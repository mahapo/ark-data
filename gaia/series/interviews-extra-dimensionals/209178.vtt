00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:32.900 align:middle line:84%
>> There are so many
benevolent civilizations around

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:41.090 align:middle line:84%
your universe that are
waiting for humanity to raise

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.830 align:middle line:84%
your vibration so that you
can begin to feel, see,

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.260 align:middle line:90%
connect with them.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:55.790 align:middle line:84%
They are waiting for humanity
to join the universe.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And many of these
star families are

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.260 align:middle line:84%
available to assist
in your awakening.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:20.460 align:middle line:90%


00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:32.520 align:middle line:84%
This home in Mount Shasta is
over part of an inner Earth

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.310 align:middle line:90%
city known as Telos.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:44.840 align:middle line:84%
The beings from Telos
appreciate this gathering,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.770 align:middle line:84%
and they are asking to bring
their energies of support

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.940 align:middle line:84%
to each and every one
of you around the world.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.060 align:middle line:90%


00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.770 align:middle line:84%
There is so much in this
vast reality for you

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.660 align:middle line:90%
all to experience.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.830 align:middle line:90%


00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.965 align:middle line:84%
Are you ready to
experience more?

00:02:16.965 --> 00:02:26.900 align:middle line:90%


00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.000 align:middle line:84%
And there are many star families
who work with the stargate.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.440 align:middle line:90%


00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.020 align:middle line:90%
They come in their light bodies.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.360 align:middle line:84%
They come because
you have asked.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.530 align:middle line:84%
Invite them closer,
feel their vibrations.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:57.360 align:middle line:90%


00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.985 align:middle line:10%
Just feel.

00:02:59.985 --> 00:03:04.320 align:middle line:84%
Feel the energy gently
changing around you.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.050 align:middle line:90%


00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.360 align:middle line:90%
And feel.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.240 align:middle line:90%
Here they come.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.560 align:middle line:84%
The energy again, gently
changing around you.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:26.050 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can feel each one is a
little different coming to you.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:34.400 align:middle line:90%


00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.860 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.765 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:03:39.765 --> 00:03:40.565 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:03:40.565 --> 00:03:47.600 align:middle line:90%


00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:54.680 align:middle line:10%
And so the angels, the
masters, the star families

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.550 align:middle line:10%
have brought the
energetics here together

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.630 align:middle line:10%
to support each
and every one of us

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.880 align:middle line:10%
wherever and whenever
you are around the world.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.430 align:middle line:90%


00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.850 align:middle line:10%
Relaxing into this
growing energy field.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.330 align:middle line:10%
Nothing to do.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.540 align:middle line:90%
Nothing to do.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.350 align:middle line:90%
Nothing to do.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:35.650 align:middle line:90%


00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Prageet.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.440 align:middle line:10%
Julieanne.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.250 align:middle line:10%
Jules.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Hey.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.820 align:middle line:90%
>> We're in Mount Shasta.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:43.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yay.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.908 align:middle line:84%
>> And you have a wonderful--
in our backdrop here, somewhere,

00:04:46.908 --> 00:04:47.950 align:middle line:90%
we'll get in there later.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.740 align:middle line:84%
But you have a
wonderful stargate

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.080 align:middle line:84%
that we got to experience
this past weekend.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'd love to get to
know you guys a little more

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.050 align:middle line:90%
and about the stargate.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.780 align:middle line:90%
And well, let's start there.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.670 align:middle line:90%
What is the stargate?

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Well the stargate is a
sacred geometrical form.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.320 align:middle line:10%
And that sacred geometry
actually holds an energy.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And so the various geometric
forms within the stargate

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.990 align:middle line:84%
allow it to be an
anchor for a higher

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.000 align:middle line:90%
dimensional consciousness.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's a little
challenging for some people

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.290 align:middle line:90%
when they hear that.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.460 align:middle line:84%
But Alcazar said it's very
similar to our physical bodies.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.310 align:middle line:84%
Our physical bodies are
an anchor for a higher

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.960 align:middle line:90%
dimensional consciousness.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:35.770 align:middle line:90%
For us.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, my show,
I think everybody--

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we get
to understand--

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.180 align:middle line:90%
we know what that means.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And so this higher dimensional,
very benevolent energetic

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.460 align:middle line:90%
is anchored in the structure.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And when we work
with the stargate,

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.360 align:middle line:84%
we're actually working
with that higher

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.160 align:middle line:90%
dimensional consciousness.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And so when we're work
with individuals or groups,

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.290 align:middle line:84%
we ask the stargate to raise
the vibration in the room.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:06.740 align:middle line:10%
And if people are connected
in via the internet,

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.250 align:middle line:10%
the energy is
experienced by them

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.560 align:middle line:10%
simultaneously
because we're actually

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.490 align:middle line:10%
working in the quantum field.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.300 align:middle line:10%
So the energetic is very
tangible all around the world.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.730 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's almost--

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.190 align:middle line:84%
you say it has its
own consciousness.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.530 align:middle line:10%
And your guide,
Alcazar, who we're

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.890 align:middle line:10%
going to bring through later, is
that a different consciousness

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:28.510 align:middle line:10%
than the actual stargate?

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:29.960 align:middle line:90%
Or how does that work?

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, is Alcazar is
actually what he describes

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.000 align:middle line:90%
as a universal master.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And he's a spokesperson for
a group of universal masters.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And their whole focus of
the Alcazar group is to assist

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.190 align:middle line:84%
in the awakening
process of humanity.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.000 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.170 align:middle line:10%
>> So Alcazar is like a master
at understanding our humanness

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:57.590 align:middle line:10%
in helping us navigate through
to higher levels of awareness.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:02.080 align:middle line:10%
>> So could the stargate be
equivalent to almost like

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.480 align:middle line:10%
an artificial intelligence,
like a conscious AI spaceship?

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.500 align:middle line:84%
In some of my other
episodes, we go into that,

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.460 align:middle line:90%
so just maybe related.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>> I wouldn't like to
say one way or the other.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.360 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.420 align:middle line:90%
Sure, sure.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:16.840 align:middle line:90%
Oh, go ahead.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.715 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, it's more
like pure consciousness.

00:07:18.715 --> 00:07:19.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And part of the function of
the stargate is to be like this

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:25.510 align:middle line:90%
cosmic tuning fork.

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.660 align:middle line:84%
The beingness of the
stargate is able to anchor

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.930 align:middle line:84%
into the structure, and
then vibrate us in a way

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:36.100 align:middle line:84%
that we're like a tuning again
to the multi-dimensional nature

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:36.910 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:40.540 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, we are just as
cosmic as the stargate is.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.970 align:middle line:84%
But we've been through
lifetime after lifetime

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:45.130 align:middle line:90%
of forgetting how to tune in.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:45.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.530 align:middle line:90%
So in a way, it's--

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:50.410 align:middle line:84%
one of the terms I like to use
is a permission slip for us

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.420 align:middle line:90%
to access this information.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.180 align:middle line:84%
Though we have it ourselves,
we can use the stargate.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Alcazar calls it a
doorway to higher dimensions.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.550 align:middle line:84%
It creates this
space, and when we're

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:02.920 align:middle line:84%
in that 12th
dimensional energetic,

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.130 align:middle line:84%
people become very
sensitive to the guides

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:07.880 align:middle line:90%
and the benevolent beings.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And so in the workshop,
we will actually

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:14.170 align:middle line:84%
invite them to come into the
meditation-- into the room.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And people can feel the energy
of the guides coming in.

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:20.320 align:middle line:90%
It's very tangible.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I was talking to a
lot of folks this weekend,

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:28.270 align:middle line:84%
and they definitely
felt the subtle nuances

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:30.770 align:middle line:84%
and the differences of the
energies that were being called

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:31.570 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:33.039 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:35.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I was busy with my camera
work and everything else,

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.980 align:middle line:84%
so I felt something, but I
couldn't tell the nuances

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.330 align:middle line:90%
obviously because I was--

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.130 align:middle line:90%
technical things going on here.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, those people that
have inner vision can actually

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.800 align:middle line:84%
see the guides
coming into the room.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
nice for everyone else

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.910 align:middle line:84%
to hear them reporting
what they've seen.

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:53.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.500 align:middle line:84%
So how did this
all start for you?

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.970 align:middle line:84%
When did you get the downloads
to build the stargate?

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:06.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, building the stargate
came about a year after Alcazar

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:07.720 align:middle line:90%
appeared in my life.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.700 align:middle line:90%
And that was a complete shock.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.660 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't something I expected.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:12.775 align:middle line:90%
I was living on Maui.

00:09:12.775 --> 00:09:16.570 align:middle line:84%
I was working with a group of
about 20 people to create--

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:20.530 align:middle line:84%
to buy a hotel and to create
a new age healing center.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And one day, we were having
a meeting in my home,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.330 align:middle line:90%
and I was really exhausted.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And my friends said, well,
why don't you just lie down

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.390 align:middle line:90%
and we'll give you a massage?

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:30.950 align:middle line:90%
Which sounded really nice.

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:32.680 align:middle line:84%
So I was lying on
the living room floor

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.835 align:middle line:90%
with many people massaging me.

00:09:34.835 --> 00:09:38.540 align:middle line:84%
I went to this is very
deep space, beautiful.

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.340 align:middle line:90%
And that was kind of timeless.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And then after a while,
somebody was talking.

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.720 align:middle line:10%
And that was a bit
of a disturbance,

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.480 align:middle line:10%
but I was enjoying the space.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.900 align:middle line:10%
But the talking got stronger
and louder, and in the end,

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:54.420 align:middle line:10%
I opened my eyes and I realized
it was me that was talking.

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:55.220 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.760 align:middle line:84%
My friends had
stopped massaging me.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:57.740 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And they were looking at me
saying, you were channeling.

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:00.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:02.540 align:middle line:90%
>> And it was like, no, no.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:03.440 align:middle line:90%
Of course not.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.970 align:middle line:90%
And they said, yes, you were.

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.140 align:middle line:90%
Do it again.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And then what
were your thoughts?

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:09.508 align:middle line:90%
What did you do?

00:10:09.508 --> 00:10:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, first of all, I didn't
accept that I was channeling.

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:14.210 align:middle line:90%
I was very skeptical back then.

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And my friends asking
me to do it again,

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.930 align:middle line:90%
and it happened again.

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:23.480 align:middle line:84%
So slowly, slowly I
started to perhaps allow

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.230 align:middle line:90%
that this is a reality.

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And I was in my room by myself,
and I said, if this is real,

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.100 align:middle line:90%
who are you?

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And I heard loud
and clear, Alcazar.

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's such a
strange name that I

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:39.260 align:middle line:84%
didn't think it was something
that my mind would make up.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:44.000 align:middle line:10%
>> So anyway, my friends were
very persistent wanting to have

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.530 align:middle line:10%
more channeling.

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And because of this
skeptical nature,

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Alcazar started to
give me demonstrations.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And first of all, he
would tell people things

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:57.750 align:middle line:84%
about their earlier life
that I knew nothing about.

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And then after that, because
I was still doubtful,

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.260 align:middle line:84%
he started giving
predictions about what

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.180 align:middle line:84%
was about to happen for
them in a day or two.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.390 align:middle line:84%
He would say this is
what's going to happen.

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And when it happens,
call Prageet.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.970 align:middle line:84%
So I started getting these
calls from my friends saying,

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:15.810 align:middle line:84%
what Alcazar predicted,
it's happened.

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:16.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>> And so slowly, I just
settled into, this is real.

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Did he give you any reference
points of where he's from

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.540 align:middle line:90%
or what--

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:30.210 align:middle line:84%
like a different dimension,
planet or anything like that?

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:31.010 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:35.000 align:middle line:84%
For a long time, when people
asked, where are you from?

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.220 align:middle line:84%
He would say, what
difference would it make?

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.880 align:middle line:84%
That's just a
question for the mind.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:39.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Tune into the energy.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.790 align:middle line:84%
If the energy feels
beneficial, great.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:46.700 align:middle line:90%
If it doesn't, wonderful.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:47.820 align:middle line:90%
Just let it go.

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:48.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:54.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And then a long time
later, he said, OK, well,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.600 align:middle line:90%
I am a spokesperson.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:00.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm for a group of
universal masters.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And the intention
of those people

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:08.780 align:middle line:84%
is to actually oversee
the evolution of humanity.

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:09.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, Wow.

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:10.460 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.350 align:middle line:84%
So he's pretty-- he's
tied into the human story,

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:14.150 align:middle line:90%
human experience.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely, yeah.

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:18.500 align:middle line:90%
>> And Jules, how about you?

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.510 align:middle line:84%
How did Alcazar
reach out to you?

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>> So my kind of metaphysical
journey began actually with

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.970 align:middle line:90%
reconnect of healing.

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I was like,
it was the first time

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.440 align:middle line:84%
I experienced multidimensional
energies and being in them.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.520 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, whoa.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to just
use these for healing,

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.480 align:middle line:90%
I want to be in these energies.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.780 align:middle line:84%
So then basically, through
just pure synchronicity,

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.850 align:middle line:84%
I happened to find
the stargate online.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And I was moving back to
my hometown after college.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:56.240 align:middle line:84%
My intention was in no
way to even really pursue

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.860 align:middle line:90%
the spiritual path.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.020 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to become
a medical doctor

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:03.020 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to do the
pure scientific training,

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:05.090 align:middle line:84%
and then blend it in
with some of the more

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:06.620 align:middle line:90%
alternative approaches.

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:10.040 align:middle line:84%
I like to say now, I'm
just super alternative.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.560 align:middle line:84%
But basically,
long story short is

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.740 align:middle line:84%
I ended up experiencing the
stargate for the first time

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.950 align:middle line:84%
at this gathering in someone's
living room in Placerville,

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:20.255 align:middle line:90%
California.

00:13:20.255 --> 00:13:22.940 align:middle line:84%
Prageet traveled the
whole world in the '90s

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.010 align:middle line:84%
and ended up settling
down about half an hour

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:26.030 align:middle line:90%
from where I was born.

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:27.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, cool.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.070 align:middle line:90%
Where was that?

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:28.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Sacramento.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:29.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Sacramento?

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:29.950 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:31.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, California.

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And so I walk into
this living room,

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.450 align:middle line:90%
the stargate's in the center.

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And I have this gush
of wind feeling.

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, OK,
something's going to happen.

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:42.500 align:middle line:84%
I still had no idea that
it would be part of my life

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.740 align:middle line:84%
until I crossed paths with
Prageet for the first time

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.930 align:middle line:90%
and I saw his face.

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And it like had this
moment out of time.

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And it felt like deja
vu, but it felt like I

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.240 align:middle line:90%
was remembering the future.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.160 align:middle line:90%
And it came with three feelings.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.080 align:middle line:84%
Like my whole life
was about to change.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.390 align:middle line:84%
I would travel all
over the world.

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And it would be the greatest
adventure I've ever been on.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And this smile popped on my
face because it felt so good.

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:12.770 align:middle line:84%
But I was like, OK,
we'll see what happens.

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:15.530 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't even experienced
the stargate at that point

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:17.310 align:middle line:90%
yet in that evening.

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:18.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:23.390 align:middle line:84%
>> And so, yeah, basically,
little by little,

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:27.770 align:middle line:84%
Alcazar started to
reveal our connection.

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And what he said was
that we've essentially

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:36.710 align:middle line:84%
done the stargate work together
on other planetary systems.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And that the
stargate is basically

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:42.752 align:middle line:84%
a tool that assists in
the awakening process.

00:14:42.752 --> 00:14:44.210 align:middle line:84%
So it comes to
planets when they're

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:46.700 align:middle line:84%
ready to hit that
acceleration point.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, which we're
at right now, right?

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:50.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Deep in it right now.

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:51.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Deep in it now.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:52.230 align:middle line:90%
There is no question.

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:53.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>> If there was a question
at the beginning of my show,

00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:00.680 align:middle line:84%
this year, 2020, has really
proven that exponential--

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:01.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:02.470 align:middle line:90%
>> --acceleration.

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>> That's exactly what
Alcazar says it is.

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.170 align:middle line:84%
It's an exponential
curve, right?

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:08.150 align:middle line:90%
And we're right here.

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.067 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, we're just at
the beginning of that--

00:15:10.067 --> 00:15:11.608 align:middle line:84%
>> The beginning of
the acceleration.

00:15:11.608 --> 00:15:12.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:14.010 align:middle line:90%
>> I feel that, for sure.

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:14.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Especially, this weekend too.

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:16.930 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:19.700 align:middle line:90%
So many confirmations of--

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:22.970 align:middle line:84%
this used to be
such a niche thing.

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And now it's like,
everybody's filling the--

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.730 align:middle line:84%
We have thousands of
people all over the world

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:30.200 align:middle line:90%
that are tuning in.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And this weekend was
kind of unique, I suppose,

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:37.980 align:middle line:84%
because you invited Aseal
to come in, and you guys are

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:38.780 align:middle line:90%
working together.

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:39.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:41.870 align:middle line:84%
This was the first
time with Aseal.

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And what we found out is that
Aseal has started publicly

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:51.360 align:middle line:90%
channeling very recently--

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Like literally two weeks ago.

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:53.990 align:middle line:90%
>> --the Elohim.

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:59.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And the Elohim council
oversee the stargate work.

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:03.500 align:middle line:84%
So it felt like they'd
brought us together

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:07.580 align:middle line:84%
with the intention of
rapidly accelerating

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:10.440 align:middle line:84%
what we're both doing,
moving it to the next level.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.970 align:middle line:84%
>> And for us, we didn't
actually even know that Aseal

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:16.670 align:middle line:84%
was channeling the Elohim until
we decided to do this workshop

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:17.720 align:middle line:84%
together and he
was like, oh, yeah.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.595 align:middle line:84%
When we do the longer
workshops, it's usually

00:16:19.595 --> 00:16:21.110 align:middle line:90%
the Elohim coming through.

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:23.400 align:middle line:90%
And we were both like, ooh.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.080 align:middle line:84%
>> So excited because that,
usually in the stargate work,

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.180 align:middle line:84%
it's rare that Alcazar will
call in the Elohim council.

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:30.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>> And when he does, it usually
means something totally new is

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:35.540 align:middle line:84%
about to come
through the stargate.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:36.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And this weekend,
we've had, I mean,

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:45.170 align:middle line:84%
from the galactic federation or
council if you want to call--

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:46.550 align:middle line:90%
there's many names for that.

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:56.180 align:middle line:84%
These galactic groups to Buddha
to Jesus and Mary Magdalene

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:57.800 align:middle line:90%
and like Lao Tzu, right?

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And even mentioned
his disciple--

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Chung Zhu.

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.350 align:middle line:90%
>> --Chung Zhu.

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:05.540 align:middle line:84%
So all of these
energies are converging.

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.040 align:middle line:84%
We have many names,
like you said.

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.119 align:middle line:90%
Ascended masters.

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:08.919 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:08.919 --> 00:17:09.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Angels.

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.750 align:middle line:90%
Galactics.

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:14.810 align:middle line:84%
So you're sort of
creating a portal for--

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:15.619 align:middle line:90%
>> All of them.

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:16.529 align:middle line:90%
>> For all it, right?

00:17:16.529 --> 00:17:17.329 align:middle line:90%
>> And more.

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:18.579 align:middle line:90%
There's the other realms, too.

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:20.810 align:middle line:90%
The dragon realm, for example.

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:21.627 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:17:21.627 --> 00:17:22.460 align:middle line:90%
>> And the unicorns.

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:23.293 align:middle line:90%
>> And the unicorns.

00:17:23.293 --> 00:17:25.110 align:middle line:84%
So they're attracted
to this as well?

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:25.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:28.670 align:middle line:90%
And the merpeople.

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:31.190 align:middle line:84%
We have a mermaid
that comes through.

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>> She's like a
stand up comedian.

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:33.230 align:middle line:90%
>> She's so funny.

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:33.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, really?

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:33.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:34.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:34.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Does she have a name?

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:35.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Symphonia.

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:36.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Symphonia.

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:37.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:38.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Does she come
through the both of you?

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:40.590 align:middle line:84%
>> No, just through
me right now.

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:41.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Well--

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:42.200 align:middle line:90%
>> You never know.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.010 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:46.160 align:middle line:84%
So one of the facets
of the stargate work

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.950 align:middle line:84%
is actually that
it connects us up

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:53.090 align:middle line:84%
to other dimensional aspects
of our higher selves.

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:55.220 align:middle line:84%
So what Alcazar
says-- and I guess

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:57.110 align:middle line:84%
many spiritual
traditions also say

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:59.810 align:middle line:84%
this-- is that our
souls have the ability

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:03.020 align:middle line:84%
to actually subdivide
into 12 aspects who

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:07.910 align:middle line:84%
can all be experiencing
a dimensional reality.

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:09.450 align:middle line:84%
So our humanness
is one of these 12.

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:13.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And so for Prageet, what
we've found is Alcazar has

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.270 align:middle line:84%
started to introduce us
to some of these aspects.

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And Symphonia is
one of his aspects.

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Symphonia?

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, this mer--

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.950 align:middle line:90%
>> The mermaid.

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:22.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Mermaid.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>> I also heard there's a
dragon aspect called Fon?

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:27.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Ran.

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Ran, sorry.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:29.060 align:middle line:90%
Ran?

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:29.450 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow.

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:30.450 align:middle line:90%
And he sounds like that?

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>> He sounds a lot more
like that actually, yeah,

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.220 align:middle line:90%
when he comes through.

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:34.520 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:35.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>> In fact, the first few times,
I got a sore throat afterwards.

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:40.010 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:41.390 align:middle line:90%
Can we bring you in later maybe?

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:42.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, maybe.

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:43.060 align:middle line:90%
>> If he wants to.

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:44.030 align:middle line:90%
>> He might show up.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:45.230 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, interesting.

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:47.870 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really fascinated
with this aspect

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:51.200 align:middle line:84%
of the dual channeling
during the workshop.

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.462 align:middle line:84%
So Alcazar would
sort of flip-flop

00:18:53.462 --> 00:18:54.420 align:middle line:90%
between the two of you.

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:59.570 align:middle line:84%
>> What does that feel like when
that's happening or can you go

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:01.070 align:middle line:90%
into that?

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:03.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, to me, it
feels very natural.

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:08.040 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like I'm listening
to the channeling as it comes

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:08.840 align:middle line:90%
through.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't really know
what's going to come next.

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:14.660 align:middle line:10%
>> And sometimes, Alcazar,
when he's talking and guiding

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:18.770 align:middle line:10%
a group, he will start a
sentence and then he'll stop.

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:20.480 align:middle line:10%
And then he'll
carry on and he'll

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:25.550 align:middle line:10%
have these moments of silence
halfway through a sentence.

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And also, he will
jump, as you said,

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:30.215 align:middle line:84%
from coming through me
to coming through Jules.

00:19:30.215 --> 00:19:31.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:35.090 align:middle line:10%
It's interesting for me because
what will happen sometime,

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:37.160 align:middle line:10%
especially as the
energy elevates,

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.620 align:middle line:10%
is I'll look across
the stargate at Prageet

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:42.290 align:middle line:10%
and it's like that
recognition happens again.

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Where it's like we
know each other.

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And so there's this amazing
energy of this family.

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:53.540 align:middle line:90%
It's an interesting feeling.

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:56.270 align:middle line:84%
But what Alcazar has said
about what we're doing

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:59.810 align:middle line:84%
is we both have this direct
connection to the being Alcazar

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:01.220 align:middle line:90%
through our higher selves.

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:04.400 align:middle line:84%
He says, it's not like this,
but you could imagine almost

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:08.070 align:middle line:90%
like we're his descendants.

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And so because of that, when
we both do the stargate work

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.630 align:middle line:84%
together, it's like the energy
comes through a triangle

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:16.830 align:middle line:90%
from Alcazar through us.

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And so we're really holding
the energy together as well as

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.523 align:middle line:90%
bouncing back and forth.

00:20:20.523 --> 00:20:22.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're really in tune
with each other in that moment

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:26.510 align:middle line:84%
to finish each other's
sentences, in a sense.

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:27.380 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, back it up
just a little bit.

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:34.610 align:middle line:84%
Jules, when did you
start channeling Alcazar?

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And was it together
or was it on your own?

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:41.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, so it was in 2012.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.960 align:middle line:84%
The moment Alcazar energy
first came through,

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:48.410 align:middle line:84%
I was actually on
Maui, coincidentally.

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:51.950 align:middle line:84%
I got this call in
Christmas Eve 2012,

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:55.820 align:middle line:84%
I was driving with my dad in
my hometown Davis, California.

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And Prageet's on the phone
and he was like, Jules,

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:00.815 align:middle line:84%
I'm on Maui, but I'm
really stressed out.

00:21:00.815 --> 00:21:02.120 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And he's like-- his best
friend, Fareed, suggested

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:07.280 align:middle line:84%
that he call someone
who can come and help

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.580 align:middle line:90%
with computer work and stuff.

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm like,
it's Christmas Eve.

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:13.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, Dad, can I go to Maui?

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:14.870 align:middle line:90%
My dad's like, yeah, sure.

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:16.010 align:middle line:90%
Go.

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:18.780 align:middle line:90%
I was like 23 at the time.

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:20.960 align:middle line:90%
And so, yeah, I mean--

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And were you in
Maui at the time?

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:23.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, he was on Maui.

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.190 align:middle line:90%
So he invited me over.

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:28.020 align:middle line:10%
And basically, that's where
the stargate was born too.

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's just like
this beautiful thing

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:33.590 align:middle line:84%
where we were just taking a
break one day from working,

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:34.520 align:middle line:90%
meditating.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, Prageet looked
over me and he was like, whoa.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:38.390 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And I was just
feeling the energy.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.200 align:middle line:90%
So I was like, I don't know.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I feel Alcazar's
energy all around me,

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:48.650 align:middle line:84%
and I've only ever
felt it from inside.

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, it
was like, ding.

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:53.675 align:middle line:84%
Like there's another
confirmation of what I saw.

00:21:53.675 --> 00:21:55.550 align:middle line:84%
I think it was back in
September when I first

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:57.020 align:middle line:90%
came to that stargate evening.

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:57.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:01.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So that was really the
beginning of the confirmations

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:04.100 align:middle line:90%
of that super conscious moment.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:05.282 align:middle line:90%
And yeah.

00:22:05.282 --> 00:22:06.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I could
feel the energy.

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And then when I recognized
it, then Alcazar

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:14.150 align:middle line:84%
started to actually come through
you and started to speak.

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:18.050 align:middle line:84%
>> So you felt the energy
first, and then you were already

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:19.868 align:middle line:90%
in the energy basking in it.

00:22:19.868 --> 00:22:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And then the voice
just came through?

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:22.160 align:middle line:90%
How did that work?

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:22.960 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the first time I
had like so-called channeled

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Alcazar, it was just the
energy coming through.

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And actually, the first time
I decided to learn to channel

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:35.150 align:middle line:90%
was because I chose to.

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:37.130 align:middle line:84%
I was like, hey,
I'm with someone who

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:38.540 align:middle line:90%
can teach me how to channel.

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:41.250 align:middle line:84%
Because Prageet does that with
people all around the world.

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:45.710 align:middle line:10%
So just happened to listen to
this like Kryon channeling.

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:47.730 align:middle line:84%
He was like, learn how
to channel for yourself.

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:48.980 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, yes.

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:51.960 align:middle line:84%
So I actually channeled my
higher self for the first time.

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:52.760 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:54.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.360 align:middle line:84%
>> In that moment or
in that day or is it--

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.500 align:middle line:90%
>> It was sometime in that trip.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:22:59.300 align:middle line:90%
>> On Maui?

00:22:59.300 --> 00:22:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:01.070 align:middle line:90%
It happened really fast.

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And has Alcazar talked about
why Maui or anything like that?

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:11.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's the remnants,
in a sense, of Lemuria.

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:12.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And Lemuria was one of those
places where consciousness

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:18.890 align:middle line:90%
first came to humanity.

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Before, we were still part of
the animal realm, in a sense.

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.690 align:middle line:84%
And the Pleiadians came,
and the interaction

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:31.700 align:middle line:84%
between the Pleiadian
women and the human male

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:35.400 align:middle line:84%
allowed for the offspring
to hold consciousness.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.100 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, wow.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:40.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And also something
Alcazar has said about Maui

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:46.250 align:middle line:84%
in particular is that that will
be the place on Earth where

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:49.343 align:middle line:90%
oneness is first experienced.

00:23:49.343 --> 00:23:50.885 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's going
to be interesting.

00:23:50.885 --> 00:23:51.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:51.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:53.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:56.210 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of these
sacred spots in Maui,

00:23:56.210 --> 00:24:01.280 align:middle line:84%
obviously, I was there
back in March actually

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.670 align:middle line:90%
right when COVID--

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:03.470 align:middle line:90%
the lockdown--

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:04.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, we were there too.

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:04.445 align:middle line:90%
>> --happened.

00:24:04.445 --> 00:24:05.170 align:middle line:90%
>> That's funny.

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:05.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.450 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:08.360 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if we called
that in somehow.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.970 align:middle line:90%


00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:17.090 align:middle line:10%
We're here in Shasta, and I
mean, I know Shasta is now.

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:20.150 align:middle line:84%
This is my first time
here this weekend.

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:23.180 align:middle line:90%
I can definitely understand why.

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:27.710 align:middle line:84%
But from your words, what
was the calling to Shasta?

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's actually an
energetic connection between

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.120 align:middle line:90%
Shasta and Maui.

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.860 align:middle line:90%
They call it the Rainbow Bridge.

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:35.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>> But one of the things that
Alcazar has said is that a long

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:43.400 align:middle line:84%
time ago, Lemuria
was a vast continent,

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:46.400 align:middle line:84%
and it slowly sank
beneath the waves.

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And he said that people
had to leave the continent.

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And they moved out in all
directions, New Zealand,

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Australia, South America
and North America.

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:01.310 align:middle line:84%
So all the indigenous
in those areas

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:04.370 align:middle line:84%
still say they come
from the Pleiades,

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:06.530 align:middle line:90%
from that Lemurian connection.

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:12.350 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things he said
was that as the continent was

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:15.170 align:middle line:84%
sinking and people
moved away, they

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:17.450 align:middle line:84%
were moving out of
that incredible bubble

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:20.360 align:middle line:84%
of high consciousness
that was created there.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And he said that some of
the masters from that time

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:27.320 align:middle line:84%
recognized that, as
people moved away,

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:31.790 align:middle line:84%
their consciousness
was going to go down.

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:35.210 align:middle line:84%
So many of them
stepped out of time

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:37.160 align:middle line:90%
and actually came to Shasta.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.680 align:middle line:84%
There's an inner
Earth city of Telos.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And they've been there holding
the wisdom and information.

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:47.160 align:middle line:10%
And they are ready to start
sharing that with humanity

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:47.960 align:middle line:10%
again.

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.510 align:middle line:10%
>> And it's actually in
another dimensional reality.

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:53.630 align:middle line:84%
So they stepped outside
of time, they also

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:55.665 align:middle line:84%
stepped outside of
this physical reality.

00:25:55.665 --> 00:25:56.465 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:56.465 --> 00:25:58.970 align:middle line:90%
What we see here.

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:00.530 align:middle line:90%
So yes, so Telos.

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:02.480 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's
something I'm planning

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:05.900 align:middle line:90%
to dive into more here.

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.180 align:middle line:84%
So how does that connect
to Maui in the sense

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:10.850 align:middle line:84%
that if we're going to
feel oneness in Maui,

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:12.800 align:middle line:84%
is it teachings
from Telos or are

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.540 align:middle line:90%
these energies coming through?

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what happens
sometimes in the workshop,

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:20.840 align:middle line:84%
if that's a particular
focus, the masters--

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:24.680 align:middle line:84%
the Lemurian masters will
actually come up into the room.

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And they will then start to
radiate to the participants

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:32.480 align:middle line:84%
some of this wisdom and
knowledge from the past.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And that is then anchored
within their energetics,

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.150 align:middle line:84%
and it becomes
available to them when

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:40.950 align:middle line:84%
it's the right time
for them individually.

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And so they've done that with
quite a lot of people now.

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Hundreds of people
in different places.

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:48.320 align:middle line:84%
>> And you feel that
stronger here in Shasta,

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:52.740 align:middle line:84%
as far as those
Lemurian energies?

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:53.760 align:middle line:90%
>> It's different.

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:54.560 align:middle line:90%
>> It's different.

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:58.550 align:middle line:84%
Every location, even when we
bring the same masters in,

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:02.180 align:middle line:84%
at the energetic of
the place, the beings

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:05.390 align:middle line:84%
respond not just
to those gathered,

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:07.220 align:middle line:90%
but to the physical reality too.

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And so they're
anchoring energies

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:11.510 align:middle line:84%
in the different
places that we work.

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:16.820 align:middle line:84%
>> There's many multidimensional
facets to this already

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:18.470 align:middle line:90%
multidimensional reality.

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:22.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, fractals upon
fractals upon fractals.

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:22.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:23.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>> With the locations, ley
lines, the energetic body,

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:28.190 align:middle line:90%
the stargates.

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:31.970 align:middle line:84%
We have all these tools
that we can tap into,

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:33.620 align:middle line:90%
it seems, almost at any time.

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:34.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.560 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a fascinating story
that I think I should share

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.360 align:middle line:90%
with you.

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.047 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, please.

00:27:40.047 --> 00:27:42.380 align:middle line:84%
>> And this happened right
at the beginning when I first

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:46.250 align:middle line:84%
started to channel
and started to--

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:49.910 align:middle line:84%
more and more people started
to come to listen to Alcazar.

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And he started to talk--
wanting to talk about Pleiadians

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:55.520 align:middle line:90%
and Arcturians.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know if
that was real back then.

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And so every time he started to
talk about extraterrestrials,

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:04.610 align:middle line:90%
as I thought of them then--

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>> --I would cut him off because
I didn't know that it was real.

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And I felt strange enough
channeling back then,

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:15.350 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't want to be
talking about things that I

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:16.290 align:middle line:90%
didn't know were real.

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:17.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>> And so he kept on
wanting to talk about them,

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:21.840 align:middle line:90%
and I kept on cutting them off.

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And it got stronger and in the
end, I said, OK, if it's real,

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:27.210 align:middle line:90%
prove it to me.

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:29.180 align:middle line:90%
And then you can talk about it.

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
well, maybe I will

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:34.860 align:middle line:84%
see a spacecraft in the
sky or something like that.

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:40.590 align:middle line:84%
But what actually happened
was way, way better than that.

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:43.850 align:middle line:84%
So one day, he told me
to go down to Cassanova,

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:46.370 align:middle line:90%
which is a coffee bar on Maui.

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And I sat there wondering
why I was there.

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And a couple came and sat
next to me, and after a while,

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.060 align:middle line:90%
we got talking.

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And then they were asking
what are you doing.

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:56.550 align:middle line:90%
And I was kind of nervous.

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I
just started channeling.

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And the woman said, well,
will you give us a session?

00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:04.040 align:middle line:90%
So I said, yeah, OK.

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:06.560 align:middle line:84%
Did a session with a husband,
and she called the next day

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.580 align:middle line:90%
saying, wow, that was amazing.

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:09.590 align:middle line:90%
He's totally different.

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:11.430 align:middle line:90%
Can I have a session?

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:12.470 align:middle line:90%
So I said, yes.

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And she said, are you
willing to do an exchange?

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:17.780 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes, of course.

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:20.450 align:middle line:84%
What is it you'd like
to offer in exchange?

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, I take
people up to the spaceships.

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:26.280 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, whoa, really?

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, yeah, yeah.

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:27.880 align:middle line:90%
>> So we went--

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>> You don't hear that
so often as an exchange.

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:31.760 align:middle line:90%
Could I get a little exchange?

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.680 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:38.220 align:middle line:84%
>> And so we went back and we
did a session with Alcazar.

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:39.960 align:middle line:90%
And she said, are you ready?

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:40.770 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes.

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:42.000 align:middle line:90%
Where do we go?

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.490 align:middle line:84%
I was ready to jump up
and run to wherever.

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
actually, we go out of body.

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:49.260 align:middle line:90%
And I said, oh.

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:50.620 align:middle line:90%
I've never done that before.

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:51.703 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how to do it.

00:29:51.703 --> 00:29:52.503 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:29:52.503 --> 00:29:53.550 align:middle line:90%
>> And she said it's, OK.

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:57.360 align:middle line:84%
You just lie down
and we will help you.

00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.670 align:middle line:84%
So I was lying on my
living room floor,

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:02.070 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know how long
it took-- several minutes.

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, I felt I was
floating above my body.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.840 align:middle line:90%
My awareness was out of my body.

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:10.710 align:middle line:84%
I could still feel
the body on the floor.

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:11.840 align:middle line:90%
And she said, good.

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:12.640 align:middle line:90%
You're out.

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.160 align:middle line:90%
Now let's go straight up.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And so there was this sensation
of moving without moving.

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:19.000 align:middle line:90%
Very strange.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And then I found myself
lying on something hard.

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And I could see, but it
was like a thick mist.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And I could see the
outline of people.

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.658 align:middle line:10%
And she said, wait a moment.

00:30:29.658 --> 00:30:31.200 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
work on your energy.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, I
could see very clearly.

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And I was in a very small, round
amphitheater with three or four

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:40.800 align:middle line:90%
kind of levels.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And there was probably 12
or 16 people in the room,

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:47.962 align:middle line:90%
and they started applauding.

00:30:47.962 --> 00:30:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And she said, do you know
why they're clapping?

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.810 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I got no idea.

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And she said,
usually you come here

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:56.940 align:middle line:90%
at night in your sleep state.

00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:59.250 align:middle line:84%
This is the first time
you've come consciously,

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:00.690 align:middle line:84%
and so they're
acknowledging that.

00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:01.490 align:middle line:90%
>> That's cool.

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was
like, oh, really?

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:04.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:05.010 align:middle line:90%
A little embarrassed--

00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:05.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.250 align:middle line:90%
>> --for not knowing.

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:07.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, right.

00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I've been on
this stage before?

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.010 align:middle line:90%
What was I wearing?

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:14.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And so then the
people left the room,

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:17.170 align:middle line:84%
and there was just one
guy standing by the door.

00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And she said, do
you recognize him?

00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:20.500 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at him.

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:21.300 align:middle line:90%
Wow, yeah.

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:23.100 align:middle line:90%
He's so familiar.

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:26.370 align:middle line:84%
But I don't remember
where I know him from.

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And she said, this is
you in this dimension.

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And that was too
much for my mind.

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:34.560 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I didn't know
what to do with that.

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:35.680 align:middle line:90%
That just felt too weird.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:36.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:37.280 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And she said, well, now we're
going to leave this small craft

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:42.210 align:middle line:84%
that we're on and we're going
to go to the mothership.

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:43.620 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:45.720 align:middle line:84%
So we walked out of
the door and we were

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:48.000 align:middle line:90%
walking along the corridor.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.880 align:middle line:84%
She was behind talking
and asking questions,

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.320 align:middle line:90%
and he was on my left.

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And after a few paces,
suddenly, we kind of merged.

00:31:56.940 --> 00:32:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And I was hearing myself
answering her questions

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.640 align:middle line:90%
about the ship.

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
strangest sensation.

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:08.070 align:middle line:90%
It was like we became one.

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And I was still in
that amazing space,

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.770 align:middle line:84%
and we walked to the
end of the corridor

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:17.310 align:middle line:84%
and there was like a
rectangular doorway.

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:18.810 align:middle line:90%
But there wasn't a door in it.

00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:21.720 align:middle line:84%
It was like lots of
little dots-- tiny dots

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:24.840 align:middle line:84%
of different white, green
and blue kind of lights.

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And they were moving
down very slowly a bit

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:28.920 align:middle line:90%
like a slow waterfall.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And we stepped into it and we
stepped out on the mothership.

00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:35.100 align:middle line:90%
Now how that works, I have idea.

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:36.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:38.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, maybe I
do, but I don't.

00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:38.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:40.200 align:middle line:90%
>> My humanness doesn't know.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And so we walked into the
bridge or the control room,

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.080 align:middle line:90%
and it was huge.

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And along a lot
of the wall, there

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:52.980 align:middle line:84%
was this what I thought at the
time was like a window looking

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:53.950 align:middle line:90%
out into space.

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:55.770 align:middle line:84%
But I think now
with the technology

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:58.050 align:middle line:84%
that we're aware of,
is more like a screen.

00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:02.490 align:middle line:84%
But I could look out into
space and we were very high up.

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And this craft could
look down on it.

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:09.870 align:middle line:84%
But it seemed to stretch for
miles in both directions.

00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:11.800 align:middle line:90%
It was huge.

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And so this lady was
asking me questions

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.140 align:middle line:90%
and I'm explaining about it.

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:18.363 align:middle line:84%
And she said, what's
this console for?

00:33:18.363 --> 00:33:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, that's
just for moving about

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:21.780 align:middle line:90%
in local space.

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, I was
just being surprised

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:26.080 align:middle line:90%
at what I was hearing.

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:29.070 align:middle line:84%
So this lasted for I
have no idea how long.

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And then at some point, she
said, OK, it's time to go back.

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And then this sensation
and boom, back in the body.

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:37.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:40.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And then I said, OK, Alcazar,
you can talk about anything

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:41.050 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:44.850 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>> You talk about
Pleiades after that?

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>> The Pleiadians, the
Arcturians, the Hathors,

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:52.230 align:middle line:84%
all of the Syrians, they all
come through in different

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:55.470 align:middle line:84%
times, depending on the
focus of the workshop.

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And sometimes, we get a
visit from the commander,

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:03.040 align:middle line:84%
who's actually that aspect
of Prageet who he met.

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:04.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:05.670 align:middle line:84%
>> And is he called
the commander?

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>> He calls himself
the commander.

00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:07.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:08.219 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:34:08.219 --> 00:34:09.150 align:middle line:84%
So he's like a
Pleiadian commander?

00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:10.500 align:middle line:90%
>> And he comes through--

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:11.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Galactic command.

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:11.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Galactic commander.

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:13.172 align:middle line:90%
>> Not necessarily Pleiadian.

00:34:13.172 --> 00:34:15.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I guess there's different
races hanging up on this--

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:16.920 align:middle line:90%
hanging on the same ship?

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:19.679 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, they're from all
the different benevolent

00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:22.530 align:middle line:84%
civilizations all
working together.

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:25.199 align:middle line:84%
And they say they have
thousands of craft

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:28.679 align:middle line:84%
in and around our solar
system, and in and around

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:30.360 align:middle line:90%
our atmosphere.

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:34.190 align:middle line:84%
Invisible most of the time,
unless they want to be seen.

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And he said more
and more, people

00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:38.540 align:middle line:90%
will be seeing the craft.

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:41.810 align:middle line:84%
It's a gentle
introduction to humanity.

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:43.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Have you had any more on-ship
experiences after that?

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:48.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Probably.

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:49.174 align:middle line:90%
>> Only in his sleep state.

00:34:49.174 --> 00:34:49.429 align:middle line:90%
>> At night.

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:50.637 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, at night on the stage.

00:34:50.637 --> 00:34:52.699 align:middle line:84%
>> But consciously,
unfortunately, not.

00:34:52.699 --> 00:34:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:54.739 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:34:54.739 --> 00:34:55.580 align:middle line:90%
>> I would welcome--

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:56.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready.

00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:58.130 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:58.130 --> 00:34:59.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Very cool.

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:00.585 align:middle line:90%
All right, awesome.

00:35:00.585 --> 00:35:02.210 align:middle line:84%
How about, Jules,
have you had any kind

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:04.340 align:middle line:84%
of galactic
interactions like that?

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>> It's kind of interesting
because that very first

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:12.140 align:middle line:84%
stargate evening I went
through in the living room,

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:14.130 align:middle line:90%
Prageet told this story.

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:17.960 align:middle line:90%
And I was just like, awesome.

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.130 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was so cool.

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And I was driving home
and suddenly-- this

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:27.440 align:middle line:84%
is the only time so far that
this has happened to me.

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:32.030 align:middle line:84%
But it was like this
bleed through of a memory

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:35.870 align:middle line:90%
of my aspect.

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And what it was is Alcazar calls
this aspect the lone pilot.

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:43.310 align:middle line:84%
So my higher self aspect
on the galactic command

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:46.910 align:middle line:84%
is like a man who is
alone most of the time.

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And then the memory, it's like
everyone being called back to,

00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:55.040 align:middle line:84%
I guess, the mothership for
one of their big meetings.

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And it was like my
consciousness was hovering

00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:00.410 align:middle line:84%
as like a ball or
a sphere and just

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:03.380 align:middle line:84%
like floating
alongside my aspect.

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And everything that he
was thinking, feeling I

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.040 align:middle line:90%
could think--

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:11.000 align:middle line:84%
I could like permeate completely
into his consciousness.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.790 align:middle line:84%
And it was just like him
walking down a hallway

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:15.230 align:middle line:90%
and taking his spot.

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And what was kind of like
stadium in the round,

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:22.070 align:middle line:84%
and in the center is
where the hollow--

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:25.040 align:middle line:84%
where the basically commander
and like a few others

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:27.320 align:middle line:90%
are on stage.

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.460 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:29.930 align:middle line:90%
That was the memory.

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:33.170 align:middle line:84%
But I just find
it so interesting

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:38.030 align:middle line:84%
that happened for me after
my first stargate experience,

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:40.280 align:middle line:84%
and nothing like that
has happened since.

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Because it came with
the strangest feeling

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:48.650 align:middle line:84%
of like remembering
something that came with--

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:50.990 align:middle line:84%
it's not like how I would
suddenly be like, oh,

00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:51.990 align:middle line:90%
I remember this.

00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:55.140 align:middle line:84%
It was like I've always
remembered this is how it felt.

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:56.180 align:middle line:90%
It was really cool.

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:56.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:57.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:01.130 align:middle line:84%
So this weekend is
my first experience

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:04.700 align:middle line:84%
with the stargate and
seeing you guys channel.

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:07.700 align:middle line:84%
It seemed to be you guys got
in it got into the channeling

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:09.210 align:middle line:90%
experience pretty quick.

00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:12.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm just wondering, is
there a prep work involved

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:14.450 align:middle line:90%
for a weekend like that?

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And what's your process for
each of you individually?

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:21.890 align:middle line:84%
Is it is it similar
or how do you

00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:24.770 align:middle line:90%
bring through the channeling?

00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:29.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's interesting
because we don't really have

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:30.530 align:middle line:90%
to prepare anything.

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:31.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:35.630 align:middle line:84%
>> The way it works, because
the guys respond to everyone

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:37.790 align:middle line:90%
who's there present in the room.

00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:38.900 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:43.190 align:middle line:84%
>> So we'll decide when
we want to do a workshop.

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:45.500 align:middle line:90%
And very often, that's guided.

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:46.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So we decide when and where
we're going to do a workshop.

00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, we will
sit down and say, OK, we'd

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:55.790 align:middle line:84%
like this element
and this element.

00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And then Alcazar
will come in and he

00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:02.880 align:middle line:84%
will do a channeling about the
workshop and what's expected.

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And then we use that just
to send out to our audience

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:10.430 align:middle line:84%
and say, this is what
we expect is happening,

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:12.470 align:middle line:84%
and you can sign
up on our website

00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:14.690 align:middle line:84%
if you wish to
join the workshop.

00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's generally
the way it happens.

00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:18.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:20.420 align:middle line:90%
>> In terms of the actual--

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:23.690 align:middle line:84%
the day of the event
right, very rarely--

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Most of the prep
work is very 3D with us,

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:28.308 align:middle line:84%
like setting up
all of the things.

00:38:28.308 --> 00:38:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>> It's like me with my camera.

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:30.510 align:middle line:90%
>> All the things, right.

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:31.718 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, the technical stuff.

00:38:31.718 --> 00:38:33.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I mean, it's beautiful.

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:36.770 align:middle line:84%
We get to just show up
and really the energy

00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:38.600 align:middle line:90%
builds throughout the workshop.

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:43.970 align:middle line:84%
So for me, personally, like
the most beautiful wild card

00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:47.000 align:middle line:84%
element is sometimes
suddenly it's

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.280 align:middle line:84%
like these higher states of
consciousness just blossom

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:53.597 align:middle line:90%
and it feels amazing.

00:38:53.597 --> 00:38:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And then they kind of
just like trickle away

00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:57.890 align:middle line:84%
and I'm more like
my humanness again.

00:38:57.890 --> 00:38:59.300 align:middle line:90%
But, yeah.

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's interesting
because recently,

00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:05.090 align:middle line:84%
because of the lockdown and so
on, we've been doing a lot more

00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:06.620 align:middle line:90%
online.

00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And for many years, I
spent between three and six

00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:12.860 align:middle line:84%
months of a year traveling
around different countries

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:17.180 align:middle line:84%
doing workshops, some of which
were very small, 20 people.

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And some of them were
much larger with 1,200.

00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And now in one of
the workshops we

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:26.190 align:middle line:84%
did recently, we had
over 20,000 people.

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:26.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it's online and you
can access people all around

00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:32.240 align:middle line:90%
the world.

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I had a couple of
testimonies mentioned that they

00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:37.160 align:middle line:90%
would--

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:40.640 align:middle line:84%
just the recordings, they would
be able to tap into that energy

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:41.900 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, again, that's
the amazing thing.

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:46.820 align:middle line:84%
Because it's working
in the quantum field,

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:51.230 align:middle line:84%
which is actually a difficult
concept for most people

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:52.770 align:middle line:90%
to grasp immediately--

00:39:52.770 --> 00:39:53.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>> But in the quantum field,
there's no time and there's no

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.720 align:middle line:90%
space, no place.

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And so when we do the
work, even the recordings--

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:11.390 align:middle line:84%
the recordings are of our
voice and music and the images,

00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:16.640 align:middle line:84%
but the energy is a response
to the person meditating

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:18.320 align:middle line:90%
with the recording.

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:23.310 align:middle line:84%
So even if they're not present
and they listen a day, a week

00:40:23.310 --> 00:40:27.110 align:middle line:84%
or a year later, they're
tapping into the energetic

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:28.800 align:middle line:90%
of that moment.

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:32.270 align:middle line:84%
So Alcazar talks about
this moment of now

00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:33.980 align:middle line:90%
when it's happening.

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And you can-- the
fascinating thing

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:41.330 align:middle line:84%
is, you can repeat the same
meditation again and again.

00:40:41.330 --> 00:40:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And each time, the
energy experience

00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:46.490 align:middle line:84%
will be different
because you're different.

00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And the guides are responding
to you when you're meditating.

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And so we always suggest
that people meditate, not

00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:56.390 align:middle line:90%
just listen to the meditation.

00:40:56.390 --> 00:41:00.170 align:middle line:84%
To actually sit and
meditate or lie down.

00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:02.780 align:middle line:84%
>> What are some of
the most impactful or--

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:05.720 align:middle line:90%


00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:08.600 align:middle line:84%
for yourself and also for
others, but maybe for yourself,

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:11.420 align:middle line:84%
how have these teachings--
and which teachings

00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:14.630 align:middle line:90%
and how have they impacted you?

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:18.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm not sure if I can
really identify any particular

00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:20.600 align:middle line:90%
one as being more powerful.

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:23.990 align:middle line:84%
But I think the inner
child work that Alcazar

00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:29.330 align:middle line:84%
does has touched the lives
of thousands of people.

00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:33.290 align:middle line:84%
Inner child work has been
around in the new age

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:34.820 align:middle line:90%
community for a long time.

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:38.090 align:middle line:84%
But this is very different
because again, we're

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:39.950 align:middle line:90%
working in the quantum field.

00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And so people have an
experience of them,

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:47.780 align:middle line:84%
the adult, being in
the same place as them,

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:50.360 align:middle line:84%
the child, that was
having a difficulty.

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And the adult can
talk to the child

00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:57.470 align:middle line:84%
and resolve the issues with
the child in the quantum field.

00:41:57.470 --> 00:42:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And when the child
releases it, that issue

00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:04.250 align:middle line:84%
is dissolved from
the adult's life.

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:08.550 align:middle line:84%
>> It's sort of like I would
go back and visit my childhood,

00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:09.350 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:10.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:12.770 align:middle line:90%
>> In the child version of me.

00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:13.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And then heal those things,
and then that would make

00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:17.570 align:middle line:90%
the difference now.

00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:19.640 align:middle line:84%
>> It would make a difference
in your adult life.

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:20.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's something-- we've
just done an online series

00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:27.380 align:middle line:90%
for 30 days.

00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And one of the aspects that we
worked with during that 30 days

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:33.200 align:middle line:90%
was the inner child.

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.048 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually
a free program

00:42:35.048 --> 00:42:36.590 align:middle line:84%
that people would
still connect into.

00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:37.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, great.

00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And the response that people
have had through that inner

00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:44.480 align:middle line:90%
child work has been amazing.

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:48.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you mentioned if time
is an illusion in this quantum

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:51.050 align:middle line:84%
field that we can go
into, it just makes sense.

00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:55.910 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we can go back in
time and in our meditations,

00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:58.910 align:middle line:84%
in our minds and do
the sealing work.

00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:00.350 align:middle line:90%
So totally.

00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, the beautiful
thing about that is the moment

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:04.310 align:middle line:90%
of transformation.

00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:05.852 align:middle line:84%
Because you can feel
where the person

00:43:05.852 --> 00:43:09.710 align:middle line:84%
goes from holding on not knowing
how to resolve something,

00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:13.700 align:middle line:84%
and then it just gently
starts to turn into just

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:15.260 align:middle line:90%
love and understanding.

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:17.810 align:middle line:90%


00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:21.140 align:middle line:84%
Working one on one with
people, that's my favorite

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:22.970 align:middle line:84%
is those moments
of transformation

00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:26.750 align:middle line:84%
where it's like, pow,
everything opens.

00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:29.390 align:middle line:90%
>> And have you--

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:32.570 align:middle line:84%
obviously, you've had to
integrate these teachings,

00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:35.600 align:middle line:84%
this work to get to
this level to even like

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:37.220 align:middle line:90%
bring through this energy.

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:42.500 align:middle line:84%
What are some-- can you give us
some examples of how maybe some

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:44.570 align:middle line:84%
working with your inner
child that you've--

00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:45.575 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:43:45.575 --> 00:43:49.730 align:middle line:84%
So for me, personally,
one of the amazing things

00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:51.920 align:middle line:84%
about working with
the stargate is how it

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:54.710 align:middle line:90%
gently, gently transports you.

00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:56.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's like it's going
to activate whatever

00:43:56.750 --> 00:44:00.200 align:middle line:90%
super powers or underlying.

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And it may be some
people are feelers.

00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:04.880 align:middle line:84%
So it's just going to let them
feel in this amplified way.

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:07.610 align:middle line:84%
It's going to let
them access states.

00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:10.530 align:middle line:84%
Or if they're visuals,
they're going to see a lot.

00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:15.230 align:middle line:84%
But for me, personally, it was
very specific in our child work

00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:17.390 align:middle line:84%
healing some things
that happened to me

00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:18.890 align:middle line:90%
when I was like three or four.

00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:23.000 align:middle line:84%
But through the process of this,
Alcazar actually connected me

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.860 align:middle line:84%
in to an energetic that he
calls the essence of life, which

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:32.150 align:middle line:84%
is like this super high
vibrational, really

00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:35.075 align:middle line:90%
beautiful energy that--

00:44:35.075 --> 00:44:37.488 align:middle line:90%


00:44:37.488 --> 00:44:39.530 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't going to go into
this, but it's actually

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:41.690 align:middle line:84%
like the flipside
of sexual energy.

00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:46.580 align:middle line:84%
So it's like healing some
really traumatic stuff ended up

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:49.790 align:middle line:90%
being the greatest gift ever.

00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:52.820 align:middle line:84%
Because it's like this
energy is pristine,

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:55.850 align:middle line:84%
it can be used to heal
literally physical stuff,

00:44:55.850 --> 00:44:58.550 align:middle line:90%
as well as emotional, mental.

00:44:58.550 --> 00:45:01.250 align:middle line:84%
It's like a cloud that
starts to surround something

00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:03.680 align:middle line:84%
and then gently, gently
like tease it apart

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:09.560 align:middle line:84%
until it's just all turns
back into essence energy.

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:11.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Meaning the
sexual energy, right?

00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:14.480 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not sexual energy.

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:18.770 align:middle line:84%
It's like this higher
vibrational aspect of it.

00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Sexual energy is really
a creative, energetic.

00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:26.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, it makes sense why the
essence of life would be this

00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:28.880 align:middle line:10%
flip side of it if you think
about how life actually comes

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:30.320 align:middle line:10%
to the planet.

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:31.490 align:middle line:90%
>> It's all sexual, right?

00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:32.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:45:32.330 --> 00:45:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>> We have to do certain acts
in order to bring life into this

00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:37.220 align:middle line:90%
world, right.

00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:38.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Life.

00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:38.990 align:middle line:90%
Voila.

00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:44.480 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it's like recognizing
that just by bringing gratitude

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:48.290 align:middle line:84%
and appreciation, it can kick
it into that higher vibration.

00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, it's the
most potent healing force.

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's just with
your intentions,

00:45:54.830 --> 00:45:56.690 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing like
tantric about it.

00:45:56.690 --> 00:46:02.180 align:middle line:84%
But for me, that was just one
of the most amazing things.

00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And now I teach women
around the world

00:46:03.830 --> 00:46:06.180 align:middle line:84%
how to access that
for themselves.

00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:08.382 align:middle line:90%
So that's one example.

00:46:08.382 --> 00:46:09.590 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean, you say intention.

00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:11.855 align:middle line:90%
I think there's a lot of--

00:46:11.855 --> 00:46:14.970 align:middle line:90%


00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:21.420 align:middle line:84%
there seems to be a new
emergence of attention

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:25.860 align:middle line:84%
to the intention of that
energy, which maybe we

00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:27.990 align:middle line:90%
haven't paid much attention to.

00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:32.280 align:middle line:84%
Or we've sort of
demonized or we've

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:35.737 align:middle line:84%
put into, oh, don't go
there kind of category.

00:46:35.737 --> 00:46:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And I know you said it wasn't
your intention to go there

00:46:38.070 --> 00:46:40.170 align:middle line:90%
here, but we're--

00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:42.060 align:middle line:84%
it's becoming less
of a taboo now.

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:46.780 align:middle line:84%
But it has been classified in
this, oh, we don't go there.

00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:47.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And there's something so
remarkable about this energy

00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:53.620 align:middle line:84%
that's been called dirty
or something like that.

00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:54.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:58.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And suddenly, you
realize that actually,

00:46:58.470 --> 00:47:01.770 align:middle line:84%
when you kick it into
this higher vibration,

00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:04.440 align:middle line:90%
it's like diamond light.

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:07.980 align:middle line:84%
It's so pristine and
it's so beautiful.

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's like it's
got nothing to do

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:12.000 align:middle line:90%
with any of that denigration.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.920 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it's
pretty fascinating.

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:19.260 align:middle line:84%
I think we're awakening
to all that dirty energy

00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:21.570 align:middle line:84%
in a sense that's been
projected on that.

00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:23.460 align:middle line:90%
And now we're cleaning that up.

00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:26.410 align:middle line:84%
So having these
conversations is part of it.

00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:27.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:29.460 align:middle line:84%
I think there's
various religions

00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:31.950 align:middle line:84%
around the world have
to take responsibility

00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:33.960 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of that.

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:36.630 align:middle line:90%
It's very much about control.

00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
there's many, many people

00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:43.560 align:middle line:84%
have experienced sexual
and physical abuse,

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:48.990 align:middle line:84%
which again, generally,
they're afraid to look at.

00:47:48.990 --> 00:47:52.860 align:middle line:84%
But what we've found is
it's so easy and so simple

00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:55.230 align:middle line:84%
to let it go working
with the techniques

00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:59.280 align:middle line:90%
that Alcazar's bringing through.

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>> On the drive
over here, Steve--

00:48:02.970 --> 00:48:04.920 align:middle line:90%
can I say this, Steve?

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:06.900 align:middle line:84%
We won't name
names, but Steve has

00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:11.250 align:middle line:84%
a friend who is sort of going
through that healing work

00:48:11.250 --> 00:48:17.310 align:middle line:84%
and some Catholic
Church passed issues

00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:21.360 align:middle line:84%
with taking advantage
of her when she

00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:24.390 align:middle line:90%
was younger, some sexual abuse.

00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And there seems to be the
coming to the awareness of it.

00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:36.540 align:middle line:84%
But there's also a falling
into victimhood of it.

00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:39.630 align:middle line:84%
Like you said, it's easy to
transmute, but a lot of people

00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:41.010 align:middle line:90%
are now--

00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:43.920 align:middle line:84%
because we're creating
the space to talk about it

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:47.010 align:middle line:84%
and it's OK to talk about
it, and now it's hyper focus.

00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And we have the #MeToo movement,
which has been started off

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:55.710 align:middle line:90%
being great, and then it's--

00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:57.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and there's
still many great things.

00:48:57.780 --> 00:48:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Having the conversation
is the number

00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:01.090 align:middle line:90%
one most important thing.

00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:05.430 align:middle line:84%
But then there's this
almost staying there.

00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:07.115 align:middle line:90%
There's like, what's next?

00:49:07.115 --> 00:49:08.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, the thing
is, it's like,

00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:12.390 align:middle line:10%
when you're talking about that
kind of like deep inner work,

00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:14.160 align:middle line:10%
you want to get
to the other side.

00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:14.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:14.700 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>> You don't want to stay in
the muckety muck where it feels

00:49:17.310 --> 00:49:18.110 align:middle line:90%
awful.

00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:21.210 align:middle line:84%
It's like you want to bring
the love and the understanding,

00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:23.910 align:middle line:84%
which together,
create compassion

00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:26.190 align:middle line:90%
to actually transmute.

00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And then once you've transmuted
it, it actually becomes wisdom.

00:49:30.570 --> 00:49:35.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And the thing is some of the
old ways of dealing with abuse

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:38.610 align:middle line:84%
are about reliving the
experience again and again.

00:49:38.610 --> 00:49:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's a no, no as
far as we're concerned.

00:49:41.210 --> 00:49:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:46.560 align:middle line:84%
>> We can dissolve those
influences and that pain

00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:50.400 align:middle line:84%
and shame and all the various
things that are connected to it

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:52.530 align:middle line:90%
in a very beautiful loving way.

00:49:52.530 --> 00:49:56.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what happens is you
can actually touch the moment.

00:49:56.550 --> 00:49:59.100 align:middle line:84%
But when you do it
from a place where

00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:01.260 align:middle line:84%
you're immersed in
the quantum field

00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:05.190 align:middle line:84%
and you have this beauty of
the guides and the energies

00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:07.690 align:middle line:84%
all around you, it's like you're
going to touch that moment.

00:50:07.690 --> 00:50:10.215 align:middle line:84%
And just by touching
it, it's never

00:50:10.215 --> 00:50:11.340 align:middle line:90%
going to be the same again.

00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:11.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:50:11.970 --> 00:50:13.553 align:middle line:84%
You're connected to
your support team.

00:50:13.553 --> 00:50:14.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:50:14.490 --> 00:50:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're infusing
the love and the wisdom.

00:50:17.850 --> 00:50:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a level of
understanding of, oh, this

00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:24.570 align:middle line:84%
was something which
from a higher level

00:50:24.570 --> 00:50:27.670 align:middle line:84%
I actually created
in my experience.

00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I take partial
responsibility for that,

00:50:31.290 --> 00:50:33.150 align:middle line:90%
having attracted into my life.

00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And now I let go of all the
guilt and shame and so on.

00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And it actually
raises the vibration

00:50:41.310 --> 00:50:44.490 align:middle line:84%
of that person on
a permanent level.

00:50:44.490 --> 00:50:46.500 align:middle line:90%
>> It's kind of--

00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:51.150 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these people, we
want to let them know that now

00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:52.140 align:middle line:90%
that we have the--

00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:53.565 align:middle line:84%
you've had this
experience and you

00:50:53.565 --> 00:50:55.630 align:middle line:84%
know you'll never going to go
into that experience again,

00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:57.030 align:middle line:84%
and we now are
teaching everybody

00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:58.710 align:middle line:90%
not to let that happen again.

00:50:58.710 --> 00:51:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Where before it was just
because of the secrecy,

00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:03.030 align:middle line:84%
because of the
shame and the guilt,

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:06.910 align:middle line:84%
that stuff was sort
of allowed to happen.

00:51:06.910 --> 00:51:07.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:09.760 align:middle line:84%
>> But the more we
have the conversations,

00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:14.390 align:middle line:84%
the more we talk about it,
the more we accept the beauty

00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:19.100 align:middle line:84%
of that sexual energy, it can't
hide in the shadows anymore.

00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:20.270 align:middle line:90%
>> For sure.

00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is a huge part
of how we're evolving.

00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:26.120 align:middle line:84%
Because the
ascension of humanity

00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:30.290 align:middle line:84%
isn't to deny
anything that happened

00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:32.510 align:middle line:84%
or anything that's
so-called dark or low

00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:35.720 align:middle line:84%
vibrational and just like
pretend it's not there.

00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:37.370 align:middle line:90%
Because that creates a fracture.

00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:40.490 align:middle line:84%
It's like it's infusing
all the beauty, the light

00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:44.210 align:middle line:84%
into the totality
of our experiences

00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:48.057 align:middle line:84%
so that then we grow as
an entire individual.

00:51:48.057 --> 00:51:48.890 align:middle line:90%
>> And a collective.

00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:52.355 align:middle line:84%
Because if we're all growing
individually like that,

00:51:52.355 --> 00:51:54.710 align:middle line:84%
then just all of
society gets uplifted

00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:56.940 align:middle line:90%
and we can move together.

00:51:56.940 --> 00:52:00.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's one of the aspects
of the study work is as you

00:52:00.890 --> 00:52:04.250 align:middle line:84%
experience, we create a
very, very strong energetic.

00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:07.550 align:middle line:84%
But there's hundreds
if not thousands

00:52:07.550 --> 00:52:10.790 align:middle line:84%
of stargates around the world
now-- physical structures

00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:13.430 align:middle line:84%
from small ones to
very large ones.

00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And they all connect
energetically.

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And so the very high
frequency, the very powerful

00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:23.660 align:middle line:84%
energies that we create
when a group gathers,

00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:28.520 align:middle line:84%
those energies are
radiated around the planet.

00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And they actually touch the
morphic field of humanity.

00:52:32.730 --> 00:52:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And so those energies are
going into the morphic field.

00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And I had one experience once
which touched me so deeply.

00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And it was a meditation,
Alcazar was guiding it.

00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And we were, as a group,
consciously sending

00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:51.560 align:middle line:84%
this loving energy
out around the planet.

00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And then I got this inner vision
of this beautiful young woman,

00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:02.360 align:middle line:84%
maybe early 20s, in India
wearing a beautiful sari.

00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:07.800 align:middle line:10%
And she felt this energy
and her face just lit up.

00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:12.720 align:middle line:84%
She went down on her
knees and went like that.

00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And it just touched me
so deeply seeing that.

00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:20.720 align:middle line:84%
Alcazar was just giving
me a demonstration

00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:24.860 align:middle line:84%
that this energy was being
felt by so many people.

00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:26.660 align:middle line:90%
And we've done different things.

00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:30.060 align:middle line:84%
We sent energies to the
new children, for example.

00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:35.060 align:middle line:84%
That also was very powerful
because what happened,

00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:36.600 align:middle line:90%
I think, we-- where were we?

00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:37.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Bulgaria.

00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:38.840 align:middle line:90%
>> In Bulgaria at the time.

00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And we did this very
strong meditation

00:53:42.110 --> 00:53:45.320 align:middle line:84%
and we built up a strong
energy field in the stargate.

00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And then we consciously sent
it out to the new children.

00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:53.660 align:middle line:84%
Because Alcazar was saying,
it's very hard for these higher

00:53:53.660 --> 00:53:56.150 align:middle line:84%
dimensional-- higher
consciousness rather--

00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:59.540 align:middle line:84%
consciousness children
coming into the heaviness

00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:01.010 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

00:54:01.010 --> 00:54:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And so we sent this energy
out and it felt really great.

00:54:05.210 --> 00:54:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And then after maybe
two or three minutes,

00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:13.070 align:middle line:84%
suddenly, there was this
influx of loving energy

00:54:13.070 --> 00:54:15.930 align:middle line:84%
into the group,
and we all felt it.

00:54:15.930 --> 00:54:18.020 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, what was that?

00:54:18.020 --> 00:54:21.260 align:middle line:10%
And Alcazar said, there were--

00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:22.820 align:middle line:10%
I can't remember
how many he said.

00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Like 100.

00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:28.070 align:middle line:84%
>> 100 of these children around
the world who had felt that

00:54:28.070 --> 00:54:33.500 align:middle line:84%
energy and had connected
together and sent this loving

00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:34.620 align:middle line:90%
energy back to us.

00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:35.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And that just opened up a
whole new perspective on where

00:54:40.730 --> 00:54:45.800 align:middle line:84%
these children were and these
youngsters were connecting with

00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:47.180 align:middle line:90%
each other.

00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And then appreciating what we'd
done, and that was amazing.

00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>> So Prageet, where
are you originally from?

00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:56.940 align:middle line:90%
>> I was born in England.

00:54:56.940 --> 00:54:57.740 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:54:57.740 --> 00:55:05.070 align:middle line:84%
>> And I was kind of a very
repressed Englishman way back

00:55:05.070 --> 00:55:05.870 align:middle line:90%
then.

00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately, I
connected in my early 20s.

00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:13.850 align:middle line:90%
I was a teacher at the time.

00:55:13.850 --> 00:55:17.930 align:middle line:84%
I connected with what was
happening in India with Osho.

00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And I was so touched
by what I'd heard,

00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:23.100 align:middle line:84%
I actually went and lived
there for five years.

00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>> In India?

00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:25.250 align:middle line:90%
>> In India, in Puna.

00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And really, that's
what opened me up.

00:55:28.610 --> 00:55:29.750 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:33.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I did a lot of work and a lot
of groups and so on back then.

00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And that enabled me to reach
this place of being open enough

00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:42.200 align:middle line:84%
to actually bring
through Alcazar when

00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:43.790 align:middle line:90%
it was the right time.

00:55:43.790 --> 00:55:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And one of the interesting
things that happened

00:55:46.790 --> 00:55:51.980 align:middle line:84%
was in the first few
months of channeling,

00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:54.950 align:middle line:84%
people would come for
personal sessions.

00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And one day, one
woman came and I

00:55:57.980 --> 00:56:00.410 align:middle line:84%
don't know how she
found out about me

00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:02.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't know who she
was, but she just came.

00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I did this
session with her.

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And maybe halfway
through the session,

00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:09.500 align:middle line:90%
she said, who's the Indian guy?

00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:11.120 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what do you mean?

00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:15.070 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, there's an
Indian guy standing behind you.

00:56:15.070 --> 00:56:16.460 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:17.570 align:middle line:90%
What does he look like?

00:56:17.570 --> 00:56:19.280 align:middle line:90%
And she described Osho.

00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:21.770 align:middle line:84%
She said, he's short
and he's wearing

00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:27.450 align:middle line:84%
this magnificent robe and a
beautiful hat on his head.

00:56:27.450 --> 00:56:28.910 align:middle line:90%
And I said, wow.

00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:30.530 align:middle line:90%
That's Osho.

00:56:30.530 --> 00:56:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, he
has a message for you.

00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:34.460 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:35.670 align:middle line:90%
What's that?

00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And she said, he's asking
you to continue his work.

00:56:41.210 --> 00:56:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And immediately, I
said, I can't do that.

00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:47.240 align:middle line:90%
I can't take that on.

00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:50.430 align:middle line:10%
And it was my ego.

00:56:50.430 --> 00:56:54.230 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to be proclaiming
I'm doing Osho's work.

00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:55.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:56:55.310 --> 00:56:58.820 align:middle line:84%
>> But now, looking
back on it, yes, I am.

00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And thousands of
others of people

00:57:01.310 --> 00:57:04.785 align:middle line:84%
were with him at the time
are also, in their own way--

00:57:04.785 --> 00:57:05.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Doing their stuff.

00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>> --continuing his work.

00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:10.590 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it's-- because his
work was about the awakening

00:57:10.590 --> 00:57:11.390 align:middle line:90%
of humanity.

00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:12.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:14.400 align:middle line:84%
Uplifting, raising
the consciousness.

00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:15.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:17.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Very cool.

00:57:17.090 --> 00:57:18.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, thank you.

00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:22.700 align:middle line:84%
What an amazing journey
you guys have been on.

00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And we're about to go on another
one in the stargate here.

00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:28.340 align:middle line:90%
So looking forward to that.

00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:29.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, this is fun.

00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:30.020 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:33.290 align:middle line:84%
>> And we certainly invite
anyone who feels touched

00:57:33.290 --> 00:57:36.030 align:middle line:84%
by this to come and
have an experience.

00:57:36.030 --> 00:57:36.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:57:36.830 --> 00:57:38.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Either physically or online.

00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:41.450 align:middle line:84%
>> And online would
be the stargate--

00:57:41.450 --> 00:57:42.740 align:middle line:90%
>> The stargateexperience.com.

00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:43.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Experience.

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:44.360 align:middle line:90%
Dot com.

00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:45.300 align:middle line:90%
Easy enough.

00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:46.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:46.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect.

00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:47.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks, Reuben.

00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>> We really appreciate being
able to share in this way with

00:57:51.350 --> 00:57:53.060 align:middle line:90%
you and your audience.

00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:54.514 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

00:57:54.514 --> 00:57:58.466 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:57:58.466 --> 00:58:01.440 align:middle line:90%


00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>> First time
experiencing stargate,

00:58:03.450 --> 00:58:05.640 align:middle line:84%
which has been a really
powerful one and so far.

00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:10.032 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's a lot more
felt. So it was really--

00:58:10.032 --> 00:58:11.490 align:middle line:84%
what was most
interesting today was

00:58:11.490 --> 00:58:14.670 align:middle line:84%
tapping into the different
vibrational frequencies

00:58:14.670 --> 00:58:16.530 align:middle line:84%
as they were calling
in different entities.

00:58:16.530 --> 00:58:17.910 align:middle line:90%
That was really meaningful.

00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And just knowing noticing
the subtle nuances

00:58:20.970 --> 00:58:22.890 align:middle line:84%
and the different
flavors, if you will.

00:58:22.890 --> 00:58:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And being able to then surrender
into those in different ways.

00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And stargate comes in with
this galactic experience,

00:58:31.950 --> 00:58:36.750 align:middle line:84%
really connecting us to the
cosmos in this interdimensional

00:58:36.750 --> 00:58:42.690 align:middle line:84%
way with all of these extra
dimensional beings and lives

00:58:42.690 --> 00:58:44.970 align:middle line:90%
that we may have or have had.

00:58:44.970 --> 00:58:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>> It was so beautifully intense
and powerful because it was

00:58:53.010 --> 00:58:53.970 align:middle line:90%
palpable.

00:58:53.970 --> 00:58:57.270 align:middle line:84%
The depth of the
energy that came in

00:58:57.270 --> 00:59:00.330 align:middle line:90%
and the power and the love.

00:59:00.330 --> 00:59:01.710 align:middle line:90%
That's maybe what I want to say.

00:59:01.710 --> 00:59:04.060 align:middle line:90%
The love and the light.

00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:09.030 align:middle line:84%
I just felt so supported
by all the celestial beings

00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:10.350 align:middle line:90%
that they brought in.

00:59:10.350 --> 00:59:11.790 align:middle line:90%
>> It was like a wave.

00:59:11.790 --> 00:59:16.350 align:middle line:84%
It's these waves of
energy coming through when

00:59:16.350 --> 00:59:18.390 align:middle line:90%
we were calling in the angels.

00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And I often will know who
is coming before they come.

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.640 align:middle line:90%
So that's always fun.

00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:29.880 align:middle line:84%
So to me, the Hathors were
really knocking on my door.

00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:32.310 align:middle line:10%
>> There were times last night
and then throughout the day

00:59:32.310 --> 00:59:35.310 align:middle line:10%
today where it almost felt like
I didn't know who I was anymore

00:59:35.310 --> 00:59:37.613 align:middle line:10%
because so much had
shifted within me.

00:59:37.613 --> 00:59:39.030 align:middle line:84%
I felt like there
were times where

00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:41.638 align:middle line:84%
I was just completely knocked
out, and then I would emerge.

00:59:41.638 --> 00:59:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And it felt like I was
coming out of an ayahuasca

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:45.240 align:middle line:90%
ceremony or something.

00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And everything felt really
just changed within me.

00:59:51.490 --> 00:59:54.060 align:middle line:84%
>> I just keep putting one
foot in front of the other.

00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And I try to be in the
flow and I loved today

00:59:57.900 --> 01:00:02.370 align:middle line:84%
when Prageet described
staying above the chaos.

01:00:02.370 --> 01:00:05.490 align:middle line:84%
Right now, I've been above
the chaos for quite a while,

01:00:05.490 --> 01:00:07.140 align:middle line:84%
and it feels like
a really good place

01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:11.820 align:middle line:84%
to be rather than caught
up with all the energies

01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:13.110 align:middle line:90%
that are just swirling.

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:14.800 align:middle line:90%
So I just remain up here.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And my goal is to constantly
be vigilant and mindful to stay

01:00:20.610 --> 01:00:24.540 align:middle line:84%
in that place where I can keep
my inner calm, my inner peace

01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:30.360 align:middle line:84%
and not be affected by all
of what's swirling around me

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:31.320 align:middle line:90%
throughout the world.

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:32.550 align:middle line:90%
It's planetary.

01:00:32.550 --> 01:00:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>> It was so--

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:35.620 align:middle line:90%
this was so powerful.

01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:40.590 align:middle line:84%
I felt Kuan Yin, and she
had such an amazing presence

01:00:40.590 --> 01:00:43.020 align:middle line:84%
coming in it was beautiful
and just I could feel it.

01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:46.620 align:middle line:90%
And Buddha and Jesus and Mary.

01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:48.090 align:middle line:90%
And it just all the--

01:00:48.090 --> 01:00:49.590 align:middle line:90%
it was amazing.

01:00:49.590 --> 01:00:53.520 align:middle line:84%
But to have that done in the
collective and that feeling,

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:54.750 align:middle line:90%
I felt very supported.

01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:58.080 align:middle line:90%
I felt very awake and conscious.

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, it was just a
really beautiful feeling.

01:01:01.890 --> 01:01:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And even from a
healing perspective,

01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:09.100 align:middle line:90%
I felt more vibrant.

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And I was more
electrified the rest

01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:12.420 align:middle line:90%
of the day-- more energized.

01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Like one piece of message
that was so amazing is that

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:21.870 align:middle line:84%
they were supporting us to be
able to live our true capacity

01:01:21.870 --> 01:01:24.570 align:middle line:90%
with no limitations.

01:01:24.570 --> 01:01:27.070 align:middle line:84%
So that, we all
understand in theory.

01:01:27.070 --> 01:01:27.870 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:01:27.870 --> 01:01:30.480 align:middle line:84%
That we are more than
our just human selves

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:34.650 align:middle line:84%
and our human little
being limitations.

01:01:34.650 --> 01:01:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And I really got it
that with the support

01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:42.510 align:middle line:84%
that we're getting
from the big upstairs--

01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:45.660 align:middle line:84%
that's what I call
them, the big upstairs.

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Prageet spoke a lot about
liberating us from limiting

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:51.060 align:middle line:84%
beliefs and how we are
just identifying with a lot

01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:54.150 align:middle line:84%
of the belief systems that we've
been relating to life through.

01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And how that is
starting to expand

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:58.350 align:middle line:84%
so that we can touch more
upon the quantum fields

01:01:58.350 --> 01:02:01.080 align:middle line:84%
and exist in a state of
infinite possibility.

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And I definitely
saw that coming out.

01:02:03.210 --> 01:02:05.970 align:middle line:84%
I felt so raw and I started
to see some of my patterns

01:02:05.970 --> 01:02:10.410 align:middle line:84%
and habits far more clearly,
and how they were perpetuating

01:02:10.410 --> 01:02:12.210 align:middle line:84%
these certain
experiences in my life,

01:02:12.210 --> 01:02:14.670 align:middle line:84%
but I don't consciously
want to be having.

01:02:14.670 --> 01:02:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's so natural
to be like, oh, it's

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:21.150 align:middle line:84%
that person's fault. Or like,
it's life's fault. Like,

01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:22.470 align:middle line:90%
life is doing this to me.

01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:25.530 align:middle line:84%
But in all the shifts that I
experienced today, it suddenly

01:02:25.530 --> 01:02:27.120 align:middle line:84%
became so clear of
like, whoa, there

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:32.160 align:middle line:84%
are these unconscious
programs actually playing out.

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:37.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I get that, that there's
this voice that comes to me.

01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:40.650 align:middle line:84%
So I'm used to hearing
that my entire life.

01:02:40.650 --> 01:02:45.580 align:middle line:84%
But after this weekend, I think
my consciousness is expanded.

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:47.580 align:middle line:90%
I have a whole new--

01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:50.160 align:middle line:84%
I know I feel like I have
a whole new group of beings

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:50.970 align:middle line:90%
to call on.

01:02:50.970 --> 01:02:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And they all have new friends
and they'll all have purpose,

01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:55.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure.

01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:57.810 align:middle line:90%
So I feel very guided right now.

01:02:57.810 --> 01:03:02.310 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like taking the
intellectual understanding

01:03:02.310 --> 01:03:06.000 align:middle line:84%
and bringing it into a really
deep embodied level so that it

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.980 align:middle line:84%
becomes sort of like a wisdom as
opposed to just knowledge that

01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:12.750 align:middle line:90%
you're hearing.

01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:16.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Us getting in touch with who
we are, with our highest self,

01:03:16.110 --> 01:03:21.750 align:middle line:84%
with our highest purpose,
with the never ending stream

01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:24.922 align:middle line:84%
of light and divinity,
that is who we really are.

01:03:24.922 --> 01:03:26.880 align:middle line:84%
That's who we really are
and we tend to forget.

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
that experience was

01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:34.410 align:middle line:84%
was really not just allowing
us to remember, but bringing it

01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:37.710 align:middle line:84%
in to us so viscerally in
so many different aspects

01:03:37.710 --> 01:03:41.070 align:middle line:84%
that we have no choice
but to constantly

01:03:41.070 --> 01:03:42.390 align:middle line:90%
be in a state of remembrance.

01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in that
constant state of remembrance,

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:47.250 align:middle line:84%
you're also constantly
in a state of emanation.

01:03:47.250 --> 01:03:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And being able to be in
that state of remembrance

01:03:50.550 --> 01:03:52.590 align:middle line:84%
and being in that
state of emanation

01:03:52.590 --> 01:03:55.650 align:middle line:84%
and really being
able to bring and be

01:03:55.650 --> 01:03:58.080 align:middle line:84%
that light and that
energy in the world--

01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:01.960 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm always looking for the
moving into the next level.

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it took a
while to get there.

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:07.750 align:middle line:90%
Number one was turn off the TV.

01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:08.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:04:08.550 --> 01:04:10.330 align:middle line:90%
The shift is happening for sure.

01:04:10.330 --> 01:04:11.130 align:middle line:90%
>> It is, yeah.

01:04:11.130 --> 01:04:11.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:04:11.930 --> 01:04:15.080 align:middle line:90%
