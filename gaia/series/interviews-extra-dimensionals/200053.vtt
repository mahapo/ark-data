Luis told me that you guys
are from the Pleiades,

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.410 align:middle line:90%
or the Pleiades star system?

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:56.860 align:middle line:84%
That is right, and located
in the central sun, which

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.270 align:middle line:90%
you refer to as Alcyone.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.110 align:middle line:84%
But we have said
many times before,

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.200 align:middle line:84%
if you were to go there,
if you had the capacity

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.780 align:middle line:84%
to go there in one
of your spaceships,

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.100 align:middle line:90%
then you would not find us.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Because we exist in a
different dimension.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.722 align:middle line:90%
>> What dimension would you--

00:04:12.722 --> 00:04:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we refer to it
as the ninth dimension.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Ninth dimension, OK.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And at that high dimension
level, you're more of a--

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we don't really
categorize it as high and low.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:25.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Just different.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Just different.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.800 align:middle line:84%
But in the difference in
the sense that we would--

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.230 align:middle line:84%
us humans would perceive it as
more of a collective energy.

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.040 align:middle line:84%
We are collective energy,
yes, speaking to you as one.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And you would have, in
that collective energy from

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.270 align:middle line:84%
the Pleiades, you would
encompass many different races,

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.550 align:middle line:90%
many different beings.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.770 align:middle line:84%
>> We consider ourself one
race consisting of many beings.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.000 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.560 align:middle line:84%
Within this, would that
encompass all of the Pleiades?

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.360 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.670 align:middle line:84%
There are many different
Pleiadian groups.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:08.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.730 align:middle line:90%
So one of many collectives--

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:12.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.750 align:middle line:90%
>> --is the AIKON energy?

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:14.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.100 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Now the Pleiades
is quite large--

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:19.910 align:middle line:90%
a large system.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's all a

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.680 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHING] This is true.

From our perspective
here on Earth,

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.540 align:middle line:90%
we look up and we see seven--

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:34.000 align:middle line:84%
we call them the Seven
Sisters, tiny constellation.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.210 align:middle line:84%
But yet several stars
more than seven,

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure, within that
region in that area.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.780 align:middle line:84%
What would be a
good reference point

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:49.752 align:middle line:84%
for others watching to connect
to this energy in their--

00:05:49.752 --> 00:05:51.460 align:middle line:84%
>> We're not understanding
your question.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:52.700 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean
a reference point?

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:53.617 align:middle line:90%
>> A reference point--

00:05:53.617 --> 00:05:57.760 align:middle line:84%
so some people in the ancient
days would look to the stars

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:04.228 align:middle line:84%
to tell stories, to have
the constellations as a--

00:06:04.228 --> 00:06:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>> You will not find
us in the stars.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.310 align:middle line:90%
You will find us in your hearts.

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And if you wish to
connect with us,

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.910 align:middle line:84%
then we recommend that
you do so within yourself.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.940 align:middle line:84%
It's not that you're going
to find us out there.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.620 align:middle line:90%
You're going to find us in here.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And most of you,
you're looking--

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.490 align:middle line:84%
you're searching for everything
in the wrong direction.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.060 align:middle line:84%
You think everything should
be found outside of you when

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.780 align:middle line:90%
the universe exists within you.

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:30.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So you must turn
your attention round.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:38.260 align:middle line:84%

you by distance, by time,

by space.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.900 align:middle line:90%
We are connected to you.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.790 align:middle line:84%
But you must attune yourself
to a certain frequency,

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.160 align:middle line:84%
like when you turn
your radio dial,

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.210 align:middle line:84%
in order to be able to
experience us and our energy.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And we said to many of
you that we are here

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.480 align:middle line:90%
and we are accessible for you.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And if you wish to
connect with our energy,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.220 align:middle line:84%
then simply make a
request in your heart

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.130 align:middle line:84%
and make the intention that
you want to connect with us.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And we'll be more than
happy to support you

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.920 align:middle line:84%
in your times of need, when
you're experiencing challenges,

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.160 align:middle line:84%
and to be there
energetically with you.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.060 align:middle line:84%
But we wish to emphasize
that you do not need us.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.308 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't want you
to become dependent on us.

00:07:18.308 --> 00:07:20.350 align:middle line:84%
We want you to recognize
that everything you need

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:21.250 align:middle line:90%
exists within you.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And you have the
capacity to source

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.480 align:middle line:84%
all the information you ever
need in any given moment

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.720 align:middle line:90%
from within yourself.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.610 align:middle line:84%
But we're happy to
be here as friends.

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:32.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.020 align:middle line:84%
That is the reference
point I was looking for.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:34.450 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:35.250 align:middle line:90%
We understand.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.800 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] Thank you.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.020 align:middle line:84%
Truly, that seems to be the main
message of the Pleiadian energy

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.350 align:middle line:90%
is to be in the heart center.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:46.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Recently, in
fact, the past week,

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:55.630 align:middle line:84%
we've had some breakthroughs,
I would say, in ufology.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:08:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And we use the term
ufology, UFOs, and other--

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.250 align:middle line:90%
it's sort of our--

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe you should
start calling them IFOs.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:06.070 align:middle line:90%
>> IFOs?

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:08.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Because you're becoming more
aware of what they actually

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:09.660 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:12.380 align:middle line:84%
Now they're identified
flying objects.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.990 align:middle line:84%
You are more aware
that we exist and there

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.050 align:middle line:84%
are many different species
and you're not alone--

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:17.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:18.790 align:middle line:90%
>> --in the universe.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And this has been
a great permission

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.480 align:middle line:90%
slip to go into these realms.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And some of us have had these
contact experiences, you know,

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:33.700 align:middle line:84%
Louise, myself, and we've
been communicating with beings

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.510 align:middle line:90%
like yourselves for many years.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:38.230 align:middle line:84%
But many on this
planet still have

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:44.200 align:middle line:84%
created a fear-based barrier to
connecting with these energies.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.350 align:middle line:84%
But we've sort of gotten a
governmental permission slip

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:53.080 align:middle line:84%
this past week
from the releasing

00:08:53.080 --> 00:09:02.020 align:middle line:84%
of some top secret government
files and videos of UFOs.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.407 align:middle line:84%
And it's starting
to create waves

00:09:04.407 --> 00:09:05.740 align:middle line:90%
in the collective consciousness.

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And I was wondering how do
you guys perceive this energy?

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've already
shared with you

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.613 align:middle line:84%
before those that have
been connecting with us

00:09:18.613 --> 00:09:19.780 align:middle line:90%
and following Louise's work.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.340 align:middle line:84%
You'll know that
we've already shared

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:25.940 align:middle line:84%
that there is a great shifting
consciousness underway

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:26.860 align:middle line:90%
in your planet.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And we've already
explained many times

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.960 align:middle line:84%
that that is the
reason why we have

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.420 align:middle line:84%
connected with
Louise to communicate

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:35.350 align:middle line:90%
with you at this time.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:40.690 align:middle line:84%
Because our particular
speciality of our faction

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:44.080 align:middle line:84%
is that we support
species that are

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.860 align:middle line:84%
going through a
transformation period

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.870 align:middle line:90%
and expansion in consciousness.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And we support them
during that time.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And our desire is that this
will lead to you becoming

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:01.430 align:middle line:90%
part of the galactic community.

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:04.180 align:middle line:90%
And we're very excited for this.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And as we proceed, there are
many, many, many races now

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:10.240 align:middle line:84%
observing your planet
and this transformation.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:13.130 align:middle line:10%
It's a very exciting
time for everyone.

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And these energies
are intensifying

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:28.540 align:middle line:84%
because your solar system is
moving through a area of energy

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:35.080 align:middle line:84%
in space, which is
affecting your physical

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.990 align:middle line:90%
and energetic makeup.

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And that is having an impact
on your consciousness,

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:44.720 align:middle line:90%
among other things.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And we're very excited to
support you in this shift.

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And these energies are
going to get more intense.

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
continue unfolding

00:10:56.050 --> 00:11:00.800 align:middle line:90%
with a heightened velocity.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.570 align:middle line:84%
It's going to start
speeding up more and more.

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:04.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:10.050 align:middle line:84%
So already, some
people are flying--

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:14.440 align:middle line:84%
you know the expression, flying
by the seat of their pants?

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.380 align:middle line:84%
It's almost too intense,
too fast for them.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:23.980 align:middle line:84%
But many others, like myself,
are welcoming these energies,

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.150 align:middle line:90%
these new ideas.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:28.367 align:middle line:84%
Whether you like
it or not, you're

00:11:28.367 --> 00:11:30.250 align:middle line:90%
going to be dragged along.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:33.850 align:middle line:84%
So we recommend that you
just get on board already.

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And your shift will
be much gentler.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, many people
during this last week,

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:44.200 align:middle line:84%
this announcement from
our government to--

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.550 align:middle line:90%
the US government, I should say.

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:47.092 align:middle line:84%
You know, other
countries have talked

00:11:47.092 --> 00:11:51.520 align:middle line:84%
about disclosure
and the existence

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:56.950 align:middle line:84%
of other intelligences
for a long time.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.570 align:middle line:84%
But specifically,
the US government

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:04.270 align:middle line:84%
has sort of had a policy of not
talking about this, especially

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:05.590 align:middle line:90%
in an open way.

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was a big
break, many feel,

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:11.310 align:middle line:84%
for them to start
this conversation

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:12.110 align:middle line:90%
in the main stream.

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:13.460 align:middle line:90%
>> This is just the beginning.

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>> I understand.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Hold on tight.

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:18.295 align:middle line:84%
>> I was going to say
many people are upset.

00:12:18.295 --> 00:12:19.572 align:middle line:90%
They're the opposite.

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:20.530 align:middle line:90%
They're actually upset.

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.080 align:middle line:84%
Because they feel
like they've only

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:27.070 align:middle line:90%
disclosed such a small amount.

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:30.870 align:middle line:84%
What would you say to
those people who are upset?

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:40.450 align:middle line:84%
>> We would say does the
flower get upset when it sees

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:45.370 align:middle line:84%
the flower next to it has
petals that are opening faster?

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:52.900 align:middle line:84%
Does the tree get upset
that its branches are not

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.840 align:middle line:90%
growing fast enough?

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:59.620 align:middle line:84%
You must recognize that
this is a process of nature.

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:05.890 align:middle line:84%
It is a divine energy that
is beyond the limitations

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:10.840 align:middle line:84%
of your mind and what you
believe yourself to be.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And the process will
happen naturally

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:17.350 align:middle line:84%
in its own time
and a right moment.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:21.040 align:middle line:84%
So stop fighting against reality
and how things should be.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:25.120 align:middle line:84%
Sit back and relax
and enjoy the ride.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:31.750 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything one can do
to enjoy the ride a little bit

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:33.050 align:middle line:90%
better?

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:33.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:43.230 align:middle line:84%
We recommend that
you become still.

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And really what we're
recommending for you

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:48.000 align:middle line:84%
is the opposite of everything
that you've been taught.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.780 align:middle line:84%
So you've been taught that
you must do and take action.

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:54.500 align:middle line:84%
We recommend that you
stop and you become still.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.010 align:middle line:84%
You've read it
you've been taught

00:13:56.010 --> 00:14:00.390 align:middle line:84%
that you must think and use
your minds to figure things out.

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:03.120 align:middle line:84%
We recommend that you stop
thinking and you become still

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.550 align:middle line:90%
and quiet.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:11.850 align:middle line:84%
It is in the stillness that you
can connect to the zero point

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:22.110 align:middle line:84%
energy, which is the
fastest vibrating energy

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:23.560 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And it is where you can
align your own energy

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:31.170 align:middle line:84%
from within yourself
in order to experience

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:35.790 align:middle line:84%
a connectedness with the
source and all that is.

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And once you're
connected with this,

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:40.980 align:middle line:84%
then this energy can
support you in your life.

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:43.990 align:middle line:84%
It can bring to you
everything that you need.

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And it requires a
surrender from your mind

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:52.290 align:middle line:84%
and how you think
things should be

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:55.270 align:middle line:84%
and a recognition that
that is not what you are.

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:56.220 align:middle line:90%
You're not your mind.

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.390 align:middle line:90%
You're not your physical body.

00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:58.290 align:middle line:90%
You're not your thoughts.

00:14:58.290 --> 00:14:59.310 align:middle line:90%
You're not your emotion.

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:03.180 align:middle line:84%
You are that which
perceives all of these.

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:06.660 align:middle line:90%


00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>> You mentioned you're
sort of almost, I guess,

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.680 align:middle line:84%
an evolution or
contact specialist,

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:18.570 align:middle line:84%
but an evolution group that
helps other races go through

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:20.790 align:middle line:90%
this transition.

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:22.350 align:middle line:84%
Are there many other
races out there

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:29.010 align:middle line:84%
that are going through a similar
awakening as Planet Earth?

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not relevant for us to
share this information with you

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:33.360 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Just as when you go to
your psychotherapists,

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:41.360 align:middle line:84%
they don't share information
on their other patients.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.210 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:44.752 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was just
thinking there might

00:15:44.752 --> 00:15:47.730 align:middle line:84%
be something we could learn
from our neighbors who

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:48.780 align:middle line:90%
might be going through.

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.322 align:middle line:84%
But I'm sure it's
uniquely different.

00:15:50.322 --> 00:15:56.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything you need to
learn is presented to you right

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:59.310 align:middle line:84%
in your face, closer than
you could ever imagine.

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Because everything, everything
in creation is intelligence.

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:05.970 align:middle line:90%
It is pure intelligence.

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And it is acting like
a mirror for you.

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:12.720 align:middle line:84%
It is a projection of
your consciousness.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.390 align:middle line:84%
Each of your
individual experiences

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:20.413 align:middle line:84%
is unique to what you need
to experience in that moment.

00:16:20.413 --> 00:16:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And if you're caught
up in your thoughts

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.705 align:middle line:84%
and you're thinking
about past memories

00:16:23.705 --> 00:16:25.650 align:middle line:84%
or projecting into the
future, then you're

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:27.090 align:middle line:90%
not fully present in the moment.

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And you're not able to receive
the information that's been

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:32.970 align:middle line:90%
shown to you in the mirror.

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:34.440 align:middle line:84%
You're not looking
in the mirror,

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.570 align:middle line:84%
because you're
looking in your mind.

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:39.660 align:middle line:84%
So you must begin to
observe your thoughts

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:42.030 align:middle line:84%
and this will create
this identification

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:43.230 align:middle line:90%
with the thoughts.

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And you recognize that there
is the thoughts appearing

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:50.610 align:middle line:90%
and disappearing.

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:52.380 align:middle line:90%
And they're coming and going.

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:55.260 align:middle line:84%
Yet something always
remains to perceive them.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.806 align:middle line:84%
You must turn your
attention to the perceiver.

00:16:57.806 --> 00:17:02.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Mhm, the "who am I" aspect,
the "I" of the "who am I"

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:06.690 align:middle line:84%
aspect, as I was kind of trying
to say earlier a little bit,

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:09.569 align:middle line:90%
who is creating those thoughts?

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Is that kind of
what you're saying?

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:16.829 align:middle line:84%
Who-- what is the energy behind
the one creating the thoughts?

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:18.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I wouldn't
say it's "behind."

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:19.822 align:middle line:90%
>> Or--

00:17:19.822 --> 00:17:22.890 align:middle line:84%
>> We would point you
to look within yourself.

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:24.300 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:32.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And you must directly
experience what we point you

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:37.700 align:middle line:84%
to because it is the only
way that you can know it.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.850 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it just
becomes a belief.

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:42.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Knowing it.

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:45.860 align:middle line:84%
>> To know it is to
experience yourself as it.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And it is easier to
identify what you are not.

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:51.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:55.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So have a look, and ask
yourself, am I this body?

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:57.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:59.600 align:middle line:84%
>> The body comes,
and the body goes.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.120 align:middle line:90%
The body changes.

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.540 align:middle line:84%
There is something
which perceives

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:05.010 align:middle line:90%
the body which does not change.

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:06.770 align:middle line:90%
Therefore, you are not the body.

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And each time you recognize
something that you are not,

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.932 align:middle line:84%
it is like taking off a
layer of your clothing.

00:18:11.932 --> 00:18:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And when you've taken
off all the clothes

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:17.600 align:middle line:84%
and you're standing there naked,
what remains is what you are.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:20.540 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.136 align:middle line:90%
Yes, great advice.

00:18:22.136 --> 00:18:23.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:28.565 align:middle line:84%
>> So as a contact
specialist then, basically,

00:18:28.565 --> 00:18:31.190 align:middle line:84%
because you're showing up in my
reality and many others who are

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:32.300 align:middle line:90%
watching this--

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:33.140 align:middle line:90%
>> We are indeed.

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:35.872 align:middle line:84%
>> --then we should
pay attention.

00:18:35.872 --> 00:18:36.747 align:middle line:90%
>> You should indeed.

00:18:36.747 --> 00:18:40.160 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] All right.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And you should also not
just believe everything that we

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:46.298 align:middle line:84%
share with you because we
don't wish to disempower you,

00:18:46.298 --> 00:18:47.840 align:middle line:84%
and tell you we have
all the answers,

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.640 align:middle line:84%
and we're here to
tell you how it is.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:54.170 align:middle line:84%
No, we are here to
support you in recognizing

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:56.510 align:middle line:84%
that you have all the
answers inside of yourself,

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:59.330 align:middle line:84%
and you have the capacity
to discern information

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:01.020 align:middle line:90%
that you are perceiving.

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.530 align:middle line:84%
So you must-- yes, we
recommend that you be open,

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:05.720 align:middle line:84%
and you listen to
what we're saying,

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.690 align:middle line:84%
and you feel the energy
that we're sharing with you.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And then you feel into your
heart and ask yourself,

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:12.440 align:middle line:90%
is this true for me?

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.760 align:middle line:90%
Does this resonate for me?

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And if it doesn't,
then we recommend

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:16.635 align:middle line:84%
that you throw it
in the garbage,

00:19:16.635 --> 00:19:18.320 align:middle line:84%
and you don't pay
any attention to it.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And if it resonates,
then we recommend

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.580 align:middle line:90%
that you take it on board.

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So many of us, as I opened
my first question with saying,

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:34.280 align:middle line:84%
looking out to the stars to find
the story of the Pleiadians,

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.830 align:middle line:84%
and you sort of reverted
it back into going within.

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:39.390 align:middle line:90%


00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:42.600 align:middle line:84%
This seems to be the
main message of Aikon

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:43.790 align:middle line:90%
in our Pleiadian family.

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:44.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:47.660 align:middle line:84%
What we most want
you to understand

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:54.570 align:middle line:84%
is that for a long, long,
long time now, you--

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:58.927 align:middle line:84%
the focus of your energy has
been up here in your mind,

00:19:58.927 --> 00:20:02.790 align:middle line:84%
and that has been
serving you up until now.

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And now, there is a new
way, something different.

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:09.780 align:middle line:84%
It's part of your evolution
that can serve you more,

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:13.920 align:middle line:84%
and that is to allow these
energies to drop down and drop

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:17.010 align:middle line:84%
into the heart where you
will find your power center,

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:19.980 align:middle line:84%
where you will find
your inner guidance,

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.680 align:middle line:84%
and to align with that
and to act on that.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And many of you, you're
not even fully present

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:28.050 align:middle line:84%
in your physical bodies
because it's painful for you

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:31.230 align:middle line:84%
to be there, so
you're trying to avoid

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:34.190 align:middle line:84%
the pain that you experience
in your physical body.

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:37.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's a kind of defense
mechanism that's been learned.

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And we are kind of
training you to remember

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:43.210 align:middle line:90%
how to bring energy back down.

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:44.700 align:middle line:90%
This is what's important for us.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Because it's only when
your energy is flowing

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.710 align:middle line:84%
through your system and you're
connected really in your heart

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:53.940 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to
recognize the truth of that

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.370 align:middle line:90%
which you are.

00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>> What are some ways that
some people can do this too?

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:06.030 align:middle line:84%
>> We recommend that
you, throughout the day,

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:12.340 align:middle line:84%
whenever possible, follow the
gentle movement of your breath.

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:16.150 align:middle line:84%
The breath will anchor
your energy in your body.

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:17.490 align:middle line:90%
So you simply notice it.

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:20.950 align:middle line:84%
You notice the breath
moving through the body.

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And as you notice it, you
will become more present.

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:27.330 align:middle line:84%
Your attention will drop
into the present moment.

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And as your attention drops
into the present moment,

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.760 align:middle line:90%
maybe memories will appear.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:34.560 align:middle line:90%
And that is OK.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:35.760 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to stop them.

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.470 align:middle line:90%
You just notice.

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And maybe thoughts about
the future will appear.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:44.730 align:middle line:84%
What am I going to
have for dinner?

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:46.260 align:middle line:90%
How will my future look?

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:47.060 align:middle line:90%
That is OK.

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:48.060 align:middle line:90%
They don't have to stop.

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:48.960 align:middle line:90%
You simply notice.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:52.950 align:middle line:90%


00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And we recommend that you become
an observer of your experience.

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And as you do so, everything
will begin to slow down.

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.040 align:middle line:90%
Your experience will slow down.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.170 align:middle line:84%
You see, many of
you, you're agitated.

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And you're trying to run away
from an inner experience,

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:12.210 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying to avoid
your inner experience

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:14.010 align:middle line:90%
or to numb it in some way.

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And you do this by keeping
yourself busy, busy, busy.

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:18.192 align:middle line:90%
You must stop.

00:22:18.192 --> 00:22:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to require
some courage because you're

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.580 align:middle line:84%
going to have to meet everything
that you've been running from.

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:26.430 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have to meet
all the pain inside you that

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:29.560 align:middle line:84%
has built up from your childhood
and has been repressed.

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:30.360 align:middle line:90%
But don't worry.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.250 align:middle line:84%
We're here to
support you in that.

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:39.580 align:middle line:90%
And one moment.

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:40.870 align:middle line:90%
Do you see?

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:41.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:49.660 align:middle line:84%
How are you here to support us
in that looking into our fears

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:51.210 align:middle line:90%
or looking into our--

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:59.100 align:middle line:84%
>> We support you through the
process of guiding you to meet

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:04.800 align:middle line:84%
the energies that were repressed
and fragmented and to integrate

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.370 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we do when
we work with individuals,

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:17.310 align:middle line:84%
when we work doing sessions
and group events with Louise.

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:19.860 align:middle line:84%
This is the main
focus of our work.

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And once this inner
work is complete,

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:26.460 align:middle line:84%
once something has shifted on
the inside, what you recognize

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:29.850 align:middle line:84%
is that your outer world
also shifts in order

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:32.640 align:middle line:84%
to reflect the new
inner state of being

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.740 align:middle line:84%
because your outer
state of reality

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:37.090 align:middle line:84%
is a reflection of your
inner state of being.

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And many of you, you're trying
to fix and change things

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:41.430 align:middle line:84%
out there, and it's
never going to happen.

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:43.140 align:middle line:84%
It's like banging
your head on a wall.

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:43.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're showing you where
to go to make those changes,

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.630 align:middle line:84%
and we're showing you how
to make those changes.

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:54.540 align:middle line:90%


00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:58.230 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to share a
personal download I received

00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:01.837 align:middle line:90%
the other day on the solstice.

00:24:01.837 --> 00:24:02.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Please, go ahead.

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:03.712 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know if it's--

00:24:03.712 --> 00:24:07.150 align:middle line:90%


00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:08.890 align:middle line:84%
well, I'll share it,
and then we can--

00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:09.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Wait a minute.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.520 align:middle line:84%
We wish for you to
finish this sentence.

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.190 align:middle line:90%
You don't know if it's, what?

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.990 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And then it los-- it
went out of my mind.

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:16.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:18.120 align:middle line:90%
And then I kind of was like, oh.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, we felt that it was
your doubt creeping in--

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.180 align:middle line:84%
>> --the doubt of your own inner
knowing and your own intuition.

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And this is the one of reasons
we're here, to support you

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:28.590 align:middle line:90%
in trusting in that.

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Because many of you, you're
receiving this inner knowing,

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.480 align:middle line:84%
and it comes in
a subtle whisper.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And you're disregarding
it because you're

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:39.210 align:middle line:84%
taught from a young
age to disregard it,

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:41.610 align:middle line:84%
that it's not valid,
that what is valid

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:44.690 align:middle line:84%
is that which comes
from your logical mind.

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:47.190 align:middle line:90%
But it's time for you to start--

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:49.620 align:middle line:84%
it's time for you to
start giving power

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:52.110 align:middle line:90%
to this inner knowing.

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:53.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So during the
solstice, I had--

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:58.115 align:middle line:90%


00:24:58.115 --> 00:25:00.060 align:middle line:84%
it was during some
breath work, actually.

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:02.940 align:middle line:90%


00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:07.065 align:middle line:90%
I had a profound download of--

00:25:07.065 --> 00:25:09.570 align:middle line:90%


00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:16.050 align:middle line:84%
about integrity
and how important

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:21.360 align:middle line:84%
the integrity of relationships,
and people, and ideas,

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:29.573 align:middle line:84%
and beliefs, and melding these
different aspects of every--

00:25:29.573 --> 00:25:31.740 align:middle line:84%
of different people, belief
systems, and everything,

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:35.190 align:middle line:84%
and sort of the
acceptance of all of this

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:45.820 align:middle line:84%
creates a very strong
web of reality.

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm searching for the words.

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:56.940 align:middle line:84%
But I could see it as
a sign of strength.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:59.470 align:middle line:90%


00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:01.490 align:middle line:90%
Hm.

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:02.290 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:07.073 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of things that ca--
a lot of energy, a lot of ideas

00:26:07.073 --> 00:26:09.240 align:middle line:84%
came through, and visions
came through at this time.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.190 align:middle line:90%
But I guess--

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:12.998 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, we're receiving
it on other levels.

00:26:12.998 --> 00:26:15.290 align:middle line:84%
We're receiving the information
you're sharing with us.

00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:17.880 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, so I guess my--

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:21.180 align:middle line:90%


00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:23.990 align:middle line:84%
with this idea of
integrity, I felt

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:25.740 align:middle line:84%
that there were some
things in my own life

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:30.150 align:middle line:84%
that I had not been
acting integrity in

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:35.490 align:middle line:84%
and, therefore, saw it
as a reflection for me

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:45.210 align:middle line:84%
to pay more attention to all
the little details in my life,

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:48.450 align:middle line:84%
to incorporate this integrity
or this idea of integrity

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:49.695 align:middle line:90%
in more ways.

00:26:49.695 --> 00:26:53.010 align:middle line:90%


00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:54.270 align:middle line:90%
I guess I'm asking--

00:26:54.270 --> 00:27:02.860 align:middle line:84%
the question I want to ask is,
from your perspective, was--

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:07.580 align:middle line:84%
is, can you-- is there any
information or guidance

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:13.720 align:middle line:90%
I can do to live in integrity?

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:14.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:17.330 align:middle line:84%
We like this question very much,
and thank you for your sharing.

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:19.170 align:middle line:90%
We honor you very deeply.

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And we feel it
takes great courage

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:28.245 align:middle line:84%
to allow yourself to
be vulnerable and open

00:27:28.245 --> 00:27:29.045 align:middle line:90%
in this way.

00:27:29.045 --> 00:27:31.130 align:middle line:90%
And we thank you for that.

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:36.530 align:middle line:84%
We thank you for your
being and your sharing.

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And we agree with that
which you shared with us.

00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And integrity means to be 100%
absolutely honest with yourself

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.290 align:middle line:90%
in every given moment.

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And to do so requires you to
face all your inner demons

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:03.290 align:middle line:84%
and all the masks that
you have been wearing

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:06.680 align:middle line:84%
to cover up all the fears
and insecurities that you

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.450 align:middle line:90%
have been hiding.

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And as you find the
courage within yourself

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:15.020 align:middle line:84%
to be honest in this way,
all these behavioral patterns

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:17.510 align:middle line:84%
that have been
playing out will begin

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:22.890 align:middle line:84%
to fall away, revealing more of
your true, natural expression.

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:29.340 align:middle line:90%
So you must ask yourselves in--

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:32.360 align:middle line:84%
each time that you
speak something or you

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:37.370 align:middle line:84%
take an action, ask yourself,
why am I saying this?

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:39.920 align:middle line:84%
Am I saying this to gain
recognition from others

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.350 align:middle line:84%
because it gives
me a sense of self?

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:47.915 align:middle line:84%
Am I saying this to show that
I am powerful because inside I

00:28:47.915 --> 00:28:50.900 align:middle line:90%
am feeling powerless?

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Am I saying this in
order to impress others

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:58.820 align:middle line:84%
because I feel that
I don't have words?

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And as you begin to honestly
reflect in these ways,

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.760 align:middle line:84%
you will meet all of
your shadows and demons.

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.350 align:middle line:84%
But that's a good
thing because that's

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:09.260 align:middle line:84%
where the treasures, and the
gems, and the beauties lie.

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:13.370 align:middle line:84%
You must enter into
the heart of darkness

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:18.650 align:middle line:84%
in order to penetrate
through into the light.

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:20.180 align:middle line:90%
There is no shortcut.

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:26.000 align:middle line:84%
It is not a journey
for the weak.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.030 align:middle line:84%
It takes courage, and this
is true courage to do this.

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:34.580 align:middle line:84%
This is true strength to allow
yourself to be so weak that you

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:40.310 align:middle line:90%
see all of your darkest parts.

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And you're not afraid
to feel the pain that

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:50.180 align:middle line:84%
will trigger inside of
you because it is only

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:51.800 align:middle line:84%
in the feeling,
and the allowing,

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:55.220 align:middle line:84%
and a welcoming of the
pain and the emotions

00:29:55.220 --> 00:30:02.060 align:middle line:84%
that these energies integrate
and return to the light.

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:03.215 align:middle line:90%
You can't go around it.

00:30:03.215 --> 00:30:04.340 align:middle line:90%
You can't run away from it.

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:06.050 align:middle line:90%
You can't escape it.

00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:09.650 align:middle line:90%
You must meet it.

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:12.890 align:middle line:10%
>> And this meeting of the--

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:17.720 align:middle line:10%
well, just meeting of
the fears is truly--

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:22.430 align:middle line:10%
it seems most of humanity is
being faced with this right

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:25.640 align:middle line:10%
now in many ways, is this--

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:27.800 align:middle line:10%
and I'm assuming.

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.930 align:middle line:90%
You can clarify it.

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:33.950 align:middle line:84%
But I'm assuming that
this is the process

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:37.400 align:middle line:84%
that we must go through in
order to meet these higher

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.480 align:middle line:90%
energies to--

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:42.110 align:middle line:84%
It's like you're
having childbirth,

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:44.250 align:middle line:84%
and you're going
down the birth canal.

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:46.562 align:middle line:90%
And it's a dark place.

00:30:46.562 --> 00:30:48.770 align:middle line:84%
>> But there's always light
at the end of the tunnel.

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:50.640 align:middle line:84%
>> There's always light
at the end of the tunnel.

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:51.932 align:middle line:90%
And that's where you're headed.

00:30:51.932 --> 00:30:52.735 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:30:52.735 --> 00:30:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>> You can't go back
up the birth canal.

00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>> No, that would not
be good for our moms.

00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:58.420 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:00.380 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I hate to, again, look
outside of what's now,

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:09.150 align:middle line:84%
but it's also exciting
to think about the future

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:17.330 align:middle line:84%
and in a future reality
where a lot of the suffering

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:19.700 align:middle line:90%
doesn't exist as it does now.

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:25.230 align:middle line:84%
What do we have to look
forward to, if you can share.

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:26.030 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not--

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:28.705 align:middle line:84%
>> We would call
that "escapism."

00:31:28.705 --> 00:31:30.830 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, just to look forward
to something is escap--

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:32.840 align:middle line:84%
>> We would call
that a "running away"

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:36.590 align:middle line:84%
from what is right here right
now because a part of you feels

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:38.810 align:middle line:90%
dissatisfied with it.

00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And we would ask you to ask
yourself, what part of me

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.100 align:middle line:90%
is dissatisfied?

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:49.190 align:middle line:84%
How am I not fully enjoying this
moment as perfection right now?

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:53.267 align:middle line:90%


00:31:53.267 --> 00:32:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And in doing that,
for myself, I use--

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:05.470 align:middle line:90%
I sort of have a vision of a--

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:08.650 align:middle line:84%
what some people might
call a "utopian future."

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:09.970 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:12.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Utopia does not
exist in the future.

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:14.590 align:middle line:90%
Utopia exists here and now.

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And if you allow
yourself to identify

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:20.770 align:middle line:84%
with this idea from your mind
that it exists in the future,

00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:24.310 align:middle line:84%
you will always be running to
another place in the future,

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:26.140 align:middle line:90%
which escapes from the now.

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:28.720 align:middle line:84%
Because the mind can
never be satisfied.

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:33.040 align:middle line:84%
You may notice in your own life
when the mind has an idea, when

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:37.520 align:middle line:84%
I get this relationship, when I
find a partner, I'll be happy.

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:41.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And so then it waits, and it
looks, and it finds a partner.

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:43.885 align:middle line:84%
And it is happy
for a short time.

00:32:43.885 --> 00:32:45.010 align:middle line:90%
>> For a short time, right.

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:47.915 align:middle line:84%
>> And then a new desire to
jump to the future rises.

00:32:47.915 --> 00:32:48.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's the same
pattern of the mind.

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And when you get to
your utopian future,

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:56.320 align:middle line:90%
the mind will not be satisfied.

00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:01.690 align:middle line:84%
Your satisfaction is-- your
true, true satisfaction,

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:05.980 align:middle line:84%
and bliss, and joy, and
peace is available to you

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:08.440 align:middle line:84%
right here and
right now when you

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:12.270 align:middle line:84%
allow yourself to surrender
fully to this moment,

00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:13.330 align:middle line:90%
and you become still.

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:17.440 align:middle line:90%


00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>> I resonate with that.

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:19.940 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:20.740 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:22.390 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not enough
to understand it.

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:23.348 align:middle line:90%
You must experience it.

00:33:23.348 --> 00:33:24.307 align:middle line:90%
>> You must experience.

00:33:24.307 --> 00:33:25.510 align:middle line:90%
Oh, and I-- no, I have.

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:25.870 align:middle line:90%
Trust me.

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:27.250 align:middle line:90%
I have been experiencing this--

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:28.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful.

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:34.480 align:middle line:84%
>> --a lot, the idea, the
mechanism of this looking

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:36.330 align:middle line:90%
forward to the future.

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And I understand
your perspective

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:46.840 align:middle line:84%
of escapism, but is there not
an aspect of evolution that

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:51.880 align:middle line:84%
comes through this idea as
far as striving to achieve--

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:56.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this is the
aggrandization of the ego that

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:58.990 align:middle line:84%
likes to think it
is a powerful being.

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:02.546 align:middle line:84%
I am responsible for the
evolution of humanity.

00:34:02.546 --> 00:34:04.010 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, I see.

00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:04.810 align:middle line:90%
So that--

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>> It likes to feel special.

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, so in reality--

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:10.150 align:middle line:90%
>> We would chop off its head.

00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:11.020 align:middle line:90%
Whoosh.

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:12.325 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:34:12.325 --> 00:34:13.160 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:13.960 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>> We don't mean to be
aggressive with you.

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:16.880 align:middle line:90%
We simply play.

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:17.713 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I understand.

00:34:17.713 --> 00:34:19.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's funny.

00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I never thought about
chopping the ego's head off.

00:34:23.410 --> 00:34:24.210 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>> And we also wish to clarify
then the ego is not something

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:31.030 align:middle line:90%
bad, or evil, or wrong with you.

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:34.659 align:middle line:84%
It is a natural
part of being human,

00:34:34.659 --> 00:34:36.984 align:middle line:84%
and it also serves
you in some ways.

00:34:36.984 --> 00:34:38.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:41.980 align:middle line:84%
>> So we don't wish to demonize
it and say that it's wrong

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.570 align:middle line:90%
and it must go away.

00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:45.219 align:middle line:90%
We are just joking here.

00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And we're saying this so
that you can relax and enjoy

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:51.469 align:middle line:90%
your ego for what it is.

00:34:51.469 --> 00:34:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And it only becomes
distorted or imbalanced

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:57.640 align:middle line:84%
when you're identified
with it and you believe

00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.070 align:middle line:90%
that that's what you are.

00:34:59.070 --> 00:34:59.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:00.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, thank you for clarifying.

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:04.870 align:middle line:84%
Because I think people who are
new to this information might

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:06.670 align:middle line:90%
knee-jerk reaction--

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:07.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, we felt that.

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>> --think that they
have to cut the ego--

00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:10.080 align:middle line:90%
>> No, absolutely not.

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.260 align:middle line:90%
>> --cut the ego's head off.

00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:14.050 align:middle line:84%
>> That would be to
cut a part of yourself.

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:16.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly, yes, thank you.

00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:18.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And we don't promote
violence in any way.

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:19.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:21.190 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:24.550 align:middle line:90%
So I, you know--

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:26.890 align:middle line:90%
again, I-- it's so weird.

00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:27.800 align:middle line:90%
I know the answer.

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.010 align:middle line:84%
This is-- I get is
this-- and I don't--

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:29.830 align:middle line:90%
>> That's wonderful.

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:32.180 align:middle line:84%
We're very excited to hear
this when you ask us a question

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:34.050 align:middle line:84%
and you tell us you
already know the answer.

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>> We already know the answer,
and then we throw in a "but."

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:38.682 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to say
"but," and we're-- and then

00:35:38.682 --> 00:35:40.390 align:middle line:84%
you're going to say
the same thing again.

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:42.092 align:middle line:84%
But we're still going
to go, and we're

00:35:42.092 --> 00:35:43.300 align:middle line:90%
going to beat the dead horse.

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:44.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, we enjoy this game.

00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>> We're going to--

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:46.130 align:middle line:84%
>> We enjoy to play
with you in this way.

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:47.922 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, we're going to
beat the dead horse.

00:35:47.922 --> 00:35:50.020 align:middle line:90%


00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:56.260 align:middle line:84%
I see a world of disclosure
where we're interacting

00:35:56.260 --> 00:36:01.260 align:middle line:84%
with these other beings is very
exciting, in a world where we

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:04.360 align:middle line:84%
are taking care of our
planet, which I'm doing now

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:07.060 align:middle line:84%
is to the best of my ability
with all the options I have.

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:08.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful.

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:11.060 align:middle line:84%
>> But I al-- but I
still use the word "but."

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:11.860 align:middle line:90%
And I--

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:12.550 align:middle line:90%
>> You'll grow out of it.

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>> I will.

00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:14.850 align:middle line:90%
I will.

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:18.790 align:middle line:84%
But I still can see
five steps ahead of--

00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:21.498 align:middle line:84%
I'm taking care of the earth
in the best way I can now.

00:36:21.498 --> 00:36:24.040 align:middle line:84%
But I see five steps ahead where
I can take care of the earth

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:24.840 align:middle line:90%
better.

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And other people, together,
we can recognize this.

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.830 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:30.880 align:middle line:90%
>> No, this is wonderful.

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:35.640 align:middle line:84%
This can also be a true desire
that's coming from your heart.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:38.148 align:middle line:84%
>> And we feel that,
in your case, it is.

00:36:38.148 --> 00:36:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be able to
discern if it's a true desire

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:43.490 align:middle line:84%
and longing from your heart
and a creative expression

00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:45.570 align:middle line:84%
if it's joyful for
you to do this,

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:47.710 align:middle line:84%
and you feel excited and
passionate about it--

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:47.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>> --or if it's something
that's causing you suffering

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:50.780 align:middle line:90%
and misery.

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And we feel, in your case,
it's a kind of creative drive

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.220 align:middle line:90%
and inspiration.

00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:59.645 align:middle line:84%
And it's wonderful
that you act upon that.

00:36:59.645 --> 00:37:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>> So that, in that case, that
would not be the ego then,

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:02.320 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.450 align:middle line:90%
Because I--

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:06.675 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you must be vigilant
with ego because it's very

00:37:06.675 --> 00:37:07.475 align:middle line:90%
sneaky.

00:37:07.475 --> 00:37:08.275 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:08.275 --> 00:37:10.930 align:middle line:84%
>> And it likes to
go in the back door.

00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to
remain vigilant with it.

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:15.100 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And the most important is
to check in with yourself.

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:25.540 align:middle line:84%
Is my energy focused in the
present moment right now?

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:31.690 align:middle line:84%
And in the present moment, there
is also space for excitement

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:34.030 align:middle line:90%
about what you wish to create.

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:35.710 align:middle line:84%
But you're not
identified with it,

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:37.210 align:middle line:84%
and caught up with
it, and already

00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:39.010 align:middle line:90%
there and away from here.

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:40.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:45.380 align:middle line:84%
So it's al-- so as long as we
sort of check the checklist,

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:46.180 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, check in with yourself.

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Am I aware of how it feels
in my feet right now?

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:54.220 align:middle line:84%
Am I aware of how it feels
in my hands, in my gut?

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:56.700 align:middle line:90%
How is it feeling in my body?

00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:58.480 align:middle line:90%
Are there any contractions?

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.765 align:middle line:84%
And when you bring your
attention back into the body,

00:38:00.765 --> 00:38:02.890 align:middle line:84%
many times what you'll
notice is that a part of you

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:05.240 align:middle line:84%
is tensed up, and
it's contracted.

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And when it is, your energy
is not flowing freely.

00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:09.940 align:middle line:84%
So when you become
aware of that,

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:12.760 align:middle line:84%
when you check in with
yourself-- ah, I'm tense here.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:15.320 align:middle line:90%
I have a knot in my stomach.

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:16.950 align:middle line:90%
I have a tightness in my neck--

00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:20.520 align:middle line:84%
and breathe, and invite it to
relax, your system will open.

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.760 align:middle line:84%
As your system opens and relaxes
on deeper and deeper levels,

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.440 align:middle line:84%
the energy will
flow more freely,

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:28.020 align:middle line:84%
and you'll become more
connected and aligned.

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And it will be less pushing,
and resistance, and hard work,

00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:35.570 align:middle line:90%
and more allowing.

00:38:35.570 --> 00:38:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And what you need
will flow to you.

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:39.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Great advice.

00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:40.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that was one of the
tips I was looking for being

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:49.650 align:middle line:84%
able to navigate this, these
changes in this energies,

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:54.680 align:middle line:84%
these fears that we are
facing now as humanity.

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:56.508 align:middle line:90%
>> What are you scared of?

00:38:56.508 --> 00:38:57.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Hm.

00:38:57.870 --> 00:39:01.090 align:middle line:90%
What am I scared of?

00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:04.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think part of
this download that I got,

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:09.370 align:middle line:84%
this integrity, there's
some basic survival things

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:17.200 align:middle line:84%
that I was not aware of that
I looked into because you

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:21.670 align:middle line:84%
sort of push that away
when you're in your data,

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:25.610 align:middle line:84%
like you said, staying busy,
get busy with everything else.

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:31.167 align:middle line:84%
But I still had some
survival issues of,

00:39:31.167 --> 00:39:32.500 align:middle line:90%
how am I going to pay the bills?

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:37.270 align:middle line:84%
How am I going to survive
in this structure,

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:43.295 align:middle line:84%
this social structure of making
money, and earning your keep,

00:39:43.295 --> 00:39:44.170 align:middle line:90%
and all these things?

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And I had some things
to look at in that area.

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:51.010 align:middle line:84%
But I also felt it was
much bigger than me.

00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:55.240 align:middle line:84%
There's many people on
this planet who are still

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:58.910 align:middle line:90%
facing those fears of survival.

00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:01.300 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:02.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:02.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:06.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And we would ask you
that, when these fear comes,

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.940 align:middle line:84%
to ask yourself, what is the
worst thing that can happen?

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:10.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:14.690 align:middle line:90%


00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:17.010 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what
I did, actually.

00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:19.405 align:middle line:84%
I looked up-- I looked
at that aspect of myself.

00:40:19.405 --> 00:40:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what's the
worst thing that can happen?

00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:27.240 align:middle line:90%
And I felt safe.

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:29.680 align:middle line:90%
I felt that this--

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:32.760 align:middle line:84%
in every moment up
until my life now,

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.570 align:middle line:90%
I've always been taken care of.

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:39.300 align:middle line:84%
I've always had everything
I've needed in the moment.

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:41.940 align:middle line:90%
And I sort of used that.

00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:46.050 align:middle line:84%
I've used my life
experiences as an example

00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:52.770 align:middle line:84%
to release that energy, release
that fear because it was just,

00:40:52.770 --> 00:40:57.070 align:middle line:84%
again, sort of an
illusion, sort of an idea,

00:40:57.070 --> 00:40:59.310 align:middle line:90%
a concept that had been lurking.

00:40:59.310 --> 00:41:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful, wonderful.

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:04.110 align:middle line:84%
Many of you, you're
afraid of your own fears.

00:41:04.110 --> 00:41:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And when you get
friendly with your fears,

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:11.080 align:middle line:84%
and you start to make your
relationship with them,

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:13.020 align:middle line:84%
and you don't run
away from them,

00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:17.790 align:middle line:84%
or try to avoid them,
or not face them,

00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:20.280 align:middle line:84%
when you find the
courage to face them,

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:23.640 align:middle line:84%
what you will discover is that
these big monsters and demons

00:49:56.810 --> 00:50:09.510 align:middle line:84%
Notice how it feels
inside the hands,

00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:18.380 align:middle line:84%
inside the abdomen,
the chest, the throat.

00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:29.440 align:middle line:90%


00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:34.120 align:middle line:84%
If any thoughts arise,
just noticed them.

00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:37.110 align:middle line:90%
Don't try to stop the thoughts.

00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:38.580 align:middle line:90%
Allow the thoughts to be there.

00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:41.674 align:middle line:90%


00:50:41.674 --> 00:50:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And turn your attention to that
which is aware of the thoughts.

00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:59.260 align:middle line:84%
Inquire into the nature
of that which is aware,

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:02.600 align:middle line:90%
a pure awareness in which--

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:07.145 align:middle line:84%
the space in which the
thoughts are arising.

00:51:07.145 --> 00:51:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And what you'll find is that
that awareness is a sense

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:17.435 align:middle line:90%
of wholeness, completeness.

00:51:17.435 --> 00:51:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And there's a deep
sense of peace

00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:24.230 align:middle line:84%
as you gently relax
and open to that.

00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:28.750 align:middle line:90%


00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:31.825 align:middle line:84%
It has no name, no form,
no shape, no sides.

00:51:31.825 --> 00:51:36.553 align:middle line:90%


00:51:36.553 --> 00:51:38.350 align:middle line:90%
It just is.

00:51:38.350 --> 00:51:40.970 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't need anything.

00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:42.280 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't want anything.

00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:50.510 align:middle line:90%


00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:55.718 align:middle line:84%
Keep your attention as
that, just feeling "I am."

00:51:55.718 --> 00:52:00.866 align:middle line:90%


00:52:00.866 --> 00:52:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And notice how it
feels in the body.

00:52:05.410 --> 00:52:07.810 align:middle line:84%
If you notice any
sensations in the body

00:52:07.810 --> 00:52:12.190 align:middle line:84%
that might be
interpreted as emotions--

00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:19.000 align:middle line:84%
it could be boredom,
agitation, sadness, heaviness--

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.160 align:middle line:90%


00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:27.980 align:middle line:84%
whatever is felt, take away
the mental interpretation

00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:33.675 align:middle line:90%
and the label of the experience.

00:52:33.675 --> 00:52:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And simply meet the
sensations as they

00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:42.250 align:middle line:84%
are without trying
to change anything,

00:52:42.250 --> 00:52:45.700 align:middle line:84%
without trying to get
rid of any sensations,

00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:50.110 align:middle line:84%
without trying to
become anything,

00:52:50.110 --> 00:52:54.340 align:middle line:84%
without expecting anything
from this moment, just a very

00:52:54.340 --> 00:53:00.870 align:middle line:84%
gentle letting go, and
letting go, and letting go,

00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:03.780 align:middle line:90%
and dropping into being.

00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:12.440 align:middle line:90%


00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:17.200 align:middle line:84%
If there is a sensation
somewhere in the body,

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:22.690 align:middle line:84%
you might experience it
like you are a subject,

00:53:22.690 --> 00:53:24.655 align:middle line:90%
and the sensation is the object.

00:53:24.655 --> 00:53:30.410 align:middle line:90%


00:53:30.410 --> 00:53:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And you can move closer
to it by dropping into it

00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:40.370 align:middle line:84%
so fully that you become
one with the sensation,

00:53:40.370 --> 00:53:45.650 align:middle line:84%
by opening to feeling what is
here so fully that there's no

00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:49.600 align:middle line:90%
longer a subject and an object.

00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:52.890 align:middle line:90%
There is only feeling, being.

00:53:52.890 --> 00:53:54.455 align:middle line:84%
There is only this
present moment.

00:53:54.455 --> 00:54:10.520 align:middle line:90%


00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Many times, the mind will
try to jump in with some form

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:20.398 align:middle line:90%
of resistance to this.

00:54:20.398 --> 00:54:23.870 align:middle line:90%
And that's OK.

00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:27.360 align:middle line:84%
If there is resistance
in the form of thoughts

00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:31.100 align:middle line:84%
or in the form of not
wanting to feel anything,

00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:34.610 align:middle line:84%
just notice that, and include
that also in your experience.

00:54:34.610 --> 00:54:41.550 align:middle line:90%


00:54:41.550 --> 00:54:43.980 align:middle line:90%
Nothing to change.

00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:46.270 align:middle line:90%
Nowhere to get to.

00:54:46.270 --> 00:54:47.610 align:middle line:90%
Nothing to become.

00:54:47.610 --> 00:54:51.210 align:middle line:90%


00:54:51.210 --> 00:54:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Fully embrace the perfection
of this moment, here and now.

00:54:57.970 --> 00:55:02.980 align:middle line:90%


00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:05.300 align:middle line:84%
Align fully with
this experience.

00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Say "yes" fully to
this experience.

00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:18.210 align:middle line:90%


00:55:18.210 --> 00:55:20.630 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
brings suffering

00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:26.300 align:middle line:84%
is when we argue with
the reality of what is,

00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:31.220 align:middle line:84%
when we have an idea of how
our experience of this moment

00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:33.820 align:middle line:84%
should be, and that idea
is different from how

00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:35.910 align:middle line:90%
this moment actually is.

00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:41.240 align:middle line:84%
So if we let go of this
idea and fully accept

00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:48.910 align:middle line:84%
whatever is here right
now, we like what is here.

00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:53.790 align:middle line:84%
We love what is here, and we're
grateful for what is here.

00:55:53.790 --> 00:55:55.840 align:middle line:90%
Then every moment is a blessing.

00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:58.560 align:middle line:84%
Every moment is a
gift to be enjoyed.

00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:10.020 align:middle line:90%


00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:14.810 align:middle line:84%
We can enjoy sounds which
the mind might interpret

00:56:14.810 --> 00:56:21.600 align:middle line:84%
or label as unpleasant because
there's no judgment of them.

00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:28.110 align:middle line:90%


00:56:28.110 --> 00:56:30.960 align:middle line:84%
There's just a
pure experiencing.

00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:45.250 align:middle line:90%


00:56:45.250 --> 00:56:53.730 align:middle line:84%
When we can experience
ourselves as this

00:56:53.730 --> 00:56:57.640 align:middle line:84%
"I am," this
beingness, we can be

00:56:57.640 --> 00:57:01.570 align:middle line:84%
one with the present moment
in every moment of our life,

00:57:01.570 --> 00:57:04.780 align:middle line:84%
and our whole life can
become a meditation.

00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:09.600 align:middle line:90%


00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:14.240 align:middle line:84%
So if you very
gently open your eyes

00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:16.800 align:middle line:84%
and you keep your
attention in the body,

00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:22.930 align:middle line:84%
you keep noticing the
movement of the breath,

00:57:22.930 --> 00:57:30.670 align:middle line:84%
keep noticing the sensation of
your feet touching the grass,

00:57:30.670 --> 00:57:35.950 align:middle line:84%
even when you stand up,
when you go to get a drink,

00:57:35.950 --> 00:57:39.640 align:middle line:84%
the meditation
continues because you're

00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:43.930 align:middle line:84%
connected within to this
deeper space of being.

00:57:43.930 --> 00:57:46.610 align:middle line:90%


00:57:46.610 --> 00:57:50.420 align:middle line:90%

00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:51.228 align:middle line:90%
