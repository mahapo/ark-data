00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.910 align:middle line:84%
>> My whole life since birth was
a spiritual experience and very

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.870 align:middle line:84%
difficult, because it wasn't
accepted by other people.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.240 align:middle line:84%
And making friends
was hard as a child.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And the nightmares, and the
visions, and feeling things,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.620 align:middle line:84%
and not knowing who to talk
to, what to talk about,

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.810 align:middle line:84%
what was right,
what was wrong, it's

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.450 align:middle line:84%
really hard because
here you are this kid

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.730 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying to gauge
what an adult's going

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.970 align:middle line:84%
to react to these things
that are happening to you

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.630 align:middle line:84%
but you can't tell them
what's happening to you.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.903 align:middle line:84%
And you're the kid leading
the adult in the conversation.

00:01:11.903 --> 00:01:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And then when they shut
you down, you're like,

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.580 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm not going to
get any answers here.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.955 align:middle line:84%
So then you just accept what
they say and be respectful.

00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:20.755 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:01:20.755 --> 00:01:22.695 align:middle line:90%

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean you get used
to it after a while,

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.430 align:middle line:84%
and it shows up in different
forms, different ways,

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.500 align:middle line:90%
different feelings.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.980 align:middle line:90%
It's just a continuous journey.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.320 align:middle line:90%
It never shuts off.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.760 align:middle line:90%
And you don't ask for it.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.410 align:middle line:90%
It just, here it is.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And right now, in my evolution
of my spirituality and growth,

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.500 align:middle line:84%
going from the scared
kid up until today,

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm really learning how to work
with it and explore it more.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'm coming up with my
own concepts and my own ideas

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.309 align:middle line:90%
on what things feel like.

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:18.670 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.710 align:middle line:84%
It's all about how things make
you feel, what you're seeing,

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.630 align:middle line:90%
getting past the fear point.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.820 align:middle line:84%
You really have to put a
block on the fear point,

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.970 align:middle line:84%
and go, OK, what's
really happening here?

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.240 align:middle line:84%
The fear is coming from me, but
there's a situation happening,

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.260 align:middle line:84%
what's happening in the
situation, and deploy your fear

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.870 align:middle line:84%
and your self back, and
then to look at things,

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.600 align:middle line:84%
and then that's when
the information really

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.770 align:middle line:90%
starts pouring in.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.550 align:middle line:90%


00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.430 align:middle line:90%
Get hypnotized.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.640 align:middle line:90%
You have this experience.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.710 align:middle line:90%
There's no coming back out.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.390 align:middle line:90%
There's no undoing it.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.970 align:middle line:90%


00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.820 align:middle line:84%
I do feel like they
have been building me up

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.465 align:middle line:84%
for this moment, my
whole existence, so far.

00:03:07.465 --> 00:03:27.260 align:middle line:90%


00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>> From this other perspective,
this other dimensions,

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.760 align:middle line:90%
you mentioned angels.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.880 align:middle line:84%
I've always thought
that they're, angels,

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.830 align:middle line:84%
are sort of the glue
that connects some

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.150 align:middle line:84%
of these dimensions, these glue,
meaning the in-between space,

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, it's one
way to term it.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.210 align:middle line:84%
Are you part of that
in-between space?

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.010 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.660 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.120 align:middle line:84%
You're from another
dimension in itself?

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Entire.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And the term human resonance,
the planetary vibrational--

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Around Earth.

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Around Earth, yes.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.130 align:middle line:90%
The--

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it has a heartbeat.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.470 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's shifting now?

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.810 align:middle line:84%
These cylinders, are they
helping with the shift?

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:26.520 align:middle line:84%
>> The cylinders were shown to
represent that each soul has

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.820 align:middle line:90%
its own creation point.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.700 align:middle line:90%
It was referenced.

on the planet--

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.570 align:middle line:84%

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:05.260 align:middle line:84%
>> What can we do to
increase their capabilities?

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.450 align:middle line:84%
>> The humans must
wake up and remember.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.330 align:middle line:84%
>> So as we were just
speaking about the pyramids,

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.740 align:middle line:84%
we're also curious about
the crystal skulls.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.890 align:middle line:84%
As you know, we've got
the Mitchell-Hedges skull

and his caretaker
here with us today.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.730 align:middle line:84%
Can you share with
us any information

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.390 align:middle line:84%
that you understand about
this crystal skulls?

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.290 align:middle line:90%
>> What would you like to know?

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Do they have a similar
function as the pyramids?

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.890 align:middle line:90%
Or does it work differently?

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes and no.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.370 align:middle line:90%
>> What are the similarities?

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.840 align:middle line:90%
>> The pyramids do not move.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:28.930 align:middle line:84%
The skull is an implementation
of the pyramid energies

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:36.010 align:middle line:84%
in the different places in a
condensed form in a material

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:44.890 align:middle line:84%
that contains information
that can travel and affect

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:53.768 align:middle line:84%
humans in many places,
like a traveling pyramid.

00:06:53.768 --> 00:06:55.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Especially if it's got
a named Bill behind it.

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, pure heart.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.210 align:middle line:90%
>> The-- so it's a similar--

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:05.560 align:middle line:90%
it does a similar technology.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.435 align:middle line:90%
It's an inactivation.

00:07:06.435 --> 00:07:09.140 align:middle line:90%
>>And more.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.000 align:middle line:90%
>> And more how?

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.150 align:middle line:84%
>> It will be unlocked
more and more.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:22.594 align:middle line:84%
You are only in the
beginning of exploration.

00:07:22.594 --> 00:07:25.530 align:middle line:90%


00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:28.620 align:middle line:84%
>> When it's unlocked, then what
will we know that we don't know

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.968 align:middle line:90%
now?

00:07:30.968 --> 00:07:32.010 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a trick question.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:32.810 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:38.227 align:middle line:90%


00:07:38.227 --> 00:07:40.060 align:middle line:84%
We want Beverly just
to be comfortable here.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.050 align:middle line:90%
>> More like--

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Just keep--

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>> --other ancient to float
like the ancients that were

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.300 align:middle line:90%
advanced.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:57.570 align:middle line:84%
The humans have forgot, and
the info has been destroyed.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:03.960 align:middle line:90%


00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:08.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And we just want Beverly
to be in a comfortable state,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.900 align:middle line:84%
keeping the energy at a
comfortable level for her body.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Trying.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Doing a great job, just want
her to be comfortable while all

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:20.640 align:middle line:84%
this amazing information
is coming through.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.800 align:middle line:90%
We're appreciative.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:28.420 align:middle line:90%


00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.790 align:middle line:84%
So the skull that
is with us today,

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:33.799 align:middle line:90%
what information does it hold?

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:34.599 align:middle line:90%
>> The key.

00:08:34.599 --> 00:08:37.550 align:middle line:90%


00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:38.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell us more.

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:41.010 align:middle line:90%


00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:46.350 align:middle line:84%
>> It needs to meet with
the others to unlock

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:52.860 align:middle line:84%
their energetic vibrational
qualities that they are tied

00:08:52.860 --> 00:09:02.320 align:middle line:84%
to to enhance the vibrational
qualities of the humans.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>> It sounds like
we've got a mission.

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:05.710 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not impossible.

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:06.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Not impossible.

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:07.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Not impossible.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:08.030 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:10.890 align:middle line:90%


00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Can we activate the
pyramids with the skulls?

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes,

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:19.960 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, does each school have
a specific pyramid it needs

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.470 align:middle line:84%
to resonate with, or do they all
work together in the same way?

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:28.270 align:middle line:84%
>> When they meet,
they exchange.

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:29.485 align:middle line:90%
>> So we can mix and match.

00:09:29.485 --> 00:09:32.240 align:middle line:90%


00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.245 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes and no.

00:09:33.245 --> 00:09:36.650 align:middle line:90%


00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>> The skull before us that
was found in the pyramid

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:47.630 align:middle line:84%
in what's now known as Belize,
what's the significance of that

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:54.650 align:middle line:84%
structure and that
technology, that archetype?

00:09:54.650 --> 00:10:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Growing, lush greenery for
humans to sustain their life

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:09.080 align:middle line:84%
in a vibrational form that
their bodies does not yet know.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you explain that
a little more, please?

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:18.230 align:middle line:84%
>> The energy goes into the
human and then the human can

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:22.130 align:middle line:90%
use the energy in the growth.

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:26.120 align:middle line:90%
That skull must be present.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:42.240 align:middle line:84%
It comes out trying to explain,
like code, code in the plants.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Code in the plants.

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.210 align:middle line:90%
The DNA?

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:47.790 align:middle line:90%
The DNA of the plants?

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:48.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Light codes.

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:54.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Light codes, up from Earth,
will be ignited with the skull.

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:58.980 align:middle line:84%
The skull pulls the new
light codes up, pull up.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:03.890 align:middle line:90%


00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:07.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Can we use the
Mitchell-Hedges skull to help

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:09.200 align:middle line:90%
us find the other skulls?

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:11.750 align:middle line:90%
>> They're connected?

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:13.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:18.180 align:middle line:90%
They want to attract each other.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And so how do how
does one do that,

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:25.040 align:middle line:84%
attract the skulls that
haven't been found yet?

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:29.780 align:middle line:84%
They must be in
vibrational high frequency

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:34.630 align:middle line:90%
to listen to the guidance.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:38.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And so how does somebody
like Bill who's the caretaker

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.710 align:middle line:90%
of the Mitchell-Hedges skull--

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:42.630 align:middle line:90%
what's his part with that?

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>> He is woring on it in his
inner work that he is doing.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:57.390 align:middle line:84%
It is trying to show
him, like a map.

00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:00.090 align:middle line:90%


00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:03.770 align:middle line:84%
>> So can you describe
what that map is like?

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:06.560 align:middle line:90%
>> He only knows.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.360 align:middle line:90%
That is his path.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.530 align:middle line:90%


00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:13.310 align:middle line:90%
>> The

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:16.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Bill has a question.

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:17.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.120 align:middle line:90%
Bill has a question.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.950 align:middle line:90%
Is it OK if Bill ask a question?

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:22.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.330 align:middle line:10%
>> Working with the
Mitchell-Hedges skull,

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:28.510 align:middle line:10%
I connect with the
skulls wherever

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:32.470 align:middle line:10%
they're at because that's the
way it was used way in the past

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:37.360 align:middle line:10%
and I can feel the energy
coming together when I send that

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.890 align:middle line:10%
energy out.

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:40.180 align:middle line:10%
I can bring it back.

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:41.440 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:45.310 align:middle line:10%
>> And with this, it
brings, it can help raise

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:47.560 align:middle line:10%
the consciousness of the planet.

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Humanity.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.870 align:middle line:90%
You pull from the others in.

00:12:54.870 --> 00:13:02.780 align:middle line:10%
You feel it, strong
vibrational, energetic lines

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:08.840 align:middle line:10%
coming towards the soul and your
inner work that you have begun.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:16.120 align:middle line:84%
It has come through
you and out of you.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>> So is Bill sort of like
a portal in that regard?

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.930 align:middle line:90%


00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:26.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes and no, can do it.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Can do it, OK.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:37.770 align:middle line:84%
His body and soul was made
in the vibrational likeness

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:46.380 align:middle line:84%
to accept those energy
frequencies to emit out of him.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:49.230 align:middle line:10%
>> I was wondering about the 26.

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:51.180 align:middle line:10%
And that's something to
me, it seems like it's

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:54.420 align:middle line:10%
13 and 13 are the two.

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.280 align:middle line:10%
And the 13 number
comes up a lot.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Male and female, yes.

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:01.060 align:middle line:10%


00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:04.930 align:middle line:10%
>> I was wondering how that
works, the 13 and the 13?

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:07.630 align:middle line:90%


00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:10.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Male and female.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:20.530 align:middle line:84%
13 molecules were implenmented
into creation and in souls.

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Does that mean
there's 26 skulls?

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:25.430 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:26.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Just 13 that can--

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>> The balance of masculine
and feminine are needed

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:36.720 align:middle line:90%
for the energetic balance.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.520 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.040 align:middle line:84%
So each skull contains both
masculine and feminine.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Right,

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:47.110 align:middle line:90%
>> It is all energy.

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:49.135 align:middle line:90%
Those are human words.

00:14:49.135 --> 00:14:51.670 align:middle line:90%


00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:53.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Energy vibration frequency.

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:59.860 align:middle line:90%


00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:02.530 align:middle line:84%
In the past sessions,
there was talk

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:10.060 align:middle line:84%
about an overlay, another
world that we're coming

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:15.220 align:middle line:90%
into harmony with or coherence.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:17.710 align:middle line:90%
How is that going now?

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:23.440 align:middle line:84%
How is this coherent
connection happening?

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:30.400 align:middle line:84%
>> We are waiting for humans
to decide their timeline

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.810 align:middle line:90%
for the overlay.

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Last time, you said that you
were making some advancements

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:39.960 align:middle line:84%
with the overlay coming close
and that we were experiencing

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.830 align:middle line:90%
that as glitches.

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:42.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:43.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that still happening?

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:44.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:46.680 align:middle line:90%
>> And since we--

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:51.810 align:middle line:84%
>> It needs to be
ready when it is ready.

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:54.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So are we closer
to being ready?

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:57.150 align:middle line:90%


00:15:57.150 --> 00:16:03.480 align:middle line:84%
>> We are hitting
one way or the other.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:09.040 align:middle line:84%
The humans must decide
if they want to repeat.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>> So the fork in the
road is not yet decided?

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.430 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:19.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Can it be decided for some
of us and not for others?

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>> That happens when the
soul leaves the cylinder.

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:26.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Why would the soul
leave the cylinder?

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:32.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Then the ascension process
for the ones that leave them

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:36.085 align:middle line:90%
before overlay.

00:16:36.085 --> 00:16:39.747 align:middle line:90%


00:16:39.747 --> 00:16:41.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that why we have so
many people leaving now?

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:47.080 align:middle line:90%


00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>> No, contracts are up.

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:58.270 align:middle line:84%
Some do not want this
experience heavy burden.

00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:06.700 align:middle line:90%


00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Just help Beverly with
the energies here so that

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.234 align:middle line:84%
she's in a calm and
comfortable position, please.

00:17:12.234 --> 00:17:17.869 align:middle line:90%


00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:23.022 align:middle line:84%
So the overlay, if I
understood, it was going to be--

00:17:23.022 --> 00:17:24.730 align:middle line:84%
once it was placed,
it was more like what

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:28.240 align:middle line:84%
we're calling the new Earth,
the higher vibrational Earth.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:38.700 align:middle line:84%
The overlay will happen
when it implements.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.370 align:middle line:90%


00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:48.180 align:middle line:84%
There will be two
existences of humans

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:54.970 align:middle line:84%
at the same time for a
period of Earth time,

00:17:54.970 --> 00:18:01.180 align:middle line:84%
and eventually, the
overlay will separate,

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:06.550 align:middle line:84%
taking the likeness
vibrational souls with it,

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:13.180 align:middle line:84%
creating separation, but keeping
close enough for a balance

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:16.915 align:middle line:84%
in the dimension that
the humans choose.

00:18:16.915 --> 00:18:19.800 align:middle line:90%


00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:27.240 align:middle line:84%
>> How do emotions
create energy?

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.294 align:middle line:90%
>> The vibration.

00:18:28.294 --> 00:18:32.560 align:middle line:90%


00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>> How can emotions
disrupt energy?

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.880 align:middle line:90%
Same, vibration?

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Like attracts like.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:45.170 align:middle line:84%
>> So what tools can we give
other humans listening to this

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:51.580 align:middle line:90%
to create a positive experience?

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:57.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Go more and ask
more questions.

00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:05.270 align:middle line:84%
Wonder about the emotional state
they are living and emotions

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:08.000 align:middle line:90%
that are not coming from them.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.140 align:middle line:90%


00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.930 align:middle line:84%
>> You mean to question the
emotions that aren't coming

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:15.220 align:middle line:90%
from them, in a sense?

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:20.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, to change the
vibrational qualities around

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:24.160 align:middle line:90%
them in their cylinder.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:28.370 align:middle line:90%
One emotion will stay in there.

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>> So in a sense, becoming
aware of others' emotions,

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:39.100 align:middle line:84%
their own emotions, and
making the choice to emote.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:42.960 align:middle line:90%


00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:46.350 align:middle line:90%
>> In a likeness.

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:49.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you feel emotion?

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:55.575 align:middle line:84%
>> In this body,
not in my existence.

00:19:55.575 --> 00:19:58.080 align:middle line:90%


00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>> So what is it like for you
to feel Beverly's emotion?

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:04.757 align:middle line:90%


00:20:04.757 --> 00:20:10.215 align:middle line:84%
>> Difficult. This
body is super--

00:20:10.215 --> 00:20:13.780 align:middle line:90%


00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:15.130 align:middle line:90%
feels everything.

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:19.250 align:middle line:90%


00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:22.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Very sensitive?

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:23.452 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:23.452 --> 00:20:27.610 align:middle line:90%


00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:33.100 align:middle line:84%
We needed it to be
this way to implement

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:40.000 align:middle line:84%
her molecular likeness that was
implemented at creation point.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.930 align:middle line:90%


00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:46.230 align:middle line:84%
>> You had mentioned that
you had begun a new existence

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:48.540 align:middle line:90%
for the organic souls.

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:50.880 align:middle line:84%
Could you please give
me a definition of what

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.340 align:middle line:90%
you mean by organic souls?

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Connecting with
their true in-ness.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:02.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And this goes in cooperation
with using less technology,

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:04.470 align:middle line:84%
so we can develop those
parts of ourselves?

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:05.790 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>> These souls have more
technology than technology

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:17.820 align:middle line:84%
in them if they
choose to wake it up.

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:22.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And what would be the best
way for them to wake that up?

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Remember, less
distractions ease flow.

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And so the organic souls
are different from the regular

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.470 align:middle line:90%
souls?

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:42.180 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, there are different
vibrational-colored souls.

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So those that aren't of the
organic nature, they, though,

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:59.640 align:middle line:84%
can also awaken
themselves to their gifts

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.750 align:middle line:90%
and their knowledge?

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:02.025 align:middle line:90%
>> If they choose.

00:22:02.025 --> 00:22:05.160 align:middle line:90%


00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:09.560 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's also a free will
issue as well as something

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:13.610 align:middle line:84%
that's planned within
their molecular structure?

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Their vibrational
qualities can be chosen.

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:25.970 align:middle line:84%
The humans have a hard
time choosing differently

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:28.880 align:middle line:90%
because they are not aware.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:35.570 align:middle line:90%


00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what we're doing here
and shows like what we're doing

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:41.270 align:middle line:84%
is helping bring that
awareness through.

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:43.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>> So when this idea of doing
a session with you through

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Beverly in this capacity that
we are today became a reality,

00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:01.300 align:middle line:84%
what were your
thoughts about it?

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:04.730 align:middle line:90%
>> It is time in your planet.

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:08.130 align:middle line:90%


00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:13.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So you had shared with us in
the first session that we are

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:17.270 align:middle line:90%
in a reality simulation.

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:18.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:23.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you again give us your
understanding of that, please?

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:25.235 align:middle line:90%
>> None is real.

00:23:25.235 --> 00:23:28.180 align:middle line:90%


00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Like a hologram?

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:middle line:90%
>> In a sense.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.450 align:middle line:90%


00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:36.250 align:middle line:90%
>> So then--

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:39.270 align:middle line:90%
>> We have shown her.

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:40.800 align:middle line:90%
>> You have shown her this?

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:44.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Does she understand it?

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:45.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:46.630 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:53.880 align:middle line:84%
So my question then, are you
living in a reality simulation?

00:23:53.880 --> 00:24:04.970 align:middle line:84%
>> In a sense of my existence,
there has to be some form

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:07.340 align:middle line:90%
to contain.

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:11.710 align:middle line:90%
>> And so who created you?

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:13.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Creator.

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:15.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Who created creator?

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:17.506 align:middle line:90%
>> Creator.

00:24:17.506 --> 00:24:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Good question.

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:21.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I like it.

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And we are all a
piece of this creator?

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:28.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:30.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Helping to create?

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:32.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Collectively
and individually?

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:36.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.270 align:middle line:90%


00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:45.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Is the designer, this
label we're giving you--

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:51.950 align:middle line:84%
is the designer a
collective or an individual?

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:53.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Individual.

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:57.350 align:middle line:90%


00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:58.778 align:middle line:90%
There are others.

00:24:58.778 --> 00:25:01.406 align:middle line:90%


00:25:01.406 --> 00:25:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Other designers?

00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:04.783 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:04.783 --> 00:25:05.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Do they have names?

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:08.230 align:middle line:90%


00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:11.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Not in this form.

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you chose to
call yourself the designer,

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:19.440 align:middle line:84%
how did you come up
with that human word?

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:20.240 align:middle line:90%
>> The humans.

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:25.290 align:middle line:90%


00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:26.910 align:middle line:84%
>> The humans came
up with the word.

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:29.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:30.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Are you aware--

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:35.896 align:middle line:84%
>> Closest to your
understanding.

00:25:35.896 --> 00:25:38.880 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, same as the engineers.

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:39.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.690 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Are you aware of something
we call the Akashic Records

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.390 align:middle line:84%
or a database of
all experiences?

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:50.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:53.090 align:middle line:90%
It is existing around you now.

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:53.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:55.480 align:middle line:90%
Can you explain that more?

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:58.360 align:middle line:90%
>> It is always here.

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.845 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's a library of sorts?

00:26:01.845 --> 00:26:02.645 align:middle line:90%
>> Your words.

00:26:02.645 --> 00:26:05.942 align:middle line:90%


00:26:05.942 --> 00:26:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Collects all information
in all dimensions

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:19.560 align:middle line:84%
and exists in all dimensions
except at creator point.

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Why would it not
exist at creator point?

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:23.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Create.

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:26.226 align:middle line:90%


00:26:26.226 --> 00:26:28.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Create.

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:29.540 align:middle line:90%
>> And so--

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I see, because
creator's constantly creating,

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:35.340 align:middle line:84%
and it is a record of what
has already been created.

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:36.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:38.500 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.960 align:middle line:84%
So it can't contain
that frequency.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:44.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Something that is not yet.

00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:46.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:49.180 align:middle line:84%
When we have ideas
and inspiration,

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:50.350 align:middle line:90%
as discussed earlier--

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:53.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Engineer implementation.

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:56.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Those are
already-created ideas.

00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:57.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:59.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Already existing in
another dimensional realm.

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:02.957 align:middle line:84%
>> And we're simply bringing
those through into this

00:27:02.957 --> 00:27:04.120 align:middle line:90%
reality.

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Energetic likeness vibration
attachment into the cylinder

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:16.330 align:middle line:90%
that soul is vibrating with it.

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:21.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Waveguides for
that vibration.

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:25.601 align:middle line:90%
>> In a sense, draw in.

00:27:25.601 --> 00:27:34.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Mm-hmm, and all of this
collective energy is affecting

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:38.880 align:middle line:84%
the current heartbeat, Schumann
resonance of the planet?

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:47.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And inside the Earth's
bubble, reflecting itself,

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:51.028 align:middle line:84%
we're bouncing off
these vibrations,

00:27:51.028 --> 00:27:53.320 align:middle line:84%
and that's what gives us the
harmonics for the Schumann

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:56.100 align:middle line:90%
resonance?

00:27:56.100 --> 00:28:06.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, two separate collective
has one vibration affecting it,

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:11.870 align:middle line:84%
and then the Earth has its
vibration and together affects

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:17.600 align:middle line:84%
the entire
outside-of-Earth vibration.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:24.500 align:middle line:84%
>> How about space, waves
from our central sun,

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:27.020 align:middle line:90%
the central galaxy?

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:29.090 align:middle line:84%
There's terms called
the photon belt

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:31.610 align:middle line:84%
and other things that
are hitting the Earth.

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:34.780 align:middle line:90%
Are those affecting us as well?

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:36.894 align:middle line:90%
>> All affects all.

00:28:36.894 --> 00:28:49.450 align:middle line:84%
All is connected like one dot
to another dot to another dot.

00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:51.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Nodal points.

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:54.670 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned in the
past about the flash.

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:56.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Has that happened yet?

00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:59.120 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.535 align:middle line:84%
>> When it happens, will
we all know it or just--

00:29:01.535 --> 00:29:02.335 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:29:02.335 --> 00:29:04.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Everyone on the planet.

00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:05.216 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:29:05.216 --> 00:29:08.870 align:middle line:90%


00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:15.920 align:middle line:84%
>> What is delaying it, or why
hasn't it not happened yet?

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Humans are deciding, shift
up in your sense or to repeat.

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:30.340 align:middle line:90%


00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:33.850 align:middle line:84%
>> But you're saying that
some may decide to repeat,

00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:36.460 align:middle line:90%
and some may decide to shift up?

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:40.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, that is what
the overlay is for.

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.850 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, and you said that
would happen for a while.

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:44.890 align:middle line:90%
Were there two--

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Existence is in the
same but different.

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Are we close to that point?

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.375 align:middle line:90%
>> Not yet.

00:29:52.375 --> 00:29:55.360 align:middle line:90%


00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:59.680 align:middle line:90%
There is much going to happen.

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:01.430 align:middle line:90%
Be prepared.

00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:05.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And so please share
with us about that.

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>> There will be much emotions
affecting humans for a time,

00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:18.970 align:middle line:84%
like a resurface of all the old
energies coming up to make sure

00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:22.370 align:middle line:84%
that we are done with
these karmic overlays.

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:26.010 align:middle line:90%


00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:29.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And how will that be
experienced by humans?

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Fear.

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:37.330 align:middle line:84%
They will fear that
it is happening again.

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:43.360 align:middle line:84%
If the collective falls too much
into any one of these fears,

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.785 align:middle line:90%
it will take place.

00:30:44.785 --> 00:30:50.560 align:middle line:90%


00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>> But on the other end,
if those that are awake

00:30:54.660 --> 00:31:00.090 align:middle line:84%
and awakening can focus not
on fear but on love and higher

00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:03.360 align:middle line:84%
vibrational thought,
what does that do?

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Then the others that
are going into fear--

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.950 align:middle line:90%
it just holds a balance.

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:12.630 align:middle line:90%


00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:15.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So maybe they won't go as
deep into the fear because some

00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:16.650 align:middle line:90%
of us are--

00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:18.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Beholding light.

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:20.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So how is the Earth doing
with holding its light right

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:27.330 align:middle line:84%
now and the
inhabitants of Earth?

00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>> The Earth is going to
wake up with much changes.

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:41.980 align:middle line:84%
It has its karmic
energies to expel, also.

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:45.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And how will
those be expressed?

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:52.670 align:middle line:84%
>> In human form, continental
things, weather patterns,

00:31:52.670 --> 00:32:01.540 align:middle line:84%
volcanic storms, things of that
nature, all earthly resonance.

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:06.790 align:middle line:90%


00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>> I imagine we have
time to prepare.

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:14.825 align:middle line:90%
The ones waking up will feel.

00:32:14.825 --> 00:32:17.330 align:middle line:90%


00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:19.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Bill has a question.

00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:25.010 align:middle line:10%
>> What job can I do with the
skull to help bring them this

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:27.890 align:middle line:10%
love and light into the
world and bring this higher

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:29.120 align:middle line:10%
consciousness?

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.440 align:middle line:10%
How can we do this?

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:38.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Though the connect with
more of those energy minds.

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:44.120 align:middle line:90%
Pull as much to it.

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:50.330 align:middle line:90%
Take that big energy in you.

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:57.425 align:middle line:84%
Push out in all
directions in your inner--

00:32:57.425 --> 00:33:02.960 align:middle line:90%


00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.775 align:middle line:90%
trying to find word--

00:33:04.775 --> 00:33:07.886 align:middle line:90%


00:33:07.886 --> 00:33:12.275 align:middle line:90%
spiritual deepness, inner work.

00:33:12.275 --> 00:33:20.720 align:middle line:90%


00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.060 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm on this path
to do this now.

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:26.240 align:middle line:10%
Is my path straight and
right, or is there more

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.770 align:middle line:10%
that I must do?

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:28.832 align:middle line:90%
>> More.

00:33:28.832 --> 00:33:31.430 align:middle line:90%


00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:34.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Can you tell me what would be
the best for me to do to really

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:37.220 align:middle line:10%
do more work and better work?

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:39.780 align:middle line:90%
>> You will travel.

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:46.310 align:middle line:84%
There will be more Indigenous
cultures to awaken.

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:53.717 align:middle line:90%


00:33:53.717 --> 00:33:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And these projects that we're
working on-- we can help with

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:56.750 align:middle line:90%
this?

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:57.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:33:57.550 --> 00:33:59.883 align:middle line:90%


00:33:59.883 --> 00:34:01.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Sounds like an adventure.

00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:02.751 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:34:02.751 --> 00:34:03.735 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it does.

00:34:03.735 --> 00:34:07.425 align:middle line:90%


00:34:07.425 --> 00:34:09.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you probably
have always been aware,

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.592 align:middle line:84%
but when you became aware
that we were going to do this

00:34:11.592 --> 00:34:20.090 align:middle line:84%
session today, what was
your hope that came through

00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:21.199 align:middle line:90%
the information today?

00:34:21.199 --> 00:34:24.353 align:middle line:90%
What was most important for you?

00:34:24.353 --> 00:34:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Light.

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:30.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And how does Beverly,
in her physical body,

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:35.980 align:middle line:84%
acclimate to that light and all
of this energy in her highest

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:36.820 align:middle line:90%
and best way?

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:39.380 align:middle line:90%


00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:41.540 align:middle line:90%
>> She is trying.

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:44.700 align:middle line:90%
It is big at moments.

00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:45.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.960 align:middle line:84%
We want her physical
body, though,

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:52.610 align:middle line:84%
to be able to accept this
energy in a way that's

00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:55.219 align:middle line:90%
not uncomfortable for her.

00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:59.040 align:middle line:90%


00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:03.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Two different
vibrational qualities.

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:05.790 align:middle line:90%


00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>> So how can she,
after the session,

00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:09.735 align:middle line:90%
help herself to adjust?

00:35:09.735 --> 00:35:13.660 align:middle line:90%


00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:15.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Rest.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Rest, OK.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.540 align:middle line:84%
She said that she recently
heard your voice coming through,

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:21.560 align:middle line:90%
giving her information.

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:25.900 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell her more about
why that is happening?

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:28.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Acceptance.

00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Will you be sharing a lot
more information with her this

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:32.580 align:middle line:90%
way?

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:33.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, and what do you want her
to know about the information

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:38.640 align:middle line:90%
you're giving her?

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.620 align:middle line:90%
>> It is meant to ease humans.

00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:44.310 align:middle line:90%


00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:46.000 align:middle line:90%
They are in unrest.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.240 align:middle line:90%


00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So she's to share the
information that you're giving

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:54.150 align:middle line:90%
her.

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:55.080 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:57.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Can I ask-- on a
personal note for Beverly,

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:04.830 align:middle line:84%
she's been having some
real difficult headaches,

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:06.540 align:middle line:84%
challenges with
the body that way.

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:10.620 align:middle line:84%
Can you take a look at
the brain, at the head,

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:14.790 align:middle line:84%
and tell us what
you're seeing there?

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>> There will be much in this
body because of the molecule

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:28.520 align:middle line:84%
that is contained is
not of this dimension.

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:29.990 align:middle line:84%
>> It's hard for
a human, though,

00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:31.790 align:middle line:84%
to have such
discomfort in the head.

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:33.695 align:middle line:84%
What can be done to
help her with that?

00:36:33.695 --> 00:36:36.330 align:middle line:90%


00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Work on it.

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:42.560 align:middle line:90%
>> You're working on it?

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:45.410 align:middle line:84%
What can she do to help
keep the discomfort

00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:49.740 align:middle line:90%
from her head or her body?

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Quit taking on
other people's pain.

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:55.560 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:58.120 align:middle line:90%
>> She cannot help it.

00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:04.160 align:middle line:84%
It is part of the vibrational
molecule that was implemented.

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.970 align:middle line:90%


00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:10.140 align:middle line:84%
>> She can't help taking
on other people's?

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:11.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>> But that's causing
discomfort within her body?

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:28.038 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and the word,
word, word, word,

00:37:28.038 --> 00:37:30.780 align:middle line:90%
vibrational differences.

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:33.830 align:middle line:90%


00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So is there a way to help
the vibration to have balance

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:39.320 align:middle line:90%
within her body?

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:40.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Not yet.

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:42.900 align:middle line:90%


00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:45.190 align:middle line:90%
>> And why?

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:47.620 align:middle line:90%
>> It does not exist here.

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:55.130 align:middle line:90%


00:37:55.130 --> 00:38:00.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you work with the body so
that the discomfort isn't there

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:02.270 align:middle line:90%
anymore for her?

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:05.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Ease.

00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:14.390 align:middle line:84%
Until humans grow in their
vibrational qualities,

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:15.920 align:middle line:90%
there will be some.

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:19.250 align:middle line:90%


00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:21.735 align:middle line:84%
>> So are you saying that
she's somewhat like a barometer

00:38:21.735 --> 00:38:22.535 align:middle line:90%
to that?

00:38:22.535 --> 00:38:26.580 align:middle line:90%


00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a shell that is
not used to containing that

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:38.030 align:middle line:90%
vibration.

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there perhaps a way
others around Beverly ourselves

00:38:43.850 --> 00:38:48.050 align:middle line:84%
and others who are
also doing this work--

00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:52.940 align:middle line:84%
can we help to influence
her in assisting

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:55.700 align:middle line:90%
in the ease of this shift?

00:38:55.700 --> 00:39:01.460 align:middle line:84%
>> That is what all the beings
in this room are here for.

00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell us about the beings
that are in this room, please.

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:06.790 align:middle line:90%
>> So many.

00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:10.270 align:middle line:90%


00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:12.100 align:middle line:90%
So many.

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:13.430 align:middle line:90%
>> What is their intentions?

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:17.320 align:middle line:90%


00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:20.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:22.315 align:middle line:84%
>> And why are they
here with us today?

00:39:22.315 --> 00:39:25.450 align:middle line:90%


00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:30.435 align:middle line:90%
>> To help, to watch.

00:39:30.435 --> 00:39:33.920 align:middle line:90%


00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:39.680 align:middle line:90%
My existence is outside of them.

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:44.960 align:middle line:90%
Want the information, also.

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:48.830 align:middle line:84%
>> And what will they
do with the information?

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:51.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Help.

00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>> So her session here today
is helping others in different

00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:58.790 align:middle line:90%
dimensions?

00:39:58.790 --> 00:39:59.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:01.750 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, that's good.

00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:09.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of higher vibrations
are not allowed to help unless

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:12.820 align:middle line:90%
humans decide.

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:14.020 align:middle line:90%
She is teaching.

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:16.560 align:middle line:90%


00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:18.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think
she's aware of that?

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:18.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:20.010 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything else that you
would like to share with us?

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:24.735 align:middle line:90%
>> So much.

00:40:24.735 --> 00:40:32.070 align:middle line:90%


00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:38.445 align:middle line:84%
You are all at the
beginning, not the end.

00:40:38.445 --> 00:40:41.873 align:middle line:90%


00:40:41.873 --> 00:40:43.040 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you mean by that?

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:46.050 align:middle line:90%


00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:52.520 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the beginning of
resolving old karmic from this

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:56.420 align:middle line:90%
dimension to form the next.

00:40:56.420 --> 00:41:00.170 align:middle line:90%
This is the beginning shift.

00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:02.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Beginning shift?

00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:07.205 align:middle line:90%
>> Bring light to all.

00:41:07.205 --> 00:41:14.530 align:middle line:90%


00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:15.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Really--

00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:16.497 align:middle line:90%
>> Sounds like a plan to me.

00:41:16.497 --> 00:41:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>> I can do that.

00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:17.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:18.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:23.770 align:middle line:84%
I think the team here is very
excited about bringing light

00:41:23.770 --> 00:41:27.820 align:middle line:84%
to many, that everybody can do
this individually on their own.

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:29.960 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:32.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:36.560 align:middle line:90%
Each will connect with others.

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:40.517 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, well, we are
so very grateful for all

00:41:40.517 --> 00:41:42.350 align:middle line:84%
the information that
has come through today.

00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for sharing
all this information.

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for keeping
Beverly's body in balance

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:55.410 align:middle line:84%
and helping her to acclimate
the energy in the way that's

00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:56.210 align:middle line:90%
best for her.

00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:58.685 align:middle line:90%


00:41:58.685 --> 00:42:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Anything else
you'd like to share

00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:03.835 align:middle line:90%
before I bring her back up?

00:42:03.835 --> 00:42:04.635 align:middle line:90%
>> Not yet.

00:42:04.635 --> 00:42:07.840 align:middle line:90%


00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:08.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Not yet, OK.

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.150 align:middle line:90%
Another session another time?

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I was just going to say, I
have a feeling there's going

00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:12.340 align:middle line:90%
to be some more.

00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:13.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:14.650 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:42:14.650 --> 00:42:17.290 align:middle line:84%
All right, well, we wish you
great luck with all of the work

00:42:17.290 --> 00:42:21.100 align:middle line:84%
that you're doing with
untangling that fear

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:24.880 align:middle line:84%
molecule in the overlay
of the new Earth,

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:28.830 align:middle line:84%
and we will send great
amounts of light to the work

00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:29.630 align:middle line:90%
that you're doing.

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:29.920 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:30.720 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:33.340 align:middle line:90%


00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:36.220 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm going to count to 10.

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:41.190 align:middle line:84%
As you come back
into the body, 1,

00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:43.755 align:middle line:84%
now you're coming out
of this experience.

00:42:43.755 --> 00:42:47.070 align:middle line:90%
7, you're back in the body now.

00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:51.600 align:middle line:84%
8, coming into awareness
into this beautiful space.

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:54.100 align:middle line:90%
9, you can move your body.

00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:55.980 align:middle line:90%
Stretch it out if you want.

00:42:55.980 --> 00:43:01.470 align:middle line:84%
10, coming back into this space
and time, and now you are here.

00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:03.110 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, friend.

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:05.415 align:middle line:90%
>> There she is.

00:43:05.415 --> 00:43:06.215 align:middle line:90%
How are you doing?

00:43:06.215 --> 00:43:08.820 align:middle line:90%


00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:10.365 align:middle line:90%
You all right?

00:43:10.365 --> 00:43:11.165 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:43:11.165 --> 00:43:13.933 align:middle line:90%


00:43:13.933 --> 00:43:14.975 align:middle line:90%
You need to get grounded?

00:43:14.975 --> 00:43:24.240 align:middle line:90%


00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:26.730 align:middle line:90%
>> That was deep.

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:29.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:31.260 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you mean?

00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we'll show you once
you get grounded back here.

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:39.220 align:middle line:90%
>> It's OK.

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:40.020 align:middle line:90%
It was good.

00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:41.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:44.870 align:middle line:90%


00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:47.464 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you recall anything?

00:43:47.464 --> 00:43:48.440 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:50.540 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:52.970 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember laying
down on the table?

00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:53.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:56.720 align:middle line:90%
I remember being nervous.

00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:00.065 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that gone now?

00:44:00.065 --> 00:44:04.510 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm just not really here yet.

00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:06.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Take your time.

00:44:06.070 --> 00:44:07.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Feel your body.

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:08.740 align:middle line:90%
Move it around a little bit.

00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:15.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Mostly I can feel everybody.

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:16.030 align:middle line:90%
It just feels different.

00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:16.830 align:middle line:90%
>> That was fun.

00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:19.040 align:middle line:84%
That was fun having a
friend ask questions.

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:19.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Was it?

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:21.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it was awesome.

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:22.660 align:middle line:90%
>> It was cool.

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:24.952 align:middle line:84%
>> I would like all of this
with every session, please.

00:44:24.952 --> 00:44:26.770 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:27.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, just call.

00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:27.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you arrange that?

00:44:27.850 --> 00:44:28.960 align:middle line:90%
>> I'll be here every--

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:31.160 align:middle line:90%
I'll film them all.

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:33.340 align:middle line:90%
I'd love to.

00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:37.317 align:middle line:90%
>> Bill were you OK?

00:44:37.317 --> 00:44:38.275 align:middle line:90%
>> I'll tell you later.

00:44:38.275 --> 00:44:40.210 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:41.380 align:middle line:90%
That was pretty intense.

00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:43.934 align:middle line:90%
>> He's still taking it all in.

00:44:43.934 --> 00:44:47.413 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:44:47.413 --> 00:45:02.340 align:middle line:90%


00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And we're back, Beverly, from
your amazing regression session

00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:10.920 align:middle line:90%
round four with the designers.

00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:12.930 align:middle line:90%
How was it?

00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:14.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Crazy.

00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:16.170 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't remember
anything, so I had to listen.

00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:20.410 align:middle line:90%
I actually had to listen to it.

00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:23.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So when the designers come
in, it's like a full-on--

00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:25.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Full-on takeover.

00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you did
mention, though,

00:45:26.610 --> 00:45:31.320 align:middle line:84%
that you felt you see things,
or something is happening.

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:33.270 align:middle line:84%
What are you experiencing
in that moment?

00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:37.560 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was relistening to
it, it was like I could get

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:39.162 align:middle line:90%
the vision of--

00:45:39.162 --> 00:45:40.620 align:middle line:84%
they were showing
me things while I

00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:43.110 align:middle line:90%
was listening to it in the car.

00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:45.152 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:45:45.152 --> 00:45:47.235 align:middle line:84%
I'm still trying to figure
out what that all means

00:45:47.235 --> 00:45:48.240 align:middle line:90%
and how it works.

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>> So not when you were actually
in the regression session,

00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:53.460 align:middle line:84%
but when you were relistening
to it, things would show up.

00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:58.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm trying to remember if
maybe they were showing me

00:45:58.230 --> 00:46:00.300 align:middle line:90%
during the regression, but--

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:01.260 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:03.780 align:middle line:90%
>> --I'm kind of checked out.

00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:05.400 align:middle line:90%
>> What was showing?

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:08.730 align:middle line:84%
What kind of
visuals did you get?

00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>> The part when they were
talking about a part of where

00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:19.690 align:middle line:84%
it had happened in areas
already, if that makes sense.

00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:25.110 align:middle line:84%
There was something
about the shift,

00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:27.750 align:middle line:84%
is what I'm thinking
it had to do with.

00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And when it mentions that
it had happened in the past

00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:36.660 align:middle line:84%
but only in small parts,
it was like it showed me

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:39.990 align:middle line:84%
a couple of different areas on
the Earth where it had already

00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:45.070 align:middle line:84%
taken place, but then those
places don't exist anymore.

00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And so that was really
interesting to me.

00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, is that
sort of like maybe--

00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:51.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Like the Ring of Fire.

00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:54.540 align:middle line:84%
In that area, it
seemed to really

00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:59.280 align:middle line:84%
be a focal point when I
heard that in the recording.

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:01.990 align:middle line:90%


00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:middle line:84%
So if they already
shifted, then that

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:08.040 align:middle line:84%
means they sort of phase-shifted
into this new template

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:09.420 align:middle line:90%
of Earth, this new Earth?

00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>> It seemed to me that
there were two things going

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:18.570 align:middle line:84%
on, and the information I
gathered as to why that is no

00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:21.120 align:middle line:84%
longer had to do
with, number one,

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:25.470 align:middle line:84%
they started getting bigger
than they should have,

00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:29.410 align:middle line:84%
thinking in a bigger aspect
than what they should have been.

00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And then also, there was
another outside source

00:47:34.110 --> 00:47:36.120 align:middle line:84%
that didn't like
the amount of power

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:39.240 align:middle line:84%
that these couple
of civilizations

00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:42.660 align:middle line:90%
had and felt threatened.

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So like the
Mayan civilization.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm guessing.

00:47:46.650 --> 00:47:49.710 align:middle line:90%
>> And maybe some of the--

00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:53.040 align:middle line:84%
we have the Maori
down in Australia.

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:55.500 align:middle line:84%
>> There is definitely one
on some island type stuff.

00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:58.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So in Hawaii,
there's a lot of that.

00:47:58.440 --> 00:47:59.760 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And they've already
sort of phase-shifted

00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:04.950 align:middle line:90%
into this new reality, then?

00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:08.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, long before
this shift happened,

00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:11.250 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's what
I was understanding,

00:48:11.250 --> 00:48:15.210 align:middle line:84%
is that those civilizations had
already went through the shift

00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:16.800 align:middle line:90%
and were shifting.

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And then I kind of was shown
what happened during that time

00:48:20.610 --> 00:48:23.550 align:middle line:84%
and that it no longer
exists and that now

00:48:23.550 --> 00:48:27.640 align:middle line:84%
all of humanity around the globe
is now in that shifting point.

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:29.520 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to be
a lot slower than it

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:32.460 align:middle line:84%
was with those other
two civilizations,

00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:35.250 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to grow at a
slower rate, because to me,

00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:37.170 align:middle line:84%
it seemed like
they let me know it

00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:43.050 align:middle line:84%
happened very rapidly, pretty
quickly in those other places.

00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:44.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Fascinating.

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:46.440 align:middle line:90%
So there was an interesting--

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:50.940 align:middle line:84%
this number 26, and
there was talking

00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:59.650 align:middle line:84%
about the idea of 26 beings,
you being one of them.

00:48:59.650 --> 00:49:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Did that resonate?

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:06.330 align:middle line:90%
>> It explains a lot of things.

00:49:06.330 --> 00:49:08.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let's explain
from your perspective.

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:12.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Just a lot of the
sensitivities I have

00:49:12.330 --> 00:49:15.240 align:middle line:84%
in my body, so I
mean, definitely,

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:16.980 align:middle line:84%
and then the
abilities and, I mean,

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:23.550 align:middle line:84%
just kind of a multi-layered
understanding of maybe why.

00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:26.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, going back to
session one, there was--

00:49:26.310 --> 00:49:28.500 align:middle line:84%
and I forgot to ask
the designers this,

00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:35.370 align:middle line:84%
but there was the planet or
star system called Aldebaran

00:49:35.370 --> 00:49:36.340 align:middle line:90%
or "All-der-burn."

00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:37.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Aldebaran.

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:37.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Aldebaran.

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:38.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:43.740 align:middle line:84%
>> And the designers sort of
said that's where they came

00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:46.470 align:middle line:84%
from, or am I
misinterpreting that?

00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm still in the research
part myself with that.

00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:54.970 align:middle line:90%
I have looked it up.

00:49:54.970 --> 00:50:00.030 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be linked
to, in my research--

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:02.760 align:middle line:84%
now, this could be completely
wrong because this is just

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:04.130 align:middle line:90%
what exists now.

00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:07.065 align:middle line:90%


00:50:07.065 --> 00:50:10.830 align:middle line:84%
The royal stars in astrology
is what it's tied to.

00:50:10.830 --> 00:50:14.580 align:middle line:84%
That's what I have found,
and there's four archangels

00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:17.490 align:middle line:90%
assigned to these four stars.

00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And they're actually appointed
in four areas in our star

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:26.190 align:middle line:84%
system, and they act
like the watchers.

00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:28.420 align:middle line:90%
They're called the watchers.

00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:29.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:30.470 align:middle line:90%
I've heard about the watchers.

00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>> So yeah, that's just
so far what I'm coming

00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:38.620 align:middle line:84%
to the understanding, and I do
have placements of these stars

00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:39.420 align:middle line:90%
in my chart.

00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:41.850 align:middle line:90%
My daughters do as well.

00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think that if these
designers were from that star

00:50:46.110 --> 00:50:54.150 align:middle line:84%
system and you being genetically
and energetically carrying that

00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:59.250 align:middle line:84%
energy for that star system,
that's trying to sort of blend

00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:04.080 align:middle line:84%
in and hybridize
here into humanity?

00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:07.320 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what I gather.

00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:08.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool, cool.

00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:14.460 align:middle line:84%
So obviously,
outside of Aldebaran,

00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:16.060 align:middle line:90%
there's many star systems here.

00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:18.690 align:middle line:84%
So from the
Pleiades, there could

00:51:18.690 --> 00:51:24.180 align:middle line:84%
be hundreds of us walking
around, bringing in that energy

00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:26.490 align:middle line:90%
into this reality.

00:51:26.490 --> 00:51:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And the more I go
into this research,

00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:35.550 align:middle line:84%
the way we think of the typical
ET thing, hybridization,

00:51:35.550 --> 00:51:37.542 align:middle line:84%
on a spaceship
and you're getting

00:51:37.542 --> 00:51:38.625 align:middle line:90%
injected with this stuff--

00:51:38.625 --> 00:51:41.310 align:middle line:90%


00:51:41.310 --> 00:51:43.260 align:middle line:84%
and even the
designers sort of talk

00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:48.060 align:middle line:84%
about this sense and
molecules and insertion

00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:51.780 align:middle line:84%
of the fear molecule and this
molecule and that molecule.

00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:54.390 align:middle line:10%
That's sort of how
we think, but I

00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:59.370 align:middle line:10%
believe those are just
metaphors for something

00:51:59.370 --> 00:52:01.530 align:middle line:10%
greater that we
don't understand.

00:52:01.530 --> 00:52:03.210 align:middle line:90%
Do you think that way, too?

00:52:03.210 --> 00:52:04.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:52:04.770 --> 00:52:07.160 align:middle line:90%
I think they've dumbed it down.

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:09.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, right dumbed
it down in the terms.

00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:12.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, giving it to us in
a way that our brains can

00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:16.110 align:middle line:84%
actually grasp it in
some kind of a form,

00:52:16.110 --> 00:52:17.880 align:middle line:90%
is what I understand.

00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:19.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:24.000 align:middle line:84%
That's how I feel this
evolution from starting the show

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.210 align:middle line:84%
and originally going into
classifying these different ET

00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:31.950 align:middle line:84%
races and people getting
brought onto ships that perhaps

00:52:31.950 --> 00:52:36.330 align:middle line:84%
that was just terms
or ideas or concepts

00:52:36.330 --> 00:52:39.660 align:middle line:84%
to help us get on
the right track

00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:43.920 align:middle line:84%
and keep evolving in the
direction we are, in having

00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:47.190 align:middle line:84%
a greater understanding,
a greater vocabulary,

00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:50.040 align:middle line:84%
and not hitting the nail
on the head so much.

00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:53.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and keeping us
away from fear, I think,

00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:55.180 align:middle line:90%
is a big part of it.

00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:57.510 align:middle line:84%
The more we understand,
the less we fear.

00:52:57.510 --> 00:53:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, exactly, and if we were
to jump without those steps

00:53:01.110 --> 00:53:04.380 align:middle line:84%
right into this
other grand idea,

00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:07.830 align:middle line:84%
there could be a lot
of misunderstandings,

00:53:07.830 --> 00:53:11.190 align:middle line:84%
swimming in the
unknown, so to say.

00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:13.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting
how this material

00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:18.780 align:middle line:84%
is coming to us in a nice,
palatable, easy-to-digest,

00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:23.730 align:middle line:84%
time-released, slow, and
easy way for some of us.

00:53:23.730 --> 00:53:27.870 align:middle line:84%
Some people, like
yourself, get bam.

00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:29.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it just
kind of comes at you.

00:53:29.490 --> 00:53:32.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Comes at you really fast,
but if you're watching my show,

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:34.060 align:middle line:90%
you could get it.

00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:36.910 align:middle line:84%
This is a nice, time-released
way to get this information.

00:53:36.910 --> 00:53:37.710 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:41.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, in addition to that,
we had a special guest.

00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:43.090 align:middle line:90%
We had the crystal skull.

00:53:43.090 --> 00:53:43.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:43.890 --> 00:53:49.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And what was it like having
the skull there compared

00:53:49.350 --> 00:53:50.473 align:middle line:90%
to past--

00:53:50.473 --> 00:53:51.390 align:middle line:90%
>> The other sessions.

00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>> --the other sessions, yeah,
when the skull wasn't there?

00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:59.100 align:middle line:84%
>> The skull added such
an element to the entire

00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:01.230 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, when we
were setting up,

00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:06.840 align:middle line:84%
getting ready for
the session, we

00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:08.910 align:middle line:84%
could already feel
the room getting

00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:13.470 align:middle line:84%
filled with spirits, I
mean, coming to partake

00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:15.250 align:middle line:90%
in the experience with us.

00:54:15.250 --> 00:54:21.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, coming out, the room
felt like it was filled.

00:54:21.210 --> 00:54:25.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we were also
in a Masonic lodge,

00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:30.450 align:middle line:84%
a very old building, and as
we were setting up I was it

00:54:30.450 --> 00:54:35.353 align:middle line:84%
reminded me of the old
Jane Roberts sessions.

00:54:35.353 --> 00:54:37.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you're familiar
with the session material.

00:54:37.770 --> 00:54:38.728 align:middle line:90%
>> Not yet, but I will.

00:54:38.728 --> 00:54:43.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and they went
through this process.

00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:46.110 align:middle line:84%
It was a very sort of
calculated process,

00:54:46.110 --> 00:54:52.200 align:middle line:84%
and they had to put water at
a certain place and a book

00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:54.330 align:middle line:84%
at a certain place, at
a certain direction,

00:54:54.330 --> 00:54:55.500 align:middle line:90%
and face a certain thing.

00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:58.140 align:middle line:84%
It was very precise
in all of these,

00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:01.620 align:middle line:84%
sort of ritualistic
in helping Jane

00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:08.640 align:middle line:84%
get into the regression
or the trance state.

00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And so we were doing--
it kind of looked

00:55:11.790 --> 00:55:13.680 align:middle line:90%
like the seance thing.

00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:16.173 align:middle line:84%
We had a security person
walk in and I'm sure--

00:55:16.173 --> 00:55:17.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I can't even imagine.

00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:20.610 align:middle line:84%
>> --pay a million
bucks to see your face.

00:55:20.610 --> 00:55:22.180 align:middle line:90%
It would have been a lot of fun.

00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:24.263 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure she peeked
in and like, oh, OK,

00:55:24.263 --> 00:55:25.305 align:middle line:90%
and it was Easter Sunday.

00:55:25.305 --> 00:55:28.190 align:middle line:90%


00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:29.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was so
not planned, either.

00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:33.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and we actually
delayed our whole trip

00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:35.220 align:middle line:84%
because we've been on
this massive road trip.

00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:40.250 align:middle line:84%
We're filming the skull
stuff, and yeah, it

00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:42.320 align:middle line:84%
just kind of happened
the way it happened

00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:45.770 align:middle line:84%
because we were trying to avoid
noise from Suzanne's office.

00:55:45.770 --> 00:55:47.960 align:middle line:84%
So we were like, well,
maybe it's Easter.

00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:50.045 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's nobody
upstairs, and sure enough, we

00:55:50.045 --> 00:55:51.420 align:middle line:84%
had the whole
place to ourselves.

00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:52.330 align:middle line:90%
So epic.

00:55:52.330 --> 00:55:53.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I mean,
it was just wow.

00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:57.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it was epic.

00:55:57.050 --> 00:56:00.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you physically see
beings as we were setting up?

00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:01.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:03.230 align:middle line:90%
>> What did they look like?

00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:06.753 align:middle line:90%
>> I saw the ritual-type being.

00:56:06.753 --> 00:56:07.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Ritual-type beings?

00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:08.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:09.860 align:middle line:90%
>> What is that?

00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:12.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Whoever was doing
rituals in there.

00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:13.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, in prior.

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:14.790 align:middle line:90%
>> The Masonic lodge, yeah.

00:56:14.790 --> 00:56:15.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:56:15.590 --> 00:56:18.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So they showed up first
while we were in preparation.

00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:19.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:20.500 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:23.070 align:middle line:84%
I remember now, and I
asked you, is it scary?

00:56:23.070 --> 00:56:23.870 align:middle line:90%
>> And it wasn't.

00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:25.790 align:middle line:90%
>> And it wasn't.

00:56:25.790 --> 00:56:29.240 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a lot
of mystery and fear

00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:35.510 align:middle line:84%
and mostly fear because of the
unknown with the Masonic stuff,

00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:40.010 align:middle line:84%
do you think some negative
stuff was going on there?

00:56:40.010 --> 00:56:40.935 align:middle line:90%
>> No, absolutely not.

00:56:40.935 --> 00:56:41.735 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:56:41.735 --> 00:56:42.535 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:56:42.535 --> 00:56:43.810 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:56:43.810 --> 00:56:46.160 align:middle line:84%
It just really
felt like they were

00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:49.490 align:middle line:84%
trying to tap in with
things that we can't

00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:53.320 align:middle line:84%
see and understand, and they
had a very ritualistic way

00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:54.120 align:middle line:90%
of doing it.

00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:56.570 align:middle line:84%
But it was very
respected, and it

00:56:56.570 --> 00:57:00.890 align:middle line:84%
was held high within
their vibrational makeup.

00:57:00.890 --> 00:57:02.020 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't scary at all.

00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:05.370 align:middle line:84%
It was very professional
and very productive,

00:57:05.370 --> 00:57:11.150 align:middle line:84%
and I think the fear that people
might have is the unknown,

00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:15.050 align:middle line:84%
obviously, and them trying
to communicate and do

00:57:15.050 --> 00:57:19.700 align:middle line:84%
these things that most
people wouldn't understand.

00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:23.330 align:middle line:84%
>> So all the secrecy, then, was
more probably just about that,

00:57:23.330 --> 00:57:27.260 align:middle line:84%
about keeping it from people
who don't understand--

00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:28.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Being exposed, yeah.

00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>> --being exposed to people
who might project and judge

00:57:31.290 --> 00:57:32.090 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of--

00:57:32.090 --> 00:57:32.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:57:32.890 --> 00:57:34.790 align:middle line:90%
It's very sacred.

00:57:34.790 --> 00:57:35.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, through our
movies and stuff,

00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:44.270 align:middle line:84%
we have all this negative
energy about that,

00:57:44.270 --> 00:57:47.510 align:middle line:90%
the Masonic's 33rd degree.

00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:50.040 align:middle line:84%
You must be the Illuminati
and all this stuff.

00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:51.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:54.950 align:middle line:84%
I think more and more, as
the truth starts coming out,

00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:59.780 align:middle line:84%
people will realize that
everything that we have feared

00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:02.970 align:middle line:84%
was put in place
to keep us from it.

00:58:02.970 --> 00:58:03.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:06.210 align:middle line:84%
So with the skull,
some things were

00:58:06.210 --> 00:58:10.080 align:middle line:84%
said about the skull
when the skull was there,

00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:12.480 align:middle line:84%
and you said you didn't
have any background.

00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:14.250 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no, no.

00:58:14.250 --> 00:58:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>> It sort of confirms some of
the legends that we have been

00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:22.500 align:middle line:84%
working on this other project,
doing the skull documentary

00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:23.670 align:middle line:90%
with Bill.

00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:28.920 align:middle line:84%
There is talk of this legend
of the 13 crystal skulls,

00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:31.740 align:middle line:90%
and that came up in the session.

00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And what did you think about
that when you heard it?

00:58:34.590 --> 00:58:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Shock.

00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:40.755 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's not many
words other than, what?

00:58:40.755 --> 00:58:42.240 align:middle line:90%
What is going on here?

00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:43.782 align:middle line:84%
>> Not having those
reference points.

00:58:43.782 --> 00:58:46.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, yeah, not even
having the reference point,

00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:47.320 align:middle line:90%
like you said.

00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:48.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:50.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, just other
than the vocabulary of that,

00:58:50.490 --> 00:58:52.830 align:middle line:90%
there is skulls.

00:58:52.830 --> 00:58:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps there's more than
one, that kind of thing.

00:58:57.250 --> 00:59:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And it seemed that the
skull was going to be

00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:08.010 align:middle line:90%
a key factor in this shift.

00:59:08.010 --> 00:59:09.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:11.280 align:middle line:90%
>> So that was kind of cool.

00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:12.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And it was like
a traveling pyramid.

00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:17.320 align:middle line:90%
That was said, too.

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:20.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I found that to be
a very interesting.

00:59:20.610 --> 00:59:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Has anybody said
anything about this?

00:59:23.950 --> 00:59:25.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, not exactly.

00:59:25.590 --> 00:59:29.160 align:middle line:84%
I was somewhat kind
of thinking that there

00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:31.950 align:middle line:84%
was a correlation with the
pyramids and the skulls,

00:59:31.950 --> 00:59:33.330 align:middle line:90%
and that's why I brought it up.

00:59:33.330 --> 00:59:37.950 align:middle line:84%
But my own sort of intuition
has been telling me

00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:43.740 align:middle line:84%
that the energy of what the
pyramids do, as far as holding

00:59:43.740 --> 00:59:49.890 align:middle line:84%
the frequency and bringing
in specific frequencies

00:59:49.890 --> 00:59:52.770 align:middle line:84%
to grid the planet,
that I also felt

00:59:52.770 --> 00:59:54.657 align:middle line:84%
the skull was doing
something similar,

00:59:54.657 --> 00:59:55.740 align:middle line:90%
and that's why I asked it.

00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:59.140 align:middle line:90%
So the confirmation was there.

00:59:59.140 --> 00:59:59.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:59:59.940 --> 01:00:03.660 align:middle line:84%
From what I understood,
it's like a deep technology

01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:09.720 align:middle line:84%
that was created to harness
similar abilities to make

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:13.230 align:middle line:90%
them more available worldwide.

01:00:13.230 --> 01:00:16.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and kind of what
Bill is doing with his work is

01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:22.860 align:middle line:84%
activating grid lines and
people and activating them,

01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:27.210 align:middle line:84%
so they can go and spread this
love and this energy throughout

01:00:27.210 --> 01:00:28.980 align:middle line:90%
the planet.

01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:31.690 align:middle line:84%
Anything else you want
to add to your session?

01:00:31.690 --> 01:00:32.490 align:middle line:90%
>> The 26.

01:00:32.490 --> 01:00:33.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, the 26?

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:33.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:33.610 --> 01:00:34.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

01:00:34.410 --> 01:00:37.620 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think we should do
just a little bit about the 26.

01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:39.900 align:middle line:90%
So that number really--

01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:42.450 align:middle line:84%
it just came out
quick like that,

01:00:42.450 --> 01:00:44.550 align:middle line:84%
and I was like, whoa,
what does that mean

01:00:44.550 --> 01:00:46.180 align:middle line:90%
when I'm listening to it?

01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:50.160 align:middle line:84%
But they do a really
good job at explaining it

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:53.010 align:middle line:90%
if you listen closely.

01:00:53.010 --> 01:00:59.430 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me that these
higher-dimensional beings--

01:00:59.430 --> 01:01:03.180 align:middle line:84%
there's apparently 13
that they have implemented

01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:12.600 align:middle line:84%
into the human soul, like an
entire molecule into souls,

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:14.400 align:middle line:90%
obviously.

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:17.740 align:middle line:84%
But they had to do
it in a masculine way

01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:20.460 align:middle line:84%
and a feminine
way, so then the 13

01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:24.810 align:middle line:90%
creates two, which would be 26.

01:01:24.810 --> 01:01:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And so there's only 13 of the
higher-dimensional beings,

01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:32.430 align:middle line:84%
but they broke
them apart into two

01:01:32.430 --> 01:01:34.960 align:middle line:90%
to keep the modalities equal.

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:35.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:01:35.850 --> 01:01:38.427 align:middle line:84%
Bill picked up on that
right away in real time.

01:01:38.427 --> 01:01:41.010 align:middle line:84%
When I heard 26, I was like, oh,
that's an interesting number,

01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:43.240 align:middle line:90%
and I was trying to do the math.

01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:49.060 align:middle line:84%
It's also 6 plus 2 is 8,
and then 8 is infinity.

01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:55.470 align:middle line:84%
So that's where I was going with
the numbers, but Bill was like,

01:01:55.470 --> 01:01:56.730 align:middle line:90%
does it have to do with 13?

01:01:56.730 --> 01:01:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And we're like, oh
yeah, and then we

01:01:58.650 --> 01:02:00.030 align:middle line:90%
got the whole explanation.

01:02:00.030 --> 01:02:05.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, and I'm not sure if
the 13 higher-dimensional forms

01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:08.070 align:middle line:84%
have anything to
do with the skulls,

01:02:08.070 --> 01:02:10.860 align:middle line:84%
since there seems to
be 13 of the skulls,

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:14.370 align:middle line:84%
and maybe that's why this
information came through while

01:02:14.370 --> 01:02:16.890 align:middle line:84%
the skull is sitting
right next to us.

01:02:16.890 --> 01:02:19.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:21.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, we do have the
12 signs of the zodiac,

01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:24.390 align:middle line:84%
and there's talk
of maybe a 13th.

01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:25.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

01:02:25.410 --> 01:02:26.785 align:middle line:84%
It's complete
speculation, right?

01:02:26.785 --> 01:02:27.585 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:02:27.585 --> 01:02:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>> But also, if you just
take all 12 combined,

01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:34.890 align:middle line:84%
then you get another
number, right?

01:02:34.890 --> 01:02:36.257 align:middle line:90%
So the 13 would be--

01:02:36.257 --> 01:02:38.340 align:middle line:84%
and that's sort of the
idea of the crystal skulls,

01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:40.800 align:middle line:84%
is that there's 12
unique skulls, at least

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:43.140 align:middle line:90%
the lore in our investigations.

01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And then the 13th skull
is all the skulls combined

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:50.267 align:middle line:90%
into one skull, so yeah.

01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:51.067 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:02:51.067 --> 01:02:52.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:54.790 align:middle line:84%
We really have to
chew on this a bit.

01:02:54.790 --> 01:02:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, there's a lot to
digest and a lot of nuggets

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:06.970 align:middle line:84%
for our journey with the skulls
and Bill and this series.

01:03:06.970 --> 01:03:07.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

01:03:07.930 --> 01:03:09.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're in
the middle of it.

01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:10.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Super cool.

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:03:11.470 --> 01:03:13.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Anything else
to reflect on it?

01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:14.050 align:middle line:90%
What's next?

01:03:14.050 --> 01:03:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh wow.

01:03:14.850 --> 01:03:16.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Ready for another session?

01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:19.510 align:middle line:84%
>> It's going to take me
a little bit to come back

01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:22.948 align:middle line:84%
and recover and
all that, but yeah.

01:03:22.948 --> 01:03:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's definitely
a lot of information there,

01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:27.710 align:middle line:84%
and anybody watching
this episode,

01:03:27.710 --> 01:03:32.800 align:middle line:84%
I purposely tried to introduce
sort of a round four,

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:36.350 align:middle line:84%
because Suzanne's work--
there's no sense in redoing any

01:03:36.350 --> 01:03:37.150 align:middle line:90%
of that.

01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:38.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, no.

01:03:38.110 --> 01:03:40.360 align:middle line:84%
>> You guys have
set a really good--

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:45.790 align:middle line:84%
your sessions together have set
a really good library of work

01:03:45.790 --> 01:03:46.990 align:middle line:90%
for people to reference.

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:48.790 align:middle line:84%
I recommend everybody
going back and--

01:03:48.790 --> 01:03:49.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>> --watching the designer
series on Suzanne's YouTube

01:03:53.170 --> 01:03:55.450 align:middle line:84%
page, and I'll have
her website and stuff.

01:03:55.450 --> 01:03:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And then I hear you're
working on a website now.

01:03:58.870 --> 01:04:01.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep, it's in the works.

01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:03.160 align:middle line:84%
>> So by the time
this comes out,

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:08.860 align:middle line:84%
we can put that up there too for
folks to check out and access

01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:11.740 align:middle line:84%
obviously not just the
designers but your work.

01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:16.390 align:middle line:84%
You're stepping more
into this work as a--

01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:18.550 align:middle line:90%
what would you call it?

01:04:18.550 --> 01:04:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>> An energy reader.

01:04:19.810 --> 01:04:20.710 align:middle line:90%
>> An energy reader.

01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:22.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I help them.

01:04:22.030 --> 01:04:24.670 align:middle line:84%
I read the energy and help
them get back on their path,

01:04:24.670 --> 01:04:26.030 align:middle line:90%
like course correction.

01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And if healing
needs to be done, I

01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:32.650 align:middle line:84%
pinpoint where those areas
are, what it pertains to,

01:04:32.650 --> 01:04:36.070 align:middle line:84%
and I just kind of let them
know instead of a guessing game.

01:04:36.070 --> 01:04:37.150 align:middle line:90%
[PEACEFUL MUSIC]

01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:41.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, again, thank you
for allowing us to sit

01:04:41.250 --> 01:04:45.780 align:middle line:84%
in on another session
and Suzanne and her time.

01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:49.590 align:middle line:84%
She was super graceful with
letting us sort of take over

01:04:49.590 --> 01:04:53.550 align:middle line:84%
for a couple of days
there and looking forward

01:04:53.550 --> 01:04:58.320 align:middle line:84%
to more fun discoveries
and exciting times

01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:02.010 align:middle line:84%
with the designers, your work,
seeing how that develops.

01:05:02.010 --> 01:05:03.167 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, let's dig deeper.

01:05:03.167 --> 01:05:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Dig deeper and stay in touch.
