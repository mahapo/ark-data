[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.493 --> 00:02:03.752 align:middle line:90%


00:02:03.752 --> 00:02:04.720 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.520 align:middle line:90%
Hello to you.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.530 align:middle line:90%
This is Sasha.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Sasha.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice to see you today.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:09.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice to see you.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.940 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for being here and being
part of this big adventure

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.620 align:middle line:90%
show that I've got going on.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.510 align:middle line:90%
>> It is our pleasure.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.750 align:middle line:90%
How may we serve you today?

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.140 align:middle line:90%
>> I have several questions.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.820 align:middle line:84%
First, I'd like to sort of
ask a little bit of background

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.810 align:middle line:90%
on the Pleiades.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And I-- my understanding
of the place

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.320 align:middle line:84%
is that it's a big star
system with many stars

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.810 align:middle line:84%
and many planets
and many beings,

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:43.800 align:middle line:84%
and maybe get an idea of more
of your planet, your history,

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.330 align:middle line:84%
and whether that's a
collective or an individual.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.430 align:middle line:84%
Maybe, let's ask this first,
what density do you reside in?

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.340 align:middle line:84%
>> We are within what you
would call the higher levels

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.180 align:middle line:90%
of fourth density.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So we still have
physical bodies.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.300 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.850 align:middle line:84%
>> But we know that our planet
and our people is making--

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.530 align:middle line:84%
on our way to making
the transition

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.483 align:middle line:90%
to no longer having bodies.

00:03:09.483 --> 00:03:12.290 align:middle line:90%
>> So-- so almost--

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.210 align:middle line:84%
well, fifth-- my understanding--
and I could be wrong--

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.350 align:middle line:90%
but fifth--

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.280 align:middle line:84%
fifth, sixth density would be
more losing the body sense.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.140 align:middle line:84%
But on the fourth
density as well?

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.830 align:middle line:84%
>> In the scale that we use,
which is seven densities--

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>> --the fourth density is
the last density in which

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.430 align:middle line:84%
physicality is expressed
as a separate body.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.230 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.930 align:middle line:84%
>> As you begin moving
into fifth density,

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.980 align:middle line:84%
then you become more
plasmic in nature.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So you could kind
of say light beings.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.940 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.560 align:middle line:84%
>> But as you go
farther and farther,

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.490 align:middle line:84%
deeper and deeper
into fifth density,

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.840 align:middle line:84%
then it becomes less
individualized and you start

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.240 align:middle line:90%
moving more towards collective.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:00.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Would-- are dream states
be a fifth density reality?

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.730 align:middle line:84%
What density would you
classify the dreams in?

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:09.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this is a metaphor
that we've used in the past

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:10.740 align:middle line:90%
for another project.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.770 align:middle line:84%
We're going to resurrect it
here because it's very useful.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>> If you consider the idea of
a golden lake to be your state

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.510 align:middle line:84%
of oneness in
complete integration,

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:32.040 align:middle line:84%
the state of sleep is the time
when, in a sense, you revisit,

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.430 align:middle line:84%
or reconnect, with
that state of oneness.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.750 align:middle line:84%
So we wouldn't say that it is
necessarily a separate density.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.750 align:middle line:84%
The dream state is another
expression of consciousness

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.960 align:middle line:84%
as you are reconnecting
with your true nature.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:46.880 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.750 align:middle line:90%
So it's not even--

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.560 align:middle line:84%
it's almost in its
own classification.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Sort of like angelic realms.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, angelic realms I've
heard are borderline somewhere

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:59.740 align:middle line:90%
around seventh--

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.670 align:middle line:84%
sixth, seventh, eighth
density sort of thing.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.930 align:middle line:84%
But is that-- do they
have a classification?

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, based on
what you're saying,

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.380 align:middle line:84%
it seems we're using
different scales.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.180 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.345 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:09.345 --> 00:05:09.510 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.030 align:middle line:84%
>> So obviously, the answers
are going to be a little bit

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.830 align:middle line:90%
confusing.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.020 align:middle line:84%
For us, it's a
seven density scale.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.820 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.150 align:middle line:84%
>> So we consider the angelic
realm to be more sixth density.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.950 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.140 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.880 align:middle line:84%
This is good because
I-- you know,

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.630 align:middle line:84%
having, again, this scale
or base to ask questions

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.430 align:middle line:84%
from and sort of
go back and forth,

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.600 align:middle line:84%
it helps the audience sort of
put the pieces of the puzzle

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.280 align:middle line:84%
together, formulate
their own ideas.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Because a lot of the same--

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.112 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, we use
same terminologies,

00:05:38.112 --> 00:05:41.372 align:middle line:84%
but, like we just noticed,
that it might be just slightly

00:05:41.372 --> 00:05:42.330 align:middle line:90%
a little bit different.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.630 align:middle line:84%
If we will-- if we can say
just a little bit more about

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.700 align:middle line:84%
density, just to give
a broader perspective--

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:48.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>> --for those
who are listening.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.730 align:middle line:84%
The best way to describe our
version of the communications

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.370 align:middle line:84%
about density is to liken
it to the idea of a rainbow.

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.510 align:middle line:84%
So when you have the
original white light that

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.750 align:middle line:84%
then passes through a prism
and becomes a rainbow,

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.940 align:middle line:84%
those seven light
frequencies that you see

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.060 align:middle line:84%
are kind of representative
of the idea of the densities

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.290 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.490 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at
them very closely,

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:16.580 align:middle line:90%
a rainbow for instance--

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.790 align:middle line:84%
>> --there's not a sharp
division between each one.

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:20.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.180 align:middle line:90%
>> There's a gradation.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct, yeah.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So consciousness, thus,
moves from its original state

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:31.050 align:middle line:84%
of oneness through the
fragmentation and through

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.320 align:middle line:84%
series of different
types of expression.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.000 align:middle line:84%
The densest being
third density, which

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.290 align:middle line:84%
is where humanity is leaving
from, because it's egoic based.

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:44.430 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And then, you begin moving
out of that ego-based reality

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.290 align:middle line:90%
and back into the collective.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I've also--
wonderful analogy.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.590 align:middle line:84%
I've also-- most
of the analogies

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.560 align:middle line:84%
I've heard it's sort of
related to the chakra system,

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.480 align:middle line:84%
which, again, is
related to the rainbow.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.280 align:middle line:90%
So it's--

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, exactly.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.520 align:middle line:90%
>> It sort of goes full circle.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.720 align:middle line:84%
>> So, you know, I've heard that
our plant and animal kingdom

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.090 align:middle line:84%
are second density
consciousness.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And, you know, I was going
to save this question for later,

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.515 align:middle line:84%
but because of how
we're going things,

00:07:19.515 --> 00:07:23.340 align:middle line:84%
we might as well
put this in now.

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:28.170 align:middle line:84%
As we are moving
into fourth density,

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:30.870 align:middle line:84%
and we're sort of in that
blending of the rainbow phase,

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:35.250 align:middle line:84%
I would say early phase,
where are our animals--

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:39.060 align:middle line:84%
are they blending into
the third density?

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:40.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.950 align:middle line:84%
There are two ways
to look at this idea.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:47.710 align:middle line:84%
One is a linear way and
one is a holographic way.

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:48.510 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:49.310 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:53.940 align:middle line:84%
So if you are to look at it from
the perspective of linearity,

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:56.010 align:middle line:84%
which is what humans
are more familiar with--

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:56.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>> --then what you would see
is that the other species

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:04.350 align:middle line:84%
and the other consciousness
around you is moving also.

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:07.560 align:middle line:84%
So from the linear
perspective, you're

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.010 align:middle line:84%
going to find that the
species on your world

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:13.140 align:middle line:84%
that you might consider
the higher second density

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:18.580 align:middle line:84%
species, such as the primates,
and certain bird species, et

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:23.580 align:middle line:84%
cetera, they are, too,
making a transition

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:28.020 align:middle line:84%
to third density, which means,
then, the development of ego.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:33.330 align:middle line:84%
So you're starting to see even
in dogs and certain animals

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.970 align:middle line:90%
more symptoms of ego.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:39.270 align:middle line:84%
Ego, of course, not
meaning a negative thing.

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Ego is simply a mechanism
that grounds you

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:45.750 align:middle line:84%
in the experience of separation
for a higher purpose.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:47.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:48.190 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:52.780 align:middle line:84%
So in that sense, then,
that's the linear--

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:53.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>> --perspective.

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:58.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you were to look at
the holographic principle

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.970 align:middle line:84%
of this idea, we're
going-- again,

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:02.410 align:middle line:90%
we have to speak in metaphors.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:03.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>> We're going to ask you to
imagine seven rooms that nest

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:14.020 align:middle line:90%
inside each other like boxes--

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.225 align:middle line:90%
like those Japanese boxes.

00:09:15.225 --> 00:09:15.590 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:16.390 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:17.440 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And the bigger box that
contains the smaller boxes

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.770 align:middle line:84%
would be more representative
of seventh density.

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:25.570 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:26.370 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.840 align:middle line:84%
So from the holographic
perspective,

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:34.630 align:middle line:84%
you exist in all of those boxes,
thus in all of the densities.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's simply a
matter of perspective

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:44.080 align:middle line:84%
about the you that is choosing
to notice the experience it's

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.640 align:middle line:90%
having at any given time.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.010 align:middle line:90%
But it is all simultaneous.

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:50.480 align:middle line:84%
So in that sense, there's
no movement, linearly--

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.900 align:middle line:84%
>> --from one
density to another.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.840 align:middle line:84%
It's a complete expression,
a complete experience

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.740 align:middle line:90%
on all levels, simultaneously.

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:58.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:04.520 align:middle line:84%
I saw-- would that relate to
platonic solids or geometrical

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.320 align:middle line:90%
shapes--

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly, yes.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:07.150 align:middle line:90%
>> --as well?

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:09.340 align:middle line:84%
There's a great video
I just saw online--

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.640 align:middle line:84%
maybe I'll post it,
here, in this video--

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.770 align:middle line:84%
where all of these platonic
solids were inside each other.

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:16.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And they sort
of pull them apart.

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.620 align:middle line:84%
The platonic solids are
a wonderful metaphor

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:25.270 align:middle line:84%
for the density energy
and also for the evolution

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:28.720 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness as it
moves from separation

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.640 align:middle line:90%
back into integration.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.400 align:middle line:84%
There is one workshop
we do where we actually

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.740 align:middle line:84%
equate each of the densities
to different platonic solids.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:37.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, perfect.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:38.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.290 align:middle line:90%
>> It's the same idea, yes.

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:40.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, excellent.

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And would that mean,
then, our first density

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:52.600 align:middle line:84%
minerals and, you know,
rocks and these sorts of--

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.250 align:middle line:84%
is water, I guess, consider
a first density being?

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:57.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:58.090 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:01.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Would-- would that sort of
move into the second density,

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:06.680 align:middle line:84%
then, and start having
sentiment consciousness?

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the thing about
first density-- again, we're--

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.147 align:middle line:84%
we're challenged by
the two perspectives,

00:11:12.147 --> 00:11:13.105 align:middle line:90%
linear and holographic.

00:11:13.105 --> 00:11:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, I guess what I'm
saying is in a linear sense.

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:16.075 align:middle line:90%
>> In a linear sense.

00:11:16.075 --> 00:11:16.875 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:16.875 --> 00:11:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>> In a linear sense, we have
to say that the first density,

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:21.440 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, is a
little bit different.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.240 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Because the first
density consciousness,

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:30.040 align:middle line:84%
being the first manifestation
into the reality of separation,

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.170 align:middle line:84%
is the building
blocks of creation.

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:34.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's your periodic
table of the elements.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:35.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.760 align:middle line:84%
>> It's all those--
that stuff of creation.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, the higher forms, then,
like high first density would

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:44.155 align:middle line:84%
be the mineral
kingdom, as an example.

00:11:44.155 --> 00:11:44.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:45.490 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:45.805 align:middle line:90%
>> And--

00:11:45.805 --> 00:11:46.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK, OK.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:46.780 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:47.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:50.840 align:middle line:90%
>> So just like with our--

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.680 align:middle line:84%
for, like, you guys
being on a higher

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.890 align:middle line:84%
end of the fourth
density spectrum--

00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:00.622 align:middle line:84%
so you still have
physical bodies like us.

00:12:00.622 --> 00:12:03.230 align:middle line:84%
The craft that you
probably fly around in--

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:06.370 align:middle line:84%
and where we're just
now entering that phase,

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:08.620 align:middle line:84%
but we're still in that
fourth density classification.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:09.100 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's a spectrum.

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:10.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:11.675 align:middle line:90%
>> It's an entire spectrum.

00:12:11.675 --> 00:12:13.300 align:middle line:84%
But the different
you're going to see--

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:17.630 align:middle line:84%
because you humans are now
entering the fourth density

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:18.430 align:middle line:90%
beginnings.

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:19.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:20.650 align:middle line:90%
>> And we're toward the end.

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.540 align:middle line:84%
The biggest difference
you're going

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:28.600 align:middle line:84%
to see between the two of us is
what we call the egoic anchor.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.480 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So ours is not as
heavy, so to speak.

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:39.130 align:middle line:84%
>> From your time of evolution,
if you can remember this

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:44.170 align:middle line:84%
or have records of this
in your era, what was,

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:45.910 align:middle line:90%
in relative years--

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:49.000 align:middle line:84%
earth years, your
linear evolution

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.500 align:middle line:84%
from beginnings of fourth
density to where you are now?

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:57.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, the-- our--

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:01.810 align:middle line:84%
looking at it linearly, we
went through very similar type

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:05.440 align:middle line:84%
of evolution that you are
going through now, however,

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.950 align:middle line:84%
we would say that our
challenges, as a species,

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:10.940 align:middle line:90%
were different than yours.

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:14.500 align:middle line:84%
So for us, a lot
of our challenges

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:22.840 align:middle line:84%
had to do with
self-forgiveness, guilt, things

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:27.040 align:middle line:84%
that we were holding on
to as a young species

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:31.030 align:middle line:84%
that we then had to
learn how to transcend.

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And for a very, very
long period of time,

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:40.120 align:middle line:84%
those challenges for my species
really stopped our evolution

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.430 align:middle line:84%
and almost destroyed
us as a species

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:43.750 align:middle line:90%
because when you keep putting--

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:47.350 align:middle line:84%
pushing down the
emotional things that

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:49.600 align:middle line:90%
need to be explored, you can--

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.105 align:middle line:84%
well, our species created
a plague, so to speak.

00:13:52.105 --> 00:13:52.980 align:middle line:90%
>> A plague, oh, wow.

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Plague, yes.

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:59.190 align:middle line:84%
Similar to what you might
call an immune plague where

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:04.130 align:middle line:84%
a disease within our immune
systems was destroying us

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:07.430 align:middle line:90%
and we had no idea what it was.

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And we had to use
our connections

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.740 align:middle line:84%
with, you might call
them the angels,

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:17.520 align:middle line:84%
or the guardians of our species,
the guides of our species--

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:21.210 align:middle line:84%
we had to connect with them
to find out what it was.

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And what we found out was that
our pattern, as a species,

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:31.780 align:middle line:84%
was that we were refusing
to look at and integrate

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.150 align:middle line:90%
what you call the shadow.

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:33.374 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:14:33.374 --> 00:14:34.174 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I see.

00:14:34.174 --> 00:14:36.690 align:middle line:84%
>> So we were keeping
that separation.

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And once we could
learn to integrate

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.790 align:middle line:84%
the shadow and the
light within us,

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:43.860 align:middle line:84%
this was a significant
nexus point

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.720 align:middle line:84%
in our fourth
density evolution--

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.310 align:middle line:90%
third fourth density evolution.

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Once we were able to
make that integration,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.600 align:middle line:84%
then the plague healed
itself and our consciousness

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.922 align:middle line:90%
began evolving.

00:14:55.922 --> 00:14:56.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Into fourth density.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:57.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>> And was that a long time ago?

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:03.300 align:middle line:84%
Or time wise, in a
linear sense, are you

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:04.600 align:middle line:90%
able to put a time stamp on it?

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, it's very difficult
because, as you know,

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:08.220 align:middle line:90%
timelines don't line up.

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:09.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:14.050 align:middle line:90%
>> But it was long enough ago--

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:16.740 align:middle line:84%
if we were to pinpoint
a time on your world,

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:24.510 align:middle line:84%
it would have been before
late, late dinosaur time.

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:25.310 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:27.660 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking
thousands of years.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:28.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Millions.

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:29.335 align:middle line:90%
>> Millions of years.

00:15:29.335 --> 00:15:30.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>> In fourth density, right
now, since that evolution to it.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, the timelines
don't line up.

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:36.950 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:37.780 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:38.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I understand.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:42.340 align:middle line:84%
>> It's very-- it's really
impossible to answer.

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:44.260 align:middle line:84%
The evolution--
generally speaking,

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.710 align:middle line:84%
the evolution of
a physical species

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:50.510 align:middle line:84%
does take a very,
very long time.

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:52.100 align:middle line:90%
Now, it depends on the species.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.770 align:middle line:84%
It depends on the
genetic work that's

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:54.920 align:middle line:90%
been done on the species.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.837 align:middle line:84%
It depends on what they're
holding on to, what

00:15:56.837 --> 00:15:58.430 align:middle line:90%
they're willing to let go of.

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:00.440 align:middle line:84%
So everyone's
process is different.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.840 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible for
an individual--

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.870 align:middle line:84%
because I've always--
through this--

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:10.030 align:middle line:84%
these interactions,
I've learned that we all

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:11.680 align:middle line:90%
create our own realities.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible for an
individual to go into a timeline

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:19.870 align:middle line:84%
where the collective
evolution of the species

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:25.150 align:middle line:84%
is accelerated, if the
individual is willing to do

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:26.200 align:middle line:90%
that work, so to say.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And then-- and not
bypass the collective,

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:32.410 align:middle line:84%
but go into a timeline where
that collective evolution

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:33.340 align:middle line:90%
is super fast?

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's really the
only way to change timelines.

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:40.780 align:middle line:84%
It's not-- as you said, it's
not a matter of bypassing,

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.770 align:middle line:90%
it's more a matter of resonance.

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:43.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, OK.

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:47.740 align:middle line:90%
>> So we've given--

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.410 align:middle line:84%
we believe you've
heard it on tape,

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:52.630 align:middle line:84%
we've given a little bit of what
we call the quantum map, which

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:56.590 align:middle line:84%
talks about how the reality
stream or the time stream

00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:59.770 align:middle line:84%
is very similar to like
the blinking of eyes.

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:02.050 align:middle line:84%
You don't notice your
eyes are blinking all day.

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:02.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:04.480 align:middle line:84%
>> But that is
how the physical--

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:08.440 align:middle line:84%
the physical universe continues
to express itself is through

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:10.119 align:middle line:90%
bursts.

00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And each time-- it's like an
in breath and an out breath.

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:16.329 align:middle line:84%
So each time there is
an in breath, which

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:18.730 align:middle line:84%
is like the blinking
of an eye, you

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:22.210 align:middle line:84%
realign with a new
frequency structure.

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:23.410 align:middle line:90%
And that's how time--

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:25.990 align:middle line:84%
that's how you, in a
sense, jump timelines.

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:31.870 align:middle line:84%
We do have to say, though, that
the ego can not direct this

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:32.670 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:33.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:34.150 align:middle line:90%
>> So.

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So, so it's a release of
the ego in order to do that.

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:37.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:42.940 align:middle line:84%
So it's not-- and,
consciously, there's almost--

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:45.800 align:middle line:84%
it's almost-- you can't--
almost can't do it consciously

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:46.600 align:middle line:90%
because of--

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>> --the ego is part of
this conscious mental mind--

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:52.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:53.410 align:middle line:84%
>> --where we have-- where
we're trying to guide,

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:55.115 align:middle line:84%
where we're trying
to steer the ship.

00:17:55.115 --> 00:17:55.915 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:17:55.915 --> 00:17:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And you have to sort of let
go of the steering wheel to get

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:58.090 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:17:58.090 --> 00:17:58.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:02.360 align:middle line:84%
The ego has-- it has
very significant needs.

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And it will always, let's
say, default to those needs--

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:07.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:09.710 align:middle line:84%
>> --before it will default to
the evolution of consciousness.

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:10.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:12.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Because then it
dies, so to speak.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:12.700 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:15.200 align:middle line:84%
>> It's almost like going to
the mountain and doing the hard

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.030 align:middle line:90%
training.

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And, then, you know, after
all the hard training,

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:23.620 align:middle line:84%
you realize that, you know, to
get to this enlightened state,

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.070 align:middle line:90%
there's no training necessary.

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:26.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly, my dear.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.060 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:29.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.950 align:middle line:84%
So it-- I kind of
want to go back

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:35.610 align:middle line:84%
to the Pleiades and
your star system now.

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:38.290 align:middle line:90%


00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:40.250 align:middle line:84%
We have this definition
of the Pleiades--

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:41.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:43.760 align:middle line:84%
>> --of, you know, the--
is it the Six Sisters?

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:44.560 align:middle line:90%
Seven Sisters?

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:45.477 align:middle line:90%
>> Seven Sisters, yes.

00:18:45.477 --> 00:18:46.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Seven Sisters.

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:48.545 align:middle line:84%
And there's obviously--
because if you

00:18:48.545 --> 00:18:50.170 align:middle line:84%
look through a micros--
or a telescope,

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.580 align:middle line:84%
you can see a lot more stars
than just the seven stars

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:53.380 align:middle line:90%
that we see.

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:54.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:57.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And then, obviously,
there's many planets on there.

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:58.420 align:middle line:90%
And is it true?

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:00.420 align:middle line:90%
Is it 444 light years away?

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:01.220 align:middle line:90%
That's--

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:05.290 align:middle line:84%
>> We-- we realize we did take a
tangent off into something else

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:07.030 align:middle line:90%
from what you were asking.

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:08.560 align:middle line:84%
Basically speaking,
we're actually

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.020 align:middle line:84%
going to jump back
and answer part

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:13.870 align:middle line:84%
of this question and the other
question that you had before.

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:18.310 align:middle line:84%
Basically speaking, the beings
that you know of as Pleiadians

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:21.770 align:middle line:84%
are not indigenous to the area
that you know of as Pleiades.

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:22.570 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:23.370 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>> So we have, basically,
two genetic lines.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.450 align:middle line:90%
One comes from the ancient Lyra.

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:30.250 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And one comes from the
ancient Lira combined with

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:34.990 align:middle line:90%
Earth genetics.

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:37.910 align:middle line:84%
That's another story,
perhaps for another time.

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:39.910 align:middle line:84%
So there's two
different lines that

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:43.470 align:middle line:84%
eventually colonized in the area
that you know of as Pleiades.

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:46.210 align:middle line:90%
So not really the Seven Sisters.

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:49.060 align:middle line:84%
However, in the
ancient days, when

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:51.580 align:middle line:84%
my people would visit
your people on Earth,

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:54.520 align:middle line:84%
and we would be asked
where are we from, well,

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.330 align:middle line:84%
if we pointed to
those seven stars--

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:57.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:00.410 align:middle line:84%
>> --in that direction,
they got the point.

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:04.370 align:middle line:84%
I know you said save
it for another day.

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:07.700 align:middle line:84%
But-- because I have
sort of this theory.

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:09.760 align:middle line:90%
And I've been testing it.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to test
it here a little bit.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.390 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>> That every star in the sky
is a potential timeline version

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.720 align:middle line:90%
of humanity that we see.

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:26.590 align:middle line:84%
So in a linear sense,
we're talking--

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:28.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking to a future
version of humanity right now.

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:33.550 align:middle line:84%
That's in one perspective of
a way of looking at things.

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:37.367 align:middle line:84%
And I have a feeling
this other humanity

00:20:37.367 --> 00:20:38.950 align:middle line:84%
version that you
were just speaking of

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:41.770 align:middle line:90%
might be closer to that theory.

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:43.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>> So we don't have to
go into too much depth,

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:52.060 align:middle line:84%
but maybe just briefly touch
on that idea of humanity being

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:58.780 align:middle line:84%
from the Pleiadian
idea mixed with humans?

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, again, here we are with
two different ways to answer

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:01.720 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.520 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:03.322 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:21:03.322 --> 00:21:04.780 align:middle line:84%
There's always two
sides of a coin.

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:05.810 align:middle line:90%
>> There's always-- yes.

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And not necessarily
that they're opposite,

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:10.910 align:middle line:84%
but it's more that one is
linear and one is non-linear.

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:12.130 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, the idea of humanity
being a mixture, well,

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:20.380 align:middle line:84%
of course, it's no surprise to
you that you know that there is

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:21.910 align:middle line:90%
a genetic connection between us.

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:22.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And it comes from many,
many different sources,

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.270 align:middle line:90%
some of which is the Lyran--

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:32.950 align:middle line:84%
the original Lyran
template DNA and Pleiadians

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:33.940 align:middle line:90%
evolving from that.

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And then, also, working
with the genetics on Earth.

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:43.330 align:middle line:84%
But we find this idea
of simply looking

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:45.790 align:middle line:84%
at it genetically
to be extremely

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:51.640 align:middle line:84%
limiting because nobody
is indigenous to anywhere.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:54.500 align:middle line:90%
You are originally one.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:55.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So again, we have
to use metaphor.

00:21:58.210 --> 00:21:59.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>> If you take
holographic film--

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:04.600 align:middle line:84%
and the nature of
holographic film

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:08.800 align:middle line:84%
is that if we were to
take a picture of an apple

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:12.460 align:middle line:84%
and then cut up the
film in tiny pieces,

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:15.910 align:middle line:84%
each tiny little piece would
have the complete image

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:17.150 align:middle line:90%
of the apple.

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter how
small you cut those pieces.

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:20.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>> So consciousness is
fractal in that way.

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:26.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:31.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And therefore, no matter
if you are a lowly human,

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.020 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, on Earth,
here, at this time,

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:40.430 align:middle line:84%
you are fractally and
holographicly every other piece

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:41.230 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:42.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So in that sense, then, the
question is difficult to answer

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:47.660 align:middle line:84%
because our default
setting is not linear.

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:48.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:50.120 align:middle line:90%
>> And yet language is linear.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.820 align:middle line:90%
>> So you mean the Pleiadian--

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:53.195 align:middle line:84%
where you are in
your evolution--

00:22:53.195 --> 00:22:53.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:54.340 align:middle line:90%
>> --is not linear, correct?

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:55.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:55.140 --> 00:23:00.970 align:middle line:84%
>> And in our human
system, our human OS,

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:02.350 align:middle line:90%
is sort of in a linear sense.

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:03.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:05.750 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're trying
to match those.

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:06.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:08.040 align:middle line:90%
But you're really shifting.

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:12.860 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is
that the Pleiadian

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:15.000 align:middle line:90%
is a very feminine energy.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.420 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:18.370 align:middle line:84%
Or is it very balanced,
in that sense?

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:24.760 align:middle line:84%
I always perceived, or
felt, more feminine energy,

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.994 align:middle line:84%
archetypal energy, related
to the Pleiadian energy.

00:23:27.994 --> 00:23:28.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, what you're going
to find with-- again,

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.290 align:middle line:84%
not a simple answer
to the question--

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:36.490 align:middle line:84%
what you're going to
find with my species,

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:38.350 align:middle line:84%
as well as many
of the other core

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:41.620 align:middle line:84%
species in your galactic family,
is that there's generally

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.910 align:middle line:90%
three eras of development.

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:47.690 align:middle line:84%
The first era is more
of the infant species.

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And it is in that
first era where

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:53.860 align:middle line:84%
the issues, let's say, of each
species that need to be healed,

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:55.100 align:middle line:90%
come up.

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:55.940 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
era tends to be

00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:02.020 align:middle line:84%
the healing period when
the integration starts,

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:03.730 align:middle line:90%
the healing happens.

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:07.660 align:middle line:84%
The third era, which is,
of course, the mature era,

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:10.850 align:middle line:84%
is when awakening, as
a species, happens.

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:16.720 align:middle line:84%
So my species,
particularly, is felt

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:21.400 align:middle line:84%
as feminine in all three eras,
which is really interesting.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of rare because
many of the other species

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:25.010 align:middle line:90%
are more felt masculine.

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:26.170 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:30.130 align:middle line:84%
>> But the reason we are felt
more feminine in all three eras

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:31.850 align:middle line:90%
is because as follows.

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:36.700 align:middle line:84%
First era, we already
told you that the tendency

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.790 align:middle line:84%
for my species was to not
want to look at the shadow.

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:43.880 align:middle line:84%
So we were kind of floating
around in the spiritual bubble.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:44.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:51.220 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, which is actually
an unbalanced feminine energy.

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:52.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:53.030 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Then, when you go
to the second era,

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:59.440 align:middle line:84%
and the integration happens,
integration, or the act

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.090 align:middle line:84%
of integration,
by its very nature

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:03.530 align:middle line:84%
is feminine because
it's inclusive.

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:08.860 align:middle line:84%
So all of that integration was
creating a movement inward,

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:11.290 align:middle line:90%
which is a very feminine energy.

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
in the third era,

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:17.320 align:middle line:84%
which is the awakened
era, you have a species

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:21.280 align:middle line:84%
that is very balanced
male female energy that

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:25.000 align:middle line:90%
is in an awakened state.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And to a separated
consciousness on Earth,

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:32.310 align:middle line:90%
that state feels very feminine.

00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:33.522 align:middle line:90%
>> So that's why I--

00:25:33.522 --> 00:25:35.980 align:middle line:84%
we're-- you know, myself and
other people get that feeling.

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And-- and this is going
into some other races,

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.720 align:middle line:90%
but I was told that--

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:46.150 align:middle line:84%
my understanding is
that the Anunnaki

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:53.260 align:middle line:84%
were a hybrid race of Pleiadian
and Draconian energies.

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.930 align:middle line:84%
Is that-- do you see it
from that perspective?

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:56.830 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:58.720 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be a little
bit of a rebel, here.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:25:59.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:04.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Because the word Anunnaki
in your Sumerian language,

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.280 align:middle line:84%
as far as we understand
the definition,

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:07.770 align:middle line:90%
means those who have come down.

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:08.570 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:11.517 align:middle line:84%
>> So Anunnaki is
meaning, basically,

00:26:11.517 --> 00:26:12.850 align:middle line:90%
those who came from the heavens.

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:13.650 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:15.070 align:middle line:90%
>> So they were not one species.

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>> They were many.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:17.320 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:18.550 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK.

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:20.350 align:middle line:84%
That-- well, that clears
up a lot of stuff.

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:21.850 align:middle line:90%
A lot of questions I had.

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:25.810 align:middle line:84%
>> So that-- that
is interesting.

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:27.790 align:middle line:84%
You know, we were trying
to figure out why--

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:31.390 align:middle line:84%
where did the Anunnaki
get all this DNA

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:38.450 align:middle line:84%
for their enslavement game
of, you know, making--

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:42.855 align:middle line:84%
the old story of enslaving--
making humans for slaves--

00:26:42.855 --> 00:26:43.655 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:43.655 --> 00:26:44.530 align:middle line:90%
>> --for mining gold.

00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was only one
particular family that did

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:48.710 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:52.220 align:middle line:84%
>> But as you know, they're the
ones that get the bad rap, yes?

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:53.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:53.500 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:55.360 align:middle line:84%
>> The rotten apple
spoils the bunch.

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.370 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:02.410 align:middle line:84%
So speaking of DNA and when that
race of beings, or that family,

00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:08.140 align:middle line:84%
took all these various DNAs
from different star systems

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:16.600 align:middle line:84%
and created the human
structure, is there,

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.190 align:middle line:84%
I guess, protocols-- or
galactic protocols that says,

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.990 align:middle line:90%
hey, wait a minute.

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:21.640 align:middle line:84%
You can't take that
DNA if you're going

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.765 align:middle line:90%
to use it for that purpose.

00:27:22.765 --> 00:27:25.280 align:middle line:90%


00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.660 align:middle line:84%
You know, I would imagine
that there would be something

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:30.490 align:middle line:90%
of that sort going on.

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:37.030 align:middle line:84%
Unless-- in the sense
of enslavement--

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:38.560 align:middle line:84%
how did that work
in the beginning?

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Or was there this--
again, this--

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:43.340 align:middle line:84%
there had to be an
agreement of sorts,

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:44.110 align:middle line:84%
otherwise it wouldn't
have happened.

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Of course, there's
always an agreement.

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:46.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>> However, again,
we have to say that--

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:55.930 align:middle line:84%
we have to look at it from
a non-human perspective.

00:27:55.930 --> 00:28:03.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're quite familiar with
other channeled information

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:05.530 align:middle line:84%
and such talking
about, basically,

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:08.080 align:middle line:84%
if something is happening,
or something is arising,

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.770 align:middle line:90%
there must be a higher purpose.

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And that is not, in any
way, meant to be a cop out.

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:13.840 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.700 align:middle line:84%
It's simply the way
the universe works.

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:16.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:17.750 align:middle line:90%
>> There is no mistakes--

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:18.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:20.050 align:middle line:90%
>> --in creation.

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:22.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, in those
ancient days, we have

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:26.980 align:middle line:84%
to say that your Earth,
or your solar system,

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:29.680 align:middle line:84%
could be likened to what you
call the wild, wild west.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:30.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.480 align:middle line:84%
Feels like that
today, still, but--

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yes, it is.

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:35.110 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:37.030 align:middle line:84%
But it's a little bit
more colonized now.

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:37.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:41.710 align:middle line:90%
>> So it was an isolated place.

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And because of that
isolation, a lot went on,

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:49.900 align:middle line:84%
that was very fragmented
with groups, one group having

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:53.980 align:middle line:84%
one agenda, one group having
another agenda and conflicts

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:55.450 align:middle line:90%
and things such as that.

00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:59.200 align:middle line:84%
All because these
forefathers of yours

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.480 align:middle line:90%
were a very young species.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:04.570 align:middle line:84%
This doesn't happen
with older species.

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:06.390 align:middle line:90%
Only with younger ones.

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:08.530 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:12.250 align:middle line:84%
So you sort of answered
the question earlier,

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:15.385 align:middle line:84%
that, yes, there was some
sort of higher purpose.

00:29:15.385 --> 00:29:17.960 align:middle line:90%


00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, these other
races sort of lend their DNA

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:24.070 align:middle line:90%
for this higher purpose.

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:25.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:28.755 align:middle line:84%
>> It wasn't stolen or
taken and put-- you know,

00:29:28.755 --> 00:29:32.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go drug the
Arcturian and then grab some

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:33.800 align:middle line:90%
DNA or some mojo--

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:34.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.475 align:middle line:84%
That makes a wonderful
science fiction movie.

00:29:36.475 --> 00:29:37.275 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:29:37.275 --> 00:29:39.160 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's not quite
the way things work.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:39.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that we've
said to many people, sometimes,

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:47.860 align:middle line:84%
that ask questions about this
is that from the perspective

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:50.410 align:middle line:84%
outside of the Earth, or from
a fourth density perspective,

00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:55.360 align:middle line:84%
let's say, this idea of the
sharing of DNA and the shaping

00:29:55.360 --> 00:30:01.990 align:middle line:84%
of cultures using DNA is
actually a very natural

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:03.500 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.000 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like pollination--

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:05.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.240 align:middle line:90%
>> --on your world.

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at
it-- when you remove

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:14.450 align:middle line:90%
the victim-perpetrator idea--

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:15.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>> --which is really only
applicable in a very polarized

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:23.890 align:middle line:84%
third density reality, then
the whole paradigm changes,

00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:24.690 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:25.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:28.580 align:middle line:84%
>> But the question,
then, is why?

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:32.030 align:middle line:84%
Why do people have
these experiences

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:34.260 align:middle line:84%
of being a victim and
things such as that.

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:35.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:37.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Why do those
buttons get pushed?

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:40.795 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you are a
third-density species,

00:30:40.795 --> 00:30:42.170 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, you
can say there are

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:45.350 align:middle line:84%
many passages, spiritual
passages, that you

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:48.710 align:middle line:84%
have to go through in order
to evolve your consciousness

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:50.600 align:middle line:90%
on the way to fourth density.

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:55.610 align:middle line:84%
One of those passages has
to do with the healing

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:59.960 align:middle line:84%
of the clinging to the idea
of victim and perpetrator.

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And many civilizations get
stuck there for millennia.

00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
have-- well, we're

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:08.750 align:middle line:84%
bringing in another
tangent, here.

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:09.550 align:middle line:90%
>> No, that's fine.

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>> But when you have the
situation with the Zetas

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:17.450 align:middle line:84%
and the so-called abductions,
it triggered the same issues

00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:21.710 align:middle line:84%
humanity has been playing out
for so many thousands of years,

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:24.080 align:middle line:90%
but this time from space.

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.010 align:middle line:90%
Are there victims?

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:26.600 align:middle line:90%
Are there perpetrators?

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And on the individual
level of those

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:34.790 align:middle line:84%
who were claiming abduction,
the reason it's happening

00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:37.148 align:middle line:84%
is because they have to
pass through that gate

00:31:37.148 --> 00:31:38.690 align:middle line:84%
in order to shift
their consciousness

00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:41.120 align:middle line:84%
and integrate the polarity
within themselves.

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And then, on a
collective level, it

00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:46.670 align:middle line:84%
happens on a collective
level, as well,

00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:49.310 align:middle line:90%
that changing of the paradigm.

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, a passage
into fourth density

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:56.060 align:middle line:84%
can be made, or one of
the steps of the passage.

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:58.760 align:middle line:84%
>> So without the
Zeta abduction,

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:03.680 align:middle line:84%
temporary detainment,
experience, then,

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:07.040 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't even have the
opportunity to heal that wound

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:08.280 align:middle line:90%
to move into fourth density.

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.222 align:middle line:84%
Or you would have
re-created something else.

00:32:11.222 --> 00:32:12.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Some other scenario.

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:12.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, we would have.

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.180 align:middle line:84%
But at least we got
to have it in that way

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:18.980 align:middle line:84%
so we could connect
to our cosmic family.

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:19.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:26.270 align:middle line:84%
>> As opposed to, you know,
making another story on Earth.

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, because in the
Orion civilization,

00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:33.960 align:middle line:84%
they didn't create that-- the
healing of that through the ET

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:34.760 align:middle line:90%
contact.

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:37.100 align:middle line:84%
They created it through
a domineering empire.

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:37.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:39.740 align:middle line:90%
And that was the Orion Wars?

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:41.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:46.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Was-- was the Pleiadian--
your society involved in those

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.390 align:middle line:90%
wars?

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:50.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Shamefully, yes.

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:51.060 align:middle line:90%
We're making a joke.

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:57.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, again, those
conflicts lasted for a very,

00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:58.320 align:middle line:90%
very long time.

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:03.180 align:middle line:84%
So there was a period of time,
when my species was very young,

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:07.540 align:middle line:84%
that our mindset was
kind of like a teenager

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:09.390 align:middle line:90%
in your human counting.

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:12.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, gung ho, do this,
jump in without thinking

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:13.360 align:middle line:90%
of the consequences.

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:14.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.640 align:middle line:90%
>> And so we did that.

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And as you say in
your vernacular,

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:20.350 align:middle line:90%
got our asses kicked.

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And that brought up
the issues of the guilt

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:27.660 align:middle line:84%
and all that kind of stuff that
we had to work on as a species

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:29.340 align:middle line:90%
in order to make our shift.

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:33.690 align:middle line:84%
So in that way, there's
nothing extraneous.

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:38.075 align:middle line:84%
>> So now, obviously, that
period of time is over

00:33:38.075 --> 00:33:41.820 align:middle line:90%
and, hopefully, the Orion--

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:42.620 align:middle line:90%
and we say now.

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And obviously time--
and I guess, you know,

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:48.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm just-- where you
are with your evolution,

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:49.640 align:middle line:90%
you've cleared that up.

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:50.682 align:middle line:90%
You've been through that.

00:33:50.682 --> 00:33:53.810 align:middle line:84%
You've had this-- we have the
story of the Orion Wars to tell

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:55.470 align:middle line:90%
to-- so we can keep--

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:56.270 align:middle line:90%
you heal--

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:56.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:57.920 align:middle line:90%
>> --some future generations.

00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:00.050 align:middle line:84%
Because hey, we've been
there, we've done that.

00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And there are some residuals
finishing up on your world,

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:05.840 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:06.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:07.460 align:middle line:90%
With the Orion Wars.

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:07.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:08.710 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:11.665 align:middle line:90%
And because again-- so I've--

00:34:11.665 --> 00:34:13.040 align:middle line:84%
you know, I've
heard this analogy

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:16.520 align:middle line:84%
that everything that's
happening on Earth is sort of--

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:18.050 align:middle line:90%
the micro and the macro, so--

00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:19.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>> --you know, if we go
back just 20 years maybe

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:25.580 align:middle line:84%
in our timeline, then the Orion
Wars are still happening kind

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:28.429 align:middle line:84%
of in a way, depending on which
timeline we're in, I guess.

00:34:28.429 --> 00:34:33.650 align:middle line:84%
>> It really depends on what
you are connecting with,

00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:34.520 align:middle line:90%
energetically.

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And so that-- instead of looking
at it from a linear sense,

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:42.120 align:middle line:84%
the vibrational frequency
of where we're at,

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:43.913 align:middle line:84%
if we're vibrating
at that frequency,

00:34:43.913 --> 00:34:45.830 align:middle line:84%
then, yes, the Orion
Wars are still happening.

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:46.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:47.510 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:50.540 align:middle line:84%
>> For instance, people in your
world who live in the Middle

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:56.280 align:middle line:84%
East, who are embroiled in
extreme polarity and extreme

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.080 align:middle line:90%
control--

00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:59.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:04.030 align:middle line:84%
>> --are directly connecting,
still, to that era of Orion.

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:04.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Whereas, perhaps, you,
in your daily life, are not.

00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:10.110 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:14.060 align:middle line:84%
So instead of seeing time
linearly in that sense,

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:15.810 align:middle line:84%
it's just more of a
vibrational frequency.

00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:17.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, and it's very fluid.

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:18.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And that-- so we can sort of see
time in our daily lives, too.

00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And if we can see everything
as a vibrational frequency,

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:30.570 align:middle line:84%
then, maybe we can get through,
navigate through this frequency

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:33.070 align:middle line:84%
soup, I like to call
it, a little bit easier.

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:33.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:34.990 align:middle line:90%
You're in a very--

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:37.560 align:middle line:84%
as you well know, you're in
a very interesting time right

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:41.520 align:middle line:84%
now, because in a sense you have
one foot in third density, one

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:42.450 align:middle line:90%
foot in fourth.

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:45.660 align:middle line:84%
You're taking the foot
out of third density.

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:48.210 align:middle line:84%
But because it's a
spectrum, and there's

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:50.880 align:middle line:84%
a gradation as the
energy changes,

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:53.010 align:middle line:84%
you're still going
to have challenges

00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:55.455 align:middle line:84%
with the old way of doing
things as the new structures are

00:35:55.455 --> 00:35:56.255 align:middle line:90%
arising.

00:35:56.255 --> 00:35:57.055 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:35:57.055 --> 00:36:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is really the most
tenuous time and also the most

00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:01.200 align:middle line:90%
challenging one.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:05.500 align:middle line:90%
But also the most--

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:06.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Exciting.

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:10.890 align:middle line:84%
>> --exciting because the
shift, the daily shifts,

00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:14.190 align:middle line:84%
are happening at such an
exponential rate that we really

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:15.580 align:middle line:90%
can take notice.

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:16.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:17.790 align:middle line:90%
>> And see these changes.

00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:18.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:20.810 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's exciting.

00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:21.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly, yes.

00:36:21.610 --> 00:36:21.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Exciting.

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's exciting
for us to watch, too.

00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:24.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:25.550 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:28.365 align:middle line:90%


00:36:28.365 --> 00:36:31.785 align:middle line:90%
With that said, there's this--

00:36:31.785 --> 00:36:34.300 align:middle line:90%


00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:36.930 align:middle line:84%
I was going to save this for
later, but we're getting--

00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:39.840 align:middle line:84%
we're having this conversation
with Lisa and Ron,

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.540 align:middle line:84%
earlier, about the-- we
call it the Mandela Effect,

00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:47.790 align:middle line:84%
is the internet terminology
for what seems to be,

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:51.600 align:middle line:84%
from one perspective, a
shifting of timelines.

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:52.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:54.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's almost
now been labeled.

00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:57.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have a
collective name for it.

00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing pieces
in our history shifting

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:02.610 align:middle line:90%
from the way we remember it.

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:03.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:07.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And we're going back and
reviewing movies and tangible,

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:10.510 align:middle line:84%
physical things, that the
way we remembered them,

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:11.730 align:middle line:90%
they weren't that way before.

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:12.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:15.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this the actual
shifting of timelines?

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:17.880 align:middle line:90%
>> It is the you--

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:21.340 align:middle line:84%
as we were just talking about a
moment ago, time is more fluid.

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:22.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>> When you are rooted,
let's say, in third density,

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:32.590 align:middle line:84%
time feels and is perceived
as being more fixed.

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:36.660 align:middle line:84%
But now you're moving more
into a fluid sense of time.

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And that means,
then, that you are--

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:41.950 align:middle line:90%
again, it's a metaphor.

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:43.280 align:middle line:90%
It's the limit of the language.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>> You are spending more
time in the quantum state

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:50.500 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness where
all possibilities exist.

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:51.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:53.527 align:middle line:90%
>> And you are, thus, able to--

00:37:53.527 --> 00:37:55.860 align:middle line:84%
remember, we were talking
about the blinking in and out,

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:56.950 align:middle line:90%
or the in and out breath.

00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:57.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:37:57.750 --> 00:38:04.470 align:middle line:84%
>> You are able to shift the
timelines much more rapidly.

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:06.840 align:middle line:84%
But in the past
when you did it, you

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:09.000 align:middle line:84%
didn't remember
the previous one.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.210 align:middle line:84%
But now, as you are spending
more time in the quantum,

00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:15.090 align:middle line:84%
you're becoming more
familiar and comfortable

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:18.660 align:middle line:84%
with that energy, that
you're starting to remember

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:21.240 align:middle line:90%
the other parallels.

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Not in a schizophrenic
way, but in a way

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:27.270 align:middle line:90%
that's meant to just tell--

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:28.770 align:middle line:90%
that's meant to just show you--

00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:29.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:33.493 align:middle line:84%
>> --look how fluid you are
becoming, you are unlocking.

00:38:33.493 --> 00:38:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's where the
excitement-- you know,

00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:35.670 align:middle line:90%
this is--

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:36.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:39.360 align:middle line:84%
So now, you're beginning
to see that the future--

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:41.350 align:middle line:84%
you've always seen
the future as fluid,

00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:43.590 align:middle line:84%
but now, you're seeing
the past as fluid, too.

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:45.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And-- and we can rewrite
the story if we want to.

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:51.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, but the ego can
never rewrite anything.

00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:52.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, the ego.

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:53.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes, ah, the ego.

00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:38:56.790 --> 00:39:00.910 align:middle line:84%
>> This is where people who do
manifestation work get stuck.

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, yes.

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:03.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Because the ego
takes over the show.

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:04.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:06.140 align:middle line:90%
I can see that.

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:08.100 align:middle line:90%
I can absolutely see that.

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:11.230 align:middle line:84%
So we want to rewrite the
story, but we can't really

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:12.030 align:middle line:90%
rewrite the story.

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:14.285 align:middle line:90%
We just have to--

00:39:14.285 --> 00:39:16.410 align:middle line:84%
we can't rewrite the past
story, but we can rewrite

00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:18.340 align:middle line:90%
the now story with our choices.

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:19.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:20.580 align:middle line:90%
You can rewrite the now story.

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:22.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we talk about now,
we're talking about now.

00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:24.360 align:middle line:90%
>> And now.

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:24.630 align:middle line:90%
And now.

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:26.030 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking about
one second from now.

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:26.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:27.530 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:31.980 align:middle line:84%
So the only thing, then,
that you have in the now

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:33.970 align:middle line:90%
is your experience of the now.

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:34.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>> So therefore, what you
are really rewriting is

00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:38.710 align:middle line:90%
your experience of the now--

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:39.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:42.540 align:middle line:84%
>> --which really has to do with
your interpretation of the now.

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>> And that, depending
on that interpretation,

00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:47.210 align:middle line:84%
will set us on a specific
vibrational frequency.

00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:48.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:50.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And then, depending on
that vibrational frequency,

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:52.570 align:middle line:90%
we see the past rewrite itself.

00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:53.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:56.470 align:middle line:84%
So if your interpretation of the
now is one of victimization--

00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:58.770 align:middle line:84%
>> --guess what
you're going to get.

00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:02.850 align:middle line:84%
>> We're going to get a past
history of Zetas abducting you

00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:04.180 align:middle line:90%
every night against your will.

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:04.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:07.380 align:middle line:84%
>> And if you are at a
vibrational frequency

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:10.320 align:middle line:84%
of non-victimization,
empowerment, then,

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:15.060 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be going on the
ships and donating your stuff

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:17.320 align:middle line:84%
instead of actually being
taken against your will.

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:20.760 align:middle line:90%
And even-- getting out--

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:23.460 align:middle line:84%
getting out of the ET stuff--
even we're talking about,

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:25.180 align:middle line:84%
is your boss picking
on you at work?

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:25.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:27.870 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're even talking
about the human stuff here.

00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:28.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:29.090 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:30.728 align:middle line:84%
And then, shifting
that perspective,

00:40:30.728 --> 00:40:33.020 align:middle line:84%
shifting that now moment,
now all of a sudden your boss

00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:38.613 align:middle line:84%
is not picking on you, but got
a greater plan or, you know,

00:40:38.613 --> 00:40:39.780 align:middle line:90%
something, some other story.

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:40.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And this brings in
the whole other aspect

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:47.520 align:middle line:84%
of the emotional body because
the ego, the insidious ego--

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.560 align:middle line:84%
we say that with love
because the ego is simply

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:51.060 align:middle line:90%
a neutral mechanism.

00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:53.670 align:middle line:84%
But the insidious ego
will continue its dialogue

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:56.580 align:middle line:84%
with you that will
tell you, well,

00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:59.760 align:middle line:84%
if you're not shifting this
now, you're not very spiritual.

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:00.780 align:middle line:90%
You're bad.

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:01.850 align:middle line:90%
You're failing.

00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And that that just
further entrenches--

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:05.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:07.050 align:middle line:90%
>> --the anchor of the ego.

00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's just a big lesson
of allowance and acceptance.

00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:10.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:11.700 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:13.270 align:middle line:90%
>> And just being, really.

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:16.360 align:middle line:90%
And not the knee jerk reactions.

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:17.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And watching yourself
so that you can

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:22.000 align:middle line:90%
see your habits and patterns.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's the key
to your freedom.

00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:28.660 align:middle line:90%
>> And by-- you're right, I see.

00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:32.687 align:middle line:84%
And by embracing those
emotions when they come,

00:41:32.687 --> 00:41:34.020 align:middle line:90%
as opposed to pushing them away.

00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:34.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:40.990 align:middle line:84%
So I was wondering in our
native cultures, in the past,

00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:42.900 align:middle line:90%
we have had--

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:47.880 align:middle line:84%
across the world we've had,
obviously, we've had pyramids,

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:54.090 align:middle line:84%
and we've had native
cultures with high ideals.

00:41:54.090 --> 00:42:00.300 align:middle line:84%
Native American Indians,
Peruvian, Amazonian tribes

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:03.510 align:middle line:84%
that have really, when
we look at it now,

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:09.220 align:middle line:84%
a highly evolved sense
of being and way of life.

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:10.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:14.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Were those cultures,
where those beings,

00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:15.820 align:middle line:90%
at a higher density?

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:17.470 align:middle line:90%
Were they fourth density?

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:18.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Well.

00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:20.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Or were they still third?

00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:22.030 align:middle line:90%
>> It depends on the era.

00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:22.830 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:26.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Because civilizations
have a tendency--

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:30.210 align:middle line:84%
physical civilizations will
have a tendency of cycling from

00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:32.980 align:middle line:84%
third to fourth density,
sometimes repeating it.

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:33.780 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:37.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Until the time is
right for the shift.

00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:38.130 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:38.970 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:42.270 align:middle line:84%
But you're going to find that
with the indigenous species

00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:45.210 align:middle line:84%
on your planet, or
the indigenous races,

00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:50.940 align:middle line:84%
excuse us, on your planet that
even though they are halfway

00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:52.690 align:middle line:84%
around the world
from each other,

00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:55.270 align:middle line:90%
your struck by the similarities.

00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:56.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:42:56.070 --> 00:43:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And pyramids and practices
and things such as that.

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:01.810 align:middle line:90%
Two main reasons for this.

00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:07.050 align:middle line:84%
One is because of the
ET influence, of course.

00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:13.260 align:middle line:84%
Another is because a lot of
those structures and practices

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:19.790 align:middle line:84%
came from Vegan mysticism,
which came to Earth from Mars,

00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:20.700 align:middle line:90%
originally.

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:21.500 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:25.500 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's why there is--
if you could really see

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:27.390 align:middle line:84%
the history of
your solar system,

00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:30.270 align:middle line:90%
you would see the continuity.

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:31.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, the linear--

00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:33.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And then, going all
the way back to Vega.

00:43:33.730 --> 00:43:34.530 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:37.270 align:middle line:84%
So the Vegans, did
they colonize Mars?

00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:38.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:40.830 align:middle line:84%
>> They colonized
Mars very early on.

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:44.010 align:middle line:84%
They colonized Mars
well before the Earth

00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:45.720 align:middle line:90%
was even stable for colonies.

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:50.310 align:middle line:90%
And the destruction of Mars--

00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:52.050 align:middle line:90%
I've heard that there was--

00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:53.820 align:middle line:84%
some say there was
a nuclear event.

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:57.390 align:middle line:90%
There was-- where--

00:43:57.390 --> 00:44:00.090 align:middle line:84%
or is that just because of
the density that we're in,

00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:01.930 align:middle line:90%
we perceive it that way?

00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:02.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:44:02.730 --> 00:44:04.920 align:middle line:84%
Actually, we've given
a session on this,

00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:08.100 align:middle line:84%
but Germaine, who
gave the session,

00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:11.920 align:middle line:84%
has never really spoken
specifically about it.

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:17.610 align:middle line:84%
However, what he has said
is that there were a--

00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:20.010 align:middle line:90%
there was a series of events.

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:23.070 align:middle line:84%
Some were cataclysmic
with asteroids and things

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:23.870 align:middle line:90%
such as that.

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:25.140 align:middle line:90%
Some were political.

00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:28.750 align:middle line:84%
Some things-- so everything, a
perfect storm, you might say.

00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:31.120 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:35.100 align:middle line:84%
There's the idea or
the talk of Meldek

00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:37.680 align:middle line:84%
being a planet within
our solar system

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:39.910 align:middle line:84%
that now makes up
the Kuiper Belt.

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:43.150 align:middle line:90%
Similar history to Mars.

00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:43.950 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:46.562 align:middle line:84%
I was going to say, did Mars
come after the destruction of--

00:44:46.562 --> 00:44:47.770 align:middle line:90%
did Mars-- does destruction--

00:44:47.770 --> 00:44:48.600 align:middle line:90%
>> It was parallel.

00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:49.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Parallel, OK.

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:55.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And then, our moon, did
it come from the Meldek

00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:57.300 align:middle line:90%
civilization?

00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:01.860 align:middle line:84%
Or is that-- because I've
heard different variations

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:05.880 align:middle line:84%
of the moon being
artificial, put into place.

00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:09.040 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not artificial, per
se, but it's been, let's say,

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:09.840 align:middle line:90%
terraformed.

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:10.185 align:middle line:90%
>> Terraformed.

00:45:10.185 --> 00:45:10.530 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:11.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:14.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Was it native to our planet?

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:16.280 align:middle line:90%
Or was it sort of put there?

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:17.610 align:middle line:90%
>> It was not native.

00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:19.070 align:middle line:90%
Let's say, it was a wanderer.

00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:19.870 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:21.412 align:middle line:84%
A wanderer and it
found its position.

00:45:21.412 --> 00:45:22.212 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:22.212 --> 00:45:23.100 align:middle line:90%
>> And it fixed.

00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:23.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:24.320 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:29.310 align:middle line:84%
Was there-- so is
it its own celestial

00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:30.620 align:middle line:90%
being with consciousness?

00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:31.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:31.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Light?

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:32.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:35.670 align:middle line:84%
>> When we think of artificial,
we think that there's been some

00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:39.300 align:middle line:90%
sort of outside manipulation--

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:40.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:41.730 align:middle line:90%
>> --done to it.

00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>> But even that outside
artificial manipulation,

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:49.210 align:middle line:84%
in a way, is still part
of that consciousness.

00:45:49.210 --> 00:45:50.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:53.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Like Earth right now, we're
making genetically-modified

00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:57.430 align:middle line:84%
foods and chemically enhancing
and doing all kinds of things.

00:45:57.430 --> 00:46:00.230 align:middle line:84%
But it's still
naturally artificial.

00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:01.030 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:02.140 align:middle line:90%
>> There you go.

00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:02.940 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:04.390 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean
it's not harmful--

00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:05.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:06.360 align:middle line:90%
>> --necessarily.

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:10.680 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, it's the whole
idea of what consciousness is.

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:15.000 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness
permeates everything,

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.290 align:middle line:84%
so can you ever take a slice
and make it not consciousness?

00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:20.115 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:46:20.115 --> 00:46:20.915 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:46:20.915 --> 00:46:23.880 align:middle line:84%
>> It's just a difference of
whether it's dormant or aware

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:27.520 align:middle line:90%
of itself or not.

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:29.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, in terms of
planets, however--

00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:30.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:46:30.110 --> 00:46:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>> --and especially suns, you're
going to find that what you

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:42.870 align:middle line:84%
call the core of the planet
or the sun is an entry point--

00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:46.330 align:middle line:84%
exit and entry
point, dimensionally.

00:46:46.330 --> 00:46:52.380 align:middle line:84%
So this is why celestial
bodies have consciousness.

00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:54.960 align:middle line:84%
Because the consciousness,
literally the consciousness

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:57.510 align:middle line:84%
of creation, breathes
itself in and out

00:46:57.510 --> 00:47:00.150 align:middle line:84%
through those
portals in the center

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:04.380 align:middle line:84%
of the core of whether
it's a sun or a planet.

00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:06.495 align:middle line:90%
So-- and we're talking--

00:47:06.495 --> 00:47:08.120 align:middle line:84%
you know, we're not
necessarily talking

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:09.690 align:middle line:90%
about a rock flying in space.

00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:10.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:13.400 align:middle line:84%
>> We're talking more about
a planetary body that even

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:15.440 align:middle line:84%
perhaps has a slight
gravitational field.

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:18.210 align:middle line:90%


00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:19.660 align:middle line:90%
>> So the weather--

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:22.950 align:middle line:84%
which most planetary bodies
do have a gravitational field.

00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:28.225 align:middle line:84%
>> And I love that we're
going into area I wasn't even

00:47:28.225 --> 00:47:29.025 align:middle line:90%
planning to go to.

00:47:29.025 --> 00:47:30.810 align:middle line:90%
>> We can feel your excitement.

00:47:30.810 --> 00:47:34.230 align:middle line:90%
>> So this idea that the--

00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:36.400 align:middle line:84%
was it-- I don't know
if it was Einstein.

00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:43.830 align:middle line:84%
The size of the celestial object
dictates the gravitational

00:47:43.830 --> 00:47:49.420 align:middle line:84%
field on one sense is correct,
but I've sort of seen gravity

00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:55.900 align:middle line:84%
as electric, and not
necessary-- well,

00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:58.530 align:middle line:84%
I guess the whole universe
is electric in that sense,

00:47:58.530 --> 00:48:04.930 align:middle line:84%
electricity, but that doesn't
necessarily mean the size

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:05.950 align:middle line:90%
of the--

00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:07.610 align:middle line:90%
is that true across all planets?

00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:08.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:10.190 align:middle line:84%
It's not really
dictated by size.

00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:14.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Because gravity has much
more to it than just the size

00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:15.550 align:middle line:90%
factor.

00:48:15.550 --> 00:48:16.400 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:17.200 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:18.932 align:middle line:84%
That's sort of what
I was wanting to ask

00:48:18.932 --> 00:48:20.890 align:middle line:84%
and I was-- hard to
formulate a question there.

00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:25.600 align:middle line:84%
But yes, so gravitational
pull doesn't necessarily--

00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:28.240 align:middle line:90%


00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:30.340 align:middle line:84%
mass doesn't necessarily
dictate the strength

00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:31.510 align:middle line:90%
of the gravitational pull.

00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:48:32.310 --> 00:48:33.430 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:34.230 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:36.780 align:middle line:84%
>> More often than not,
you'll see the correlation.

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:36.964 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:48:36.964 --> 00:48:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>> But it doesn't mean one
is caused by the other.

00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:39.310 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:40.600 align:middle line:90%
That's what I thought.

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And in our sun's case,
as you were saying,

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:50.760 align:middle line:84%
it's sort of a portal
and we're getting--

00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:55.890 align:middle line:84%
that's our life
force is the sun.

00:48:55.890 --> 00:49:01.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we were to move
to another solar body

00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:04.080 align:middle line:90%
galaxy, or solar system, and--

00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:10.120 align:middle line:90%
would we then shift our being?

00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:12.310 align:middle line:90%
Would we no longer become human?

00:49:12.310 --> 00:49:14.440 align:middle line:90%
Would we become a new--

00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:16.480 align:middle line:84%
because now we're getting
our energy downloads

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:21.260 align:middle line:84%
from a new celestial being,
would we become a new species?

00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:22.060 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:23.780 align:middle line:84%
So this is definitely
hypothetical.

00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:24.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:27.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Because at this point,
humans cannot go and try out--

00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:30.490 align:middle line:90%
>> And try it out, yes.

00:49:30.490 --> 00:49:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And also because
of the limitation

00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:37.540 align:middle line:84%
of human consciousness to
traverse space right now.

00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:40.450 align:middle line:84%
Because right now,
human consciousness

00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:43.150 align:middle line:84%
is tied to the
gravitational field

00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:45.860 align:middle line:90%
of its planet and its sun.

00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is a metaphor--
a macrocosmic metaphor

00:49:50.730 --> 00:49:55.430 align:middle line:84%
for how the ego is the
anchor for you on a planet.

00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:56.230 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Because the ego is
like a black hole.

00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:01.460 align:middle line:90%
Same function, so to speak.

00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:04.750 align:middle line:84%
However, as you move into fourth
density, deeper and deeper

00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:09.160 align:middle line:84%
into fourth density, and
the anchor that is ego

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:13.570 align:middle line:84%
and individuality becomes
metaphorically lighter,

00:50:13.570 --> 00:50:15.580 align:middle line:84%
therefore, you're
able, in a sense,

00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:18.130 align:middle line:84%
to escape the
gravitational field

00:50:18.130 --> 00:50:21.160 align:middle line:84%
and not be influenced
so much by it.

00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:24.880 align:middle line:84%
So space travel becomes
no longer traveling

00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:26.860 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of space.

00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:29.800 align:middle line:84%
It, instead, becomes
traveling through space

00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:36.020 align:middle line:84%
or becoming one with space in
a very, very different way.

00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:39.065 align:middle line:84%
So we had to lay that
groundwork in order

00:50:39.065 --> 00:50:40.065 align:middle line:90%
to answer your question.

00:50:40.065 --> 00:50:40.865 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:50:40.865 --> 00:50:42.050 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Right now, if you were to be
picked up and taken to another

00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:53.040 align:middle line:84%
planet in another solar
system, it would be very,

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:56.340 align:middle line:84%
very hard to make
the adaptation.

00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:57.140 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:57.940 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:50:57.940 --> 00:51:02.540 align:middle line:84%
But if you were more
deeper into fourth density

00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:07.610 align:middle line:84%
in terms of your evolution, thus
your egoic anchor was lighter,

00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:11.750 align:middle line:84%
it would be easier for you
to go through a metamorphosis

00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:15.425 align:middle line:84%
if you were planted, so to
speak, in another solar system.

00:51:15.425 --> 00:51:17.450 align:middle line:90%
It would be easier.

00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:18.860 align:middle line:90%
>> And is that--

00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:21.770 align:middle line:84%
going to the hybrid
programs for the Zetas--

00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:29.190 align:middle line:84%
is that-- part of that
creating new beings, so to say,

00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:31.680 align:middle line:84%
and populating new planets
and new star systems,

00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:35.460 align:middle line:84%
or new solar systems,
with new DNA?

00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:36.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:39.270 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the reasons
why hybridization

00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:46.840 align:middle line:84%
is the better chosen
method than colonization.

00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:47.640 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:50.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Unless the circumstances
are such that where

00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:52.500 align:middle line:84%
you're colonizing
is very similar--

00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:53.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:56.650 align:middle line:84%
>> --hybridization is
much more appropriate,

00:51:56.650 --> 00:52:01.050 align:middle line:84%
which is why the original Lyrans
in the very ancient times began

00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:05.070 align:middle line:84%
the programs on Earth,
the genetic work on Earth,

00:52:05.070 --> 00:52:08.010 align:middle line:84%
because they needed to
create that hybridization

00:52:08.010 --> 00:52:09.780 align:middle line:90%
for their future incarnations.

00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:12.510 align:middle line:84%
Colonization was not
a comfortable option.

00:52:12.510 --> 00:52:13.620 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:15.070 align:middle line:90%
So when we even--

00:52:15.070 --> 00:52:17.160 align:middle line:84%
what if it was within
our solar system,

00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:20.730 align:middle line:84%
like Mars, if we were to
go to Mars or go to Venus?

00:52:20.730 --> 00:52:21.810 align:middle line:90%
Is that a--

00:52:21.810 --> 00:52:24.190 align:middle line:90%
>> It would be easier.

00:52:24.190 --> 00:52:28.230 align:middle line:84%
However-- and again, we're
speaking metaphorically.

00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:31.140 align:middle line:84%
This is basically-- we're going
to make this simple so you

00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:33.430 align:middle line:90%
understand, but let's say that--

00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:36.660 align:middle line:84%
let's say each of the
planets represents

00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:39.720 align:middle line:90%
an energy of a chakra, OK?

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:42.030 align:middle line:90%
Earth being solar plexus chakra.

00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, then, that you
moved to another planet that

00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:49.290 align:middle line:90%
represents another chakra.

00:52:49.290 --> 00:52:51.450 align:middle line:84%
Basically, what you're
going to experience

00:52:51.450 --> 00:52:56.070 align:middle line:84%
is a similar structure, but
the aspects of that chakra

00:52:56.070 --> 00:52:57.670 align:middle line:90%
will need to come into play--

00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:58.470 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:52:58.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>> --more or be activated more.

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's the kind
of the system--

00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:05.640 align:middle line:84%
the macrocosmic system
in a given solar system.

00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:06.880 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And if we were to do
that, we would need,

00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:13.450 align:middle line:84%
probably, technology
to aid in that life

00:53:13.450 --> 00:53:16.230 align:middle line:84%
force sustaining, you know, not
just air and everything else,

00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:18.130 align:middle line:90%
but, energetically, we would--

00:53:18.130 --> 00:53:18.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:18.930 --> 00:53:21.512 align:middle line:84%
>> --either have to do it--
do the work ourselves or have

00:53:21.512 --> 00:53:22.470 align:middle line:90%
an external technology.

00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:26.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, but, actually, we see
that the most important thing

00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:31.650 align:middle line:84%
you would need to colonize a
moon of Jupiter or whatever is

00:53:31.650 --> 00:53:34.690 align:middle line:84%
actually mentors,
extraterrestrial mentors.

00:53:34.690 --> 00:53:35.490 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:53:35.490 --> 00:53:36.250 align:middle line:90%
To help--

00:53:36.250 --> 00:53:36.870 align:middle line:90%
>> To help.

00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:37.290 align:middle line:90%
>> --with--

00:53:37.290 --> 00:53:38.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:41.460 align:middle line:84%
>> --explain more than what
we physically know right now.

00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:42.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:47.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Because we only see such
as a small sliver of what is.

00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:48.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:48.810 align:middle line:90%
>> I See.

00:53:48.810 --> 00:53:49.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:53:49.150 --> 00:53:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And that can
help out with that.

00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you know, I've heard
stories that humanity has

00:53:54.660 --> 00:54:00.360 align:middle line:84%
a breakaway civilization of a
secret space program, per se,

00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:03.300 align:middle line:90%
that we've been--

00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:06.080 align:middle line:84%
individuals from humanity
in the '50s and '60s

00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:10.290 align:middle line:84%
worked together to sort of start
colonizing our solar system.

00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:11.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:54:11.090 --> 00:54:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And started
doing this already.

00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of this whistleblower
stuff is coming out now.

00:54:17.310 --> 00:54:20.580 align:middle line:90%


00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And we're sort of
being made aware.

00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And then, hopefully, we can join
our own family back with us.

00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:28.620 align:middle line:90%
But they had--

00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:34.890 align:middle line:84%
I guess, they did have Draconian
assistance in their evolution

00:54:34.890 --> 00:54:36.360 align:middle line:90%
to colonize.

00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Is that-- am I
correct using that?

00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we're going to say
there's truth and distortion.

00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:41.570 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:54:41.570 --> 00:54:43.020 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:47.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, when truth
starts coming out,

00:54:47.070 --> 00:54:49.260 align:middle line:84%
there is a whole
faction on your world

00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:52.590 align:middle line:84%
that works very hard
to distort the truth

00:54:52.590 --> 00:54:57.150 align:middle line:84%
through sensationalistic things,
or red herrings, as you say.

00:54:57.150 --> 00:54:59.910 align:middle line:90%
So there is also a lot of that.

00:54:59.910 --> 00:55:04.020 align:middle line:84%
The researchers, themselves,
having good intentions

00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:07.890 align:middle line:84%
are given very, what seems to be
for them, credible information,

00:55:07.890 --> 00:55:09.240 align:middle line:90%
that isn't really credible.

00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:11.200 align:middle line:84%
So the truth gets
buried at another layer.

00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So there is a lot
of different things.

00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:16.810 align:middle line:84%
This is why we don't talk
so much about this stuff.

00:55:16.810 --> 00:55:19.430 align:middle line:84%
It's also not our
mission, so to speak.

00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:20.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, sure.

00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:23.620 align:middle line:84%
>> However, we can say,
just very basically, yes,

00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:24.930 align:middle line:90%
secret space programs.

00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:27.420 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the powers that
be, if you will,

00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:29.820 align:middle line:84%
are quite aware
that Mars was once

00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:31.620 align:middle line:84%
a thriving
civilization, that there

00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:34.500 align:middle line:84%
are things happening on the
moon, et cetera, et cetera.

00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:35.400 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:36.270 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:38.190 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to go
into any more details.

00:55:38.190 --> 00:55:38.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:39.840 align:middle line:90%
Not our forte.

00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:41.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Not yet.

00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:44.893 align:middle line:84%
Not until-- it'll all
develop in the way

00:55:44.893 --> 00:55:45.935 align:middle line:90%
it's supposed to develop.

00:55:45.935 --> 00:55:47.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:48.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good.

00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:50.490 align:middle line:84%
I think we're
winding down, here.

00:55:50.490 --> 00:55:53.280 align:middle line:84%
The Japanese energy
healing Reiki.

00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:56.160 align:middle line:90%


00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Lisa told me the mountain
to go to where I can

00:55:58.470 --> 00:56:00.210 align:middle line:90%
find where it was developed.

00:56:00.210 --> 00:56:04.320 align:middle line:90%
But was that--

00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:06.730 align:middle line:84%
I think the founder even
said it came from the cosmos.

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:07.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:56:07.530 --> 00:56:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>> It was downloaded to him
through this sort of cosmic

00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:11.900 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Did that come from a specific
star system or some beings?

00:56:17.310 --> 00:56:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:23.490 align:middle line:84%
Again, we very often use some
of the star names as archetypes.

00:56:23.490 --> 00:56:26.520 align:middle line:90%
But we see that the--

00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:28.100 align:middle line:84%
well, the legends
of Mount Kurama--

00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:28.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:33.620 align:middle line:84%
>> --which is the mountain
we're talking about in Kyoto,

00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:34.970 align:middle line:90%
are that.

00:56:34.970 --> 00:56:36.630 align:middle line:90%
Beings from Venus--

00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:37.430 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:39.380 align:middle line:84%
>> --originally, two
million years ago,

00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:41.240 align:middle line:90%
came to that mountain.

00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, the question then is,
did the founder of Reiki

00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:46.340 align:middle line:90%
tap into Venus energy?

00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:50.570 align:middle line:84%
We would say that Venus, itself,
is a portal through which

00:56:50.570 --> 00:56:52.790 align:middle line:90%
other cosmic energy can come.

00:56:52.790 --> 00:56:57.260 align:middle line:84%
We see the Reiki energy as
being much more connected

00:56:57.260 --> 00:56:58.680 align:middle line:90%
to Arcturist energy.

00:56:58.680 --> 00:56:59.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:04.040 align:middle line:84%
>> It's very, very balanced
and very powerful in its

00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:04.990 align:middle line:90%
simplicity.

00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:06.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:57:06.770 --> 00:57:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And is that a representation,
then, of Arcturist, is

00:57:09.890 --> 00:57:11.210 align:middle line:90%
balance and simple?

00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Balance, simple.

00:57:13.170 --> 00:57:15.990 align:middle line:84%
You have also termed
it the angelic realm.

00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:16.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:57:16.790 --> 00:57:18.070 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a realm of--

00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:18.870 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, I see.

00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:21.870 align:middle line:84%
>> --integration where mental,
emotional, male, female,

00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:23.210 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, is all balanced.

00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:28.040 align:middle line:84%
It is also an energy that
is very easy for humans

00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:31.610 align:middle line:84%
to tap into when they
allow themselves to do so.

00:57:31.610 --> 00:57:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>> I've heard analogies.

00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:36.000 align:middle line:84%
They're like the
Jedis in Star Wars.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.110 align:middle line:84%
You know, the Arcturians,
they're sort of always

00:57:39.110 --> 00:57:40.650 align:middle line:84%
wearing robes and
sort of in that--

00:57:40.650 --> 00:57:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>> While, that's
how they're seen.

00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:42.820 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:42.860 align:middle line:90%
>> How they're perceived.

00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:43.550 align:middle line:84%
How we perceive them
as, sort of masters.

00:57:43.550 --> 00:57:45.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Because mostly they
are sixth density,

00:57:45.690 --> 00:57:48.170 align:middle line:84%
so they're not physical
in that way any longer.

00:57:48.170 --> 00:57:48.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Very masterful.

00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And even, I've heard throughout
our galaxy and universe,

00:57:53.540 --> 00:57:55.820 align:middle line:84%
many other beings
sort of go there to do

00:57:55.820 --> 00:57:57.270 align:middle line:90%
pilgrimages and homework and--

00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:58.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:57:58.070 --> 00:58:00.880 align:middle line:90%
>> You know, and go to--

00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:03.247 align:middle line:84%
Sasha, have you been
to Arcturian system

00:58:03.247 --> 00:58:04.330 align:middle line:90%
to do some study and work?

00:58:04.330 --> 00:58:05.130 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:58:05.130 --> 00:58:09.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in my time
frame, the, you might say,

00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:11.970 align:middle line:84%
high Arcturian
civilization is long gone.

00:58:11.970 --> 00:58:12.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:58:12.770 --> 00:58:12.980 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Because they have gone into
they're ascension process.

00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:16.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see.

00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:17.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:19.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So when people are
talking about that,

00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:21.200 align:middle line:90%
they are talking about--

00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:22.790 align:middle line:84%
again, we're going
off the timelines--

00:58:22.790 --> 00:58:23.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:25.050 align:middle line:90%
>> --a past era--

00:58:25.050 --> 00:58:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:58:25.850 --> 00:58:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>> --of the civilization.

00:58:26.690 --> 00:58:28.770 align:middle line:84%
>> When there was a
physical version to visit.

00:58:28.770 --> 00:58:29.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:58:29.570 --> 00:58:30.600 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:38.900 align:middle line:84%
So the-- I'm not sure if it was
you who mentioned this, but--

00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:41.840 align:middle line:90%
it may have been har--

00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:45.710 align:middle line:84%
the Sirius energy, the way
they-- sort of their evolution

00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:49.250 align:middle line:84%
is they tapped into
their emotional body

00:58:49.250 --> 00:58:54.870 align:middle line:84%
through their mental
pineal gland direction.

00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:55.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:57.860 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, and that was sort
of their evolutionary state.

00:58:57.860 --> 00:58:58.490 align:middle line:90%
Took them a while.

00:58:58.490 --> 00:58:59.900 align:middle line:84%
But through the
mental body, they

00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:04.100 align:middle line:84%
were actually able to access
their emotional bodies.

00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:05.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:59:05.690 --> 00:59:06.690 align:middle line:90%
They took the back door.

00:59:06.690 --> 00:59:07.910 align:middle line:90%
>> They took the back door.

00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:09.530 align:middle line:90%
Which is fascinating.

00:59:09.530 --> 00:59:13.790 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I see so many
similarities in humanity

00:59:13.790 --> 00:59:15.920 align:middle line:90%
where we get very mental.

00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:17.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:18.530 align:middle line:90%
>> And I was wondering--

00:59:18.530 --> 00:59:26.060 align:middle line:84%
I've been working a lot with the
Amazonian medicine, ayahuasca.

00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And the chemical compound, which
induces a psychedelic trance

00:59:33.110 --> 00:59:35.700 align:middle line:84%
state, is DMT,
dimethyltryptamine,

00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:38.750 align:middle line:90%
which is very--

00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:44.780 align:middle line:84%
I see it very third eye
going into that state.

00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's sort of resonated
when I heard that download

00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:50.180 align:middle line:84%
because it feels that's
a similar path using

00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:56.760 align:middle line:84%
this medicine in a mental way to
connect to the emotional body.

00:59:56.760 --> 00:59:57.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:59:57.560 --> 01:00:01.340 align:middle line:84%
It's similar to the work the
Sirians did, but with a booster

01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:02.210 align:middle line:90%
rocket.

01:00:02.210 --> 01:00:02.860 align:middle line:90%
>> With a booster--

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:04.520 align:middle line:84%
so they-- the ayahuasca
is the booster rocket?

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.150 align:middle line:84%
>> The ayahuasca is
the booster rocket.

01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>> The Sirians, being that
their lineage is Vegan,

01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:11.390 align:middle line:90%
are very hard core.

01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't--
for most of the time,

01:00:14.570 --> 01:00:16.500 align:middle line:90%
didn't like to use help--

01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:17.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:18.800 align:middle line:90%
>> --so to speak.

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:21.555 align:middle line:84%
But humans like
shortcuts sometimes.

01:00:21.555 --> 01:00:23.555 align:middle line:84%
And we don't mean that
in any way disrespectful.

01:00:23.555 --> 01:00:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:27.960 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's like a booster
rocket for the same idea.

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:30.660 align:middle line:84%
>> If it's used
properly, of course.

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And the energy of
the ayahuasca spirit

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:38.150 align:middle line:84%
that the shamans speak of,
this Grandmother Earth energy,

01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:40.850 align:middle line:84%
that's the way I've
always seen her,

01:00:40.850 --> 01:00:47.920 align:middle line:84%
is this almost a collective
unconditional love,

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:49.400 align:middle line:90%
Mother Earth energy.

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:50.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>> That being, I was wondering
on a galactic scale--

01:00:57.050 --> 01:01:03.440 align:middle line:84%
how do the other ET races
interact with that energy?

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:04.940 align:middle line:90%
Do they interact?

01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:07.040 align:middle line:90%
And is that part of--

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:09.270 align:middle line:84%
is that part of the Earth's
collective consciousness?

01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>> It is part of the Earth's
collective consciousness.

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And it goes back to some of what
we were talking about in terms

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:18.350 align:middle line:84%
of how every planet, every
sun has its own consciousness.

01:01:18.350 --> 01:01:19.170 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:01:19.170 --> 01:01:23.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And so from the point of
view of an ET, such as myself,

01:01:23.210 --> 01:01:27.540 align:middle line:84%
whenever we come to a planet
to do any type of work

01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:33.180 align:middle line:84%
as an offering or as a service,
we have to get permission from

01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:34.600 align:middle line:90%
that collective consciousness.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.400 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>> First and foremost.

01:01:37.810 --> 01:01:42.000 align:middle line:84%
So you, as humans, are
moving toward this as well,

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.750 align:middle line:84%
in terms of recognizing
your own planet as a living

01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:46.860 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And of course, once you
do, everything changes.

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:51.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I already have.

01:01:51.990 --> 01:01:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And tapping into that energy
is-- it's so beautiful.

01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm working
with the medicine

01:01:57.810 --> 01:02:01.770 align:middle line:84%
and working with the shamans
and our indigenous cultures who

01:02:01.770 --> 01:02:04.390 align:middle line:84%
have been working with this
energy for thousands of years.

01:02:04.390 --> 01:02:05.627 align:middle line:90%
>> Thousands of years.

01:02:05.627 --> 01:02:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>> With or without the medicine.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:09.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, the medicine is
just a permission slip--

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:09.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:11.340 align:middle line:90%
>> --to talk to this energy.

01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:14.761 align:middle line:90%
But it's so beautiful.

01:02:14.761 --> 01:02:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just assuming that
that collective energy

01:02:17.850 --> 01:02:23.010 align:middle line:84%
is interacting with the
Pleiadian collective energies

01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:23.820 align:middle line:90%
on--

01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:25.630 align:middle line:90%
and other Sirian collectives--

01:02:25.630 --> 01:02:26.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:02:26.430 --> 01:02:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>> --on a greater
galactic scale of--

01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:30.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:31.280 align:middle line:90%
We have to.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:33.940 align:middle line:90%
We have to do it that way.

01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:35.430 align:middle line:90%
>> So with that--

01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:37.750 align:middle line:84%
would she be part of the
association of worlds?

01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:39.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:40.560 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:43.390 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

01:02:43.390 --> 01:02:45.975 align:middle line:90%
OK, well, thank you so much.

01:02:45.975 --> 01:02:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Now that we hear the
wheels going with that one.

01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:49.058 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, there's so more.

01:02:49.058 --> 01:02:50.530 align:middle line:90%
I know I could go on forever.

01:02:50.530 --> 01:02:52.650 align:middle line:84%
But I want to honor
everybody's time.

01:02:52.650 --> 01:02:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And we've got lots of
great stuff to share here.

01:02:56.250 --> 01:03:00.360 align:middle line:84%
So thank you so
much for everything.

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:02.900 align:middle line:84%
I'll leave it open just for
one last thing, if Sasha

01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:05.630 align:middle line:90%
wants to share anything for me.

01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:06.690 align:middle line:90%
I've heard that maybe--

01:03:06.690 --> 01:03:07.610 align:middle line:90%
>> My brother.

01:03:07.610 --> 01:03:08.410 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:03:08.410 --> 01:03:10.985 align:middle line:90%
>> I heard that--

01:03:10.985 --> 01:03:11.860 align:middle line:90%
I heard that earlier.

01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:12.660 align:middle line:90%
So--

01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:16.860 align:middle line:84%
>> There is another you in
my time stream, my dear.

01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And he is much more
flamboyant than you.

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:20.490 align:middle line:90%
It's a he.

01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:21.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Flamboyant?

01:03:21.290 --> 01:03:23.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Flamboyant, actually.

01:03:23.210 --> 01:03:26.690 align:middle line:90%
In a-- we don't--

01:03:26.690 --> 01:03:28.635 align:middle line:90%
maybe not what you're imagining.

01:03:28.635 --> 01:03:29.970 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:03:29.970 --> 01:03:32.460 align:middle line:84%
>> He doesn't wear rainbow
streamers or anything.

01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:33.260 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:40.140 align:middle line:84%
>> But he's very
excited and gregarious,

01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:42.480 align:middle line:84%
even more than you
are as a human.

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And whenever he-- he's involved
a lot in some of the contact

01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:53.430 align:middle line:84%
work, in general,
introducing planets--

01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:55.950 align:middle line:84%
new planets to the
galactic community.

01:03:55.950 --> 01:04:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And whenever he is present, he,
let's say, lightens the mood.

01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:02.130 align:middle line:84%
Not that it's ever
a somber mood.
