00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Here we are
with Barbara Lamb.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.629 align:middle line:90%
And we're in your lovely home.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.370 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for inviting us in.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.930 align:middle line:10%
>> And I'd love to just kind of
get to know you and get to know

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.100 align:middle line:10%
your work.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.200 align:middle line:10%
You've been in this--

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.610 align:middle line:10%
in the extraterrestrial
field, crop circle field,

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.350 align:middle line:10%
hypnotherapist regression
field for quite a while.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.080 align:middle line:90%
And I'd like to get--

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Many years.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.985 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to get into some of
those experiences if we could.

00:01:27.985 --> 00:01:29.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And first, could you just
tell us what your background

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.680 align:middle line:90%
is?

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.510 align:middle line:84%
I know you've probably said
this a million times, but--

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>> That's OK.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.100 align:middle line:90%
>> --just for the new audience.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And just explain, you
know, your work and your body

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.320 align:middle line:90%
of work.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, basically, I'm a
licensed psychotherapist,

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.040 align:middle line:84%
licensed in the state
of California in 1976.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.010 align:middle line:90%
So that's many years ago.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And I began to notice
that part of my work

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.270 align:middle line:84%
just seemed to evolve
into, with some people,

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.730 align:middle line:84%
anyway, doing what I was
calling deep relaxation work

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.310 align:middle line:84%
or altered states of
consciousness work.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.880 align:middle line:90%
It just sort of evolved.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't realize, in
some of those early years,

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.150 align:middle line:84%
in the 1970s and early
'80s, that I was actually

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.420 align:middle line:84%
doing hypnosis with
some people, just

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.120 align:middle line:84%
with some clients in
my therapy practice,

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.790 align:middle line:84%
where it seemed like
it would be useful.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And then people began to
bring it to my awareness

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.650 align:middle line:90%
that I was doing hypnosis.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.350 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, well,
I really ought

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.000 align:middle line:84%
to get officially trained
in that if I'm doing it.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And I had a couple of
training courses and felt very,

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.100 align:middle line:90%
very comfortable with that.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And in 1984, I became
aware of the Association

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.400 align:middle line:84%
for Past Life Research
and Therapies,

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.170 align:middle line:84%
because I'd been having some
spontaneous experiences of what

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.050 align:middle line:84%
certainly seemed
to be like memories

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.830 align:middle line:84%
or sort of bleed-throughs
from previous lifetimes.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And particularly,
that was happening

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.870 align:middle line:84%
when I went to Peru and
Egypt in the early 1980s,

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.450 align:middle line:90%
and some other countries too.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And in certain locations,
these really detailed memories

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.965 align:middle line:90%
would come up.

00:03:23.965 --> 00:03:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'd give myself
over to them to see

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.630 align:middle line:90%
how much I could remember.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know that
it wasn't fantasy.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.700 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't daydream.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.540 align:middle line:90%
And I was awake in these places.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.680 align:middle line:90%
So I figured, well, hm.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.660 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if they could really be
coming from previous lifetimes.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.290 align:middle line:84%
Up to that point of
view, up to that time,

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.890 align:middle line:84%
I just had not thought
about past lives.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.090 align:middle line:90%
I just wasn't in my reference.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.160 align:middle line:84%
But I began to
think, well, maybe

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.190 align:middle line:84%
we really do have
lots of lifetimes,

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.110 align:middle line:84%
and maybe that remembering what
happened in certain lifetimes

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.650 align:middle line:84%
could be useful
therapeutically, so

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.680 align:middle line:84%
that when I met the
past life therapy

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.329 align:middle line:84%
professional organization,
I was really quite thrilled.

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And I went for five
years of training

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.380 align:middle line:84%
with them to be a past
life regression therapist.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And at the very last
module of training,

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:35.240 align:middle line:84%
which was 1988 or possibly 1999,
the trainer, whom I respected

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.000 align:middle line:84%
very much as a therapist,
she said, those of you

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.280 align:middle line:84%
who are doing this
regression therapy

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.840 align:middle line:84%
work need to know that it could
happen that sometimes, somebody

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:53.080 align:middle line:84%
will come to you who's had very
unusual experiences with beings

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.470 align:middle line:84%
from somewhere else,
who are not human,

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.210 align:middle line:84%
coming into their environment
and sometimes taking them away

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.040 align:middle line:90%
for an hour or two.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.830 align:middle line:84%
So they mentioned this in
the course you were taking.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.150 align:middle line:84%
>> They mentioned
it in the course.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.410 align:middle line:84%
>> They didn't really call them
extraterrestrials or aliens.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:13.210 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.260 align:middle line:90%
What year was this?

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.880 align:middle line:90%
>> 1988 or '89.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.680 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.450 align:middle line:84%
So they were
already tapping in--

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, some of those
therapists already were.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:22.590 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I hadn't known
that till that moment.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.040 align:middle line:84%
But the most
striking thing to me

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:33.940 align:middle line:84%
was, not only did this trainer
say that, which was news to me.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.550 align:middle line:84%
I had just never
thought in those terms.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:42.400 align:middle line:84%
But even more striking
was a big voice in my head

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.330 align:middle line:84%
almost yelling to me
in a demanding way.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:47.740 align:middle line:90%
Nobody else around heard it.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.500 align:middle line:84%
But I heard it in
my head, seeming

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.910 align:middle line:90%
to come from somewhere else.

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And that voice said, pay
attention to this, Barbara.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.140 align:middle line:90%
You will be doing this.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.180 align:middle line:90%
So wow.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.130 align:middle line:84%
There are other beings that come
and take people away sometimes?

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.830 align:middle line:90%
And I'll be working with that?

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.150 align:middle line:90%
Well, that was a shock.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And I felt from
that point on that

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.790 align:middle line:84%
I needed to sort
of pay attention

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:23.130 align:middle line:84%
to the UFO
extraterrestrial phenomenon

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.100 align:middle line:84%
to see if I thought
it was really true.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And this was before John
Mack's work came out, right?

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:30.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.040 align:middle line:90%
I had never heard of John Mack.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't think he was
doing that work yet.

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.890 align:middle line:84%
So I found out then,
in the late 1980s,

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:42.660 align:middle line:84%
that Budd Hopkins was doing
work, and David Jacobs,

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:47.140 align:middle line:84%
I think, at that time, or at
least a couple years later.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And then I was at
different lecture venues.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:57.240 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing lots of videotapes
of UFOs and photos of UFOs.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And I began to think, you
know, I think this really

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.250 align:middle line:84%
must be really happening,
even though I had not

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:08.260 align:middle line:90%
thought about it before.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And so by 1991, I felt
at a certain point

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.540 align:middle line:84%
that if anybody
would ever happen--

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.800 align:middle line:90%
what are the chances of that?

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.570 align:middle line:84%
But if ever somebody would
come to me with complaints

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:27.570 align:middle line:84%
of that sort, that they
had had experiences

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:32.320 align:middle line:84%
with these other beings, that I
would be ready to handle that.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And I was very experienced
in regression therapy.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And I figured that,
you know, we'd just

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.380 align:middle line:84%
use the same techniques and help
somebody regress to an event

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.390 align:middle line:90%
that they had wondered about.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:50.370 align:middle line:84%
So the very day that
I decided on my own

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:52.320 align:middle line:84%
that I could handle
that if it would ever

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.680 align:middle line:84%
come to me, a couple
of hours later,

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.250 align:middle line:90%
I met a woman in a bookstore.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And she said that she knew that
I did this regression therapy

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.200 align:middle line:90%
work.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And would I please work with
her 21-year-old daughter,

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:13.560 align:middle line:84%
who was having these
visitations, mostly at night?

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:18.210 align:middle line:90%
And she was hugely traumatized--

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:19.840 align:middle line:90%
devastatingly.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.800 align:middle line:84%
She didn't even want to
sleep in her room alone,

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.580 align:middle line:84%
because that's where these
visitors would usually

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:27.750 align:middle line:90%
find her.

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And she was insisting on
sleeping between her mother

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:33.270 align:middle line:84%
and father every night
in their bedroom.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And they were
getting kind of tired

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:38.629 align:middle line:84%
of their 21-year-old daughter
insisting on doing that.

00:08:38.629 --> 00:08:39.429 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, 21's--

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:41.110 align:middle line:84%
>> It's bad enough
when it's a baby,

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.870 align:middle line:90%
but a 21-year-old daughter.

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:48.570 align:middle line:84%
So the mother and father were
caring and understanding,

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:52.410 align:middle line:84%
but kind of fed up with this,
and really wanted help for her.

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:56.400 align:middle line:90%
So she came for six sessions.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.100 align:middle line:90%
And we did six regressions.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And yes, indeed,
the details showed

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:05.130 align:middle line:84%
that there was a
variety of what we now

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:08.850 align:middle line:84%
think of as
extraterrestrial beings who

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:13.120 align:middle line:84%
came to her on various occasions
and did all kinds of things--

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:18.090 align:middle line:84%
sometimes took her away,
sometimes did some procedures

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.470 align:middle line:90%
on her right there--

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:20.270 align:middle line:90%
>> In the room?

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:21.765 align:middle line:84%
>> --when she was
sleeping in the bedroom.

00:09:21.765 --> 00:09:22.565 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:09:22.565 --> 00:09:26.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Or they would take her from
between her mother and father

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:30.360 align:middle line:84%
in their bed, and sometimes
take her onto a spacecraft,

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.480 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes just take
her into her own room,

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.440 align:middle line:84%
where they would be alone with
her and be able to do certain

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.670 align:middle line:90%
procedures.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And amongst those,
one of the procedures

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:45.810 align:middle line:84%
was that they healed a bad
ear infection that she had,

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:47.610 align:middle line:90%
right there in her room.

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:49.320 align:middle line:90%
And she was lying on one side.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And they were working
on the infected ear.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And she could look around
a little bit and see them.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:10:00.420 align:middle line:84%
They were very tall, white, thin
beings, definitely not human.

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And she was so improved
from that ear problem, even

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:07.800 align:middle line:84%
the next morning,
that she began to feel

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.330 align:middle line:90%
more kindly about these beings.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:11.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:16.050 align:middle line:84%
>> So after the sixth
session she had with me,

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:18.060 align:middle line:90%
she came in one day.

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And she was smiling and happy
and looked very relaxed.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And she said right away,
you know, I am privileged.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:34.620 align:middle line:84%
I feel honored that I'm part
of whatever this is, you

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.380 align:middle line:90%
could call it, that's going on.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's great
that for whatever reason,

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:46.410 align:middle line:84%
I've been chosen for this,
because these beings are really

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:47.780 align:middle line:90%
helpful.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:52.220 align:middle line:84%
They certainly are different
looking and peculiar.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:53.270 align:middle line:90%
They're not like us.

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:54.400 align:middle line:90%
They're not human.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.110 align:middle line:90%
But they really are wonderful.

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:58.660 align:middle line:90%
And they had healed her--

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:02.860 align:middle line:84%
not only the ear infection,
but of lower back pain

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:05.090 align:middle line:84%
that she'd had for a
considerable period of time.

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:05.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:07.180 align:middle line:90%
Can I get an alien visitation?

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:07.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:08.270 align:middle line:90%
Lots of people--

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I got some low back
pain I got to get--

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.620 align:middle line:84%
>> --would like to
have that happen.

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:12.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.060 align:middle line:90%
All those stunts, you know?

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Sometimes I--

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:14.910 align:middle line:90%
>> After a while.

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:18.820 align:middle line:84%
>> --jokingly say to a friend
or somebody I know who's having

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:22.910 align:middle line:84%
some pain or something, well,
just ask the extraterrestrials.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:24.700 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't frankly think
that the extraterrestrials

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.730 align:middle line:90%
come to just anybody.

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:33.220 align:middle line:84%
But they come to the
people they're working

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:36.280 align:middle line:90%
with over a period of time.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.660 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, that was
my first client.

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:38.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:39.260 align:middle line:90%
Did they say--

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And I thought, wow, I
can really work with this.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:43.390 align:middle line:90%
And it can turn out well--

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:44.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:44.260 align:middle line:90%
In a positive--

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.177 align:middle line:84%
>> --you know, even
though beginning in a very

00:11:46.177 --> 00:11:47.710 align:middle line:90%
traumatizing way.

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:50.980 align:middle line:84%
So a few months later,
after visiting crop circles

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.620 align:middle line:90%
in England, another client came.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And she worked with
me for 11 or 12 years.

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:02.500 align:middle line:84%
We must have done at
least 60 regressions

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.620 align:middle line:84%
to her extraterrestrial
encounters.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And her son was very involved
with extraterrestrial visits

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:14.480 align:middle line:90%
and very positive about them.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And she had an
extraterrestrial mentor

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:21.130 align:middle line:84%
who was really wonderful
to be with when

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:23.740 align:middle line:90%
she was on the spacecraft.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.050 align:middle line:90%
And he also channeled.

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:28.180 align:middle line:84%
She realized after a
few sessions with me

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:32.440 align:middle line:84%
that she was channeling
very interesting information

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:35.200 align:middle line:84%
from that
extraterrestrial being.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.890 align:middle line:84%
So he was not only
a mentor, a teacher,

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:44.560 align:middle line:84%
a guide to her on that
craft when she was taken.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:50.030 align:middle line:84%
But he also, when she was home
or particularly in my office,

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:52.570 align:middle line:84%
he would channel
through and give

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:57.850 align:middle line:84%
lots of interesting perspective
from his planet, which

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:03.400 align:middle line:84%
was the binary star system
which we call Antares.

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Antares, interesting.

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:07.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And so that was
really wonderful to get

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:08.540 align:middle line:90%
an off-planet--

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:09.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Perspective.

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>> --you know, other take
on Earth, and human life,

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.000 align:middle line:84%
and on their life,
and everything.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:17.800 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Was she having
negative experiences?

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Or I should say,
was she traumatized

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:24.400 align:middle line:90%
when she went to see you?

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.200 align:middle line:84%
Or was it-- and then it
developed into just figuring it

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.000 align:middle line:90%
out?

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.530 align:middle line:90%
Or like the first girl?

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:30.520 align:middle line:90%
>> She had been.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:34.390 align:middle line:84%
Before she came to me, she
was very baffled and confused

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:39.010 align:middle line:84%
and couldn't quite pin
down what was going on.

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:42.580 align:middle line:84%
But she had, all
of her life, been

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:45.970 align:middle line:84%
visited by three
little white beings who

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:47.770 align:middle line:90%
were about three feet tall.

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And she called them my
three little white guys.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And she and her sister,
who shared the bedroom

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:58.060 align:middle line:84%
all through their
childhood years,

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:02.170 align:middle line:84%
the sister would wake up
and witness, time after time

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:05.620 align:middle line:84%
after time, for years, these
three little white beings

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:06.640 align:middle line:90%
coming.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:07.030 align:middle line:90%
And that--

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Did they talk about it?

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:08.930 align:middle line:90%
Did her sister tell her?

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:09.930 align:middle line:90%
>> They talked about it.

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:10.780 align:middle line:90%
And they liked it.

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:11.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:16.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And what would happen is that
the little beings would appear

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:20.140 align:middle line:84%
first as little
sparkles of light,

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:25.930 align:middle line:84%
just kind of circling around
the room, and forming spirals,

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:31.990 align:middle line:84%
and then eventually landing
on the floor and morphing

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:36.460 align:middle line:84%
into these three little white
extraterrestrial beings.

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:39.700 align:middle line:84%
So as they would be
flying around the room,

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:44.500 align:middle line:84%
and circling, and spiraling,
almost like doing somersaults

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:46.360 align:middle line:84%
in the air, very
pretty patterns,

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:50.832 align:middle line:84%
they thought of those
little sparkles as fairies.

00:14:50.832 --> 00:14:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And they would tell
their mother, oh, you

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:55.570 align:middle line:84%
should come in some night
and see the fairies.

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:56.870 align:middle line:90%
They're so pretty.

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:58.120 align:middle line:90%
They're wonderful.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.580 align:middle line:90%
They're lighted.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:02.410 align:middle line:90%
They're lovely in the dark room.

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And the mother would say things
like, well, that's very nice,

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:07.600 align:middle line:90%
dears.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.160 align:middle line:84%
But fairies are
just for children.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.970 align:middle line:84%
So if I came into the room,
they probably wouldn't show up.

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:14.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:15.895 align:middle line:90%
Well, she's probably right.

00:15:15.895 --> 00:15:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The mother had no
clue, I think, about--

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:18.810 align:middle line:90%
>> But she's probably right.

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:20.018 align:middle line:90%
They might not have shown up.

00:15:20.018 --> 00:15:23.050 align:middle line:84%
>> They might not if they
were extraterrestrials, too.

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:28.780 align:middle line:84%
So she was always taken
for her experiences

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:31.900 align:middle line:84%
by these three
little white beings.

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And they were like
the little gray beings

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:41.350 align:middle line:84%
except that they had round eyes,
not the big black oval eyes,

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:43.060 align:middle line:90%
but the round eyes.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And they had some
whites in their eyes.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.470 align:middle line:90%
So their eyes moved.

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:50.350 align:middle line:90%
And they had expressions.

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And both of these girls
really liked them.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.820 align:middle line:90%
They even had love for them.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:06.040 align:middle line:84%
However, sometimes she would be
taken by them, whom she liked,

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:11.080 align:middle line:84%
to physical examinations
and on board the craft,

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:16.090 align:middle line:84%
the spacecraft, and
different procedures that she

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:18.410 align:middle line:90%
didn't necessarily like.

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:22.810 align:middle line:84%
But other times, along
with the physical things

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:28.990 align:middle line:84%
that were happening, she often
was taken into another room

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:31.420 align:middle line:90%
after a physical checkup.

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:35.230 align:middle line:84%
I think she became to look at it
as, oh, they're really checking

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:37.390 align:middle line:90%
a lot of my body systems.

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.520 align:middle line:90%
They want me to be all right.

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And if there's anything
going wrong physically,

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:44.290 align:middle line:90%
they would fix it.

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:45.340 align:middle line:90%
They would heal it.

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:50.230 align:middle line:84%
Took some regressions to realize
that that's what was going on.

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:53.380 align:middle line:84%
But she'd also be
taken into another room

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:58.780 align:middle line:84%
on each one of those occasions,
and either seeming to be

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:00.940 align:middle line:90%
in a place of learning--

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:05.710 align:middle line:84%
she called it the library, even
though there weren't any books.

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:08.410 align:middle line:84%
But it obviously was
a place of learning.

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:11.619 align:middle line:84%
And she would sit
at a console sort

00:17:11.619 --> 00:17:15.280 align:middle line:84%
of arrangement with a
barrel-shaped chair,

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:20.349 align:middle line:84%
and then her feet in
almost like foot plates.

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:24.069 align:middle line:84%
And that was
connected to a screen

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:28.060 align:middle line:84%
that she said is a combination
between a television

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:32.740 align:middle line:84%
screen and a computer
screen, although she

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:36.430 align:middle line:84%
didn't know about computers
when she was a child

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:39.010 align:middle line:84%
and started having
those experiences.

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And there was always this
very tall, white, thin

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:49.815 align:middle line:90%
being who became her mentor.

00:17:49.815 --> 00:17:50.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Her mentor.

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:53.740 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, she didn't realize
in childhood that he would

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:58.330 align:middle line:84%
continue through her adult
life to be her special teacher

00:17:58.330 --> 00:17:59.590 align:middle line:90%
and mentor.

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And he turned out
to be the being who

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:06.760 align:middle line:84%
did years and years of
channeling through her,

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.850 align:middle line:90%
too, when she was here on Earth.

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:12.670 align:middle line:84%
So that was always
a very interesting,

00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:13.900 align:middle line:90%
positive experience.

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.220 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:18.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Did she publish these
channels, or did she--

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:20.350 align:middle line:90%
>> No, she didn't publish them.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:22.630 align:middle line:84%
I told her that maybe
someday, I would

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:25.660 align:middle line:84%
like to collaborate with her,
because they're very, very

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:31.360 align:middle line:84%
interesting from an
extraterrestrial point of view.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.953 align:middle line:84%
And she said,
well, I don't know.

00:18:32.953 --> 00:18:34.120 align:middle line:90%
I'll have to think about it.

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.260 align:middle line:90%
Maybe someday.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I've
been extremely busy

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:42.290 align:middle line:84%
since I last saw her, which
was probably about 2001.

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:43.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:47.310 align:middle line:84%
>> So I haven't gotten
back with her about that.

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:50.410 align:middle line:84%
But I still think that would
be a good project to do.

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:55.120 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, after she
came, more people just--

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:56.860 align:middle line:90%
I didn't advertise it.

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.500 align:middle line:90%
They just somehow found me.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:03.740 align:middle line:84%
I think there's some guidance
in this sort of thing.

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And I began also to be invited
to speak at different groups

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:10.210 align:middle line:90%
and conferences.

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:13.210 align:middle line:90%
Again, I never sought this.

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And then I would mention
the regression work

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:21.070 align:middle line:84%
I was doing with people who had
extraterrestrial encounters.

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And very often, there'd be
somebody, maybe two or three,

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:28.450 align:middle line:84%
even, from any given audience
who'd come up to me afterwards

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:30.820 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, I
would really like

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:33.190 align:middle line:84%
to work with you,
because I've been

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:36.880 align:middle line:84%
having these peculiar
things happen too.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.250 align:middle line:90%
So it just grew.

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And here we are now, 24
years later, at this point.

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And there have been at least
1,300 separate individuals

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:53.290 align:middle line:84%
whom I've done regressions
with to their extraterrestrial

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:54.490 align:middle line:90%
encounters.

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And some of those people have
been able to do lots of them,

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:03.170 align:middle line:84%
because they live within an
hour or so of where I'm located.

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And so some have done
20 regressions, some 30,

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:08.860 align:middle line:90%
or 40, or 50.

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:11.620 align:middle line:84%
So that's a lot of
material, probably

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:14.640 align:middle line:90%
about 2,500 regressions.

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.360 align:middle line:84%
I've kind of lost
track, but I estimate--

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Wow, so 1,300 individuals,
and then another--

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:23.722 align:middle line:84%
counting all the sessions
that they've done, could--

00:20:23.722 --> 00:20:25.555 align:middle line:84%
well over 2,000, you're
saying, regressions.

00:20:25.555 --> 00:20:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:28.210 align:middle line:90%
So it's been important.

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:29.810 align:middle line:90%
And I have found that these--

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's just
related to the ET subject?

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:33.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Just the ET, yeah.

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:37.240 align:middle line:84%
I've done many--
probably a few thousand

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.750 align:middle line:90%
past life regressions too.

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And I always come back to
being a regular therapist.

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:46.930 align:middle line:84%
So I also work with many,
many people who have nothing

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:50.400 align:middle line:84%
to do with these
subjects or don't ever

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.810 align:middle line:90%
wonder about past lives.

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:57.275 align:middle line:84%
So that's a very
nice balance for me.

00:20:57.275 --> 00:20:59.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Like people who
want to quit smoking,

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:00.990 align:middle line:90%
or relationship problems, or--

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:02.032 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yeah, quit smoking.

00:21:02.032 --> 00:21:04.230 align:middle line:84%
They have marriage problems,
or children problems,

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:06.200 align:middle line:84%
or they're depressed,
or they're anxious.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.610 align:middle line:84%
I work with a lot of
anxiety-prone people.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:10.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Or stuff that when
they were a child--

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:11.940 align:middle line:90%
childhood stuff that--

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, very often.

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:15.480 align:middle line:84%
I have to bring the
childhood that they've

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:19.360 align:middle line:84%
had into it, because it
does have its effect.

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.390 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, it's
very interesting.

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And I must say, favorite part
of this wonderful work I'm

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:31.740 align:middle line:84%
privileged to do is working
with the people who've

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:34.440 align:middle line:84%
had the extraterrestrial
encounters.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:38.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, in many cases,
those encounters

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:43.140 align:middle line:84%
they've had are with
really special beings.

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:48.420 align:middle line:84%
They're, I would say, highly
developed, highly spiritual

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:49.530 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:53.610 align:middle line:84%
Many of them seem to come from
other dimensions of reality,

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:56.850 align:middle line:84%
definitely different
frequencies.

00:21:56.850 --> 00:22:00.870 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are glowing beings.

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:04.020 align:middle line:84%
Some of them look like
a person, sort of,

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:08.370 align:middle line:84%
with a glow around the edge,
like we have the auras.

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:10.920 align:middle line:90%
But theirs really shows.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it might
be a body in the middle

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:21.600 align:middle line:84%
of maybe a big oval or a
general shape like that

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.400 align:middle line:90%
which is totally glow.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.060 align:middle line:90%
It's glowing light.

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And then, when you look in
toward the middle of all

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:34.410 align:middle line:84%
that glowing shape,
there seems to be

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:38.570 align:middle line:90%
more of a dense sort of center.

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:40.830 align:middle line:90%
And it is a being.

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And then you can begin to see as
you look further that, oh yeah,

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:49.110 align:middle line:84%
there are eyes and
maybe a tiny suggestion

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:53.550 align:middle line:84%
of little holes for nostrils,
maybe a suggestion of a mouth.

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:57.270 align:middle line:84%
But the eyes are the part
that usually stand out.

00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:01.410 align:middle line:84%
So those beings come
to people and take them

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:07.230 align:middle line:84%
to a whole variety of really
inspiring experiences,

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:11.310 align:middle line:84%
very highly spiritual
experiences.

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:15.240 align:middle line:84%
So many people are learning
in this whole big group

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:19.620 align:middle line:84%
that we would call
extraterrestrial, because they

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:22.340 align:middle line:90%
don't seem to be from here.

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:25.830 align:middle line:84%
There's a huge variety
of these beings

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:29.550 align:middle line:84%
that have come through the
regressions that I've done.

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you mentioned-- it
was not Andromeda, or the--

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:34.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Antares.

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:35.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Antares.

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:38.130 align:middle line:84%
Can you name some of the other
beings that maybe have come

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:41.970 align:middle line:84%
through, or people
who've had experiences,

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:46.470 align:middle line:84%
are they able to describe which
part of the galaxy or where--

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Most of the beings who appear
in the regressions that I do

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:55.200 align:middle line:90%
don't give that information.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.480 align:middle line:84%
They don't give
themselves a name,

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.720 align:middle line:84%
or they don't say the
name of their planet.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:05.790 align:middle line:84%
Or they'll say, if the person
asks them, where are you from?

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:07.500 align:middle line:90%
What planet do you live on?

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:10.770 align:middle line:84%
They'll say something
like, well, we don't

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:13.360 align:middle line:90%
have a name for our planet.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.580 align:middle line:84%
We don't have names
for each other.

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:17.910 align:middle line:84%
We don't have
names for anything,

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:21.390 align:middle line:84%
because we're
completely telepathic.

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:25.980 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to name each
other, or name our place,

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:28.050 align:middle line:90%
or name anything.

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:32.160 align:middle line:84%
We all are in tune,
and we all understand.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.020 align:middle line:84%
That's one thing
that many beings

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:38.730 align:middle line:90%
have said in these regressions.

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
beings have said,

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:45.350 align:middle line:84%
when the person asks,
have said, well, we

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:48.860 align:middle line:90%
have a name for our planet.

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:52.430 align:middle line:84%
But it wouldn't mean
anything to you.

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:55.010 align:middle line:90%
You've never heard this name.

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:58.930 align:middle line:84%
You don't have it
on your star maps.

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they'll mention
it, or maybe they won't.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:04.490 align:middle line:90%


00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And the same with giving
a name to themselves.

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:10.380 align:middle line:84%
However, there are some
exceptions to that.

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:13.790 align:middle line:84%
And some of the beings have
told some of my clients

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:17.250 align:middle line:84%
that they are
Arcturians, for instance.

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:19.580 align:middle line:90%
They're from Arcturus.

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:25.130 align:middle line:84%
Or others will say they're
Sirians from Sirius.

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:29.540 align:middle line:84%
Or they'll say they
are Pleiadians from one

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:31.550 align:middle line:90%
of the Pleiadian planets.

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:38.190 align:middle line:84%
So occasionally, they do,
and Andromedans as well.

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:41.930 align:middle line:84%
But usually, there just
isn't a name given.

00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:45.182 align:middle line:84%
And most often in all these
regressions, I must say,

00:25:45.182 --> 00:25:51.140 align:middle line:84%
the person is fascinated
seeing the beings

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:53.310 align:middle line:84%
and realizing what
they're doing.

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:57.500 align:middle line:84%
But they don't even think
to ask who they are.

00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.420 align:middle line:84%
It just doesn't
come up for them,

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:01.730 align:middle line:84%
or where they're
from, nor does it

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:06.720 align:middle line:84%
occur, apparently, to the
beings to give that information.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:10.940 align:middle line:84%
But one of the very interesting
things about these regressions

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:13.610 align:middle line:84%
is that when a
person has been taken

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:22.070 align:middle line:84%
and is on what we assume
or think is a spacecraft,

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:24.860 align:middle line:84%
certain procedures
might be going on.

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And the person
obviously is wondering

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:31.850 align:middle line:84%
why they're doing this
particular thing, especially

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:35.580 align:middle line:84%
a physical examination
kind of thing.

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I will typically say,
in the regression, I'll say,

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:42.530 align:middle line:84%
would you like to
know why they're doing

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:44.960 align:middle line:90%
this particular procedure?

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And the person will usually
say, yes, I would like to know.

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:54.680 align:middle line:84%
So then I say, well, you can ask
them and tell them you really

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.920 align:middle line:84%
would like to know or
that you have a right

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:00.830 align:middle line:90%
to know what's happening to you.

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And you can do it out loud
with your words to them.

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:07.130 align:middle line:84%
The beings are
right around them.

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:12.380 align:middle line:84%
Or you can just do it with your
thought, whichever you want.

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And some people actually
say it out loud.

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:18.050 align:middle line:90%
Some do it in their thought.

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And almost every time one
of my clients has asked,

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:26.120 align:middle line:90%
they do get an answer.

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.820 align:middle line:90%
Now they get it in their mind.

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:33.200 align:middle line:84%
The beings are communicating
telepathically to them.

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.380 align:middle line:90%
So they hear inside their minds.

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:37.760 align:middle line:90%
They hear the answer.

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:41.390 align:middle line:90%
They don't tend to hear a voice.

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:45.650 align:middle line:90%
But the answer comes in English.

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:48.650 align:middle line:84%
Or for people who are
German, for instance,

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:51.290 align:middle line:90%
they would hear it in German.

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:55.070 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be that
these beings can do that.

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:56.440 align:middle line:90%
We don't know exactly how.

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:59.060 align:middle line:84%
But they do some
pretty amazing things.

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And the answers so far
have always made sense.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.460 align:middle line:90%
They're very quick answers.

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:09.120 align:middle line:90%
They're very simple.

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.930 align:middle line:84%
They're very brief,
maybe just a few words.

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:16.820 align:middle line:84%
But they really make
sense, connected

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:21.690 align:middle line:84%
with what seems to be
happening to the person bodily.

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's true in
terms of teaching.

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:29.630 align:middle line:84%
You see, a lot of people who
are taken on these experiences,

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:34.460 align:middle line:84%
they are ushered into
various rooms, each room

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.350 align:middle line:90%
for a certain purpose.

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:40.040 align:middle line:84%
One might be for a
physical checkup.

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:45.860 align:middle line:84%
One might even be for the
beings healing a person who

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:49.580 align:middle line:90%
has a condition to be healed.

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And that person may
not have even thought

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:55.280 align:middle line:84%
about extraterrestrials
healing them.

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.500 align:middle line:84%
They haven't even
asked for help.

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:02.060 align:middle line:90%
But they, these beings, know.

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:05.060 align:middle line:84%
They know a lot
about our bodies,

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:08.840 align:middle line:84%
probably more than most humans,
even medically trained people,

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:09.830 align:middle line:90%
do.

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:12.140 align:middle line:90%
And they know how to heal.

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And they have very
good ways of healing.

00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:17.420 align:middle line:84%
Quite a number of
my clients have

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:23.120 align:middle line:84%
been healed of something quite
serious, or painful, or both.

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it
seems to be done

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:29.570 align:middle line:84%
by laying the hands
of these beings

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:34.850 align:middle line:84%
over the body of the
afflicted person,

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:37.430 align:middle line:84%
and that they can
feel warmth, or they

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:43.370 align:middle line:84%
can feel energy coming to
that area that needs healing.

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:46.190 align:middle line:84%
Once in a while, it
seems to be hands

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:49.370 align:middle line:84%
on healing by one
of the beings who

00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:55.280 align:middle line:84%
has typically much
longer, thinner fingers,

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:58.010 align:middle line:84%
and maybe not as many
fingers as we have,

00:29:58.010 --> 00:29:59.570 align:middle line:90%
depending on the beings.

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:04.070 align:middle line:84%
But the healing still comes
from those hands right

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:06.750 align:middle line:90%
into the body.

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, also, the healing
seems to happen by an area,

00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:17.210 align:middle line:84%
almost like a beam of light, a
broad area of light coming down

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:22.460 align:middle line:84%
to the person who's lying
on a medical type of table.

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And they just simply just
relax and soak it in.

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:29.940 align:middle line:90%
And the healing happens.

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Or sometimes, a
couple of people have

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:41.840 align:middle line:84%
described that it seems almost
like a machine-like wand that

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:49.880 align:middle line:84%
has been starting at the feet
and rolling up the prone body

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:52.190 align:middle line:90%
and over the top of the head.

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And as it's rolling up,
it is emitting some kind

00:30:56.510 --> 00:31:00.510 align:middle line:84%
of frequency, often
light as well,

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:04.500 align:middle line:84%
which is healing whatever
that condition is.

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes the healing
seems to be happening by what

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:12.260 align:middle line:90%
appear to be laser lights.

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:15.770 align:middle line:84%
There've been some really
spectacular healings

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:16.950 align:middle line:90%
that have happened.

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:18.030 align:middle line:90%
>> And the descriptions--

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:19.510 align:middle line:90%
I can imagine that's--

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:22.410 align:middle line:84%
you know, what people
are describing--

00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:25.710 align:middle line:84%
do you see an overlap
with the descriptions?

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:29.070 align:middle line:90%
I guess two-part questions--

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:36.960 align:middle line:84%
one is, can you describe some
of the reasons that the--

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.720 align:middle line:84%
you said they get telepathically
these messages in their head,

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:42.810 align:middle line:84%
that they get the reason why
they're going through this.

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe, have
you've seen overlaps

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:51.940 align:middle line:84%
with different people describing
the same types of technology,

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:54.720 align:middle line:90%
the same types of reasons?

00:31:54.720 --> 00:32:00.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, each person whom I've
regressed who's been healed has

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:03.570 align:middle line:84%
a different kind of
condition to be healed.

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:08.520 align:middle line:84%
In one case, it might be a liver
problem, or a spleen problem,

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.130 align:middle line:90%
or a kidney problem.

00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:16.240 align:middle line:84%
Others, it might be a serious
injury in the back or a knee

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:20.460 align:middle line:84%
that is continuing over time
to have repeated problems,

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:23.310 align:middle line:84%
or a problem with
the foot, or could

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:27.842 align:middle line:84%
be a more temporary thing like
a strep throat, or a bad cold,

00:32:27.842 --> 00:32:28.800 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Or like ear
infection, you said.

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Ear infection, yeah.

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:35.850 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, just a lot
of variety has come up,

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:40.360 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of variety of
these healing techniques.

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:45.870 align:middle line:84%
But I would say that
the placing of the hands

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:51.800 align:middle line:84%
is very typical of the being
with what feels like heat

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.410 align:middle line:90%
and energy coming out--

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Almost like a--

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:55.350 align:middle line:90%
>> --into the body.

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:56.710 align:middle line:90%
>> We have, in China--

00:32:56.710 --> 00:33:00.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't if you've seen the
qigong masters, who actually

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:02.370 align:middle line:90%
apply their hands and their--

00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:06.450 align:middle line:84%
there's this one video
online where there's a tumor.

00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:11.520 align:middle line:84%
Someone's lying down, and they
have a ultrasound of the tumor.

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And these qigong masters
are doing the qi.

00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And they're literally
disintegrating

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:18.235 align:middle line:90%
this tumor in real time--

00:33:18.235 --> 00:33:19.035 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:33:19.035 --> 00:33:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>> --I would think.

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:21.478 align:middle line:84%
So it sounds like
maybe there's some kind

00:33:21.478 --> 00:33:23.310 align:middle line:90%
of qigong magic going on there.

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:26.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, whether we would
call it that or not.

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:30.990 align:middle line:84%
I've been to China to some
of the traditional Chinese

00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:33.930 align:middle line:90%
medicine hospitals and clinics.

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen the qigong
masters do amazing things.

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:41.490 align:middle line:90%
And then we would--

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:43.440 align:middle line:84%
those of us who
were on this trip

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:46.260 align:middle line:84%
would get to experience
standing at one

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:51.640 align:middle line:84%
end of the room with a qigong
master at the other end,

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:55.890 align:middle line:84%
and with our backs to
him, sending this energy.

00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And we would feel it maybe
20 feet away in our body.

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:00.990 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And we saw a qigong master doing
some remarkable healing things

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:09.810 align:middle line:84%
that we would never
even think of.

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:11.410 align:middle line:90%
So yes, I think that--

00:34:11.410 --> 00:34:12.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Maybe that--

00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:16.920 align:middle line:84%
>> --they do a lot of
that energy healing.

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:20.350 align:middle line:90%
The most remarkable case--

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:22.350 align:middle line:84%
well, there are two
of them, actually--

00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:25.880 align:middle line:84%
involving healing-- one
is a woman who in the 19--

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:31.260 align:middle line:84%
young woman who, in
the 1970s, was suddenly

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:38.320 align:middle line:84%
missing from her job
for three whole days.

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't
know where she was.

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:41.580 align:middle line:84%
They kept calling
on the telephone.

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:46.469 align:middle line:84%
She kept not answering, because
she wasn't really there.

00:34:46.469 --> 00:34:47.820 align:middle line:90%
She had been taken.

00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:50.520 align:middle line:84%
We found out in the
regression that she

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:54.449 align:middle line:84%
had been taken early
in that process

00:34:54.449 --> 00:34:59.460 align:middle line:84%
by extraterrestrial beings,
had been taken onto a craft.

00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And the first major
thing they did

00:35:01.410 --> 00:35:07.740 align:middle line:84%
was put her into a
sliding prone position

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:11.700 align:middle line:84%
and sort of slid
her into a machine

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:15.870 align:middle line:84%
that she later
recognized would be very

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:18.540 align:middle line:90%
much like our MRI machines.

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:19.340 align:middle line:90%
>> MRI, yeah.

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:20.220 align:middle line:90%
CAT scan, yeah.

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:23.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And they were
scanning her body.

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And at the time when
this was happening--

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:31.160 align:middle line:84%
and she didn't remember
until years later,

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:33.030 align:middle line:84%
when she did that
regression with me.

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:38.990 align:middle line:84%
But at that time, she did
not know about MRI machines.

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:43.190 align:middle line:84%
But now, she realizes, oh,
it was very akin to that.

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And then, after they had
scanned her to determine

00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:48.750 align:middle line:90%
what was the problem--

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:51.650 align:middle line:84%
by the way, she didn't even
know she had a problem.

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:53.100 align:middle line:90%
But she did have one.

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:54.710 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Then they took her into
another room and suspended her

00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:04.070 align:middle line:84%
in a lying-down position, up
in the air a number of feet,

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:07.880 align:middle line:84%
maybe about six
feet off the floor.

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:11.360 align:middle line:84%
She wasn't suspended
on anything.

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:14.720 align:middle line:84%
She was just
suspended in the air.

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And for most of that
three-day period,

00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:24.650 align:middle line:84%
where she was gone from
her home and her work,

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:31.050 align:middle line:84%
she received thin laser beams
coming from all directions,

00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:33.410 align:middle line:90%
including from underneath.

00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:35.420 align:middle line:90%
That's why she was suspended.

00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And there were always some of
these extraterrestrial beings

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:43.910 align:middle line:84%
watching her, making sure
everything was all right.

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And these beams were
doing a tremendous amount

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:48.900 align:middle line:90%
of healing work.

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:51.970 align:middle line:84%
They were different
colors, each one.

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:54.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Each being, or like lasers?

00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:55.420 align:middle line:90%
>> These lasers.

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:56.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:57.928 align:middle line:84%
>> The laser beams
were different colors.

00:36:57.928 --> 00:36:59.595 align:middle line:84%
The beings were not
of different colors.

00:36:59.595 --> 00:37:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, OK.

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:04.790 align:middle line:84%
>> And she realized in the
regression that one particular

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:10.880 align:middle line:84%
being who was standing near
her head and talking to her--

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:15.740 align:middle line:84%
she was slightly higher up
in this suspended position.

00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:17.900 align:middle line:84%
But she recognized
in the regression

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:22.790 align:middle line:84%
that, oh, he was one that she'd
been with many, many times.

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And he was always very
kindly and very helpful.

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't look
like a person.

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:32.510 align:middle line:90%
But she liked him.

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And he affirmed, yes, indeed, we
have been together many times.

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And it is time for
us to really give you

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:42.870 align:middle line:90%
some very important help.

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:46.730 align:middle line:84%
He told her right then and
there, while this was going on,

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:52.520 align:middle line:84%
that she had a very
rare blood disorder

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:53.990 align:middle line:90%
and that she didn't know it.

00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:56.870 align:middle line:90%
And nobody knew that about her.

00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:58.610 align:middle line:90%
But they knew it.

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And they were sorry that
they couldn't clear up

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:06.110 align:middle line:84%
the damage that had
already happened.

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:08.930 align:middle line:84%
But what they were doing
with the laser beams

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:15.800 align:middle line:84%
was arresting it so it would
not continue to develop,

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:18.830 align:middle line:84%
because if it would
continue to develop,

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:23.930 align:middle line:84%
she would develop
leukemia for sure.

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:28.010 align:middle line:84%
So they were arresting it
at the stage of development

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:30.980 align:middle line:84%
that it already had been
so that it would never

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:32.570 align:middle line:90%
progress further.

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And she would never
have to get leukemia.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:36.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Hm.

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:39.690 align:middle line:84%
>> So that was a wonderful
service that they did.

00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:40.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>> So she was returned to her
wooden floor after three days.

00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And when she came to with
another one of these telephone

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:56.630 align:middle line:84%
calls from work, she thought,
well, that's strange.

00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:59.900 align:middle line:84%
If I've been here for
three days, on the floor,

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:01.020 align:middle line:90%
I should be sore.

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:03.080 align:middle line:84%
I should be really
uncomfortable.

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.460 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not.

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:08.910 align:middle line:84%
She'd gone to sleep on the
sofa three days earlier.

00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:10.910 align:middle line:84%
But when she was
returned, she was

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:14.990 align:middle line:84%
returned to the floor
right in front of the sofa.

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And then several years later,
she went to an Earth doctor,

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:22.430 align:middle line:90%
here on Earth.

00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And he determined-- for
the first time in her life,

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:29.240 align:middle line:84%
he had determined that
yes, indeed, she had

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:32.410 align:middle line:90%
a very unusual blood disorder.

00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:38.750 align:middle line:84%
But as he followed her through
the years leading up to now,

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:41.630 align:middle line:84%
he said, the most
remarkable thing

00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:47.510 align:middle line:84%
is that this blood disorder has
not developed into leukemia.

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:52.040 align:middle line:84%
We can't imagine why not,
because everyone else

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:57.330 align:middle line:84%
with this rare blood disorder
has always ultimately developed

00:39:57.330 --> 00:39:58.130 align:middle line:90%
leukemia.

00:39:58.130 --> 00:39:59.420 align:middle line:90%
And they've died.

00:39:59.420 --> 00:39:59.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:00.520 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's one of those
medical mysteries.

00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:07.295 align:middle line:84%
But we know why that was
that it didn't develop.

00:40:07.295 --> 00:40:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I guess the
bigger question is,

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:12.680 align:middle line:90%
why would they choose her?

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And why did they let other
people with this blood disorder

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:17.980 align:middle line:90%
develop the leukemia?

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And all of the people who
have had these healing things

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:22.640 align:middle line:90%
happen to them.

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Why are they chosen
and not the others?

00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Why her?

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:26.130 align:middle line:90%
>> And why her?

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:27.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think it has a lot
to do with the fact that she had

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:36.470 align:middle line:84%
already been having experiences
with them in childhood right

00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:37.640 align:middle line:90%
on up.

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
but her mother

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:44.690 align:middle line:84%
had been having
extraterrestrial encounters,

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:46.100 align:middle line:90%
although she would--

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:50.540 align:middle line:84%
and she talked about the
beings a lot, the mother did.

00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:53.690 align:middle line:84%
But she would never
agree to having

00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:56.690 align:middle line:84%
a regression, even though her
daughter kept saying, come on,

00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:57.490 align:middle line:90%
Mom.

00:40:57.490 --> 00:40:59.300 align:middle line:90%
Do it.

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:04.190 align:middle line:84%
But she obviously was having
encounters with these beings.

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And people who are
involved in this, usually,

00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:13.760 align:middle line:84%
as far as I know,
have families that

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:17.240 align:middle line:84%
also have some members
who are involved

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:19.890 align:middle line:90%
in this sort of encounter--

00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:20.800 align:middle line:90%
generations.

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:25.050 align:middle line:84%
So this woman's mother
had been involved,

00:41:25.050 --> 00:41:30.860 align:middle line:84%
although she never quite
faced the whole reality of it.

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:34.110 align:middle line:84%
But she remembers seeing
extraterrestrial beings

00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:34.910 align:middle line:90%
in her room.

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And she was seeing
shadow people frequently.

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And she had some odd
missing time experiences,

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:48.410 align:middle line:84%
which we could put together
with at least probable

00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:50.690 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial encounters.

00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And she thought that
maybe her mother--

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:57.170 align:middle line:84%
that would be my
client's grandmother--

00:41:57.170 --> 00:41:58.880 align:middle line:90%
had had experiences.

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:01.595 align:middle line:90%
And then my client had two sons.

00:42:01.595 --> 00:42:03.680 align:middle line:90%
They're both grown up now.

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And one of those
sons, very apparently,

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:10.550 align:middle line:84%
has had lots of
extraterrestrial encounters.

00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:12.740 align:middle line:90%
The other one probably hasn't.

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:17.340 align:middle line:84%
So it does seem to run in a
genetic line very frequently.

00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:22.520 align:middle line:84%
So the people who get
healed, I think, so far--

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:25.520 align:middle line:84%
this can change
with learning more--

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:29.870 align:middle line:84%
but they seem to be
people who already

00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:33.480 align:middle line:84%
have been having a series of
encounters with those beings.

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:34.280 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And at a certain point, they
do get healed by the beings.

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:42.560 align:middle line:84%
If something
develops that is not

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:45.390 align:middle line:84%
the way it should
be for that person,

00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:46.760 align:middle line:90%
the beings will heal it.

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:50.750 align:middle line:84%
>> There's really no way to
tell how far back these--

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:52.070 align:middle line:90%
in the bloodlines--

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:53.570 align:middle line:90%
>> No, unfortunately.

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:57.735 align:middle line:84%
If we could somehow interview
the great-great parents,

00:42:57.735 --> 00:43:00.110 align:middle line:84%
and the great great great
great great great grandparents,

00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:02.960 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, it
would be wonderful,

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:05.690 align:middle line:84%
if we-- or if there were
some other way to check.

00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:08.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, maybe this is a
question for my next ET

00:43:08.490 --> 00:43:09.290 align:middle line:90%
interview that I--

00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:10.860 align:middle line:90%
when I go talk to them directly.

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:11.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:12.470 align:middle line:90%
>> I can say, hey, guys.

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:13.303 align:middle line:90%
What's up with this?

00:43:13.303 --> 00:43:15.830 align:middle line:84%
>> And has anybody
else in your family?

00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:16.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:21.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Very often, when I ask that
question of anybody who seems

00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:25.790 align:middle line:84%
to be having encounters,
they'll say, yeah,

00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:30.650 align:middle line:84%
one of my sisters is having
these experiences, or, well,

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:33.920 align:middle line:84%
my mother won't quite
admit it exactly.

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:37.400 align:middle line:84%
But I remember her
saying some things

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:41.570 align:middle line:84%
about unusual beings coming
into the room at night,

00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:46.970 align:middle line:84%
or giving strong clues that
she too has had experiences.

00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:50.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the really
exciting things to me

00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:55.700 align:middle line:84%
is when there is an
encounter that happens,

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:58.250 align:middle line:90%
and it is witnessed.

00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:00.200 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes that happens.

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:04.580 align:middle line:84%
I think it's quite rare,
because these beings typically

00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:10.920 align:middle line:84%
will, what we call, switch
off anybody accompanying

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:11.720 align:middle line:90%
the person.

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:13.187 align:middle line:90%
Like the men in black.

00:44:13.187 --> 00:44:17.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And that could be a whole
group of people that are all

00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:22.700 align:middle line:84%
sort of stopped in mid-sentence
or mid-action and just out

00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:23.640 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:25.250 align:middle line:90%
They're not harmed.

00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:27.410 align:middle line:90%
They're just made unaware.

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Or it could, and very
typically, be the person

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:33.980 align:middle line:84%
sleeping in the room
or sleeping in the bed

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:36.380 align:middle line:84%
with the person who
has this encounter.

00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And that other one is,
phew, switched off,

00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:42.380 align:middle line:90%
just out of total awareness.

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Or it might be a
car full of people

00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:48.260 align:middle line:84%
that is stopped when
driving along, even

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:54.290 align:middle line:84%
in a populated area, or a rural
area would be very common too.

00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And then the car
motor comes to a stop.

00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, the driver
pulls off the road,

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.910 align:middle line:84%
or at least well
over to the side.

00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And everyone else in
the car is switched off.

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And this one particular person
is taken for the encounter.

00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And that seems to
happen all the time.

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:20.240 align:middle line:90%
>> So does time itself stop?

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:23.960 align:middle line:90%
Or do just people black out?

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:26.330 align:middle line:90%
Or how is it described?

00:45:26.330 --> 00:45:28.730 align:middle line:84%
Because it sounds
like, in some cases,

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:31.580 align:middle line:84%
they could actually
manipulate time itself.

00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:33.680 align:middle line:90%
>> They can manipulate time.

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:36.240 align:middle line:84%
I have no clue about
how they do it.

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:39.600 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's evident
that they do do that.

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:42.500 align:middle line:84%
But many, many cases,
the person will

00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:49.040 align:middle line:84%
be missing a period of time
and realize after an encounter

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:51.080 align:middle line:84%
that, oh, an hour and
a half has gone by.

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:52.550 align:middle line:90%
Where did that go?

00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:57.140 align:middle line:84%
Or two hours, typically,
sometimes more.

00:45:57.140 --> 00:46:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And then the encounter has
happened in the meantime.

00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:03.470 align:middle line:84%
But there are
situations, including

00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:10.580 align:middle line:84%
one that I had myself,
where the beings already

00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:15.470 align:middle line:84%
planned to manipulate
time to the extent

00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:19.460 align:middle line:84%
that I would be placed
back down on the freeway.

00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:20.480 align:middle line:90%
I had been driving on.

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:22.280 align:middle line:90%
My car and I were taken.

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And I would be placed
back only about one minute

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:32.620 align:middle line:84%
after I had looked at the
clock to see what time it was.

00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:34.680 align:middle line:90%
And then this event happened.

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:35.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you describe the event?

00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:37.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And so I didn't
miss two hours.

00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:38.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:40.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So but it felt-- it was two
hours, about, that was gone,

00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:41.710 align:middle line:90%
or it felt like?

00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:41.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:46:41.770 --> 00:46:44.228 align:middle line:84%
It was at least an hour and a
half, probably more like two.

00:46:44.228 --> 00:46:45.028 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:45.028 --> 00:46:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, can you
give us more details?

00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:47.590 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:46:47.590 --> 00:46:48.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:52.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, it really was a very
fascinating experience.

00:46:52.930 --> 00:46:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And my car and I were
driving around midnight,

00:46:58.210 --> 00:47:02.180 align:middle line:84%
back from Goleta,
north of Santa Barbara,

00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:06.460 align:middle line:84%
California, coming down the
101 freeway right by the ocean.

00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And I had noticed that,
well, this is strange.

00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:13.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't see any
headlights coming,

00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:18.100 align:middle line:84%
or tail lights ahead of me,
or headlights in back of me.

00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:21.240 align:middle line:84%
And that went on for
a number of miles.

00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, that means
that I'm the only car driving

00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:26.530 align:middle line:90%
on this part of the freeway.

00:47:26.530 --> 00:47:28.270 align:middle line:90%
And it's Friday night.

00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:33.430 align:middle line:84%
People often come up north
or go south for the weekend.

00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:35.260 align:middle line:90%
And it's only around midnight.

00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:36.850 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's really peculiar.

00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:38.020 align:middle line:90%
Well, OK.

00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:39.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm all right.

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw a round flash
of light, perfectly circular,

00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:48.530 align:middle line:90%
off the coast, over the ocean.

00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:50.500 align:middle line:90%
It was a very overcast night.

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:51.640 align:middle line:90%
So I couldn't see ocean.

00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:53.190 align:middle line:90%
But I knew it was there.

00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:55.280 align:middle line:90%
I had done that trip many times.

00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:57.610 align:middle line:90%
And so this round--

00:47:57.610 --> 00:48:02.570 align:middle line:84%
big, round flash of light,
pew, just that long,

00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:07.790 align:middle line:84%
just lasting one
second, and then gone.

00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
that's really peculiar.

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:12.890 align:middle line:90%
What was that, you know?

00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:13.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:18.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And then I notice a few miles
later that there seemed to be

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:24.160 align:middle line:84%
a big arc of light over
the hills to my left.

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:27.100 align:middle line:90%
That's to the east.

00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:28.720 align:middle line:90%
And I knew that territory.

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:31.820 align:middle line:84%
I had had many trips
up there previously.

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that there
were no towns over there,

00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:35.650 align:middle line:90%
or stores, or anything.

00:48:35.650 --> 00:48:37.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And you say arc, like
it's coming over the horizon,

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:38.030 align:middle line:90%
kind of, or--

00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:38.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:39.520 align:middle line:90%
There were hills.

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And it was like over the top
of the hills seemed to be this

00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:49.540 align:middle line:84%
very even arc of light
that was whitish-greenish,

00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:52.450 align:middle line:84%
which is exactly the
color of that, pew--

00:48:52.450 --> 00:48:53.250 align:middle line:90%
>> The flash.

00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>> --flash that had happened.

00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:58.730 align:middle line:90%
Wow, that is unusual.

00:48:58.730 --> 00:49:00.520 align:middle line:84%
I wonder-- I mean,
I know there are

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:02.710 align:middle line:90%
no towns or houses over there.

00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:04.210 align:middle line:90%
I wonder what that light is.

00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:05.770 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's OK.

00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:08.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm still all right, and--

00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:09.550 align:middle line:90%
saying to myself.

00:49:09.550 --> 00:49:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And then I noticed that
there was what I thought

00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:16.900 align:middle line:84%
was a big trailer truck,
half on the freeway

00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:19.780 align:middle line:84%
and half off the freeway,
over at the side.

00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And there were lights
around the bottom.

00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:26.230 align:middle line:84%
I had that
impression, and people

00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:27.400 align:middle line:90%
walking around the lights.

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:33.488 align:middle line:84%
So I assumed just a regular
old natural Earth human thing--

00:49:33.488 --> 00:49:34.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, construction workers.

00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:36.850 align:middle line:84%
>> --that it was a truck
that had had a flat tire

00:49:36.850 --> 00:49:38.020 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:39.520 align:middle line:90%
And they had the flares up.

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:42.520 align:middle line:84%
That must have been what
was causing the light--

00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:46.270 align:middle line:84%
flares you put on the road
and people walking around

00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:49.420 align:middle line:84%
to check and maybe
work on this truck.

00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And then just at the other
end of the truck, there--

00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:56.740 align:middle line:84%
in my windshield,
just past the edge

00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:58.900 align:middle line:84%
of the truck, which,
by the way, seemed

00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:04.210 align:middle line:84%
like an especially
long truck compared

00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:06.180 align:middle line:90%
to other trucks here on Earth--

00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:11.650 align:middle line:84%
and then there was a big flash
of light across my windshield,

00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:13.930 align:middle line:84%
as if it was right
outside the windshield.

00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:17.540 align:middle line:84%
It was sort of a
peachy, pinky color.

00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And it had a little,
what looked like a ribbon

00:50:20.290 --> 00:50:26.230 align:middle line:84%
or something stretched
taut on an angle across it.

00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And the most striking
thing, even though that

00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:31.900 align:middle line:84%
was remarkable enough, but
the most striking thing

00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:35.800 align:middle line:84%
was, at the same instant,
the light, the ribbon--

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:39.250 align:middle line:84%
there was a crack
in my windshield,

00:50:39.250 --> 00:50:42.700 align:middle line:84%
right in front of my face, in
front of the driver's wheel.

00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:47.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was in the shape of a--
like a complicated spider web.

00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And so my inkling was to
slow down, and back up,

00:50:53.410 --> 00:50:55.090 align:middle line:84%
and talk to those
people back there

00:50:55.090 --> 00:50:57.370 align:middle line:84%
at the other end
of this big truck,

00:50:57.370 --> 00:50:59.050 align:middle line:90%
and say, what are you doing?

00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:01.390 align:middle line:90%
My windshield has been cracked.

00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:07.150 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't do that, because
this big, resounding voice

00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:10.750 align:middle line:84%
in my head, just like
that time earlier,

00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:15.970 align:middle line:84%
said to me, really
insistent, saying, no.

00:51:15.970 --> 00:51:17.050 align:middle line:90%
Don't slow down.

00:51:17.050 --> 00:51:18.010 align:middle line:90%
Don't stop.

00:51:18.010 --> 00:51:18.890 align:middle line:90%
Don't go back.

00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:21.850 align:middle line:84%
Just keep driving, driving,
driving all the way home.

00:51:21.850 --> 00:51:27.070 align:middle line:84%
I still had probably a two-hour
or two-and-a-quarter-hour trip

00:51:27.070 --> 00:51:29.260 align:middle line:90%
before being home.

00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, what I realized
in the regression

00:51:32.410 --> 00:51:36.620 align:middle line:84%
that I did three weeks
later to that event--

00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:40.420 align:middle line:84%
and I was regressed by
somebody really excellent

00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:43.220 align:middle line:84%
in doing regressions,
Dolores Cannon--

00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:44.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:44.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:45.420 align:middle line:90%
>> I've--

00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:47.570 align:middle line:84%
>> She's done thousands
of regressions.

00:51:47.570 --> 00:51:50.060 align:middle line:84%
>> I've actually reached out
to her to be part of this.

00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:50.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, good.

00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>> But I haven't got a
response yet, but hopefully.

00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:53.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, she's wonderful--

00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:54.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>> --and very talented, and
extremely interested in finding

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:04.000 align:middle line:84%
out as much
information as she can.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And she said, Barbara, if
anything interesting comes out

00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:09.130 align:middle line:84%
of this, do I have
your permission

00:52:09.130 --> 00:52:13.030 align:middle line:84%
to use this in the book
I am just completing?

00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:15.430 align:middle line:90%
So I said yes.

00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:24.215 align:middle line:84%
So in the regression, it showed
that that truck wasn't a truck.

00:52:24.215 --> 00:52:25.860 align:middle line:90%
>> A truck.

00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:31.580 align:middle line:84%
>> It was a UFO, and that
the lights around the bottom

00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:34.550 align:middle line:84%
weren't flares, that
they were light emitting,

00:52:34.550 --> 00:52:37.910 align:middle line:84%
that whole energy system
emitting from the bottom

00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:39.560 align:middle line:90%
of that craft.

00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And in reliving it in
the regression, I said,

00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:50.280 align:middle line:84%
can we just slow this down
so I can see these people?

00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:52.560 align:middle line:90%
Well, they weren't people.

00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>> ETs.

00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>> They were other
kinds of beings,

00:52:55.650 --> 00:52:57.360 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial beings.

00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:59.400 align:middle line:84%
So then, at the
end of that truck,

00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:03.630 align:middle line:84%
before the flash of light and
the crack in the windshield,

00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:05.400 align:middle line:90%
my car and I--

00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:07.640 align:middle line:90%
I still felt like I was driving.

00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:09.790 align:middle line:84%
But the motor wasn't
on any longer.

00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And we were being
drawn up in what

00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:19.200 align:middle line:84%
seemed like a diagonal beam
of light and then into--

00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:22.110 align:middle line:90%
straight up into a craft.

00:53:22.110 --> 00:53:24.430 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see that craft
from the outside--

00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:26.040 align:middle line:90%
craft up in the air--

00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:29.070 align:middle line:90%
and slid onto a floor.

00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And lots of little
beings came around,

00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:36.450 align:middle line:84%
probably 20 or 30 really short
beings, sort of silvery blue.

00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And they had big,
almond-shaped eyes

00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:45.300 align:middle line:84%
that looked to me like a cobalt
blue, so like the little greys,

00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:47.580 align:middle line:90%
except more silvery-bluey.

00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:51.660 align:middle line:90%
And they were so curious.

00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as my car and I
were there in this enclosure,

00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:59.280 align:middle line:84%
which I assume was
a craft, they came

00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:01.950 align:middle line:84%
running from all
directions, climbing

00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:05.190 align:middle line:84%
all over the car, up
on the hood of the car,

00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:06.900 align:middle line:84%
looking down through
the windshield,

00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:11.220 align:middle line:84%
upside-down, and looking
in all the windows,

00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:14.220 align:middle line:90%
climbing up on the hood.

00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And then even though I know
I had locked the doors,

00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:20.970 align:middle line:84%
because I don't like
to drive alone at night

00:54:20.970 --> 00:54:23.640 align:middle line:90%
with unlocked car doors--

00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:26.370 align:middle line:84%
even though I know they were
locked, because I checked it

00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:31.980 align:middle line:84%
just before I left, two
beings opened the door,

00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:35.280 align:middle line:84%
and came in, and sat
on the passenger seat,

00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:39.120 align:middle line:84%
right on top of my candies and
my purse that I had out there.

00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And two others opened
the driver's door.

00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And they were so curious,
and funny, and cute.

00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:53.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was just fascinated
with them, no fear at all.

00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:54.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:56.753 align:middle line:84%
That's why you like that
little statue over there.

00:54:56.753 --> 00:54:57.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:01.830 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that helped to
acclimatize myself to it.

00:55:01.830 --> 00:55:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And so then I was drawn out
of the car and sort of ushered

00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:13.770 align:middle line:84%
and floated upright across that
room that we were in, which

00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:16.140 align:middle line:84%
served as sort of a
garage, I figured--

00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:18.120 align:middle line:84%
there wasn't anything
in the room--

00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:22.950 align:middle line:84%
and then through a door with a
rounded top, into another room.

00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And in that room,
I could see, there

00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:29.880 align:middle line:84%
was a very straight column
coming from the ceiling

00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:34.830 align:middle line:84%
to a platform, about a
one-foot-high platform,

00:55:34.830 --> 00:55:39.720 align:middle line:84%
and a chair, very straight
chair with straight arms,

00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:41.860 align:middle line:90%
attached to that platform.

00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:43.390 align:middle line:90%
And at the top of the platform--

00:55:43.390 --> 00:55:47.250 align:middle line:84%
I was being ushered
across to that chair--

00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:52.890 align:middle line:84%
I could see that there was a
metallic object, which reminded

00:55:52.890 --> 00:55:57.690 align:middle line:90%
me of a beehive shape of metal.

00:55:57.690 --> 00:56:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And it looked like
different pieces of metal,

00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:08.920 align:middle line:90%
reminded me of a vegetable--

00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:11.230 align:middle line:84%
not a sieve, but
one of those things

00:56:11.230 --> 00:56:13.115 align:middle line:84%
that you put in a pan
and steam vegetables

00:56:13.115 --> 00:56:15.027 align:middle line:90%
in with sort of sliding pieces.

00:56:15.027 --> 00:56:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, right, right.

00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:16.818 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:56:16.818 --> 00:56:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I've forgotten what the
name of that object is.

00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:21.440 align:middle line:90%
It reminded me of that.

00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:23.200 align:middle line:84%
And then, so they
sat me in this chair,

00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:26.770 align:middle line:84%
put my arms on the arms of
these very straight arms,

00:56:26.770 --> 00:56:28.540 align:middle line:84%
and then brought
down the helmet,

00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:32.710 align:middle line:84%
fitted it all around my
head, and particularly

00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:37.980 align:middle line:84%
where my head dents in a
little bit at the temples.

00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And then I felt a current
coming into my head,

00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:46.170 align:middle line:84%
through my whole body,
but especially in my head,

00:56:46.170 --> 00:56:48.220 align:middle line:90%
like an electrical current.

00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:49.770 align:middle line:90%
It didn't hurt.

00:56:49.770 --> 00:56:52.410 align:middle line:84%
But it was a very
noticeable feeling.

00:56:52.410 --> 00:56:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I wondered
what was going on.

00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And in the meantime, these
little beings sort of

00:56:57.220 --> 00:57:00.690 align:middle line:90%
formed a semicircle around me.

00:57:00.690 --> 00:57:02.520 align:middle line:90%
And they were looking up at--

00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:06.180 align:middle line:84%
these big eyes, and juggling
each other out of the way

00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:09.900 align:middle line:84%
so they could get a closer look,
and looking around the sides.

00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking at them
with absolute fascination.

00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And again, I think they
were adorable and almost

00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:27.150 align:middle line:84%
like innocent, childlike,
it seemed to me,

00:57:27.150 --> 00:57:29.160 align:middle line:84%
although they were
obviously involved in doing

00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:31.530 align:middle line:90%
something quite serious.

00:57:31.530 --> 00:57:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And then I noticed
that behind them, there

00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:38.160 align:middle line:90%
was a very tall white being--

00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:41.250 align:middle line:84%
very tall, very
thin, bigger eyes

00:57:41.250 --> 00:57:47.730 align:middle line:84%
that were more square with
rounded corners, it seemed,

00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:49.950 align:middle line:84%
came around the
sides a little bit.

00:57:49.950 --> 00:57:53.430 align:middle line:90%
And he started talking to me.

00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:55.320 align:middle line:90%
And he knew my name.

00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:58.150 align:middle line:90%
And he said, ah, Barbara.

00:57:58.150 --> 00:58:01.538 align:middle line:84%
You're probably wondering
what we're doing.

00:58:01.538 --> 00:58:05.010 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Yes.

00:58:05.010 --> 00:58:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And he said, first
of all, I want

00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:12.160 align:middle line:84%
you to know we're not
harming you in any way.

00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:16.710 align:middle line:84%
You will be perfectly all
right, which was reassuring.

00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And then he said,
what we're doing is--

00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:21.960 align:middle line:90%
and then he paused.

00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'm going to use
a word that you now understand.

00:58:27.450 --> 00:58:34.230 align:middle line:84%
We are downloading
information from your brain.

00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And we're not removing
your information

00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:42.480 align:middle line:90%
or your memories in your brain.

00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:45.690 align:middle line:84%
We're just making
a copy of them,

00:58:45.690 --> 00:58:48.390 align:middle line:84%
so those memories
and that information

00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:52.710 align:middle line:90%
will be intact inside yourself.

00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And then Dolores, who
was regressing me,

00:58:56.040 --> 00:59:01.230 align:middle line:84%
pitched in and said,
Barbara, ask him what

00:59:01.230 --> 00:59:04.140 align:middle line:90%
they do with this information.

00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:06.660 align:middle line:90%
And I asked him.

00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:11.490 align:middle line:90%
And he said, we broadcast it.

00:59:11.490 --> 00:59:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And Dolores said
again to me, lying

00:59:15.180 --> 00:59:22.240 align:middle line:84%
there, having the regression,
ask him who listens to it.

00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:24.970 align:middle line:90%
And he said, tell her that--

00:59:24.970 --> 00:59:27.430 align:middle line:84%
so in other words, he was even
aware of her ask questions--

00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:29.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Asking questions, yeah.

00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:31.540 align:middle line:84%
>> --even though this encounter
had happened three weeks

00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:32.340 align:middle line:90%
earlier--

00:59:32.340 --> 00:59:33.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Happened-- right.

00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>> --which gets into a whole
interesting question about

00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:41.840 align:middle line:84%
time, what time really
is, if there is any time.

00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And so he said,
well, we broadcast it

00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:54.890 align:middle line:84%
in signals similar to your radio
signals, or telephone signals,

00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:56.680 align:middle line:90%
or television signals.

00:59:56.680 --> 01:00:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And people can dial into
them if they want to.

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:04.000 align:middle line:84%
So those other beings
from other places,

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.720 align:middle line:84%
if they're interested
in this information,

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:11.890 align:middle line:84%
they will tune into that
particular frequency.

01:00:11.890 --> 01:00:13.510 align:middle line:84%
If they're not
interested, they just

01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:17.080 align:middle line:90%
won't, just like you humans do.

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:22.390 align:middle line:84%
And then she said, well, what
is this information about?

01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, what we
want to know is three things.

01:00:28.090 --> 01:00:31.750 align:middle line:90%
With all the people that she--

01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:36.910 align:middle line:84%
me-- works with
who've had experiences

01:00:36.910 --> 01:00:40.480 align:middle line:84%
with beings that come
from somewhere else,

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:47.170 align:middle line:84%
we want to know what those
people knew before they found

01:00:47.170 --> 01:00:49.330 align:middle line:90%
out more details in regression.

01:00:49.330 --> 01:00:52.750 align:middle line:84%
What was their whole
impression and opinion

01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:55.550 align:middle line:84%
before really knowing
the specifics?

01:00:55.550 --> 01:00:56.740 align:middle line:90%
That's one thing.

01:00:56.740 --> 01:01:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And we want to know
what specifically they

01:01:00.970 --> 01:01:04.120 align:middle line:84%
learned in the
regression, and then

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:08.050 align:middle line:84%
thirdly, how the
whole thing of having

01:01:08.050 --> 01:01:11.380 align:middle line:84%
these kinds of encounters
and experiences

01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:14.840 align:middle line:84%
is affecting them
in their lives.

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:18.490 align:middle line:84%
So some of these
beings, apparently,

01:01:18.490 --> 01:01:20.980 align:middle line:84%
are very, very
interested in that.

01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And some of them couldn't
care less and don't tune in.

01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And then Dolores kept
asking questions.

01:01:31.450 --> 01:01:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And he, after a
few more, he said,

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:38.890 align:middle line:90%
she can just ask me directly.

01:01:38.890 --> 01:01:41.780 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't have
to go through you.

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:44.020 align:middle line:84%
So she, sitting
in the room where

01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:45.940 align:middle line:84%
we were doing the
regression, which

01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:49.720 align:middle line:84%
happened to be up in Laramie,
Wyoming at the time--

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:53.200 align:middle line:90%
she would ask a question.

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:55.210 align:middle line:90%
And he would answer it.

01:01:55.210 --> 01:01:58.130 align:middle line:84%
But he'd answer it through me,
because she couldn't hear him.

01:01:58.130 --> 01:01:59.630 align:middle line:84%
You know, it had
to come through me.

01:01:59.630 --> 01:02:02.830 align:middle line:84%
I was the one having
the experience with him.

01:02:02.830 --> 01:02:07.000 align:middle line:84%
So this went on
for, oh, you know,

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.550 align:middle line:84%
another hour and a half
or hour and a quarter.

01:02:09.550 --> 01:02:12.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, so Dolores stopped
saying, Barbara, ask him this.

01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:13.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:14.560 align:middle line:90%
>> He just said--

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:15.060 align:middle line:90%
>> She just asked the question.

01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:16.320 align:middle line:84%
>> --said, OK, hey,
what's going on?

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:17.080 align:middle line:90%
>> And he answered it.

01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:17.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Directly.

01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:18.640 align:middle line:90%
>> But he had to--

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:20.080 align:middle line:84%
but I was the only
one who could--

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Could hear it.

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>> --hear his answer.

01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:22.868 align:middle line:90%
So I'd hear it and repeat it.

01:02:22.868 --> 01:02:25.080 align:middle line:84%
>> So in essence, you
were channeling his being.

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, channeling a being.

01:02:26.270 --> 01:02:27.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's right.

01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:28.460 align:middle line:90%
Ah, thank you.

01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:29.970 align:middle line:90%
I never thought of it that way.

01:02:29.970 --> 01:02:32.530 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think you
could say that.

01:02:32.530 --> 01:02:34.210 align:middle line:90%
So that was wonderful.

01:02:34.210 --> 01:02:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And he answered all
kinds of questions

01:02:36.310 --> 01:02:40.050 align:middle line:84%
about his type of
beings, and their planet,

01:02:40.050 --> 01:02:43.060 align:middle line:90%
and lots of information.

01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:46.900 align:middle line:84%
How do they know all that
about this one person,

01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:52.163 align:middle line:84%
about me, which I think
is remarkable, that--

01:02:52.163 --> 01:02:53.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Did she ask which--

01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>> --that he did know.

01:02:54.010 --> 01:02:56.400 align:middle line:84%
>> --which part of the
galaxy they were from, or--

01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:03.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and a lot about life
among their species and life

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:05.170 align:middle line:90%
on their planet in general.

01:03:05.170 --> 01:03:06.670 align:middle line:90%
And he gave lots of details.

01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:10.033 align:middle line:84%
And so after a
while, Dolores said,

01:03:10.033 --> 01:03:11.700 align:middle line:84%
well, we're going to
have to finish now.

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:15.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if the
audiotape she was taping on

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:17.410 align:middle line:84%
was running out or if
her time was running out.

01:03:17.410 --> 01:03:20.528 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, we'd been
going a good, long time.

01:03:20.528 --> 01:03:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And she said, we're going
to have to finish this.

01:03:22.570 --> 01:03:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And then he volunteered,
if you would

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:30.070 align:middle line:84%
like to have another
discussion like this,

01:03:30.070 --> 01:03:33.670 align:middle line:84%
arrange to meet again,
like you did now.

01:03:33.670 --> 01:03:36.040 align:middle line:90%
And have questions ready.

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And I will be very
happy to answer them.

01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:41.020 align:middle line:90%
What an opportunity!

01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:44.200 align:middle line:84%
So about two and a
half months later,

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:48.910 align:middle line:84%
Dolores Cannon came to the Los
Angeles area, which is only

01:03:48.910 --> 01:03:52.600 align:middle line:90%
about an hour's drive from me.

01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And so we arranged to
meet where she was.

01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:57.370 align:middle line:90%
And we did another regression.

01:03:57.370 --> 01:04:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And we both, this time, had
a long list of questions,

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:06.460 align:middle line:90%
which she read off and asked.

01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And then he would
hear this again.

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:14.680 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even have to
pass it through to him.

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:15.910 align:middle line:90%
And then he answered.

01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:18.710 align:middle line:90%
And I would give her the answer.

01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you have to recreate
kind of the moment of the actual

01:04:24.370 --> 01:04:25.925 align:middle line:90%
abduction or experience?

01:04:25.925 --> 01:04:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Did you have to kind
of walk through it

01:04:27.550 --> 01:04:28.675 align:middle line:90%
to get you back into that--

01:04:28.675 --> 01:04:30.940 align:middle line:84%
>> What we did, very,
very quickly, briefly,

01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:35.050 align:middle line:84%
was to begin the
session with relaxation.

01:04:35.050 --> 01:04:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And then she said,
we're going back

01:04:38.110 --> 01:04:41.920 align:middle line:84%
to that experience on the 101
freeway, where you and your car

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:42.722 align:middle line:90%
were taken--

01:04:42.722 --> 01:04:43.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right, right.

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:45.730 align:middle line:84%
>> --and had this long
conversation with the being--

01:04:45.730 --> 01:04:46.897 align:middle line:90%
>> It was a reference point.

01:04:46.897 --> 01:04:51.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And that opened the
way to his remotely,

01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:53.790 align:middle line:84%
from wherever he
was at the time,

01:04:53.790 --> 01:04:58.890 align:middle line:84%
knowing that this was the
opportunity to talk together

01:04:58.890 --> 01:04:59.710 align:middle line:90%
again.

01:04:59.710 --> 01:05:05.040 align:middle line:84%
So all of that information that
came from those two sessions

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:10.570 align:middle line:84%
is written in Dolores Cannon's
book called "The Custodians."

01:05:10.570 --> 01:05:11.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK, yeah.

01:05:11.730 --> 01:05:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's the last two
chapters of that book,

01:05:15.690 --> 01:05:20.100 align:middle line:84%
which she calls "Therapy
for the Therapist."

01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:20.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect title.

01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:22.785 align:middle line:90%
And she--

01:05:22.785 --> 01:05:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Or should it say "Therapy
from the Therapist"?

01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:26.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:27.270 align:middle line:90%
>> And for the therapist.

01:05:27.270 --> 01:05:29.050 align:middle line:84%
>> From, and for, and
within, and around.

01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:29.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

01:05:29.850 --> 01:05:35.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So she used the name Bonnie
for me, because at that time,

01:05:35.490 --> 01:05:39.930 align:middle line:84%
in the early 2000s, I think
this was, or end of the 1990s--

01:05:39.930 --> 01:05:42.540 align:middle line:84%
at that particular
time, I didn't

01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:45.960 align:middle line:84%
feel favorable about
declaring in public

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:48.750 align:middle line:84%
that I, too, was
having experiences.

01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:52.110 align:middle line:84%
Since then, obviously,
I've gotten past that sense

01:05:52.110 --> 01:05:53.270 align:middle line:90%
of reserve about it.

01:05:53.270 --> 01:05:56.070 align:middle line:90%
But so she calls me Bonnie.

01:05:56.070 --> 01:06:01.800 align:middle line:84%
But it's all about my
regressions and my experience.

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:10.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Based on that experience and
the thousand-plus regression--

01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:11.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Or--

01:06:11.310 --> 01:06:12.260 align:middle line:90%
>> --or 2,000-plus.

01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:12.550 align:middle line:90%
>> 2,000.

01:06:12.550 --> 01:06:13.967 align:middle line:84%
Two and a half
thousand, probably.

01:06:13.967 --> 01:06:20.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah-- plus regressions that
you've done with other people,

01:06:20.410 --> 01:06:24.790 align:middle line:90%
can you sum up why--

01:06:24.790 --> 01:06:27.430 align:middle line:90%
why do we have these visitors?

01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:35.570 align:middle line:84%
Or even better, what is
this Earth experience?

01:06:35.570 --> 01:06:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I know that's
a massive question to answer.

01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:41.670 align:middle line:90%
This is a final question.

01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:47.790 align:middle line:84%
But if there's some kind of
overlapping sort of thing

01:06:47.790 --> 01:06:52.820 align:middle line:84%
that you've gotten from all of
your collective experiences,

01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:54.810 align:middle line:90%
and a short--

01:06:54.810 --> 01:06:58.805 align:middle line:84%
the shortest possible
way to wrap that up.

01:06:58.805 --> 01:07:05.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Earth and humanity seem to be
extremely interesting to many,

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:07.950 align:middle line:84%
many of these
extraterrestrial species.

01:07:07.950 --> 01:07:12.130 align:middle line:84%
They know about us, even if
we don't know about them.

01:07:12.130 --> 01:07:15.060 align:middle line:84%
They have this
remarkable ability,

01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:21.690 align:middle line:84%
I think, of remote viewing and
remote sensing, remote knowing.

01:07:21.690 --> 01:07:23.010 align:middle line:90%
They know what's in our minds.

01:07:23.010 --> 01:07:24.840 align:middle line:90%
They know what's in our hearts.

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:29.370 align:middle line:84%
They also see so much
of what is going on.

01:07:29.370 --> 01:07:31.500 align:middle line:90%
And they're very concerned.

01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Many of these groups
have expressed

01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:36.780 align:middle line:84%
that they're very concerned
about planet Earth,

01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:40.720 align:middle line:84%
because we're destroying
it slowly but surely.

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:43.530 align:middle line:90%
We're ruining life on Earth.

01:07:43.530 --> 01:07:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And we just don't even pay
enough attention to that.

01:07:47.710 --> 01:07:51.000 align:middle line:84%
But they can see from
their perspective.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:55.370 align:middle line:84%
And some of them have even been
on planets that were ruined.

01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And life had to move elsewhere,
move on to other places

01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:01.920 align:middle line:90%
to live in the cosmos.

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:07.710 align:middle line:84%
So they're so aware that Earth
humans could be really ending

01:08:07.710 --> 01:08:10.520 align:middle line:84%
the possibility
of life on Earth.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want
to see that happen.

01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:17.189 align:middle line:84%
Another aspect is that they're
very interested in humanity,

01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:20.700 align:middle line:84%
because humanity
has been influenced

01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:26.020 align:middle line:84%
genetically by a lot of
those different species.

01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:32.399 align:middle line:84%
Many of those species claim to
have responsibility for some

01:08:32.399 --> 01:08:34.109 align:middle line:90%
of our characteristics.

01:08:34.109 --> 01:08:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And this, of course,
goes way back

01:08:36.450 --> 01:08:39.330 align:middle line:90%
before our recorded history.

01:08:39.330 --> 01:08:44.250 align:middle line:84%
But I think, having heard
of this from enough people,

01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:48.000 align:middle line:84%
or enough extraterrestrials,
I should say, by now,

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.040 align:middle line:84%
that I think that
this is really true.

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:51.840 align:middle line:90%
I think it has merit.

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:57.000 align:middle line:84%
So each one of those species
that ever, in eons of time,

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.649 align:middle line:84%
had some influence in
creating certain aspects

01:09:01.649 --> 01:09:03.000 align:middle line:90%
of the human race--

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.460 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of like we're
their children who

01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:08.430 align:middle line:90%
have gone far away.

01:09:08.430 --> 01:09:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And they want to
know how we're doing.

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And when they see
how we're doing,

01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:17.310 align:middle line:84%
they think it's really
deplorable as a humanity.

01:09:17.310 --> 01:09:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And they're
particularly concerned

01:09:20.130 --> 01:09:23.520 align:middle line:90%
with our nuclear capability.

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:28.470 align:middle line:84%
This is extremely
serious, not only for us

01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:33.000 align:middle line:84%
and all life on Earth,
and even the Earth itself.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.620 align:middle line:84%
But if we start setting
off nuclear warfare

01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:43.710 align:middle line:84%
or nuclear devices for any
purpose, and even all the leaks

01:09:43.710 --> 01:09:46.560 align:middle line:84%
that are happening
and could continue

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:52.279 align:middle line:84%
to happen, that this
pollution not only affects

01:09:52.279 --> 01:09:55.010 align:middle line:84%
the Earth and the
atmosphere around the Earth,

01:09:55.010 --> 01:10:00.350 align:middle line:84%
but they know that it affects
the entire solar system

01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:04.410 align:middle line:84%
and even beyond
our solar system.

01:10:04.410 --> 01:10:09.170 align:middle line:84%
So they are at risk
too by our having

01:10:09.170 --> 01:10:12.140 align:middle line:90%
all this nuclear capability.

01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And combining that with
that very unfortunate,

01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:22.670 align:middle line:84%
more like pugnacious tendency
that so many humans have--

01:10:22.670 --> 01:10:26.050 align:middle line:84%
not all, but too
many of them do--

01:10:26.050 --> 01:10:31.730 align:middle line:84%
that it could be so easy to
use that nuclear proliferation,

01:10:31.730 --> 01:10:34.100 align:middle line:84%
and whether it's an
accident, or it's on purpose,

01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:38.630 align:middle line:84%
or it's for some political
gain or to stop another war.

01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:42.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we are just at
the brink all the time

01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:44.450 align:middle line:90%
of setting that loose.

01:10:44.450 --> 01:10:47.510 align:middle line:90%
So they're very concerned.

01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And they also have been
creating-- many species have--

01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:59.870 align:middle line:84%
of hybrid beings-- part them
genetically and part human.

01:10:59.870 --> 01:11:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And they give many
reasons for this.

01:11:03.180 --> 01:11:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is
that if their species

01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:12.920 align:middle line:84%
wants to be able to
eventually live on Earth--

01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:15.560 align:middle line:84%
and I don't mean
taking over the Earth.

01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:20.820 align:middle line:84%
I've never, never felt that
that is part of their agenda.

01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:24.440 align:middle line:84%
But if they want to live here,
some of them, and commingle,

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:27.050 align:middle line:84%
and even help us,
they would have

01:11:27.050 --> 01:11:31.220 align:middle line:84%
to be partly human
beings themselves.

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And then they talk
about how we could

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:42.980 align:middle line:84%
have very wise ambassadors,
who are part extraterrestrial

01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:47.450 align:middle line:84%
and part human, who could go
from this planet to another

01:11:47.450 --> 01:11:50.420 align:middle line:84%
and from another planet
to here, that they

01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:53.240 align:middle line:84%
could help us to get
to know each other

01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:55.440 align:middle line:90%
and understand each other.

01:11:55.440 --> 01:12:01.730 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these beings would
like to see us, humanity, really

01:12:01.730 --> 01:12:08.180 align:middle line:84%
upgraded and be able to
be more encompassing, more

01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:13.250 align:middle line:84%
allowing, more accepting of our
view of other kinds of beings,

01:12:13.250 --> 01:12:16.670 align:middle line:84%
and to really be
able to take our part

01:12:16.670 --> 01:12:19.100 align:middle line:90%
in the cosmic community.

01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:22.760 align:middle line:84%
They talk about a
galactic federation

01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:27.350 align:middle line:84%
that already exists for
millennia, probably,

01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:30.230 align:middle line:84%
with many, many
different species, maybe

01:12:30.230 --> 01:12:35.240 align:middle line:84%
thousands of different
kinds of intelligent species

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:38.390 align:middle line:84%
congregating together
and sorting out

01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:41.390 align:middle line:90%
problems in the universe.

01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And planet Earth is
not part of that.

01:12:44.810 --> 01:12:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Planet Earth is
way off out of it.

01:12:47.710 --> 01:12:53.930 align:middle line:84%
We have not evolved consciously
and spiritually enough

01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:56.480 align:middle line:90%
to really participate in that.

01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And they would like
to see us do that.

01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:05.840 align:middle line:84%
An interesting corollary to
that is that a few of my clients

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:08.300 align:middle line:84%
have found in their
regressions that they

01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:13.020 align:middle line:84%
have been taken to council
meetings, where there's

01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:19.730 align:middle line:84%
a whole congregation of
many, many different types

01:13:19.730 --> 01:13:21.490 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrial beings.

01:13:21.490 --> 01:13:22.290 align:middle line:90%
And they--

01:13:22.290 --> 01:13:23.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Like something
out of "Star Wars."

01:13:23.090 --> 01:13:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And they, usually with
a couple of others or a few

01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:28.220 align:middle line:84%
others, are
delegates from Earth.

01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:33.650 align:middle line:84%
So to some extent, it seems
to be happening already.

01:13:33.650 --> 01:13:38.450 align:middle line:84%
But they would like us, as
a whole planetary society,

01:13:38.450 --> 01:13:44.360 align:middle line:84%
to be very aware of
participating intergalactically

01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:49.550 align:middle line:84%
with these other species,
and to participate peacefully

01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:54.890 align:middle line:84%
and intelligently, no
competition, no wars, no might

01:13:54.890 --> 01:14:00.410 align:middle line:84%
makes right, but really
to participate the way

01:14:00.410 --> 01:14:02.870 align:middle line:90%
that many of them do.

01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:03.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow, yeah.

01:14:03.890 --> 01:14:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>> I would just like to mention
quickly that there is this

01:14:08.810 --> 01:14:13.365 align:middle line:84%
incredibly wonderful
phenomenon going on on Earth,

01:14:13.365 --> 01:14:14.490 align:middle line:90%
the crop circle phenomenon.

01:14:14.490 --> 01:14:14.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yeah.

01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:16.495 align:middle line:84%
That's something
we've been getting to.

01:14:16.495 --> 01:14:20.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And it seems like this
really connects with all that

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:24.380 align:middle line:84%
we've been talking about,
not in the sense of personal

01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:28.490 align:middle line:84%
encounters with individual
extraterrestrials,

01:14:28.490 --> 01:14:33.770 align:middle line:84%
but in being communicated
with all over the planet,

01:14:33.770 --> 01:14:37.020 align:middle line:84%
particularly in England, where
most of them have happened.

01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:40.530 align:middle line:84%
But in most of the
countries of the world,

01:14:40.530 --> 01:14:44.300 align:middle line:84%
there will be appearing in
the fields, and have been,

01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:48.410 align:middle line:84%
these beautiful
symbolic patterns

01:14:48.410 --> 01:14:54.750 align:middle line:84%
laid down in crop fields and
making very specific patterns,

01:14:54.750 --> 01:15:00.110 align:middle line:84%
some of which we understand, we
recognize as meaningful symbols

01:15:00.110 --> 01:15:01.850 align:middle line:90%
here on Earth.

01:15:01.850 --> 01:15:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And many of the patterns might
be symbols that are meaningful

01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:09.980 align:middle line:84%
to them, to whoever
are the beings,

01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:14.070 align:middle line:84%
or wherever that intelligence
is that lays down the crop

01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:14.970 align:middle line:90%
circles.

01:15:14.970 --> 01:15:19.020 align:middle line:84%
It definitely seems that
we are being communicated

01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:26.440 align:middle line:84%
with from out there, from
other intelligences elsewhere.

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:30.810 align:middle line:84%
I think the most simplistic
thing that we can think of

01:15:30.810 --> 01:15:37.680 align:middle line:84%
is that they want us to know
about them in a very safe way.

01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:40.740 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to risk
coming here, or having

01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:45.630 align:middle line:84%
their crafts shot down, or
being imprisoned, and studied,

01:15:45.630 --> 01:15:50.040 align:middle line:84%
and dissected, as some
already have been.

01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:55.330 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole different way of
letting us know about them.

01:15:55.330 --> 01:15:56.790 align:middle line:90%
It's so benign.

01:15:56.790 --> 01:16:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a
lovely phenomenon.

01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:05.250 align:middle line:84%
Pictorially, it's so
attractive, so pretty.

01:16:05.250 --> 01:16:10.500 align:middle line:84%
It's geometrically very
intelligent, spiritually very

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:15.600 align:middle line:84%
intelligent, even
mathematically very intelligent,

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:17.490 align:middle line:90%
some of the crop circles.

01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:20.580 align:middle line:84%
So it's a gift in
the sense that it

01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:25.110 align:middle line:84%
just, like an art
form that's laid down

01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:28.140 align:middle line:84%
in a field of growing
crop, and stays

01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:33.600 align:middle line:84%
there as long as the crop
is still growing there.

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:38.580 align:middle line:84%
It's even still there after the
whole field has been harvested,

01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:45.120 align:middle line:84%
and all the standing crop is
gone, and even after the soil

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:47.190 align:middle line:84%
where the crop
circle is laid down--

01:16:47.190 --> 01:16:51.180 align:middle line:84%
when that's all tilled
over in the fall,

01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:55.620 align:middle line:84%
ready for the next
season of planting.

01:16:55.620 --> 01:17:00.270 align:middle line:84%
The reason it's still
there is that the energy

01:17:00.270 --> 01:17:04.080 align:middle line:84%
from the original crop
circle is still there.

01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
people who have

01:17:06.510 --> 01:17:13.790 align:middle line:84%
tested the same particular
spot in the same field for as

01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:18.200 align:middle line:84%
many as eight years that
I know of, maybe more.

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And even though new
crops have grown up

01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:26.990 align:middle line:84%
in that field, in that very
spot, for several more years,

01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:31.610 align:middle line:84%
and the tilling between
seasons, the energy

01:17:31.610 --> 01:17:34.970 align:middle line:84%
from the original crop
circle is still there.

01:17:34.970 --> 01:17:40.550 align:middle line:84%
So something really unusual and
different is happening there.

01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:45.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Almost like,
you know, I guess,

01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:50.513 align:middle line:84%
kind of, when you
harvest something new,

01:17:50.513 --> 01:17:51.555 align:middle line:90%
you put down the compost.

01:17:51.555 --> 01:17:54.630 align:middle line:90%


01:17:54.630 --> 01:17:55.860 align:middle line:90%
And then that creates--

01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:58.870 align:middle line:84%
that fertile soil will
create something new.

01:17:58.870 --> 01:18:01.860 align:middle line:84%
So maybe that's-- maybe they
were just planting new energies

01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:09.050 align:middle line:84%
for something new to grow,
not physically, but overall.

01:18:09.050 --> 01:18:13.020 align:middle line:84%
>> And when you think that these
crop circles do happen mostly

01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:17.910 align:middle line:84%
in England, but all over
the world, that maybe--

01:18:17.910 --> 01:18:19.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Except for the one up in--

01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:22.140 align:middle line:84%
last year, in-- or
earlier this year--

01:18:22.140 --> 01:18:22.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, up in--

01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:23.610 align:middle line:90%
>> --in California.

01:18:23.610 --> 01:18:24.652 align:middle line:90%
>> --northern California.

01:18:24.652 --> 01:18:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>> That was Nokia doing
some kind of advertisement.

01:18:27.510 --> 01:18:30.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's a whole
subject in itself.

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:35.100 align:middle line:84%
I think that they're saying
it was a man-made hoax.

01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:37.560 align:middle line:84%
I think they're saying
that it's a hoax.

01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:39.540 align:middle line:84%
I think it was a
genuine crop circle.

01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:39.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, really?

01:18:39.670 --> 01:18:40.470 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:18:40.470 --> 01:18:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And they saw it,
their marketing people.

01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:44.670 align:middle line:90%
Oh let's, use this.

01:18:44.670 --> 01:18:45.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:46.270 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

01:18:46.270 --> 01:18:48.900 align:middle line:84%
>> That's my personal
opinion, based on some

01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:50.170 align:middle line:90%
people's experiences--

01:18:50.170 --> 01:18:51.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Some of the data and stuff.

01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>> --whom I know who actually
went into that crop circle

01:18:55.660 --> 01:18:56.480 align:middle line:90%
and experienced it.

01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:59.190 align:middle line:84%
But that's kind of a
big subject right there.

01:18:59.190 --> 01:19:00.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:07.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so I think there are
many different ways that we are

01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:11.550 align:middle line:84%
in touch with these
extraterrestrial beings.

01:19:11.550 --> 01:19:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And one of them
is the encounters,

01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:22.290 align:middle line:84%
even the extradimensional,
other-dimensional beings

01:19:22.290 --> 01:19:23.190 align:middle line:90%
who come.

01:19:23.190 --> 01:19:29.880 align:middle line:84%
I think it's part of this
whole huge, universe-wise or

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:32.955 align:middle line:90%
cosmos-wide phenomenon.

01:19:32.955 --> 01:19:35.140 align:middle line:90%
And crop circles are one--

01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:35.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Aspect, yeah.

01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>> --part of this whole thing.

01:19:37.650 --> 01:19:40.790 align:middle line:90%
They're really trying to--

01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:44.570 align:middle line:84%
I think, with these sightings,
that they allow themselves

01:19:44.570 --> 01:19:52.070 align:middle line:84%
to be seen in their crafts--
the sightings, the encounters,

01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:55.400 align:middle line:84%
knowing that people can
find out the details

01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:59.750 align:middle line:84%
of their encounters, if they
choose to, through regressions.

01:19:59.750 --> 01:20:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And they may be
stimulating other people

01:20:03.650 --> 01:20:08.060 align:middle line:84%
to put on these wonderful
conferences, the UFO

01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:11.930 align:middle line:84%
conferences and spiritual
conferences in which this

01:20:11.930 --> 01:20:14.510 align:middle line:90%
comes in, to some extent.

01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:19.340 align:middle line:84%
I think that they're doing
quite a bit to upgrade humanity.

01:20:19.340 --> 01:20:20.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:20:20.140 --> 01:20:21.030 align:middle line:90%
Upgrade humanity.

01:20:21.030 --> 01:20:23.540 align:middle line:90%
>> And I really appreciate that.

01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:24.447 align:middle line:90%
I applaud that.

01:20:24.447 --> 01:20:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:29.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we can take all
the upgrading we can take.

01:20:29.390 --> 01:20:30.850 align:middle line:90%
It would be a really good thing.

01:20:30.850 --> 01:20:31.650 align:middle line:90%
>> This is true.

01:20:31.650 --> 01:20:32.140 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:32.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:37.173 align:middle line:84%
>> It definitely gives
me something to film.

01:20:37.173 --> 01:20:38.585 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it gives you--

01:20:38.585 --> 01:20:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm definitely
fascinated by--

01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:41.153 align:middle line:90%
>> --an interesting topic.

01:20:41.153 --> 01:20:44.110 align:middle line:84%
>> --interesting topics that
doesn't get enough attention.

01:20:44.110 --> 01:20:48.290 align:middle line:84%
I believe that for
many reasons, which

01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:50.720 align:middle line:84%
we won't get into at
the moment, but yeah,

01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:56.560 align:middle line:84%
there's not enough attention
put into this subject matter.

01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:58.180 align:middle line:90%
And that's why we're here.

01:20:58.180 --> 01:20:59.180 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're doing.

01:20:59.180 --> 01:20:59.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's a pleasure
and a privilege,

01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:07.340 align:middle line:84%
I truly feel, to be
talking about this,

01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:12.290 align:middle line:84%
to let more people know about
this very real phenomenon that

01:21:12.290 --> 01:21:16.780 align:middle line:84%
is going on, even if many
people are not aware of it yet.

01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully,
they will be more.

01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:22.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, thank you for all the
work you've been doing and you

01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:23.160 align:middle line:90%
continue to do.

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:25.530 align:middle line:90%
You've been a huge inspiration.

01:21:25.530 --> 01:21:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so glad we got to
have this conversation.

01:21:27.990 --> 01:21:28.903 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, me too.

01:21:28.903 --> 01:21:29.820 align:middle line:90%
>> And the regression.

01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:30.828 align:middle line:90%
That was--

01:21:30.828 --> 01:21:32.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, you had the regression.

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:32.953 align:middle line:90%
>> That was intense.

01:21:32.953 --> 01:21:34.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:21:34.170 --> 01:21:35.400 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that was good.

01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:36.390 align:middle line:90%
And you did very well.

01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:36.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:21:36.690 --> 01:21:37.290 align:middle line:90%
