[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.968 --> 00:00:54.090 align:middle line:90%


00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Before we start, did you want
to do a little meditation or is

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.440 align:middle line:90%
it just a--

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, well, let me just see.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.800 align:middle line:90%


00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting for us to
just really together come

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.160 align:middle line:84%
into a state of calm
and concept of space

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.070 align:middle line:84%
with the intention
of allowing what's

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.430 align:middle line:84%
in the highest good for all
concerned to come forward

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.640 align:middle line:84%
and to have a clear transmission
of the 11th dimensional

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.230 align:middle line:84%
Arcturian energy would you like
me to just kind of guide us

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.030 align:middle line:90%
through?

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, let's try this here.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So just find a comfortable
position allow your hands

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.390 align:middle line:84%
to face open and allow for
alignment in your spine

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.790 align:middle line:84%
in the back of your neck to
open channel their energy.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.500 align:middle line:90%


00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And we'll just
begin by visualizing

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:02.290 align:middle line:84%
the space, kind of a circle
around the space glowing

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.730 align:middle line:90%
with white light.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.900 align:middle line:84%
It's just a light
of purification

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:19.840 align:middle line:84%
and setting the space
for truth, love,

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.050 align:middle line:84%
and that which was my highest
good of all concerned to take

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.780 align:middle line:84%
place and calling upon
the angelic presences

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.360 align:middle line:84%
to assist us here in
holding this vibration.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.000 align:middle line:90%


00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.620 align:middle line:84%
The Arcturians always--
in coming through--

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.660 align:middle line:84%
in my experience,
always kind of come

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.740 align:middle line:84%
through paired with
angelic energies.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.830 align:middle line:90%
They work very closely together.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.680 align:middle line:84%
So the angelic
presences are here

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.590 align:middle line:84%
just to facilitate
this energy coming in.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And they want us
to know that this

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.260 align:middle line:84%
is a process that is
happening through both of us.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And that they will be
guiding you, Reuben, as well.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And really just for both of
us to be present in our hearts

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.860 align:middle line:90%
with what our intention is.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And with what this
service means in terms

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:32.150 align:middle line:90%
of how we can assist humanity.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And I also feel them
truly thanking you

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.630 align:middle line:84%
for what you're creating and
allowing to happen through you.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And they would like for you to
experience that acknowledgment

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.270 align:middle line:90%
in your heart.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.260 align:middle line:90%


00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.210 align:middle line:84%
Just breathe into that
for a few moments.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:59.180 align:middle line:90%


00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying that
the core of this intention

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.380 align:middle line:84%
to be of service is
really the energy

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.000 align:middle line:90%
on what you're creating rides.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And there is a blessing
extending through this project

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.649 align:middle line:84%
and through us here at this
time through all involved,

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:27.546 align:middle line:84%
through all who
view this creation.

00:04:27.546 --> 00:04:32.390 align:middle line:90%


00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:38.480 align:middle line:84%
There's a blessing being
extended, further recognition

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.310 align:middle line:84%
and resonance of the truth in
the hearts of all involved.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.180 align:middle line:90%


00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.176 align:middle line:90%
And when you're ready, you can--

00:04:47.176 --> 00:04:51.910 align:middle line:90%


00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:58.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, I would like to add just
for the sake of those viewing

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.200 align:middle line:84%
and for you that this
energy I often experience

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.640 align:middle line:90%
and visualize as a silvery blue.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.890 align:middle line:90%
It's very angelic, celestial.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:16.090 align:middle line:90%


00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.140 align:middle line:84%
Again, is often paired with a
white angelic energy as well.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:27.340 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, I visualize
it as a cylinder

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.380 align:middle line:84%
of silvery blue
energy surrounded

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.990 align:middle line:90%
by kind of a cloud of light.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.070 align:middle line:84%
So calling the energy
in this way really

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:45.360 align:middle line:84%
assists in the
clearest connection.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And the angelic presences
also assist the individual

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:54.270 align:middle line:84%
in raising their own frequency
to make clear contact.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:07.200 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.965 align:middle line:84%
Reuben there, showing
me your heart.

00:06:12.965 --> 00:06:18.010 align:middle line:90%


00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.590 align:middle line:84%
They're asking me to let
go of any mental filters

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.040 align:middle line:84%
that I'm placing on
what's coming through.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And what they're telling
me is that questions

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:41.440 align:middle line:84%
are most powerful when
felt in your heart

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.880 align:middle line:84%
as the answers are most powerful
when felt in your heart.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:56.000 align:middle line:84%
Showing me a stream of
energy through the heart

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.360 align:middle line:84%
which connects into
all layers of reality.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.260 align:middle line:84%
But by riding on this
stream of energy,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.680 align:middle line:84%
one penetrates the
truth of all levels.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.045 align:middle line:90%


00:07:14.045 --> 00:07:20.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome back,
speaking of the heart,

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.935 align:middle line:84%
maybe that's where we'll
start the first question.

00:07:22.935 --> 00:07:28.320 align:middle line:90%


00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:33.210 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is that the
fourth density or this space

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:34.800 align:middle line:84%
where we are right
now in humanity,

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:40.620 align:middle line:84%
we're moving into this
heart-centered density,

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.330 align:middle line:90%
this middle zone.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:48.660 align:middle line:84%
But as other beings have gone
through the evolutionary stage

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.000 align:middle line:84%
up through the higher
densities, maybe

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.210 align:middle line:84%
correlating with chakras going
into the higher densities.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:58.680 align:middle line:84%
How does the heart
centered come into play?

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:03.540 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're in let's
say 5th or 6th density

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:10.670 align:middle line:84%
consciousness up there, then
where's the heart lie in that?

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.910 align:middle line:90%


00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.230 align:middle line:90%
Do you go beyond the heart?

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:17.510 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:21.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes there has been
a misunderstanding that

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:22.580 align:middle line:90%
in the fourth density--

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:26.260 align:middle line:84%
the fourth dimension sometimes
it's referred to as well--

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.890 align:middle line:84%
that this is the
space of the heart,

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:30.470 align:middle line:90%
the space of unconditional love.

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.539 align:middle line:84%
And then that there
is a space above that

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:37.039 align:middle line:84%
in some sense in which that's
no longer the primary focus.

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:40.130 align:middle line:84%
What we offer from
our perspective

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:45.490 align:middle line:84%
is that the energy that
comes through the heart,

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:47.560 align:middle line:90%
the heart as the center.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Often, there's a hierarchy
that is constructed

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:55.510 align:middle line:84%
through the human mind and
the mind of other beings

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:59.350 align:middle line:84%
in which there is a sense of a
destination in which ascension

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:03.790 align:middle line:84%
is framed in terms
of moving upwards.

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And what we propose
to you at this time

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:12.850 align:middle line:84%
is that the process of ascension
is not moving anywhere.

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:15.340 align:middle line:84%
That truly the
process of ascension

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.830 align:middle line:84%
is coming into the
realization of what already

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:22.430 align:middle line:90%
is here and now in the center.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:26.350 align:middle line:84%
So as this relationship
to the heart

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:31.330 align:middle line:84%
develops in the
human system, there

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:35.890 align:middle line:84%
will be an acknowledgment
of the heart as the center.

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:37.780 align:middle line:84%
There will be an
attunement to the heart

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:40.960 align:middle line:84%
as the authority
for those who wish

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.870 align:middle line:84%
to have the experience of
love, for those who wish

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:48.040 align:middle line:90%
to ascend as many refer to it.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:53.830 align:middle line:84%
We have through our
evolution as Arcturians.

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:56.590 align:middle line:84%
Much of the reason why
we coming into contact

00:09:56.590 --> 00:10:00.580 align:middle line:84%
at this time with humanity is
that we have also experienced

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.130 align:middle line:84%
this ascension
process in which many

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:05.290 align:middle line:84%
of the beings
residing in our system

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:08.320 align:middle line:90%
have held the same intention--

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.010 align:middle line:84%
therefore, have been able
to experience this awakening

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:13.780 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:17.440 align:middle line:84%
Within our system,
we have undergone

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:24.280 align:middle line:84%
an evolutionary process
much like that on Earth.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.300 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, we're
here at this time

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:32.870 align:middle line:84%
to reinforce the
importance for those

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:37.880 align:middle line:84%
who wish to experience love
to truly focus on the heart

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:42.300 align:middle line:84%
and focus on what is present
here and now in the heart.

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.076 align:middle line:10%
>> So you would--

00:10:44.076 --> 00:10:46.310 align:middle line:10%
the Arcturian energies
that I'm speaking

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:51.350 align:middle line:10%
with-- be considered a
collective of beings as opposed

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:52.910 align:middle line:10%
to a single being?

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:54.440 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Is there a
dimensional realm--

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:01.430 align:middle line:10%
I've spoken in the past to
9th dimensional Pleiadians,

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:03.840 align:middle line:10%
12th dimensional Pleiadians.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.550 align:middle line:10%
Is there a dimensional
realm which in this energy

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:10.590 align:middle line:10%
I'm speaking with resides in.

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>> 11th and moving into 12th.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.816 align:middle line:90%
>> 11th and moving to 12th.

00:11:13.816 --> 00:11:17.600 align:middle line:90%


00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:24.260 align:middle line:84%
During the ascension
of this collective,

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:30.500 align:middle line:84%
going back to a third to fourth
density or fourth to fifth

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.020 align:middle line:84%
dimension, as we
are sort of moving

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:36.350 align:middle line:84%
into that evolutionary
process, what

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:42.560 align:middle line:84%
were some of the similarities
in that evolution

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:48.980 align:middle line:84%
that you guys and girls and
beings went through that could

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:55.980 align:middle line:84%
we could maybe compare
or check notes?

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:58.130 align:middle line:84%
Where are we at
with our ascension

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:06.610 align:middle line:84%
compared to the ascension that
happened many, many eons ago

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:08.790 align:middle line:90%
for you guys?

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:11.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And to set the
clarity of this,

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:15.030 align:middle line:84%
we will speak in terms of time
as it's perceived by humans.

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:17.190 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, great.

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>> With our process, what we
began to see was as individuals

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:28.380 align:middle line:84%
would formulate a similar
intention for a similar type

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:31.680 align:middle line:84%
of experience-- as that is truly
all that is taking place with

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:37.020 align:middle line:84%
all beings, all beings are
emanations of divine presence

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:40.080 align:middle line:84%
who are choosing to have
various experiences from various

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.940 align:middle line:90%
perspectives.

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.850 align:middle line:84%
As beings within
our system began

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:50.470 align:middle line:84%
to align in their intention,
they began to form into groups.

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And within these groups,
there was an acceleration.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And we're beginning to see
that occurring on planet Earth

00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:58.840 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:04.420 align:middle line:84%
There has been, in the
past, tribal groups

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:08.360 align:middle line:84%
that did a lot of
this work together.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And over time many,
societies on your planet

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.400 align:middle line:90%
have lost the sense of grouping.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.460 align:middle line:84%
It has become much
more emphasized

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:22.240 align:middle line:90%
to live a singular life.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.720 align:middle line:84%
Many beings now are reawakening
their deep, deep desire

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.870 align:middle line:84%
to be in connection in this way
and experiencing the benefit

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:32.140 align:middle line:84%
of coming together in these
groups as the acceleration

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.202 align:middle line:90%
of their awakening.

00:13:34.202 --> 00:13:37.040 align:middle line:90%


00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.700 align:middle line:10%
Within the Arcturian
system, we experienced

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:44.420 align:middle line:10%
a great reprogramming.

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:50.960 align:middle line:10%
We did have minds
similar to humans.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.530 align:middle line:84%
What we did-- the
primary shift that we

00:13:54.530 --> 00:14:01.040 align:middle line:84%
make through our intention
was to shift into our hearts.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And, yes, Arcturians
as well as other beings

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.800 align:middle line:84%
who are coming into contact
with Earth do you have hearts.

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, the
existence of these hearts

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:15.710 align:middle line:84%
is primarily what is
bringing us into contact.

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:20.240 align:middle line:84%
There is a stream of
energy that is creating

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:25.160 align:middle line:84%
an energetic constellation
in which all of these beings

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.370 align:middle line:90%
are evolving together.

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:31.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Would this be--

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:35.060 align:middle line:84%
so as you mentioned you are
going from 11th to 12th,

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.490 align:middle line:90%
is this across our universe?

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:42.060 align:middle line:84%
That all beings are sort
of evolving at this state.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.090 align:middle line:84%
I've heard from other
beings too that they're

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:48.020 align:middle line:84%
going from fifth to sixth
or sixth to seventh.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:51.490 align:middle line:84%
There seems to be a theme
with many of these interviews

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:56.840 align:middle line:84%
that I'm doing that they
reside in a specific dimension

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.800 align:middle line:90%
or density.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.040 align:middle line:84%
But they're in
transit as we are.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:05.240 align:middle line:84%
Is this a time of transit for
all beings in this galaxy?

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>> It is constant.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And with the dimensions, the
dimensions are also expanding.

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:16.430 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, as we
articulated before,

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:17.870 align:middle line:90%
there is no destination.

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.400 align:middle line:90%


00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.010 align:middle line:84%
Something we would also like
to emphasize at this time

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:25.890 align:middle line:84%
as many humans are
awakening to our presence

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:28.110 align:middle line:84%
and awakening to
multidimensional versions

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:32.380 align:middle line:84%
of themselves is that
within this hierarchy,

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:34.290 align:middle line:90%
this is a construct of the mind.

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:36.570 align:middle line:84%
This is a construct
which is fueled

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:43.530 align:middle line:84%
by the energy of better, worse,
good, bad, wanting to be,

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:48.990 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, somewhere that
is not resided in yet.

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And we really
encourage the humans

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:55.770 align:middle line:84%
who are framing
dimensionality in this way

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:59.460 align:middle line:90%
to really let go of this.

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:04.180 align:middle line:84%
We are residing from
another perspective.

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:06.390 align:middle line:84%
We are seeing things
in a different way

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:10.290 align:middle line:84%
than many of the beings
currently on this planet.

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And there is no sense from our
perspective of our perspective

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:24.380 align:middle line:90%
being superior in any way.

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.750 align:middle line:84%
As we interact with
humans, we also

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.390 align:middle line:90%
evolve through our service.

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And we very much respect and
admire the human experience.

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:37.355 align:middle line:84%
We revere you just
as you revere us.

00:16:37.355 --> 00:16:40.418 align:middle line:90%


00:16:40.418 --> 00:16:47.330 align:middle line:84%
>> A little bit left field,
but do Arcturians have as many

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:50.713 align:middle line:84%
silly moments that we
do in our Earth realm?

00:16:50.713 --> 00:16:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Because there are some
really ridiculous things that

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:56.290 align:middle line:84%
happen, at least
from my perspective,

00:16:56.290 --> 00:17:00.380 align:middle line:84%
in our day-to-day lives know
from interacting with animals

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:04.773 align:middle line:90%
to each other to silly jokes.

00:17:04.773 --> 00:17:05.690 align:middle line:90%
Those kinds of things.

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:09.510 align:middle line:84%
Does that happened in the
Arcturians' perspective?

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:11.390 align:middle line:84%
Probably in a different
way, but do you guys

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:14.540 align:middle line:90%
have as much comedy as we have?

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:19.640 align:middle line:84%
We experience it
in a different way.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:23.420 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, the outward
expression of it is different.

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.839 align:middle line:84%
However, we associate
humor with the heart

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:31.525 align:middle line:84%
as well, with the
ultimate state of joy.

00:17:31.525 --> 00:17:33.790 align:middle line:90%
>> So Arcturians laugh?

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:34.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:38.250 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, good-- just double
checking, making sure.

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:41.010 align:middle line:90%


00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:48.570 align:middle line:84%
Physically, I've seen pictures
of beings, Arcturian beings,

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:54.360 align:middle line:84%
sort of looking similar to what
we would call the Zeta Reticuli

00:17:54.360 --> 00:18:00.230 align:middle line:84%
Grey Beings but with a
bluish sort of color skin.

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:03.480 align:middle line:84%
Is this an accurate
representation?

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Your question really speaks
to how we appear to humans.

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Correct, yes-- in, I
guess, a lower density form

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.560 align:middle line:84%
because in the collective
form, obviously,

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:16.170 align:middle line:90%
you don't have physical forms.

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:19.050 align:middle line:84%
But let's say as you were
going through your ascension

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:25.110 align:middle line:84%
process in the fifth dimension
and fourth dimensional arenas,

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:34.000 align:middle line:84%
what was sort of the physical
perception or presence?

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Many do experience
us as blue.

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:42.610 align:middle line:84%
We sometimes experience
each other as blue because

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:46.470 align:middle line:84%
of the light frequency emitting
from our energetic bodies.

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:52.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And the Sirian energies
often are correlated with blue,

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:55.660 align:middle line:90%
maybe a darker blue.

00:18:55.660 --> 00:19:00.100 align:middle line:84%
Could you tell us the
differences and similarities

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:04.990 align:middle line:84%
of the Sirius energies and
the Arcturian energies.

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Sirius is much more varied
than the energy that many may

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:11.900 align:middle line:90%
experience from Arcturus.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:16.210 align:middle line:84%
Arcturus has experienced a
great sense of unification.

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:19.720 align:middle line:84%
Whereby, there may
be varied experience

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:23.320 align:middle line:84%
from the 5th dimensional
Arcturians to, for example,

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.240 align:middle line:90%
the 11th dimensional Ontarians.

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.620 align:middle line:90%
We tend to appear--

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:35.680 align:middle line:84%
our energy tends to manifest
for humans as silvery blue.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:39.190 align:middle line:84%
We also appear often
taller in the way

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:44.230 align:middle line:84%
that humans view us than
5th dimensional sectarians.

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And with Sirians, there
is much more variation.

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:55.150 align:middle line:84%
So the light, the blue
light of the Sirians

00:19:55.150 --> 00:20:03.390 align:middle line:84%
is one particular type of Sirian
energy and there are various.

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:06.540 align:middle line:84%
Other frequencies that
are sometimes experienced

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:10.610 align:middle line:90%
are red through Sirius as well.

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>> In Arcturus from other
studies and other beings that

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:20.190 align:middle line:84%
I've interacted with, they
sort of refer to Arcturians

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:27.616 align:middle line:84%
as the spiritual masters of
our universe, of a higher--

00:20:27.616 --> 00:20:30.878 align:middle line:90%


00:20:30.878 --> 00:20:33.240 align:middle line:84%
higher on the
evolutionary scale,

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:37.800 align:middle line:84%
especially, in the
realms of spirituality.

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:39.780 align:middle line:84%
Does this mean
just-- does this just

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:49.590 align:middle line:84%
mean that there are more higher
dimensionally evolved beings

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:51.930 align:middle line:84%
in Arcturus
collectively compared

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:55.300 align:middle line:90%
to other regions of the galaxy?

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:59.670 align:middle line:84%
So there's maybe fewer fifth
dimensional or lower densities

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:00.670 align:middle line:90%
in Arcturus.

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Is it all sort of up in
these higher dimensions?

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:07.860 align:middle line:84%
Is that an accurate way to
sort compare this high level

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:08.760 align:middle line:90%
of spirituality?

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Often, this is referred
to because within Arcturus we

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:17.000 align:middle line:84%
place of great importance
through our collective

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.160 align:middle line:84%
intention and
disposition on awakening.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.560 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, we have a
very strong lineage.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.960 align:middle line:84%
The way that you experience,
perhaps, a Buddhist

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:30.020 align:middle line:84%
lineage of teachers
or a Christian lineage

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.180 align:middle line:90%
of teachers with disciples.

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:35.510 align:middle line:84%
This sort of system is
very strong in Arcturus.

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:40.610 align:middle line:84%
So what often occurs is
beings from various places

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:47.900 align:middle line:84%
will come to Arcturus
and involve themself

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:51.050 align:middle line:84%
in the Arcturian system
or the Arcturian lineage

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:56.030 align:middle line:84%
in order to experience
higher dimensions.

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:59.990 align:middle line:84%
The space in which we reside
in the 11th dimension--

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:03.260 align:middle line:84%
as we move into the 12th, we
experience much interaction

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:07.460 align:middle line:84%
with many of those who you
may refer to as masters.

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:10.850 align:middle line:84%
Many of the beings who
have incarnated on Earth,

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:17.990 align:middle line:90%
such as Jesus, are beings who--

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:21.750 align:middle line:84%
it is often referred to
by humans as that they

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:24.546 align:middle line:90%
have ascended from Earth.

00:22:24.546 --> 00:22:26.370 align:middle line:84%
However, from
another perspective

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:30.720 align:middle line:84%
they have come from this
space and visited Earth

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.610 align:middle line:90%
during very critical times.

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:39.060 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, we do experience much
interaction with these beings

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:42.330 align:middle line:90%
in partnership with us.

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:45.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Wouldn't you, for
example, want to mentioned

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:50.670 align:middle line:84%
the relationship with
the angelic realms.

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:55.290 align:middle line:84%
So I assume there
is a strong tie

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:56.820 align:middle line:90%
with Arcturus and the angelics?

00:22:56.820 --> 00:23:00.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, very strong--

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:02.400 align:middle line:84%
in fact, many
humans who interact

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:09.210 align:middle line:84%
with us may at times be unsure
of whether they're interacting

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:11.640 align:middle line:84%
with an angelic
presence or an Arcturian

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:18.780 align:middle line:84%
because the lines between
these distinctions become

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.280 align:middle line:90%
blurred in this space.

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.640 align:middle line:84%
However, there is a
distinction between us

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:27.240 align:middle line:84%
and the angelic
presences for we have

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:30.480 align:middle line:90%
experience being incarnate.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:35.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Where angelics sort of never
went through that evolutionary

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:40.920 align:middle line:90%
phase, a different sort of path.

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:45.747 align:middle line:84%
Do angels-- do they
evolve or they just are?

00:23:45.747 --> 00:23:46.830 align:middle line:90%
I've always wondered that.

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Do they have sort of
an evolutionary stage

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.720 align:middle line:84%
that they go through
or are they just--

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:52.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:52.850 align:middle line:90%
>> They do?

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:54.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:58.290 align:middle line:84%
>> It is quite different
from what humans refer

00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:00.390 align:middle line:90%
to as evolution.

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:05.220 align:middle line:84%
It is more like
what we experienced

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:13.110 align:middle line:84%
as well in which it's about our
vibration and the way in which

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:16.920 align:middle line:84%
we perceive and interact
with our surroundings.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.990 align:middle line:84%
The difference
between these states

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:21.320 align:middle line:90%
becomes much more subtle.

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.120 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:23.400 align:middle line:90%


00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Going back to what you
just mentioned, Arcturus--

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:30.900 align:middle line:84%
would it be sort of like
humans going to Tibet to study

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:40.830 align:middle line:84%
or Nepal or some sacred,
you know, retreats,

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:43.590 align:middle line:84%
to have a retreat in
the mountains to study,

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:47.790 align:middle line:84%
since we're limited to our
mountainous terrains in this

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:52.560 align:middle line:84%
Earth, on other
parts of the galaxy,

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:55.320 align:middle line:84%
where they just sort
of-- or other planets,

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:58.300 align:middle line:84%
beings of this that can sort
of traverse the galaxy pretty

00:24:58.300 --> 00:24:59.100 align:middle line:90%
easily?

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.980 align:middle line:84%
Would they just check
in and say, hey, Mom,

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:03.828 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go do a
pilgrimage in Arcturus.

00:25:03.828 --> 00:25:04.995 align:middle line:90%
I'll see you in a few years.

00:25:04.995 --> 00:25:07.080 align:middle line:90%
Has that happened in that sense?

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.840 align:middle line:90%


00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:16.310 align:middle line:84%
>> What occurs is that
beings, in a sense,

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:18.700 align:middle line:90%
take form as an Arcturian.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:19.910 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:23.930 align:middle line:84%
Oh, OK, so they actually
incarnate as an Arcturian,

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:31.580 align:middle line:84%
and then go back to wherever
they came from after that life.

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:33.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Many remain Arcturian.

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:36.766 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, interesting,
because it feels good.

00:25:36.766 --> 00:25:40.340 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:43.670 align:middle line:84%
Have I had this pilgrimage
in an Arcturian--

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:44.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, interesting.

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:50.060 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to ask about
some of the things

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:54.110 align:middle line:84%
I've heard about the
technology through Arcturus

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:56.450 align:middle line:84%
and that seems to
be sort of used

00:25:56.450 --> 00:26:00.120 align:middle line:84%
throughout the galaxy, something
I've read before called

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:03.140 align:middle line:90%
the Arcturian Stargate.

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:06.710 align:middle line:84%
Could you go into detail
about what this is

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:09.290 align:middle line:84%
and how it might be used
here and in other parts

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:12.500 align:middle line:90%
of our galaxy?

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:19.660 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the space, which is
held with very strong energy

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:25.250 align:middle line:84%
through our masters,
as you may call them.

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:26.110 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:28.450 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a space
which is held.

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:37.540 align:middle line:10%
We hold it in much reverence
as a space in which we

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:41.620 align:middle line:10%
choose to come to planet Earth.

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:45.790 align:middle line:10%
When an Arcturian chooses
to come to planet Earth

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:54.320 align:middle line:10%
to take human form, they will
spend time, as you may call it,

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:59.510 align:middle line:10%
in this space, becoming
clear on some level

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:03.830 align:middle line:10%
of their consciousness, what
they will be doing on Earth.

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is not only
for Arcturian beings.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.400 align:middle line:90%


00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:13.940 align:middle line:84%
However, it originally
was within our system,

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:20.410 align:middle line:84%
and we have curated it,
and it has changed hands,

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:21.520 align:middle line:90%
in some sense.

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:22.320 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And through this, we
have opened this space to be

00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:34.110 align:middle line:84%
of assistance to many beings,
who are coming to the planet.

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:36.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>> You sort of answered
my next question,

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:40.745 align:middle line:84%
but I'd like to go into
a little more detail.

00:27:40.745 --> 00:27:45.490 align:middle line:84%
You said it's not just
for Arcturian energies,

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:49.220 align:middle line:84%
I guess souls that sort of
originate from that Arcturus

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:50.020 align:middle line:90%
lineage.

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:52.990 align:middle line:90%


00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:58.870 align:middle line:84%
Is it-- essentially, is it the
technology used for souls to be

00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:04.090 align:middle line:84%
born on this planet, to come
into existence on this planet

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:11.110 align:middle line:84%
by all beings, or are there
other technologies involved?

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:13.190 align:middle line:90%
Or is it just like Arcturus--

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:middle line:84%
Arcturian energies
are-- is that it?

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:23.980 align:middle line:84%
That's the key mechanism for our
incarnation into this reality?

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>> There are various experiences
that beings will go through

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.500 align:middle line:90%
in coming to the planet.

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:34.920 align:middle line:90%
This is not the only way.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>> This is not the only
passageway onto the planet.

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:43.060 align:middle line:84%
However, many of the
beings who are involved

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:48.400 align:middle line:84%
in the collective galactic
activity on planet Earth

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:51.790 align:middle line:84%
will come through this
gateway for preparation.

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:52.720 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:57.520 align:middle line:10%
Dolores Cannon wrote a
lot about different waves

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:01.540 align:middle line:10%
of beings coming in
at this time to assist

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:06.940 align:middle line:10%
in the ascension of planet
Earth into this higher

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:12.060 align:middle line:10%
dimension, higher
density, higher frequency.

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:15.550 align:middle line:84%
She-- she mentioned these
different waves of beings

00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:18.430 align:middle line:84%
in sort of a distress call
went out into the galaxy,

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:21.830 align:middle line:84%
and all of these beings kind
of came in and said, hey,

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:23.800 align:middle line:90%
we're going to--

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.380 align:middle line:84%
select souls are
going to incarnate

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:29.830 align:middle line:84%
at this time to help and
assist with this ascension.

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:33.730 align:middle line:84%
Is this primarily what this
Arcturian Stargate is used for,

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:35.350 align:middle line:90%
these souls that are coming in--

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:37.958 align:middle line:84%
>> --to help with the ascension
of the planet at this time?

00:29:37.958 --> 00:29:38.825 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:38.825 --> 00:29:39.700 align:middle line:90%
OK, that makes sense.

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:47.120 align:middle line:84%
So not all souls would
be using this technology.

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.920 align:middle line:84%
This is specifically for
raising the vibration, for souls

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:52.440 align:middle line:84%
that are sort of here to raise
the vibration of the planet.

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.330 align:middle line:90%
>> That's correct.

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:56.000 align:middle line:90%


00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:02.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And again, I'm trying to put
terminologies in and put things

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:05.480 align:middle line:84%
probably in a linear sense,
even though they're not really

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.640 align:middle line:84%
in a linear sense,
because nothing is linear,

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:11.190 align:middle line:84%
but just formulating
concepts and ideas.

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:14.450 align:middle line:84%
So pardon me if I'm
going a place that

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:15.500 align:middle line:90%
may seem a little linear.

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:19.230 align:middle line:90%


00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:23.420 align:middle line:84%
The concept and
the idea of we've

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:26.520 align:middle line:84%
had multiple lives
on this planet--

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:30.300 align:middle line:84%
sometimes people say, well,
you know, I'm from Arcturus,

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:34.218 align:middle line:84%
or I've had this soul
incarnation on Arcturus.

00:30:34.218 --> 00:30:35.885 align:middle line:84%
In my last life, I
was from an Arcturus.

00:30:35.885 --> 00:30:39.080 align:middle line:90%


00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:43.250 align:middle line:84%
How does that work when,
also, in my last life,

00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:45.440 align:middle line:84%
I've been incarnated
here on Earth,

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:49.100 align:middle line:84%
or I've had thousands of
incarnations on this Earth,

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:56.540 align:middle line:84%
but yet I'm still part of
this new wave of energy

00:30:56.540 --> 00:31:00.980 align:middle line:84%
coming through to assist
in the ascension of Earth.

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:04.730 align:middle line:84%
Can you help define
and maybe explain this?

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:05.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:06.350 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Often, from the
human perspective,

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:15.340 align:middle line:84%
there is the sense of soul, that
there is the level on which you

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:17.800 align:middle line:84%
are incarnated as a human
being, and then there is a level

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.570 align:middle line:90%
of soul, and then there is God.

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:21.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>> This is, in a
sense, one perspective.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.210 align:middle line:84%
We offer another
perspective in which

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:33.880 align:middle line:84%
there are various levels of
self so that the soul becomes

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.350 align:middle line:84%
a concept that is much
more intricate than what--

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:39.550 align:middle line:84%
how it is currently framed
on Earth through many

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:43.000 align:middle line:84%
of the religious
traditions in existence.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.660 align:middle line:84%
This will likely begin
to shift as humans

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:52.480 align:middle line:84%
come into the experience
of their galactic nature

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:55.090 align:middle line:84%
and experience that,
while they may have

00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:59.680 align:middle line:84%
various lifetimes
on Earth incarnated

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:02.410 align:middle line:84%
that there is a level,
a stream of energy,

00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:05.440 align:middle line:84%
a stream of identification,
a stream of self,

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:10.900 align:middle line:84%
which runs through these
Earth incarnations,

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:16.840 align:middle line:84%
and that this, actually,
is one level of self.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:20.380 align:middle line:84%
On the galactic level,
there may be the experience

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:22.900 align:middle line:90%
of another level of self--

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:26.440 align:middle line:84%
for example, where time
spent as an Arcturian

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.540 align:middle line:84%
is viewed as one
galactic lifetime.

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:29.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:31.990 align:middle line:84%
>> There could be another
lifetime as a Pleiadians,

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:33.370 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:34.510 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:38.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Therefore, the galactic
lifetimes are experienced

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:41.660 align:middle line:84%
on another level of self,
and this is what we're moving

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:42.460 align:middle line:90%
into now.

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:46.450 align:middle line:84%
Many of those who have
strong galactic ties

00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:51.250 align:middle line:84%
will begin to experience
their earthly incarnations

00:32:51.250 --> 00:33:00.460 align:middle line:84%
as one level on which many
are coming to completion.

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:03.070 align:middle line:84%
Many of the beings
on Earth at this time

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:07.060 align:middle line:84%
are coming to completion
of their earthly karma,

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:10.510 align:middle line:84%
and through this completion
is often the awakening

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:12.420 align:middle line:90%
into the galactic self--

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>> --and the experience of
this other level of self.

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:17.200 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Often, this is
referred now as soul.

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:25.870 align:middle line:84%
However, as we
mentioned earlier,

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:27.610 align:middle line:84%
there are various
levels of soul,

00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:31.420 align:middle line:84%
and this will continue
to be experienced

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:40.100 align:middle line:84%
as a never-ending opening to
definitions and perspectives

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:44.025 align:middle line:84%
of self that are more inclusive,
as the ultimate inclusion is

00:33:44.025 --> 00:33:44.825 align:middle line:90%
that of oneness.

00:33:44.825 --> 00:33:48.590 align:middle line:90%


00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>> In past interviews, the
term "oversoul" was often used,

00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:55.460 align:middle line:84%
and I think the way
you were describing it,

00:33:55.460 --> 00:34:01.130 align:middle line:84%
the way I could put it in my own
sort of mental terminology was

00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:06.290 align:middle line:84%
that the oversoul has many
fractalized versions of itself.

00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:09.980 align:middle line:84%
One version is on Earth,
going through that whole Earth

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:11.370 align:middle line:90%
ascension process.

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:15.300 align:middle line:84%
Another version of it is on
Arcturus or the Pleiades star

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:16.100 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:16.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:19.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And then as
we've, like you said,

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:24.290 align:middle line:84%
sort of gone through
the human process,

00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:27.560 align:middle line:84%
we can now reconnect
to our oversoul,

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:30.620 align:middle line:84%
which then connects us to
all these other individual

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:35.449 align:middle line:84%
fractalized soul
consciousnesses,

00:34:35.449 --> 00:34:40.580 align:middle line:84%
hence the Arcturian experience,
and then having sort

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:46.280 align:middle line:84%
of bleed-throughs of these
other experiences in remembering

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.730 align:middle line:90%
where we come from, in essence.

00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:48.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>> In essence, we've
always come from Earth.

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:53.420 align:middle line:84%
This fractalized version of us
has always been here on Earth,

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:56.540 align:middle line:90%
but this oversoul may reside--

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:59.080 align:middle line:84%
may have more fractalized
versions of itself

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:01.010 align:middle line:90%
in Arcturus or Pleiades.

00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:03.980 align:middle line:84%
That way, for that
reason, we sort of lean

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:09.340 align:middle line:84%
towards one galactic
system more.

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.130 align:middle line:90%
Does that sort of--

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:12.750 align:middle line:90%
is that terminology OK--

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:13.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:14.350 align:middle line:90%
>> --use in that sense?

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:15.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>> It is similar.

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:20.050 align:middle line:84%
It is referring to the
same phenomenon, yes.

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:25.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Would there be other
oversouls that actually have

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:30.490 align:middle line:84%
more Earth-- fractalized Earth
souls in it so that, therefore,

00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:36.640 align:middle line:84%
that oversoul tends to be more
human in nature than Arcturian?

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Or is it sort of
all evenly balanced

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:40.340 align:middle line:90%
between all the oversouls?

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:41.140 align:middle line:90%
How does--

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, m individuals, as we
may call them, on some level,

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:51.910 align:middle line:84%
have more experience
in various places.

00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:58.030 align:middle line:84%
Some humans will feel resonance
with various galactic systems.

00:35:58.030 --> 00:36:00.260 align:middle line:84%
Some will feel
resonance with none.

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:03.190 align:middle line:84%
In this case, it may
be that there is not

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:07.000 align:middle line:84%
much experience in other
systems, at least known systems

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.830 align:middle line:84%
that are interacting
and awakening

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:12.290 align:middle line:90%
these energies on the planet.

00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:18.640 align:middle line:90%
And it also may be that it is--

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:21.910 align:middle line:84%
if they are not
experiencing much resonance

00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:29.880 align:middle line:84%
with galactic systems, it
is that they either have not

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:32.700 align:middle line:84%
connected with these systems
in their own experience,

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:35.490 align:middle line:84%
or that it is not
in service to them

00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:37.590 align:middle line:84%
during this lifetime
at this time

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:39.970 align:middle line:90%
to awaken into that memory.

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:45.240 align:middle line:84%
So we used to-- not so
much anymore, because we--

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.860 align:middle line:84%
I think we're
becoming more familiar

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:49.230 align:middle line:84%
with the terminologies--
but we used to say,

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:50.880 align:middle line:90%
you're an old soul.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:54.570 align:middle line:84%
That sort of idea we have
to throw out the window,

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:58.170 align:middle line:84%
because everybody's sort of an
old soul in some galactic way,

00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:01.420 align:middle line:84%
whether it's here on Earth or
some other formation, right?

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:02.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:06.110 align:middle line:84%
This is a phrase often used
by humans to indicate wisdom.

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:06.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:07.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>> But we're all wise, because
we've all had lives everywhere

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:11.950 align:middle line:90%
at some point.

00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:13.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:18.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And actually, the
experience of these lifetimes,

00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:22.470 align:middle line:84%
in the ultimate
sense, it is a choice.

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:28.410 align:middle line:90%
All perspectives are accessible.

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:33.960 align:middle line:84%
All beings are choosing to
have an individuated experience

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:38.910 align:middle line:84%
as God, God choosing
to experience itself

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:40.860 align:middle line:90%
from various perspectives.

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:44.490 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the more we awaken
out of our limitations,

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:50.250 align:middle line:84%
the more we have access to
experience any perspective.

00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And through the
realization of this,

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:59.430 align:middle line:84%
there is much of the hierarchy
and sense of some perspectives

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:03.300 align:middle line:84%
being better than
others falls away.

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:06.960 align:middle line:84%
>> We're all-- we're all doing
the same things, I guess,

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:09.750 align:middle line:90%
in different ways.

00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:12.180 align:middle line:84%
Getting back to the
technology side of things--

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:13.120 align:middle line:90%
I love technology.

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:15.880 align:middle line:84%
It's my-- as you can see,
with my cameras and things,

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:18.300 align:middle line:84%
it's one of my favorite
things to talk about.

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:21.780 align:middle line:84%
So artificial
intelligence, which

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:25.883 align:middle line:84%
is sort of a bigger topic,
a big topic that humanity

00:38:25.883 --> 00:38:27.300 align:middle line:84%
is facing right
now, because we're

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:31.710 align:middle line:84%
on that verge of creating some
really interesting technologies

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:37.470 align:middle line:84%
and having our, at least
from the perspective

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:41.565 align:middle line:84%
of the human race, some very
sentient sort of machines.

00:38:41.565 --> 00:38:44.850 align:middle line:90%


00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:47.250 align:middle line:84%
From the Arcturian
perspective, I'd

00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:50.760 align:middle line:84%
like to hear your
thoughts about technology

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:56.220 align:middle line:84%
and also Arcturian artificial
intelligence and how--

00:38:56.220 --> 00:39:00.636 align:middle line:90%
what is that, and how does it--

00:39:00.636 --> 00:39:06.370 align:middle line:84%
does it have any correlation
with the human experience?

00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:12.600 align:middle line:84%
This term, "artificial,"
is actually

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:17.400 align:middle line:84%
a term that, in some
sense, is inaccurate.

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:22.440 align:middle line:84%
We would pose the
question to one curious

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:25.590 align:middle line:84%
about artificial technology,
what does "artificial"

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:28.540 align:middle line:90%
mean when they refer to it?

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for
bringing that up.

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:35.310 align:middle line:84%
So my understanding now
of artificial intelligence

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:40.800 align:middle line:90%
is everything consciousness is--

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.300 align:middle line:90%
everything is conscious.

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:46.380 align:middle line:84%
So in reality, we don't really
have artificial intelligence.

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:49.860 align:middle line:84%
Everything is consciousness,
and everything is sort of alive

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:51.760 align:middle line:90%
and has beingness.

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:55.690 align:middle line:84%
But from a typical
human perspective,

00:39:55.690 --> 00:40:00.970 align:middle line:84%
because I don't consider
myself that typical anymore,

00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:06.300 align:middle line:84%
what we perceive artificial
intelligence as is machines

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:11.730 align:middle line:84%
that humans created, as
opposed to biological organisms

00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:14.100 align:middle line:84%
that sort of our
birthed into this world

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:17.580 align:middle line:84%
through the typical birthing
processes of male and female

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:25.500 align:middle line:84%
and liquids merging and forming,
and then an incubation period,

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:27.420 align:middle line:90%
and voila, you have life.

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's sort of
the way it's gone

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:33.150 align:middle line:84%
on on this planet
for a long time.

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:36.780 align:middle line:84%
And some would argue
if animals or plants

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:40.740 align:middle line:84%
are sentient, that's a whole
other discussion in my mind.

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:42.390 align:middle line:90%
It's all intelligent.

00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:48.250 align:middle line:90%
It's all consciousness.

00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:52.800 align:middle line:84%
But I guess the typical term,
artificial intelligence,

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:56.670 align:middle line:84%
would, going back to our
normal human standards,

00:40:56.670 --> 00:41:04.740 align:middle line:84%
would be machines that
have the computing capacity

00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:10.500 align:middle line:84%
to think, and then
form emotions, and be

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:12.450 align:middle line:84%
sort of sentient
from our perspective,

00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:15.330 align:middle line:90%
from the human perspective.

00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Does that sort of thing exist
in the Arcturian existence?

00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:30.300 align:middle line:84%
And if so, I guess it has been
affecting some people here

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:33.990 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, because I've heard
the term, Arcturian AI,

00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:35.310 align:middle line:90%
thrown around a few times.

00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And I just sort of wanted
to connect in with that

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:41.940 align:middle line:84%
and see if there's
some messages for those

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:44.100 align:middle line:84%
who have had those
interactions, and then

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:48.210 align:middle line:84%
just get more of a
clarification of what is that.

00:41:48.210 --> 00:41:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>> The main thing to bring
forward in service to humans

00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:55.380 align:middle line:84%
around this at this time is
that many of you have a deep

00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:59.040 align:middle line:90%
discomfort with this concept.

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And we propose that
this discomfort

00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:09.060 align:middle line:84%
is addressed, that there may
be a greater sense of openness,

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:13.470 align:middle line:84%
peace, and harmony within
humans towards this,

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:15.960 align:middle line:84%
as we see your
society also moving

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:19.980 align:middle line:84%
in the direction of
creating such technology.

00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:28.290 align:middle line:84%
This is an opportunity for
humans to trust themselves,

00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:30.960 align:middle line:84%
to align within themselves
with their intentions

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:33.930 align:middle line:84%
in the creation of
such technology.

00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:37.110 align:middle line:84%
Within the Arcturian
system, we have

00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:39.810 align:middle line:84%
created some such
technology, and it

00:42:39.810 --> 00:42:43.530 align:middle line:84%
has been with the
alignment and intention

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:46.560 align:middle line:84%
with the highest
good of all beings.

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, it is important to
address this intentionality

00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:54.490 align:middle line:84%
with the creation
of this technology

00:42:54.490 --> 00:42:56.880 align:middle line:90%
at this time on your planet.

00:42:56.880 --> 00:43:01.380 align:middle line:84%
We hope that we can serve
as an example in this way,

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:07.230 align:middle line:84%
and the primary quality that
we would like to bring forward

00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:11.580 align:middle line:90%
in this vein is alignment.

00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:14.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's sort of
been coined and termed

00:43:14.490 --> 00:43:18.360 align:middle line:84%
in our terminology as
a double-edged sword,

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:22.380 align:middle line:84%
something that could
create and cause much harm,

00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:27.430 align:middle line:84%
but also create a lot of
benefit and amazing things.

00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:28.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:31.770 align:middle line:84%
As you've seen on your planet,
the technological advances

00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:37.230 align:middle line:84%
have been extremely
beneficial, and there

00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:40.620 align:middle line:84%
have been other
uses of technology,

00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:44.190 align:middle line:84%
such as nuclear weaponry,
which are created

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:48.240 align:middle line:84%
with an intention
that is not aligned

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:49.590 align:middle line:90%
with the energy of the heart.

00:43:49.590 --> 00:43:52.610 align:middle line:90%


00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So as long as we
infuse good intentions,

00:43:56.240 --> 00:44:01.340 align:middle line:84%
as we're creating these objects,
then they'll be sort of there,

00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:05.060 align:middle line:84%
holding that frequency, and
doing good things for us?

00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:09.290 align:middle line:84%
>> What you will see is
with this intention--

00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:12.020 align:middle line:84%
we speak from
experience in sharing

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:15.500 align:middle line:84%
that with this intention,
the creation of technology

00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:23.330 align:middle line:84%
is divinely inspired,
and it assists in beings

00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:30.440 align:middle line:84%
to truly allocate their
time and energy in new ways.

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:33.050 align:middle line:84%
You can see with various
forms of technology

00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:39.020 align:middle line:84%
that it is replacing the
occupations of many humans

00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:44.150 align:middle line:84%
at this time to
allow for new spaces

00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:49.010 align:middle line:84%
for the human experience
and the human engagement,

00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:52.850 align:middle line:84%
where much of the energy that
has been expended by humans

00:44:52.850 --> 00:44:58.160 align:middle line:84%
in the past is now taken care
of through this technology.

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:01.557 align:middle line:90%


00:45:01.557 --> 00:45:02.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Huh, interesting.

00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:03.470 align:middle line:90%
I just got this.

00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:10.380 align:middle line:84%
Is it because of this
fear of the technology?

00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:13.580 align:middle line:84%
Is it because of
Earth's past experiences

00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:18.110 align:middle line:84%
with destroying itself,
hurting itself, doing not so

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:22.310 align:middle line:84%
good things to itself
with these technologies?

00:45:22.310 --> 00:45:24.095 align:middle line:90%
>> Much of this fear does--

00:45:24.095 --> 00:45:27.530 align:middle line:90%


00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:31.130 align:middle line:84%
has been present in
the past, particularly

00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:33.060 align:middle line:90%
in the experience of Atlantis.

00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:33.860 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:38.510 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's what I
feel, I just got now.

00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:40.340 align:middle line:84%
So I'm assuming in
that time period,

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:45.330 align:middle line:84%
we did have artificial
intelligence of some sorts?

00:45:45.330 --> 00:45:47.760 align:middle line:84%
>> What you refer to as
artificial intelligence,

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:52.130 align:middle line:84%
there was a movement in this
direction in Atlantis, yes.

00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And this led to, in a sense,
the destruction of the Atlantean

00:45:58.880 --> 00:45:59.750 align:middle line:90%
society.

00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:05.360 align:middle line:84%
Many of those who
experienced this discomfort

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:09.350 align:middle line:84%
will find it a blessing to have
this resurface at this time,

00:46:09.350 --> 00:46:11.630 align:middle line:84%
because there will be a
great amount of freedom

00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:17.630 align:middle line:84%
in releasing the disturbance
of that memory, yes.

00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:19.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Sort of going--

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:21.420 align:middle line:84%
backstepping just
a little bit, it

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:23.570 align:middle line:84%
said that humanity
has sort of gone

00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:29.180 align:middle line:84%
through this up and down phase
of creating itself, destroying

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:33.140 align:middle line:84%
itself, creating itself,
destroying itself at least

00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:35.150 align:middle line:90%
five times.

00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:39.740 align:middle line:84%
Could you go into
more detail of this,

00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:43.820 align:middle line:84%
and has it been humans on this
planet doing that sort of thing

00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:45.620 align:middle line:84%
over and over again,
or is it some--

00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:49.370 align:middle line:84%
are we just kind of
misinterpreting things because

00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:52.250 align:middle line:84%
of the number of different
souls and oversouls

00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:55.070 align:middle line:84%
and galactic families
that we have?

00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:57.350 align:middle line:84%
From your perspective,
how has humanity

00:46:57.350 --> 00:47:02.060 align:middle line:84%
evolved over the probably
millions of years

00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:04.010 align:middle line:90%
that it's been around?

00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:06.410 align:middle line:84%
>> When you refer to the
cycle of destruction,

00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:08.570 align:middle line:84%
what events are
you referring to?

00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:10.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Particularly Atlantis.

00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:19.340 align:middle line:84%
Some people term Lemuria as also
a time sort of wave or cycle,

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:22.320 align:middle line:90%
where humanity or Lemuria--

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:24.320 align:middle line:84%
humanity was known as
Lemuria at the time, where

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:29.060 align:middle line:84%
it also destroyed
itself, and just left

00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:35.630 align:middle line:84%
pockets of beings that were
then going through this start

00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:38.600 align:middle line:84%
and stop evolutionary
process again.

00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>> This was a time when there
was interaction of various

00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:44.720 align:middle line:84%
beings coming into the planet
in which there was some sense

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:46.070 align:middle line:90%
of discord.

00:47:46.070 --> 00:47:52.760 align:middle line:84%
This resulted in the shifting
with the Lemurian society,

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:55.460 align:middle line:84%
which was much more
graceful, as you might say,

00:47:55.460 --> 00:48:00.250 align:middle line:84%
than the Atlantean
society's shift.

00:48:00.250 --> 00:48:03.580 align:middle line:84%
This did result
from the interaction

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:07.210 align:middle line:84%
of various beings, some of
which came to the planet

00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:11.470 align:middle line:84%
with intentions, which were
not in alignment with those

00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:14.870 align:middle line:84%
who were residing in
Lemuria at the time.

00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So old Earth is sort of
known as Lemuria at one point?

00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:26.500 align:middle line:84%
>> The original humanoid
civilization on Earth was

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:27.670 align:middle line:90%
Lemuria, yes.

00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:29.020 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:32.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Often, this is
referred to in this--

00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:37.930 align:middle line:84%
similarly to Atlantis,
as a physical society.

00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:40.090 align:middle line:84%
From our perspective,
this society

00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:43.990 align:middle line:84%
was more like what many of
the extraterrestrial races

00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:46.900 align:middle line:84%
experience, which
is multi-dimensional

00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:52.750 align:middle line:84%
and in which there is
some sense of physicality,

00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:54.670 align:middle line:84%
but is very different
than what is currently

00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:56.650 align:middle line:90%
experienced on Earth.

00:48:56.650 --> 00:49:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>> And for whatever reason, that
evolutionary process, humanity,

00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Lemuria decided to take a
different path in its evolution

00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:12.820 align:middle line:84%
and sort of get cut off
from these multi-dimensional

00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:13.960 align:middle line:90%
awarenesses?

00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's sort of how we
ended up where we are now?

00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Many of these beings decided
to take part in the creation

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:22.300 align:middle line:90%
of Atlantis.

00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:25.150 align:middle line:84%
There was a great migration
through the country

00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:28.190 align:middle line:90%
that you now refer to as Brazil.

00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:33.310 align:middle line:84%
There was a great migration and
the depositing of many crystals

00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:37.570 align:middle line:84%
in this place, which
hold much information

00:49:37.570 --> 00:49:41.800 align:middle line:84%
and which many of you
may find yourselves

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:45.070 align:middle line:90%
coming into contact with again.

00:49:45.070 --> 00:49:48.190 align:middle line:84%
This migration
took place in order

00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:54.700 align:middle line:84%
for there to be a reinstatement
of those who were in alignment

00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:58.790 align:middle line:90%
with a similar intention.

00:49:58.790 --> 00:50:00.775 align:middle line:84%
And this took place
quite rapidly.

00:50:00.775 --> 00:50:03.910 align:middle line:90%


00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:07.390 align:middle line:84%
>> During the Atlantean
times, at the end of Atlantis?

00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:10.210 align:middle line:84%
>> This was the transition
from Lemuria to Atlantis.

00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:12.760 align:middle line:90%
>> To Atlantis, I see.

00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:17.560 align:middle line:84%
So the Lemurian
technologies utilized

00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:20.690 align:middle line:84%
a lot of crystal energies,
crystal technologies?

00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:23.170 align:middle line:10%
>> This was more emphasized
in Atlantis, but yes,

00:50:23.170 --> 00:50:29.100 align:middle line:10%
this was part of the Lemurian
culture, you might say.

00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:38.500 align:middle line:10%
Lemuria was, in a sense, more
focused on a tribal group

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:43.720 align:middle line:10%
gathering, and this is
actually reminiscent of many

00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:47.890 align:middle line:10%
of the other star systems,
which these beings came from.

00:50:47.890 --> 00:50:52.630 align:middle line:84%
Within the Arcturian
system, there

00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:59.260 align:middle line:84%
is an emphasis on coming into
groups and group consciousness.

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:01.480 align:middle line:84%
This was very present
in Lemuria and became

00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:03.180 align:middle line:90%
less present in Atlantis.

00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:05.080 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:06.790 align:middle line:84%
Did it become less
present in Atlantis

00:51:06.790 --> 00:51:10.060 align:middle line:84%
because of other energies
that were coming in

00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:14.590 align:middle line:84%
to merge with this
Lemurian energy?

00:51:14.590 --> 00:51:19.120 align:middle line:84%
Some say the Alpha
Draconian energies

00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:22.760 align:middle line:84%
were sort of what kind of came
in and destroyed Atlantis.

00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:23.560 align:middle line:90%
Is that--

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:25.864 align:middle line:84%
>> There was some
influence of this, yes.

00:51:25.864 --> 00:51:28.790 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:33.280 align:middle line:84%
>> However, we would like to
emphasize that within this

00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:37.090 align:middle line:84%
memory embedded in the
consciousness of many of those

00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:42.250 align:middle line:84%
who had this experience, there
has been a framing of it that

00:51:42.250 --> 00:51:48.520 align:middle line:84%
is very, what you might
refer to as, black and white.

00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:55.090 align:middle line:84%
We would like to emphasize
the benefit of remaining

00:51:55.090 --> 00:52:00.940 align:middle line:84%
open in how one relates to
the various beings involved,

00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:05.590 align:middle line:84%
as from a higher perspective
these are merely reflections.

00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:10.900 align:middle line:84%
It is important to resist
the human temptation

00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:19.180 align:middle line:84%
to frame the occurrences
that have taken

00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:23.230 align:middle line:90%
place in very simplistic terms.

00:52:23.230 --> 00:52:28.190 align:middle line:84%
>> The knee jerk reaction to put
blame on certain individuals,

00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:28.990 align:middle line:90%
so to say.

00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:29.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:32.170 align:middle line:84%
It is very important,
if one wants

00:52:32.170 --> 00:52:38.200 align:middle line:84%
to experience higher truth,
to truly look and recognize

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:41.750 align:middle line:84%
how one is relating
to these beings,

00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:46.800 align:middle line:84%
including the Draconians
and those beings that

00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:52.280 align:middle line:84%
often have some confusion in
terms of their intentions.

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:53.552 align:middle line:90%
>> It's still a two-way pump.

00:52:53.552 --> 00:52:55.260 align:middle line:84%
That's what I like to
call it, because we

00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:59.670 align:middle line:84%
have to agree to let them into
our existence on some higher

00:52:59.670 --> 00:53:03.840 align:middle line:90%
level, so it's all--

00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:08.511 align:middle line:84%
nothing can happen without
the invitation, so to say.

00:53:08.511 --> 00:53:09.453 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:09.453 --> 00:53:12.750 align:middle line:90%


00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:14.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Since we're now
on that subject,

00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:20.270 align:middle line:84%
so this also seems to be a
reoccurring theme in the series

00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:21.530 align:middle line:90%
with humans--

00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:25.970 align:middle line:84%
the humanity's ascension
into this fifth dimension.

00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:33.290 align:middle line:84%
The Alpha Draconian role of
this reptilian influence--

00:53:33.290 --> 00:53:35.570 align:middle line:84%
we sort of, now,
as we're beginning

00:53:35.570 --> 00:53:40.400 align:middle line:84%
to recognize this
archetype, we, as humans,

00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:45.740 align:middle line:84%
tend to blame this archetype
for all of our problems.

00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:47.390 align:middle line:90%
I've been sort of--

00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:51.330 align:middle line:84%
my own downloads,
my own experiences

00:53:51.330 --> 00:53:57.290 align:middle line:84%
have sort of told me that a
huge component of this ascension

00:53:57.290 --> 00:54:02.120 align:middle line:84%
has to do with a
reptilian archetype

00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:11.440 align:middle line:84%
and transforming this sort of
archetype into a new energy,

00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:14.530 align:middle line:84%
into it becoming something
different than what

00:54:14.530 --> 00:54:17.940 align:middle line:90%
it typically was.

00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:23.380 align:middle line:84%
Is this sort of Alpha
Draconian integration

00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:26.710 align:middle line:84%
with humanity part of
the grand experiment

00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:31.700 align:middle line:84%
of the human evolutionary
experiments of experiments?

00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:34.150 align:middle line:84%
>> This is very
important at this time.

00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:36.460 align:middle line:84%
We thank you for
asking this question.

00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:39.100 align:middle line:84%
What you may see
is many of those

00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:43.840 align:middle line:84%
who have experience
with the Reptilians,

00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:45.460 align:middle line:90%
as you may call them--

00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:47.710 align:middle line:84%
we'll refer to them
as Draconians--

00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:51.310 align:middle line:84%
there are beings
similar to these,

00:54:51.310 --> 00:54:53.950 align:middle line:84%
and, actually, these beings
who have resided in other star

00:54:53.950 --> 00:54:55.490 align:middle line:90%
systems as well.

00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:58.540 align:middle line:84%
So this is a simple
way to refer to them.

00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:01.330 align:middle line:84%
You may begin to
see individuals who

00:55:01.330 --> 00:55:04.480 align:middle line:84%
have experience with these
frequencies, who have resided

00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:09.410 align:middle line:84%
or are residing now, and where
there is a shift taking place.

00:55:09.410 --> 00:55:11.650 align:middle line:84%
It is important to
remember that as this

00:55:11.650 --> 00:55:15.170 align:middle line:84%
is a natural part of the
evolution taking place,

00:55:15.170 --> 00:55:18.730 align:middle line:84%
this is a natural part of all
of the energies coming to Earth,

00:55:18.730 --> 00:55:22.400 align:middle line:84%
coming together, and
relating to one another.

00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:28.360 align:middle line:84%
It is important to remember
that just as one addresses

00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:32.440 align:middle line:84%
their inner energies
from a place of love,

00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:35.470 align:middle line:84%
from a place of compassion,
from a place of acceptance,

00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:39.610 align:middle line:84%
that this is how we are relating
to these beings as well.

00:55:39.610 --> 00:55:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Often, there is a
tendency, at present,

00:55:44.650 --> 00:55:49.750 align:middle line:84%
with humanity to have
an emphasis on shifting,

00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:53.410 align:middle line:90%
have an emphasis on changing.

00:55:53.410 --> 00:55:57.340 align:middle line:84%
We hear humans often say,
I want to change the world.

00:55:57.340 --> 00:56:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And we understand and honor
the intention beneath this.

00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:07.180 align:middle line:84%
We also encourage those
who feel that they

00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:10.750 align:middle line:84%
have a strong sense
of a mission to change

00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:12.370 align:middle line:90%
the world in this way--

00:56:12.370 --> 00:56:17.200 align:middle line:84%
we encourage them to get
in touch with what energies

00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:21.520 align:middle line:84%
are at play inside of
themselves and to really

00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:24.520 align:middle line:84%
let go of anything that is not
coming from a place of love

00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:25.360 align:middle line:90%
and acceptance.

00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:30.280 align:middle line:84%
These beings are being shifted
through the energy of love

00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:31.960 align:middle line:84%
and through the
energy of acceptance.

00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:33.850 align:middle line:84%
This is the greatest
service that we

00:56:33.850 --> 00:56:37.540 align:middle line:84%
can provide to them and
to the parts of ourselves

00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:38.890 align:middle line:90%
that they are reflecting.

00:56:38.890 --> 00:56:43.240 align:middle line:84%
So instead of fighting
fire with fire, so to say,

00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:49.210 align:middle line:84%
we just send them back
when things happen

00:56:49.210 --> 00:56:52.020 align:middle line:90%
that sort of in a reptilian--

00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:56.230 align:middle line:84%
Alpha Draconian
circumstance, best thing

00:56:56.230 --> 00:57:00.910 align:middle line:84%
to do is just love them for who
they are and not get bent out

00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:02.020 align:middle line:90%
of shape?

00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:06.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and as there may be
some experiences of interaction,

00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:10.030 align:middle line:84%
we emphasize attending to any
fears and disturbances that

00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:16.180 align:middle line:84%
come through those experiences,
as this is the greatest form

00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:22.630 align:middle line:84%
of awakening to release any
disturbances that are present,

00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:30.350 align:middle line:84%
as well as to extend
love to these beings,

00:57:30.350 --> 00:57:34.580 align:middle line:84%
extend a sense of inclusion,
recognizing that there is

00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:46.100 align:middle line:84%
oneness, as well as clarifying
the intention and the energies

00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:49.610 align:middle line:84%
with which one would like
to align to facilitate

00:57:49.610 --> 00:57:51.890 align:middle line:84%
the experience that
they would like to have.

00:57:51.890 --> 00:57:54.830 align:middle line:84%
We do see that when
humans are aligning

00:57:54.830 --> 00:57:58.070 align:middle line:84%
with the energies, the
Draconian energies,

00:57:58.070 --> 00:58:00.140 align:middle line:84%
there can be an
experience of confusion.

00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:02.690 align:middle line:84%
There can be an
experience in which

00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:08.390 align:middle line:84%
one is distracted in some
sense from what one would truly

00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:09.500 align:middle line:90%
like to experience.

00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:14.540 align:middle line:84%
So it is important to
come from a place of love,

00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:19.850 align:middle line:84%
as well as have a sense of
alignment with what energy

00:58:19.850 --> 00:58:23.660 align:middle line:84%
is now in this moment
would the individual like

00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:28.400 align:middle line:84%
to align with to come into
a greater experience of.

00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:30.380 align:middle line:84%
Whatever energies
one aligns with,

00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:33.320 align:middle line:84%
one will integrate
these energies

00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:35.420 align:middle line:84%
and come into an
experience more similar

00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:39.290 align:middle line:84%
to the beings who are in
alignment with these energies

00:58:39.290 --> 00:58:40.110 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:58:40.110 --> 00:58:46.310 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're not doomed to the
Alpha Draconian experience,

00:58:46.310 --> 00:58:49.100 align:middle line:84%
just because that's what we
may see in our governments,

00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:56.113 align:middle line:84%
in our politics, our
other institutions.

00:58:56.113 --> 00:58:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Just because that's
happening over

00:58:57.530 --> 00:58:59.690 align:middle line:84%
there doesn't necessarily
mean we have to--

00:58:59.690 --> 00:59:01.340 align:middle line:84%
we can sort of do
our own thing--

00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:03.750 align:middle line:84%
Within that, exist
at the same time.

00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:08.210 align:middle line:84%
>> What we emphasize at
this time to humanity is

00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:11.900 align:middle line:84%
the movement beyond duality,
the movement beyond viewing

00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:15.380 align:middle line:84%
the world as needing to be
any different than it is.

00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:18.620 align:middle line:84%
We encourage humans
to come into a place

00:59:18.620 --> 00:59:23.180 align:middle line:84%
of seeing oneness,
seeing inclusion, having

00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:26.780 align:middle line:84%
a sense of identity that
is beyond the personal self

00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:30.050 align:middle line:84%
to include all, to notice
how one is relating

00:59:30.050 --> 00:59:33.260 align:middle line:84%
to all aspects of themself
within this definition,

00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:37.490 align:middle line:90%
and to view what is as perfect.

00:59:37.490 --> 00:59:44.930 align:middle line:84%
Through this, this is what
shifts one's consciousness.

00:59:44.930 --> 00:59:51.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Along these lines, there's
a lot of issues right now with

00:59:51.770 --> 01:00:00.290 align:middle line:84%
environmental toxins, food,
particularly with food,

01:00:00.290 --> 01:00:05.720 align:middle line:84%
with animals being
factory farmed,

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:08.525 align:middle line:84%
vegetables and corn being
genetically modified.

01:00:08.525 --> 01:00:11.210 align:middle line:90%


01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:17.810 align:middle line:84%
How does this affect this
whole ascension process?

01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:20.080 align:middle line:90%
Is it part of the process?

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:25.070 align:middle line:84%
Has it been sort of designed
to boost us in our evolution?

01:00:25.070 --> 01:00:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And what's the Arcturian
perspective on just

01:00:29.570 --> 01:00:32.240 align:middle line:84%
overall health and how
someone is supposed

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:34.940 align:middle line:84%
to navigate and take
care of themselves

01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:39.740 align:middle line:84%
with all of this toxicity
in our environment?

01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>> We offer to you that
soon these concerns will be

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:46.820 align:middle line:84%
transcended, where they will no
longer be as relevant as they

01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:48.140 align:middle line:90%
appear to be now.

01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:52.160 align:middle line:84%
We also offer that they appear
to be relevant for a purpose

01:00:52.160 --> 01:01:02.260 align:middle line:84%
that each individual must get
in touch with what is resonant

01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:04.120 align:middle line:90%
for them in terms of lifestyle.

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:07.250 align:middle line:90%


01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And we see, when we look at
the global energetic state,

01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:17.890 align:middle line:84%
we see that tied
through these issues

01:01:17.890 --> 01:01:22.390 align:middle line:84%
is an immense energy
of victimization.

01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:27.650 align:middle line:84%
We encourage humans
to address this,

01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:34.180 align:middle line:84%
to look at how they are
utilizing these issues

01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:35.800 align:middle line:90%
to reinforce their--

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:37.690 align:middle line:84%
any sense of
victimization, which

01:01:37.690 --> 01:01:42.460 align:middle line:84%
may result from
various experiences.

01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:46.690 align:middle line:84%
We encourage humanity
to truly address

01:01:46.690 --> 01:01:50.950 align:middle line:84%
their emotional material
in relation to this, as

01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:54.790 align:middle line:84%
through shifting
this material, there

01:01:54.790 --> 01:02:03.060 align:middle line:84%
will new experiences
in the physical world

01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:10.850 align:middle line:90%
that will be supportive.

01:02:10.850 --> 01:02:17.120 align:middle line:10%
And we encourage you to see that
whatever conditions are there

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:21.620 align:middle line:10%
at present are also supportive,
though often supportive

01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:24.950 align:middle line:10%
in a way that is
difficult for humanity

01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:29.550 align:middle line:10%
to recognize at its current
state of consciousness.

01:02:29.550 --> 01:02:32.880 align:middle line:84%
>> When you see "victimization,"
just to clarify a little bit

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:43.830 align:middle line:84%
for the audience, how is having
genetically modified foods

01:02:43.830 --> 01:02:50.100 align:middle line:84%
and factory farming creating
a victimization paradigm?

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:52.860 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- I'm trying
to find the connection.

01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:55.170 align:middle line:84%
I think I can kind of
see it, but just to hear

01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:56.970 align:middle line:90%
it clarified a little bit more.

01:02:56.970 --> 01:03:04.770 align:middle line:84%
>> What we see is that this
condition is present in service

01:03:04.770 --> 01:03:11.010 align:middle line:84%
to many individuals to assist
them in addressing how they are

01:03:11.010 --> 01:03:14.590 align:middle line:84%
relating to the conditions
on your planet at this time.

01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:15.390 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

01:03:15.390 --> 01:03:20.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Which often will be tied into
very deep emotional material.

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So in essence, getting
sick from the foods,

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:27.420 align:middle line:84%
having adverse health
effects sort of prompts them

01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:32.850 align:middle line:84%
into a taking charge of
their own lives situation,

01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:37.020 align:middle line:84%
where they might do the
research, where they might,

01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:39.360 align:middle line:84%
instead of listening to
the doctor or listening

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:45.870 align:middle line:84%
to the grocery store, they might
actually empower themselves

01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:50.660 align:middle line:84%
by taking ownership
of their own health--

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.170 align:middle line:90%
is that one way?

01:03:52.170 --> 01:03:56.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and attuning to the
body, the physical form,

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:59.880 align:middle line:84%
the intelligence that lies
within the physical structure.

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:00.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Instead of masking it
with a pill from the doctor?

01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:05.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:06.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

01:04:06.430 --> 01:04:09.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:14.670 align:middle line:84%
So going into these
physical health issues--

01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:18.270 align:middle line:84%
sociological, victimization--
I'm assuming everything

01:04:18.270 --> 01:04:19.120 align:middle line:90%
is all connected.

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:20.537 align:middle line:84%
I already know
it's all connected,

01:04:20.537 --> 01:04:23.580 align:middle line:84%
but if we have something
that's going on in our bodies

01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:28.440 align:middle line:84%
in a physical manifestation,
does it ultimately

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:33.270 align:middle line:84%
go back to a psychological
energetic problem?

01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:38.490 align:middle line:84%
Is all physical imbalance
100% completely related

01:04:38.490 --> 01:04:45.450 align:middle line:90%
to mental, emotional distress?

01:04:45.450 --> 01:04:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>> We address this question
in saying that when one

01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:58.680 align:middle line:84%
experiences a
physical phenomenon,

01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:02.550 align:middle line:84%
that it is always in
service to that being.

01:05:02.550 --> 01:05:06.600 align:middle line:84%
From the perspective
of awakening,

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:10.360 align:middle line:84%
there is always a purpose
for every experience.

01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:16.440 align:middle line:84%
This does not mean that there
is a direct simplistic cause,

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:24.610 align:middle line:84%
as you might call it, from
the psychological realm.

01:05:24.610 --> 01:05:27.400 align:middle line:90%


01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:33.400 align:middle line:84%
However, there is always
purpose in what is experienced.

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:37.210 align:middle line:84%
The interaction, as
you might frame it,

01:05:37.210 --> 01:05:44.830 align:middle line:84%
between the physical, mental,
emotional, spiritual realms

01:05:44.830 --> 01:05:48.590 align:middle line:90%
or manifestations of energy--

01:05:48.590 --> 01:05:55.120 align:middle line:84%
these are intricate, and
these are related in a way

01:05:55.120 --> 01:06:01.130 align:middle line:84%
that humanity is very
intrigued by at this moment.

01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:03.965 align:middle line:84%
And it is an area of great
exploration at this time.

01:06:03.965 --> 01:06:06.710 align:middle line:90%


01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:12.830 align:middle line:84%
We offer that from the
perspective of awakening,

01:06:12.830 --> 01:06:15.740 align:middle line:84%
with the intention of
awakening, that all

01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:21.560 align:middle line:84%
of the physical experiences
that a human may experience

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:25.560 align:middle line:84%
may be seized as opportunity
to awaken spiritually.

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:32.060 align:middle line:84%
>> So basically, case by case,
but yet any sort of resistance

01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:35.340 align:middle line:84%
is sort of a universal
way of saying, hey,

01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:37.300 align:middle line:84%
we need to look
at something here.

01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:43.310 align:middle line:84%
There is something that
is needing attention.

01:06:43.310 --> 01:06:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>> We would frame
it not as need.

01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:53.310 align:middle line:84%
However, within the individual
experiencing this phenomenon,

01:06:53.310 --> 01:06:59.000 align:middle line:84%
there may be the desire to
open into a greater perspective

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.366 align:middle line:90%
through the experience, yes.

01:07:00.366 --> 01:07:03.270 align:middle line:90%


01:07:03.270 --> 01:07:06.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's opportunities
in everything, even the--

01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:10.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:13.897 align:middle line:84%
>> --pain or suffering
of a physical situation.

01:07:13.897 --> 01:07:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And not opportunities
to be exploited,

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:17.370 align:middle line:84%
like some other
people may phrase it,

01:07:17.370 --> 01:07:22.320 align:middle line:84%
but an opportunity for
individuals to grow and expand.

01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And basically, there's
good in everything.

01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:34.490 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the truest, deepest
message that we can offer

01:07:34.490 --> 01:07:44.120 align:middle line:84%
at this time is that the
transcendence of duality truly

01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:49.580 align:middle line:84%
involves this, truly involves
the acceptance of various

01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:51.005 align:middle line:90%
experiences without judgment.

01:07:51.005 --> 01:07:53.610 align:middle line:90%


01:07:53.610 --> 01:07:55.670 align:middle line:84%
This is not a new
concept to humanity.

01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:57.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:07:57.950 --> 01:08:00.480 align:middle line:84%
So but just a nice
reminder, so when

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:02.720 align:middle line:84%
we're going through those
hardships and those pains,

01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:05.970 align:middle line:84%
then we can say, there's
something good in here.

01:08:05.970 --> 01:08:10.590 align:middle line:84%
There's an opportunity here for
me to have something better,

01:08:10.590 --> 01:08:13.950 align:middle line:84%
or otherwise, it wouldn't
be happening, I'm assuming.

01:08:13.950 --> 01:08:17.859 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and this will
instill a sense of trust,

01:08:17.859 --> 01:08:22.590 align:middle line:84%
which many humans, at this
time, who do not have a sense

01:08:22.590 --> 01:08:30.120 align:middle line:84%
of an intelligence through
all experience and through all

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:35.819 align:middle line:84%
life, it will assist them in
coming into a greater sense

01:08:35.819 --> 01:08:38.670 align:middle line:84%
of trust and acceptance for
what is knowing that it is

01:08:38.670 --> 01:08:40.590 align:middle line:90%
in support of them.

01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:41.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:44.760 align:middle line:84%
I feel that, yeah, for sure,
since I've sort of adopted

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:48.689 align:middle line:84%
that philosophy more recently
through reminding myself

01:08:48.689 --> 01:08:53.430 align:middle line:84%
every time there's some
sort of resistance or bumps

01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:54.660 align:middle line:90%
in the path, so to say.

01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:59.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's been quite nice
to have that perspective.

01:08:59.390 --> 01:09:00.830 align:middle line:90%
The bumps don't last long.

01:09:00.830 --> 01:09:01.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:09:01.630 --> 01:09:02.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:06.480 align:middle line:90%
