We had groups from all
over the world there--

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.840 align:middle line:90%
Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, US.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.770 align:middle line:90%
And it was a cosmic celebration.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:53.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.572 align:middle line:84%
And this was my
first contact retreat

00:03:55.572 --> 00:03:56.780 align:middle line:90%
that you did here in America.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:57.200 align:middle line:90%

amazing footage, as usual.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>> It was very hard to
decompress because there was

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.390 align:middle line:84%
just so much
post-retreat stuff to do.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And there's just been a
really intense energy happening

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.290 align:middle line:84%
I think all over the
planet right now.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:22.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.892 align:middle line:84%
>> I know when I've
spoken to other people,

00:04:23.892 --> 00:04:25.220 align:middle line:90%
they've talked about it also.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.685 align:middle line:84%
So it just seems like
everything's speeding up.

00:04:27.685 --> 00:04:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And I know we've been
saying that for years--

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.093 align:middle line:90%
>> --but it's still speeding up.

00:04:31.093 --> 00:04:32.635 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's not
going to stop, is it?

00:04:32.635 --> 00:04:33.860 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not going to stop.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.560 align:middle line:84%
So we have to learn how
to surf the wave, I guess.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Surf the wave.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.440 align:middle line:90%
Surf the wave of change.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.840 align:middle line:90%
>> That's James, right?

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:42.640 align:middle line:90%
That's his--

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes yes.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.540 align:middle line:90%
>> --company, his shirt.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.990 align:middle line:84%
One of the contact
retreat members

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.510 align:middle line:84%
has a t-shirt, Surf the Wave
of Change, and a company.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, shall we bring Hamon
in and see where that goes?

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes so maybe I should just
say something about Hamon.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, please.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I've channeled Sirian
energy here and there,

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.130 align:middle line:90%
starting in around 2003.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.170 align:middle line:84%
I've always found
for me, in the way

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:13.460 align:middle line:84%
it manifests with me,
to be very electrical,

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.750 align:middle line:84%
often combined with weird
thunderstorms that happen.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.140 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to have any of
that today, I don't believe,

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:26.550 align:middle line:84%
but really only
maybe five years ago,

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.690 align:middle line:84%
this particular
being, Hamon, came

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.210 align:middle line:84%
through for the
first time, mostly

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.590 align:middle line:84%
in connection with retreats
out in nature, surprisingly.

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.800 align:middle line:84%
>> He speaks a lot about
ancient and traditional Sirian

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.290 align:middle line:84%
practices that were
passed to Earth people,

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.630 align:middle line:84%
and prefers to be in
this type of environment.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:49.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.068 align:middle line:90%
>> So I think--

00:05:52.068 --> 00:05:53.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
your questions are.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:54.380 align:middle line:90%
We shall see.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.565 align:middle line:84%
That's going to
be a big surprise.

00:05:55.565 --> 00:05:56.365 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:56.365 --> 00:05:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>> But you'll see that his main
focus is really the awakening

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.520 align:middle line:84%
of the consciousness
on the planet.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect.

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, so here he comes.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.088 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:06:06.088 --> 00:06:48.080 align:middle line:90%


00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, my friend.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.740 align:middle line:90%
It is I, Hamon.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, Hamon.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for the invitation.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.500 align:middle line:84%
I've got a number
of questions today,

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:07.960 align:middle line:84%
and wanted to start off
with what was the clap?

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.440 align:middle line:84%
>> For the channel's body and
the way that she integrates

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.400 align:middle line:84%
energy, it is a way to create
a type of alchemy within her

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.490 align:middle line:84%
energetic field
that, you might say,

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.250 align:middle line:84%
opens a portal or opens
a tube, so to speak,

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.630 align:middle line:84%
that allows our energy to
be assimilated more easily.

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:26.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Like a sync up, in a sense?

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:26.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Kind of, yes.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:27.780 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.520 align:middle line:84%
Because I do the same clap
to get all my audio synced up

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.530 align:middle line:84%
for all the different
devices they have.

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:37.450 align:middle line:84%
>> You can say it's kind of like
a way to sync my energy field

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:42.100 align:middle line:84%
with her energy field and
create a third energy field that

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.350 align:middle line:84%
allows for the
communication to take place.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:45.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.700 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.180 align:middle line:84%
The Sirian energy is
sort of a newer thing,

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:53.600 align:middle line:84%
she just said, for
her, as channeling.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.400 align:middle line:90%
Why now?

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.320 align:middle line:90%
Why the Sirius energy now?

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.380 align:middle line:84%
What's happening now for this to
come out, for you to come out?

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>> That is quite
a good question,

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:07.060 align:middle line:84%
because much of it has to do
with the crossing point that

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.730 align:middle line:84%
you've called on
your planet, 2012,

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:15.400 align:middle line:84%
in which your solar system's
relationship to galactic core

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:20.300 align:middle line:84%
is that you've moved now
into a cycle of integration,

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.820 align:middle line:84%
which is more of
a feminine cycle,

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.770 align:middle line:84%
as you would
understand the term,

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:28.270 align:middle line:84%
instead of a more dissociative
cycle or disintegrated cycle,

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.180 align:middle line:84%
which has been the
last 13,000 years.

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:38.500 align:middle line:84%
So because of that shift
in the energy of humanity,

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:44.500 align:middle line:84%
you can say it was the
signpost for us Sirians

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:48.160 align:middle line:84%
to return and continue
the work that we've

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:54.740 align:middle line:84%
done in the last cycle,
1,000 to 26,000 years ago.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:58.540 align:middle line:84%
>> So the energy now is more
accessible for the Sirian

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.430 align:middle line:90%
energy to come through.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:02.170 align:middle line:90%
>> That is correct.

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:05.320 align:middle line:84%
The name, for example,
that I have chosen

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:09.310 align:middle line:84%
for these interactions through
this channel, the word Hamon,

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:13.570 align:middle line:84%
in our ancient language,
means integration.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:20.410 align:middle line:84%
So it is an expression of
the energy of your time now,

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:26.650 align:middle line:84%
and how it is also connected
to the work and the promises,

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:29.320 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, we have
made to humanity

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.110 align:middle line:84%
to help to facilitate
the integration process.

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:38.180 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of
density, what density--

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:40.060 align:middle line:84%
we know Sasha's
in fourth density.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:43.690 align:middle line:84%
What density would
Hamon be residing in?

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Same idea, fourth
density consciousness.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:52.210 align:middle line:84%
You can say, however, because
we understand humans like

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:54.910 align:middle line:84%
hierarchy in order
to understand things,

00:09:54.910 --> 00:10:01.479 align:middle line:84%
you could say that my people,
my civilization is slightly more

00:10:01.479 --> 00:10:05.890 align:middle line:84%
advanced or slightly more
integrated than Sasha's.

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:08.640 align:middle line:84%
But still fourth density,
for we still have a body.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.440 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.857 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I was going to ask, do
you still have physical body.

00:10:11.857 --> 00:10:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And you do you fly
around in ships?

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.560 align:middle line:90%


00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, although that word
is often misunderstood

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:26.880 align:middle line:84%
because of the idea of how ships
can move from liquid quantum

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.220 align:middle line:90%
states to solid mass states.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.370 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.680 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that actually--
I'm going to jump right

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:38.000 align:middle line:84%
into a question that has
been lurking in my mind

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.870 align:middle line:84%
that I think Sasha actually
brought up at the retreat.

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:47.300 align:middle line:84%
The understanding that we
have now of ships, of flying

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:52.880 align:middle line:84%
saucers, of galactic
star systems,

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.250 align:middle line:84%
as we're moving
through time, we're

00:10:55.250 --> 00:11:01.670 align:middle line:84%
understanding timelines, we're
redefining our reality almost

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:04.130 align:middle line:84%
on a daily basis now, with
new scientific discoveries

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:05.540 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:11.750 align:middle line:84%
So maybe you could
clarify if, by the time

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:15.470 align:middle line:84%
we get to your density, it's
going to be a massive change.

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Like, our whole concept
of what ships are,

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:21.140 align:middle line:84%
of how transportation,
of star beings,

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.810 align:middle line:84%
Star Trek, like this whole idea,
it's going to be different,

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:25.490 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:30.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, but there is a very
important understanding with

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:35.020 align:middle line:84%
this idea that we wish
to shed some light on.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:39.440 align:middle line:84%
>> If you look back in your
timeframe that you know

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:46.100 align:middle line:84%
of on Earth, such as the 1950s,
the different types of contacts

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:50.810 align:middle line:84%
that were experienced at that
time were with very structured

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:56.150 align:middle line:84%
ships, very 3D kind of ideas
of ETs in Spandex suits

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.920 align:middle line:84%
and the sports model ships
and all of that idea.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:11:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:04.070 align:middle line:84%
>> However, as consciousness
itself begins to evolve

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:09.620 align:middle line:84%
and shift, you no longer
need that type of imagery

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:13.050 align:middle line:84%
to understand what is
happening in the universe.

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:15.800 align:middle line:84%
So it is not that we
are presenting you

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.800 align:middle line:84%
with different things, it
is that your consciousness

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:24.620 align:middle line:84%
is much more able to conceive
of and accept and resonate

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:29.180 align:middle line:84%
with the ideas that are
closer to the truth of what

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.700 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial
contact really is.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:32.630 align:middle line:90%
Does this make sense?

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:33.430 align:middle line:90%
>> It does.

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that, from my
own understanding, expansion

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:42.280 align:middle line:84%
of this, not limiting
it to guys in Spandex

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.630 align:middle line:84%
and in the sports
models, but then

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:50.240 align:middle line:84%
going into these other realms of
the fairies and the elementals

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:54.140 align:middle line:84%
and nature spirits, and just
expanding into all of it,

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.030 align:middle line:90%
where it's not--

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:59.420 align:middle line:84%
and I feel that maybe
you guys are even

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:04.890 align:middle line:84%
maybe closer to that idea, in
a sense that it's more fluid.

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:06.620 align:middle line:84%
I think in the
human interpretation

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.860 align:middle line:84%
of like elves and fairies and
"Lord of the Rings" type stuff,

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.750 align:middle line:84%
that feels more
magical, in a sense,

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:15.647 align:middle line:84%
and more fluid, and not as
rigid with structured craft

00:13:15.647 --> 00:13:16.730 align:middle line:90%
and these kinds of things.

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:17.810 align:middle line:90%
Am I in the right path?

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>> That is correct.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And also, you are touching
upon the Sirian relationship

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.620 align:middle line:84%
with your planet,
which is very--

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.510 align:middle line:90%
the spectrum is very wide.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:29.810 align:middle line:84%
From the idea of beings such
as myself and my people,

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:32.390 align:middle line:84%
who you would associate
with the stars,

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:37.250 align:middle line:84%
to other Sirian beings who, in
a sense, stayed on your planet

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.310 align:middle line:84%
when many of us returned to
the stars, and in a sense

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:43.430 align:middle line:84%
became one with your
planet, inner Earth,

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:45.060 align:middle line:90%
things such as that.

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:49.730 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of contact, then,
especially with Sirian energy,

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:51.155 align:middle line:90%
has a very, very broad spectrum.

00:13:51.155 --> 00:13:52.130 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:57.260 align:middle line:84%
>> We will also say, though,
that as human understanding

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:02.000 align:middle line:84%
of the quantum nature
of reality grows,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.390 align:middle line:84%
your experiences of
extraterrestrial contact are

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:08.480 align:middle line:84%
also going to shift more
into the quantum realms,

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:12.210 align:middle line:84%
which you are already seeing
beginning to happen now.

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, hence the contact
retreat we just had,

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:19.490 align:middle line:84%
where people are going
not so much physically,

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:25.400 align:middle line:84%
but consciously into the
ships, having the experiences,

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.500 align:middle line:84%
connecting to that dream world
a little bit more closely,

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.300 align:middle line:90%
it seems.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:32.870 align:middle line:84%
>> That is correct, because
it really has to be that way.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:37.910 align:middle line:84%
If contact is only
focused on the 3D,

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:40.970 align:middle line:84%
the things you can
touch, then in a sense

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:43.250 align:middle line:84%
you lock yourselves
into a paradigm

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:45.470 align:middle line:84%
that does not allow
your consciousness

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:48.110 align:middle line:84%
to move beyond the
more structured reality

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:52.750 align:middle line:84%
into its more organic nature,
which is more of a quantum

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:54.870 align:middle line:90%
expanse of nature instead.

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:55.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'm assuming,
like the Pleiades,

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:04.010 align:middle line:84%
there's many planetary
bodies in the Sirius AB

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:07.790 align:middle line:90%
system harboring life.

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And am I assuming
that correctly?

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:14.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and many
dimensional realities.

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:18.170 align:middle line:84%
But also, please
understand that, once we

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:21.110 align:middle line:84%
became space-faring,
we go out to

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:24.090 align:middle line:84%
many, many different colonies
and space stations and such.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:28.460 align:middle line:84%
So it goes beyond the star
system, simply itself.

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:31.920 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess I'm assuming that
having the suns in the sky,

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.380 align:middle line:84%
that kind of imagery-- and
we've seen other science fiction

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:37.890 align:middle line:84%
stories that have, in
Star Wars and whatnot,

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:41.400 align:middle line:84%
different two suns or
three suns, in a sense,

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.910 align:middle line:84%
in the sky that give a much
different experience than we

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:47.310 align:middle line:90%
have on Earth with our one sun.

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:49.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:51.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Anything to
elaborate on that?

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:53.818 align:middle line:84%
>> Not so much to
elaborate, except to say--

00:15:53.818 --> 00:15:55.610 align:middle line:84%
this is something we
have said in the past,

00:15:55.610 --> 00:16:01.140 align:middle line:84%
but looking at star systems
from the point of view of out

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:01.940 align:middle line:90%
there--

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:03.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:06.830 align:middle line:84%
>> --from our perspective,
your sun is part of the Sirian

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:07.670 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:08.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Right

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:11.840 align:middle line:84%
>> So the relationship,
then, is very, very close.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And that deep, deep,
ancient, ancient memory is

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:20.060 align:middle line:84%
stored within the holographic
memory of your people

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:22.010 align:middle line:90%
and our people, as well.

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So almost like
Earth-- or I'm sorry,

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:26.270 align:middle line:90%
our sun could be a Sirius C?

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:27.680 align:middle line:90%
>> You could say that, yes.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:31.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:33.680 align:middle line:84%
In our history, we
have the Dogon tribe

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:42.470 align:middle line:84%
that has talked about Sirian
contact and beings of almost

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:45.910 align:middle line:84%
like an aquatic or
dolphin-type nature,

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:48.680 align:middle line:84%
and they had masks and
maybe even spacesuits

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:50.570 align:middle line:90%
to keep that liquid in.

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:52.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure, there's
different interpretations

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:57.200 align:middle line:90%
of those legends.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Anything to say about
the Dogon tribe?

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:02.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, we point to the
spectrum we have talked about.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:06.240 align:middle line:84%
Some of those beings
are more earth-based,

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.840 align:middle line:90%
some are more water-based.

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:13.100 align:middle line:84%
So some of that is
indeed a memory.

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.980 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit mixed,
though, the memories.

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:18.550 align:middle line:90%
It's not so literal.

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:20.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a little bit more symbolic.

00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:23.930 align:middle line:84%
However, the Dogon
tribe is tapping

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:27.620 align:middle line:84%
into more of that symbolic
memory of some of those beings

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:28.800 align:middle line:90%
from ancient times.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.630 align:middle line:84%
Like they even knew about the
two suns before our scientists

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:34.430 align:middle line:90%
even--

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:35.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct, yes.

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:36.272 align:middle line:90%
>> --could tap into that.

00:17:36.272 --> 00:17:38.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:42.410 align:middle line:84%
>> How about Egypt or some
of these other ancient

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:44.540 align:middle line:90%
civilizations, Atlantis?

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.060 align:middle line:84%
What was the influence
or relationship

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:49.122 align:middle line:84%
to Sirius in those
civilizations?

00:17:49.122 --> 00:17:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's a
very good question,

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.350 align:middle line:84%
but the answer
could be very long.

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:53.150 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:56.120 align:middle line:84%
>> So we are going
to try to summarize.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Basically, as we were
previously saying about

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:03.810 align:middle line:84%
the 26,000 year cycle,
you go through cycles

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:07.110 align:middle line:84%
of disintegration, which
is the last 13,000 years,

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:09.480 align:middle line:84%
and you go through
cycles of integration.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.870 align:middle line:84%
You are now entering the
new cycle of integration.

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:18.470 align:middle line:84%
So extraterrestrial contact
on your planet, historically,

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:21.350 align:middle line:84%
will mirror, the
contacts themselves

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:26.340 align:middle line:84%
will mirror the galactic
energy, depending

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.600 align:middle line:84%
upon which part of
the cycle you are in.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:32.159 align:middle line:84%
So within the last 13,000
years, then, while there

00:18:32.159 --> 00:18:35.730 align:middle line:84%
has been contact,
especially when you go back

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:38.429 align:middle line:84%
to the early dynasties
of Egypt and you

00:18:38.429 --> 00:18:41.790 align:middle line:84%
go back farther and farther
into Sumeria, as an example--

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:42.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.179 align:middle line:84%
>> --you're talking about
what you would consider to be

00:18:45.179 --> 00:18:49.830 align:middle line:84%
the post fall of Atlantis,
something such as that.

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Those time periods
were the time periods

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.860 align:middle line:84%
when you were, in a sense, in
terms of the galactic cycle,

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.260 align:middle line:90%
falling into disintegration.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:18:59.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:03.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So what you're going to find
during those points is that,

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:07.830 align:middle line:84%
while you might see peaks
of civilization in terms

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:13.110 align:middle line:84%
of technology and maybe
language jumps and jumps in art

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:17.340 align:middle line:84%
and jumps in tools and practices
and things such as that,

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:19.110 align:middle line:90%
there's a lot more going on.

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:22.230 align:middle line:84%
Because of that cycle
of disintegration,

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:24.510 align:middle line:90%
this is where some of that--

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:27.720 align:middle line:84%
we've talked about in other
venues the dark Sirian

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.190 align:middle line:90%
energy came in, as well.

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:32.400 align:middle line:84%
So you have the dark
magic practices and things

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.520 align:middle line:84%
such as that in those
cycles of disintegration.

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.030 align:middle line:84%
So historically,
you're going to find

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:41.430 align:middle line:90%
so many different influences.

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And it really depends on the
particular point in history

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:47.370 align:middle line:84%
and the particular
groups of consciousness

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:48.450 align:middle line:90%
that you're asking about.

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:50.880 align:middle line:84%
It can seem like a mish mash,
if you know what we mean.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, yeah.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>> But does that
address your question?

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:55.560 align:middle line:90%
>> It does.

00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:01.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Looking back, then, at the
cycle 13,000 to 26,000 years

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:04.170 align:middle line:84%
ago, which would have
been an integrative cycle,

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:06.990 align:middle line:84%
and we're looking at the
last phase of that cycle,

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:11.190 align:middle line:84%
when those who were on the Earth
knew that the, as you call it,

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:15.420 align:middle line:84%
the fall was going to happen
back into disintegration,

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:20.340 align:middle line:84%
this was a time where many of
your extraterrestrial family

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:24.300 align:middle line:84%
and many Earth people were
working together to try

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.940 align:middle line:84%
to, in a sense, stop
the fall from happening,

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:30.280 align:middle line:84%
or to slow down the
fall into forgetfulness.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're going to find
during that time period,

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:37.320 align:middle line:84%
while there might not be a lot
of historical proof of this,

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.670 align:middle line:84%
although if you look hard
enough, you will find it--

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:40.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>> It was kind of what
you might call a high time

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:47.220 align:middle line:84%
of civilization in an
attempt to, in a sense,

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:52.500 align:middle line:84%
energetically boost you through
that cycle of the fall so that

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.050 align:middle line:84%
you would awaken before
it happened, so to speak.

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:57.960 align:middle line:84%
We speak a little bit
dramatically in order to just

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.640 align:middle line:84%
to illustrate the point that
we're trying to get across.

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:04.330 align:middle line:84%
>> So Atlantis was sort of
an accelerated evolutionary

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:05.130 align:middle line:90%
period?

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:06.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:10.380 align:middle line:84%
In the attempt at awakening
consciousness so that

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:12.310 align:middle line:84%
you would not fall into
another sleep cycle.

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:13.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Right

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:17.530 align:middle line:84%
>> However, energy
doesn't lie, so to speak.

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:20.400 align:middle line:84%
So if the mass
consciousness is not

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:24.030 align:middle line:84%
integrated to a certain
level, and if there is still

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:28.290 align:middle line:84%
what you might call a
shadow influence that is not

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:30.570 align:middle line:84%
being integrated
and worked with,

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:32.640 align:middle line:90%
then another cycle begins again.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.140 align:middle line:84%
So that was a little
bit of what you

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:36.880 align:middle line:84%
call a race to the
finish line, so to speak,

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.190 align:middle line:90%
if you understand the metaphor.

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:42.720 align:middle line:84%
But now that we're
entering the new cycle,

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:49.070 align:middle line:84%
we can pick up where that
old cycle left off, in a way.

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:51.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, but it's important to
know that it's not a circle.

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:54.560 align:middle line:84%
You are not repeating the same
thing over and over again.

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:55.720 align:middle line:90%
It's more of a spiral.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>> So as you go
into this cycle now,

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:01.750 align:middle line:84%
you're going to find that you
are at a different place than

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:04.930 align:middle line:84%
you were the last time
you were in this cycle.

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:05.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:10.030 align:middle line:84%
But there were remnants
of the last cycle,

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:11.630 align:middle line:84%
for example maybe
the crystal skulls--

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:12.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:16.780 align:middle line:84%
>> --that were left as
gifts for us to pick up.

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:17.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:20.410 align:middle line:84%
There are those types of
gifts all over your planet.

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:22.120 align:middle line:84%
You can include
the crystal skulls,

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:26.420 align:middle line:84%
you can include the places
such as Stonehenge, the stone

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:27.220 align:middle line:90%
circles.

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:31.150 align:middle line:84%
You can include the pyramids
that are all around the planet,

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:33.170 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Those are places where
knowledge is preserved.

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And when we use
the term knowledge,

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.500 align:middle line:84%
we're not talking about, as
you would know, book knowledge.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:42.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:47.590 align:middle line:84%
>> We're talking more about
places or portals where wisdom

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:52.090 align:middle line:84%
can be accessed as a reminder to
trigger your remembrance of who

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:53.890 align:middle line:90%
you truly are.

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:54.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Exciting times.

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:56.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Very exciting, my dear.

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:59.200 align:middle line:90%
Very exciting.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:02.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Would you say that the
serpent energy is also

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:06.290 align:middle line:84%
associated with
the Sirius energy?

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:07.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:13.120 align:middle line:84%
Your planet has used the
symbol of serpent or dragon

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:22.910 align:middle line:84%
or snake as a way to give an
energy signature, if you will--

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:23.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:28.090 align:middle line:84%
>> --to the Sirian energy,
as it has helped to develop

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:30.410 align:middle line:84%
your awakening
process in the past.

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:33.130 align:middle line:84%
However, as with
everything, there

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:35.260 align:middle line:84%
are certain elements
that sometimes

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:40.960 align:middle line:84%
can hijack symbology and use
it for their own purposes.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.030 align:middle line:84%
In terms of your
biblical references,

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:46.540 align:middle line:84%
we do believe this was written
about just a little bit

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:50.200 align:middle line:84%
in the "Prism of Lyra" book,
but generally speaking,

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.410 align:middle line:84%
the whole garden of
Eden story is a metaphor

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:57.160 align:middle line:84%
for the choices
humanity has made

00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:02.050 align:middle line:84%
about whether it would awaken
or whether it would go back

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:04.780 align:middle line:84%
into another cycle
of forgetfulness.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:08.770 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of the dark
Sirian energy, though,

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:10.930 align:middle line:84%
we know that there
are probably people

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:12.790 align:middle line:84%
watching this video
that want to understand

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:15.020 align:middle line:90%
what we're referring to.

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:17.080 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to say
this very, very simply.

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:18.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>> It's written more
about in the new book,

00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:24.100 align:middle line:84%
"The Golden Lakes," for people
that want to research that.

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:33.030 align:middle line:84%
But very, very simply,
this idea of duality

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:35.790 align:middle line:90%
is the nature of creation.

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:38.310 align:middle line:84%
But when we define
duality, we are

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:41.460 align:middle line:84%
referring to the idea
of like a battery, where

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.650 align:middle line:84%
you have a positive charge
and a negative charge.

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:45.280 align:middle line:84%
One is not good and
one is not evil.

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>> They simply require both
charges to create an energy

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:54.810 align:middle line:84%
source to run your device or to
run the reality, so to speak.

00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:55.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:24:55.710 --> 00:25:00.322 align:middle line:84%
>> However, when a civilization
moves into a third density type

00:25:00.322 --> 00:25:03.810 align:middle line:84%
of experience, where
polarity is magnified,

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:10.020 align:middle line:84%
that neutral duality
becomes polarity,

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:15.120 align:middle line:84%
which is more an experience
of value judgment than it is

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:19.360 align:middle line:84%
an expression of
neutral duality.

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:24.810 align:middle line:84%
So in that case, then, what
is happening now on your world

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:31.530 align:middle line:84%
is that you are moving into
that time of integration,

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:33.750 align:middle line:84%
as we were previously
saying, which

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:38.040 align:middle line:84%
means that you have to
revisit the idea of polarity

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:42.750 align:middle line:84%
as well as duality, learn the
difference between the two,

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:46.110 align:middle line:84%
and integrate the shadow
and the light within you.

00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:50.040 align:middle line:84%
This is a type of Sirian
alchemy that my people

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:55.750 align:middle line:84%
did a very, very long time ago
for our awakening as a species.

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And it is what is being
required of you now.

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:02.160 align:middle line:84%
It is why, on your
planet, you are

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:06.720 align:middle line:84%
seeing all of this darkness
coming out into the light.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And we're not just talking
about out there in the politics

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:14.010 align:middle line:84%
or in the religion, but we are
also talking about within you,

00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:18.690 align:middle line:84%
as well, for your internal is
a reflection of the external.

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:22.200 align:middle line:84%
We know that you are seeing
this playing out on your planet

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.090 align:middle line:84%
all over the place,
whether it is politics,

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:25.660 align:middle line:90%
whether it is religion.

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:29.730 align:middle line:84%
However, it is very important
in this crucial time

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:31.860 align:middle line:84%
to understand that
what you are seeing out

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:34.530 align:middle line:84%
there is connected to
what is happening within.

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:36.330 align:middle line:90%
This is true for everyone.

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:40.620 align:middle line:84%
The shadow and the light,
or the two dualities

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:44.340 align:middle line:84%
are needing to come out and
be embraced and integrated

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:45.250 align:middle line:90%
and balanced.

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:49.620 align:middle line:84%
This is a process as you
enter fourth density reality.

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Every civilization
goes through this.

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, in this time
more than any time,

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.250 align:middle line:84%
it is the most
important time to do

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:01.770 align:middle line:84%
the inner work of the
integration of those energies

00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:03.420 align:middle line:90%
within you.

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:07.500 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'll say hopefully, but
I don't even need to use that

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.110 align:middle line:84%
word, unlike the
Atlantian times,

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:15.100 align:middle line:84%
we are going to pull
through this one.

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:17.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm pretty confident.

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:18.785 align:middle line:90%
>> No comment, my dear.

00:27:18.785 --> 00:27:19.590 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, all right.

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>> However, we will say that the
biggest difference between this

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:29.100 align:middle line:84%
time and the Atlantian time is
that, in the Atlantian time,

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:34.110 align:middle line:84%
most people were concerned with
the outer projection and not

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:35.080 align:middle line:90%
looking within.

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:35.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:40.020 align:middle line:84%
>> This time, a great many
people on your world are doing

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:43.620 align:middle line:84%
the inner work also, which
is going to make the biggest

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:44.430 align:middle line:90%
energetic shift.

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:45.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:46.280 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, I have confidence
we're going to do this.

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:51.110 align:middle line:90%
>> We do, too, my dear.

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And as I just said,
it's exciting times.

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:55.890 align:middle line:90%
So glad to be here.

00:27:55.890 --> 00:28:00.910 align:middle line:90%


00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:04.170 align:middle line:84%
At one of the contact
retreats in Japan,

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:06.930 align:middle line:84%
Hamon's come through and talked
about the serpent schools.

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:08.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Could you elaborate a
little bit about those?

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:11.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:15.150 align:middle line:84%
We have called this the
School of the Nine Serpents.

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:18.030 align:middle line:84%
Basically, serpent
is a metaphor.

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:21.690 align:middle line:84%
It is a metaphor
for meaning gate,

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:25.290 align:middle line:84%
meaning that it is
a gate through which

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:29.160 align:middle line:84%
spiritual training
will take you where

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:32.880 align:middle line:84%
you must pass to
integrate yourself

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.100 align:middle line:90%
on the way back to the one.

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:38.550 align:middle line:84%
So much of this is written
about also in the new book.

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:40.840 align:middle line:84%
We're not meaning a
commercial, it's simply that--

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:41.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:43.365 align:middle line:84%
>> --we can't go through
the whole thing here.

00:28:43.365 --> 00:28:44.165 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no, no.

00:28:44.165 --> 00:28:48.090 align:middle line:84%
>> However, the nine schools
in that way help you work with

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:54.210 align:middle line:84%
your inner energy, and most
especially helping your ego

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:58.380 align:middle line:84%
make the transition it needs
from a third density version

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:01.440 align:middle line:84%
of ego to a fourth
density version of ego,

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.320 align:middle line:84%
which is very necessary because
the third density version

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:09.780 align:middle line:84%
of ego cannot survive within a
fourth density type of reality.

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:12.270 align:middle line:84%
So serpent, in that
way, is meant merely

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:15.190 align:middle line:84%
as a metaphor for
Sirian gateway.

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:15.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's also perhaps
why the Sirius--

00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:23.520 align:middle line:84%
like you said, since
2012, the Sirian gateways

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.050 align:middle line:90%
have been sort of opened a bit.

00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:26.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Very much so, yes.

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:28.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So these schools
are being revisited.

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:29.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, very much so.

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:36.390 align:middle line:84%
This ancient school was one
that was given to early humans

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:40.230 align:middle line:84%
by Sirians and Pleiadians
in the very ancient days.

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:44.160 align:middle line:84%
But it also had its
version before Earth,

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.170 align:middle line:84%
because all of
these teachings come

00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:49.680 align:middle line:84%
from what we call Vegan
mysticism, all the way back

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:52.350 align:middle line:84%
to your very
ancient, ancient Vega

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:57.060 align:middle line:84%
and, subsequently, Liran
forefathers, as well.

00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:04.020 align:middle line:84%
This school was also
very prevalent on Mars

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:05.890 align:middle line:84%
when Mars's civilization
was thriving.

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:06.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So it is meant to be a
roadmap or a guide to help

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:12.630 align:middle line:90%
an awakening planet.

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:15.390 align:middle line:84%
If the work is done,
awakening happens.

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:16.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Hm.

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And there's no need to
demonize the serpent.

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:23.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Not at all, unless
that's what turns you on.

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I guess some
people get turned on by it.

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:31.980 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of Mars, what
is Sirius's energy--

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:34.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is there
anything that we haven't

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:36.840 align:middle line:90%
touched upon with the serpent?

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:42.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Mostly that, in the
ancient days, Mars--

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:46.550 align:middle line:84%
well, this would be very,
very, very, very ancient days.

00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:49.530 align:middle line:84%
My people were very
young at that time,

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:54.140 align:middle line:84%
so we were not necessarily
visiting Mars in that time.

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:58.220 align:middle line:84%
It was more Vegans,
more Lirans, Orions,

00:30:58.220 --> 00:30:59.720 align:middle line:90%
different types of energies.

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:03.890 align:middle line:84%
However, there is a
lineage, if you will.

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:07.910 align:middle line:84%
Because Mars was very
connected to Vegan lineage,

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:10.760 align:middle line:84%
theory is, very connected
to Vegan lineage,

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.700 align:middle line:90%
we are connected in that way.

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:13.690 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:18.800 align:middle line:84%
So the Sirian energy is there
as a lineage, but not so much

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:19.850 align:middle line:90%
the people themselves.

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:20.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:21.200 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.720 align:middle line:90%
We were too young at that time.

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:33.648 align:middle line:84%
>> And what's the relationship
to Sirius and the Anunnaki?

00:31:33.648 --> 00:31:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Hm.

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:39.330 align:middle line:84%
You asked about Anunnaki, we
believe, accessing her memory

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:40.680 align:middle line:90%
in the past.

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:41.880 align:middle line:90%
>> I did, yeah.

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.630 align:middle line:90%
Anunnaki comes up a lot.

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:44.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, all right.

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:47.850 align:middle line:84%
So our definition,
then, is simply

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:51.780 align:middle line:84%
that Anunnaki is not a species,
as has been misunderstood

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:55.710 align:middle line:84%
on your planet, but is more
referring to those ETs,

00:31:55.710 --> 00:32:00.180 align:middle line:84%
if you will, that came from the
heavens and were seen on Earth.

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:05.430 align:middle line:84%
So they were labeled Anunnaki,
simply meaning children of Anu,

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:07.980 align:middle line:90%
or those from Anu, et cetera.

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:11.430 align:middle line:90%
And that would include Sirians.

00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Would Sirians have a little
more influence in that grouping

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:18.820 align:middle line:90%
of terms or energy than others?

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:20.910 align:middle line:90%
Two things to remember.

00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:23.200 align:middle line:84%
One, my species
was younger then.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Less mature.

00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Two, there were more
factions at that time.

00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:34.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Darker ones, and lighter
ones that had good intentions,

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:42.420 align:middle line:84%
let's say, but were
still immature.

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:45.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.050 align:middle line:90%
Like a young Earth, in a sense.

00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:48.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:49.870 align:middle line:84%
A little bit older
than you, but--

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:50.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:52.090 align:middle line:90%
They still had space-bearing--

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:52.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>> --technology and
these kinds of things.

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:57.930 align:middle line:84%
>> But still not
matured spiritually.

00:32:57.930 --> 00:32:59.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And maybe through us,
they learned some lessons.

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:03.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:06.520 align:middle line:84%
My people have many
lessons courtesy of you,

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:08.670 align:middle line:90%
thank you very much.

00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:10.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Glad to be of assistance.

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:12.180 align:middle line:90%
>> It's how we help each other.

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:13.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:14.850 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:20.700 align:middle line:84%
So you mentioned Vega
lineage, Liran lineage.

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:23.910 align:middle line:84%
What's the relationship
to Sirius and Zeta?

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:25.390 align:middle line:90%
Is there a lineage there?

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:31.050 align:middle line:84%
Is there a connection in
that side of lineages?

00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:32.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Repeat the question, please.

00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:36.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you mentioned that
there's a lineage that Sirius

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:41.880 align:middle line:84%
has with Vega, and then going
further back perhaps to Lira.

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:47.040 align:middle line:84%
Is there a Zeta lineage
connection in there somewhere?

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:48.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, there is.

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:51.420 align:middle line:90%
And have you ever seen the map?

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:52.220 align:middle line:90%
>> I have.

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:53.350 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:57.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I'll insert it here
for our audience to see.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.860 align:middle line:84%
>> So the map that you are
seeing at this time is a very

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:06.420 align:middle line:84%
rudimentary map that discusses
your galactic lineage

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:07.440 align:middle line:90%
relationships.

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:11.400 align:middle line:84%
>> So in order to
answer your question,

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:14.910 align:middle line:84%
we'll just state
very simply that,

00:34:14.910 --> 00:34:18.150 align:middle line:84%
if you think of Lira
as the progenitors,

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:21.300 align:middle line:84%
and then the very first
separations were the Liran

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:25.320 align:middle line:84%
groups and the Vegan groups, and
the Vegan groups had a tendency

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:28.650 align:middle line:84%
to go more into the mind to
separate out the emotional

00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:29.940 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And remembering that
the journey that you

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:37.520 align:middle line:84%
are meant to take, that
you have chosen to take,

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:40.780 align:middle line:84%
that we have all chosen to take,
was a journey into separation.

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:41.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:44.770 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is not
something negative or bad.

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:46.680 align:middle line:84%
It's simply the way
energy moves because it's

00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:48.370 align:middle line:84%
the type of journey
you chose to take.

00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:49.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:54.750 align:middle line:84%
>> So as the Vegan lineages
became more and more focused

00:34:54.750 --> 00:35:00.450 align:middle line:84%
on the mental body, some
branched off and became even

00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:03.330 align:middle line:84%
more super focused
on the mental body.

00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:07.500 align:middle line:84%
So that's where the
Zeta species came in,

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:11.100 align:middle line:84%
was as being one of
those species that

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:17.508 align:middle line:84%
became the super mental
species from the Vegan lineage.

00:35:17.508 --> 00:35:18.800 align:middle line:90%
Does that answer your question?

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:19.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.630 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think with the
map that will help--

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:21.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:23.127 align:middle line:90%
>> --kind of explain things.

00:35:23.127 --> 00:35:26.249 align:middle line:90%


00:35:26.249 --> 00:35:28.440 align:middle line:84%
I've been working
on a documentary

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:32.700 align:middle line:84%
and having a lot of experiences
with the plant medicine

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:34.229 align:middle line:90%
ayahuasca.

00:35:34.229 --> 00:35:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And in my first experience
with that, I saw a cave.

00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:43.670 align:middle line:84%
I saw a chamber of
snakes, serpents.

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:48.209 align:middle line:84%
The serpent energy was
coming in very clearly.

00:35:48.209 --> 00:35:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
have this imagery

00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:56.160 align:middle line:84%
when they partake in these
ceremonies and this medicine.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:01.590 align:middle line:84%
Is there a technology
like ayahuasca,

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:04.690 align:middle line:84%
or is this technology from
Sirius, and is there-- sorry,

00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:06.809 align:middle line:90%
this is a two-part question--

00:36:06.809 --> 00:36:10.720 align:middle line:84%
does that technology
exist in your world?

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:13.110 align:middle line:84%
>> First of all, we want to
make a comment about the cave

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:13.960 align:middle line:90%
of snakes.

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:14.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Because on your world, you
have often come to understand

00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:23.610 align:middle line:84%
serpent as being
Kundalini energy.

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:26.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>> What we're going to say about
that is connected to that kind

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:33.320 align:middle line:84%
of, but it has to do with
the integration of dualities.

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:38.300 align:middle line:84%
So those who might experience
that type of cave of snakes

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:42.110 align:middle line:84%
is a type of snake
initiation, if you will, which

00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:46.350 align:middle line:84%
is we could claim it and
say a Sirian initiation,

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:50.100 align:middle line:84%
which can be sometimes,
depending upon the person,

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.670 align:middle line:84%
but more so it's
an initiation that

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:56.210 align:middle line:84%
has to do with beginning
to bring together

00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:59.960 align:middle line:84%
your own dualities
so that you can start

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:03.180 align:middle line:90%
to actually release polarity.

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:08.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, the plant
medicine is actually

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:11.280 align:middle line:84%
something that is
indigenous to most planets--

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.760 align:middle line:90%
>> --within the galactic family.

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:17.700 align:middle line:84%
They have their own
different versions of it.

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And we've found
historically, galactically,

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:28.820 align:middle line:84%
that it is used particularly
when a civilization is stuck

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:32.960 align:middle line:84%
somewhere, so to speak,
which is where you're--

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:35.390 align:middle line:84%
we don't want to say your
civilization is stuck,

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:40.220 align:middle line:84%
but you are having some issues
with releasing and integrating

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:41.150 align:middle line:90%
polarity.

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:43.470 align:middle line:90%
So that technology is helpful.

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:48.200 align:middle line:84%
However, we have
to say it always

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.730 align:middle line:90%
must be done in a sacred way--

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>> --with guidance by someone
who is much more experienced--

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:54.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>> --and it is never meant to
be continued in an ongoing way.

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:02.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I concur.

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:03.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:06.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I've had those experiences,
and I've seen the magic

00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:15.020 align:middle line:84%
of the medicine and the power
it has had with specific people

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:19.830 align:middle line:84%
to awaken, and to help connect,
reconnect their hearts--

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:20.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:21.505 align:middle line:90%
>> --and their minds.

00:38:21.505 --> 00:38:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>> You're going to find at some
point that your civilization

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.610 align:middle line:90%
will not even need it anymore.

00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:27.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, yeah.

00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And when I first
partook in the medicine,

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:33.530 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh my god,
everybody should try this.

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And after a few ceremonies
and understanding the energy,

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:40.950 align:middle line:84%
I definitely right now am
like, it's not for everybody.

00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:44.150 align:middle line:84%
I definitely want
to make that clear.

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And especially I've
been sort of letting

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:50.480 align:middle line:84%
people know who are already
very much in the heart space

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:53.420 align:middle line:84%
and connected that they don't
need the medicine at all.

00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:57.800 align:middle line:84%
It's just really to help those
going through some tough times,

00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.720 align:middle line:90%
might be in the mental space.

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:02.180 align:middle line:84%
Now we're finding
in our science it's

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:04.280 align:middle line:84%
great for people
who are suffering

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:09.090 align:middle line:84%
from PTSD and deep depression
and these kinds of things.

00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:09.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's a tool,
a wonderful tool.

00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:13.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:16.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Going back to some of--

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:18.500 align:middle line:84%
not to dwell in the
darkness, but to go back

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:26.920 align:middle line:84%
to some of the dark energy of
Sirius, we have in our history

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:29.570 align:middle line:84%
and in our lore
and storytelling,

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:34.465 align:middle line:84%
we have dark cults and wizards
and sort of this evil energy.

00:39:34.465 --> 00:39:37.530 align:middle line:90%


00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And there was this
trauma related to this--

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:43.600 align:middle line:84%
or I guess in past
channelings, I've

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:46.510 align:middle line:84%
heard that there is a
connection with Sirius

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:48.970 align:middle line:84%
and some of these
darker energies,

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:51.400 align:middle line:84%
and then you guys had to
actually integrate them

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:55.132 align:middle line:84%
in a way, or accept them or not
run away from them, I guess.

00:39:55.132 --> 00:39:56.590 align:middle line:84%
Can you elaborate
a little bit on--

00:39:56.590 --> 00:40:01.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Sorry, are you referring to
the human student's experience

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:02.620 align:middle line:90%
or Sirian history?

00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:05.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe Sirian history first,
and then we can connect it

00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:10.060 align:middle line:84%
to our traumas with that energy,
because I think it overlaps.

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:11.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:13.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess I want to make
the connection while we--

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:18.060 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] He's right here, yeah.

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:21.874 align:middle line:90%
Charlie, you're in our shot.

00:40:21.874 --> 00:40:23.330 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:23.330 --> 00:40:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:27.790 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes, he's integrating.

00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:30.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we are
very comfortable,

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:31.380 align:middle line:90%
so we are going to keep going.

00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:32.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, no, go ahead.

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.000 align:middle line:90%
Just, it's--

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:41.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So in my history,
as most civilizations,

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:45.360 align:middle line:84%
there is resistance toward
integrating the darkness.

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:46.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:52.830 align:middle line:84%
>> So within my civilization,
we had that time also.

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And that was when the split
happened in my civilization,

00:40:57.510 --> 00:41:01.920 align:middle line:84%
where some of us began to
awaken and others of us

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:05.910 align:middle line:84%
began to spiral more
down into the darkness.

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:13.290 align:middle line:84%
So when it became time to
interact with your planet,

00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:18.270 align:middle line:84%
you had Sirian energy coming
from different points of view,

00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:19.070 align:middle line:90%
let's say.

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:19.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, OK.

00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:19.590 align:middle line:90%
>> All right?

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:20.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:24.055 align:middle line:84%
>> Hello, my dear
little butt here, yes?

00:41:24.055 --> 00:41:24.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Donkey butt, yeah.

00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:26.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Donkey butt.

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:28.326 align:middle line:90%
Talking about dark energy, yes.

00:41:28.326 --> 00:41:30.260 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:31.680 align:middle line:90%
Cosmic joke.

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:34.400 align:middle line:90%
Butt of the joke, yes?

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:35.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:42.480 align:middle line:84%
>> So that energy
did come to Earth.

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:44.130 align:middle line:90%
There's no victims.

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:48.390 align:middle line:84%
It's just part of
the way energy moves

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:52.950 align:middle line:84%
while you are experiencing
a third density reality.

00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:56.880 align:middle line:84%
So in your time, then, as you
were falling into darkness,

00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:00.960 align:middle line:84%
that was the time when the
Sirian shadow energy came.

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:05.370 align:middle line:84%
So the question would then
be, how did you on Earth

00:42:05.370 --> 00:42:08.040 align:middle line:90%
experience that energy?

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And we could say that many, many
humans experience that energy

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:17.020 align:middle line:84%
through mystery schools, whether
it be Egypt whether it be,

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:20.920 align:middle line:90%
well, West or East, Babylonia.

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Anyplace on the planet
you could possibly

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:32.300 align:middle line:84%
imagine, there was the infusion
of that dark energy when humans

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:36.050 align:middle line:84%
refused to look at
their own dark energy,

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:38.420 align:middle line:84%
because that's when
it gets called in

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:39.890 align:middle line:90%
because it has to play out.

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:41.340 align:middle line:90%
This is energy dynamics.

00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:42.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>> So during those
time periods, then,

00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:48.140 align:middle line:84%
that's when you started to see
wonderful high consciousness

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:52.130 align:middle line:84%
mystery schools, but also others
that were more darker that

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:54.420 align:middle line:90%
maybe preyed on the weaker.

00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:55.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:58.215 align:middle line:84%
So there was a light and
a dark mystery school.

00:42:58.215 --> 00:42:59.015 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:42:59.015 --> 00:42:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:00.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Now sometimes in
terms of mystery schools,

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:06.800 align:middle line:84%
people might think they are
experiencing one that is

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:07.660 align:middle line:90%
of the light--

00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:08.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>> --because they cannot
see their own shadow--

00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:11.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:14.930 align:middle line:84%
>> --so they do not they are
in the shadow, so to speak.

00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:19.250 align:middle line:84%
But all of that, you
might say karmic speaking,

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:22.400 align:middle line:84%
is part of the
process of awakening.

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:26.810 align:middle line:84%
So when we first
shared this information

00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:31.130 align:middle line:84%
with the first group, which
would have been in Japan one

00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:33.170 align:middle line:90%
year ago, so 2018--

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:35.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>> --many of the people in the
audience there connected with

00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:43.020 align:middle line:84%
traumatic past lives that
they had remembered--

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:43.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:48.170 align:middle line:84%
>> --from those time periods
in those ancient schools,

00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:52.310 align:middle line:84%
or being abused by
teachers, whatever it was.

00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And we were encouraging them
that that is going to come up

00:43:57.590 --> 00:43:58.390 align:middle line:90%
now--

00:43:58.390 --> 00:43:59.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>> --because it
needs to come out.

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:02.780 align:middle line:90%
It needs to come to the light.

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:06.170 align:middle line:84%
Even self-forgiveness
needs to happen

00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:11.420 align:middle line:84%
for those who maybe judge
themselves for making what they

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:13.520 align:middle line:90%
might deem to be wrong choices.

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:16.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So does that
address what you--

00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:17.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, that story
seems to repeat itself.

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:26.960 align:middle line:84%
We have, on this planet, we've
had cults or, you know, the--

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:31.940 align:middle line:84%
even in our mass pop culture
now, we have the Illuminati,

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:33.630 align:middle line:84%
and it's become
sort of a buzzword,

00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:37.140 align:middle line:90%
and everybody's running scared.

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:40.580 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh-- and the
idea of symbolism, you know?

00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Like you said earlier,
symbols can be used for dark,

00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:46.010 align:middle line:90%
or they can be hijacked for--

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:48.050 align:middle line:84%
>> You see whatever
you're looking for.

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:48.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:51.810 align:middle line:84%
>> You will always find
what you're looking for.

00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:54.450 align:middle line:90%
And that is a trap.

00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:58.280 align:middle line:84%
So humanity, or
sections of humanity,

00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:01.970 align:middle line:84%
are busy looking for all
those signs of that stuff

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:03.860 align:middle line:90%
and rooting out the evil.

00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:08.640 align:middle line:84%
But that is a black
hole that never ends.

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:12.050 align:middle line:84%
So how do you pull yourself
out of that black hole?

00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:13.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:17.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And that is where a lot of
the Sirian teachings come in.

00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And it is part of the teachings
of the School of the Nine

00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:21.890 align:middle line:90%
Serpents.

00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Simply, very simply put,
if you use the metaphor

00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:29.300 align:middle line:84%
that you, as humans
in third density,

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:34.230 align:middle line:84%
are actors on a stage playing
a part, in third density,

00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:38.510 align:middle line:84%
you don't realize you are an
actor on the stage playing

00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:39.310 align:middle line:90%
a part.

00:45:39.310 --> 00:45:40.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:41.390 align:middle line:90%
>> So you become lost in it.

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:44.420 align:middle line:84%
You become lost in the darkness,
you become lost in the joy.

00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, you
get lost in the drama.

00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:47.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:51.500 align:middle line:84%
>> But as you begin to
shift to fourth density,

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:55.880 align:middle line:84%
you start to have glimmers
of awareness, such as, oh,

00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:58.490 align:middle line:90%
this isn't really real.

00:45:58.490 --> 00:46:01.040 align:middle line:90%
It's not that it's not real.

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:02.520 align:middle line:90%
The chair is real.

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:08.180 align:middle line:84%
>> It's where you are putting
your consciousness actually

00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:11.760 align:middle line:84%
defines the reality
that you experience.

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:16.580 align:middle line:84%
So when you begin to
remember that you are playing

00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:19.670 align:middle line:84%
a role on a stage,
then you can actually

00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:23.690 align:middle line:84%
begin to cultivate a dual
awareness where a part of you

00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:28.040 align:middle line:84%
can also simultaneously be
in the audience watching,

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:31.790 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, the
play on the stage.

00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:32.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And this kind of dual level
of consciousness is the most

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:40.370 align:middle line:84%
important step in the
shift in consciousness,

00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:45.410 align:middle line:84%
because eventually you will
be able to maintain that more

00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:48.530 align:middle line:84%
birds-eye view, one
consciousness, so to speak,

00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:51.800 align:middle line:84%
watching the stage play for
longer and longer periods

00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:55.400 align:middle line:84%
of time, until you fully
understand in a visceral way

00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:58.730 align:middle line:84%
that you are that consciousness,
not the consciousness

00:46:58.730 --> 00:46:59.910 align:middle line:90%
on the stage.

00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:02.360 align:middle line:84%
So this is where
the individuals that

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:06.110 align:middle line:84%
are lost in the dramas
happening on Earth

00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:09.650 align:middle line:84%
will need to unlock from
that in their own time

00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:15.650 align:middle line:84%
to remember who they really
are in the more expansive level

00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:17.090 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:47:17.090 --> 00:47:21.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I like to use the
analogy of video games.

00:47:21.590 --> 00:47:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And in our mass media,
in our consciousness,

00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:27.530 align:middle line:84%
we're creating these
games to be so visceral,

00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:30.642 align:middle line:90%
but yet we are playing the game.

00:47:30.642 --> 00:47:32.850 align:middle line:84%
We're playing the character
moving through the movie.

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:34.950 align:middle line:84%
Before we'd go to the
movies, but now we're

00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:41.080 align:middle line:84%
actually integrating the virtual
reality experience, the game,

00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:44.260 align:middle line:84%
we're making the choices to
move the character along.

00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:45.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:47.190 align:middle line:84%
It is so interesting
that you have

00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:49.740 align:middle line:84%
created all of these
things on your world,

00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:50.710 align:middle line:90%
such as smartphones--

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:51.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:56.130 align:middle line:84%
>> --just to teach you
about layers of reality

00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:57.040 align:middle line:90%
and perception.

00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:57.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:01.320 align:middle line:84%
>> For when you get
lost in your smartphone,

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:04.840 align:middle line:84%
and 20 minutes have passed
that you have lost forever--

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:05.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:11.610 align:middle line:84%
>> --that is an example of being
lost on the role on the stage.

00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:18.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Lost in the
hyperfocus of the dark--

00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:19.050 align:middle line:90%
whatever it is.

00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:22.860 align:middle line:84%
You know, the demonizing
the serpent or the making

00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:24.380 align:middle line:90%
the symbols evil and--

00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:24.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>> --going on
these tangents of--

00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:26.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:26.580 align:middle line:90%
>> --fear.

00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:27.380 align:middle line:90%
Fear tangent.

00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:28.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:32.595 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, though, it's
fun to get lost in--

00:48:32.595 --> 00:48:36.120 align:middle line:84%
>> As long as you are aware that
you are doing it and you can

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:36.930 align:middle line:90%
step back--

00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:37.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>> --it's part of the experience
of the shift from third

00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:41.280 align:middle line:90%
to fourth density.

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:42.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:44.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Eventually, deeper and
deeper into fourth density,

00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:46.890 align:middle line:84%
you don't get pulled
into that anymore.

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:50.630 align:middle line:90%
Reality becomes very different.

00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Could you explain a
little bit this reality?

00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:55.840 align:middle line:84%
The polarity game,
the mystery schools,

00:48:55.840 --> 00:49:00.400 align:middle line:84%
the dark and integrating
that in the relationship,

00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:05.140 align:middle line:84%
or similarities that Earth
now is having during this time

00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:10.090 align:middle line:84%
I guess that Sirius also had
to integrate its darker self--

00:49:10.090 --> 00:49:10.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:49:10.890 --> 00:49:12.040 align:middle line:90%
>> --in relationships.

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>> There is definitely
a parallel between where

00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:19.750 align:middle line:84%
your planet is at right now
in its integration process

00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:24.490 align:middle line:84%
and where my civilization
was during the similar time

00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:27.500 align:middle line:84%
of our shift between
third and fourth density.

00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:30.460 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of
the reasons why

00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:33.640 align:middle line:84%
for us to guide you
at this point in time

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:35.830 align:middle line:90%
is very appropriate.

00:49:35.830 --> 00:49:40.940 align:middle line:84%
So we were talking about
how the group in Japan

00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:43.010 align:middle line:84%
was the first group to
receive the information

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:45.740 align:middle line:84%
about the dark Sirian
energy, and it triggered

00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:50.270 align:middle line:84%
the memory of the mystery
schools that were painful

00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:53.480 align:middle line:84%
experiences people
had had in the past.

00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:56.060 align:middle line:84%
It is not that you
need to remember

00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:58.920 align:middle line:90%
all of these dark experiences.

00:49:58.920 --> 00:49:59.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Simply, though, if there is
a type of a wound that has to do

00:50:04.610 --> 00:50:08.690 align:middle line:84%
with victimization or has
to do with self-forgiveness

00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:11.930 align:middle line:84%
for making choices
that you have made,

00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:15.170 align:middle line:84%
this is the time to
begin working on that,

00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:20.900 align:middle line:84%
for you have to step off the
victim/perpetrator polarity

00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:22.180 align:middle line:90%
game, so to speak.

00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:23.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we were talking
about earlier, where we're

00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:31.910 align:middle line:84%
trying to hyperfocus on
the evil deeds, so to say,

00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:34.520 align:middle line:84%
that taking the
focus off of that

00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:38.090 align:middle line:84%
is sort of switching
from the polarization

00:50:38.090 --> 00:50:40.250 align:middle line:90%
to a non-polarized.

00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:42.910 align:middle line:84%
Acknowledge it for what it is,
but not get caught up in it.

00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:44.120 align:middle line:84%
I guess that's what
I'm trying to say.

00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:44.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:47.270 align:middle line:84%
You can acknowledge it
because, as you know,

00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:51.330 align:middle line:84%
repressing things only builds
up the energy charge inside.

00:50:51.330 --> 00:50:52.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's a very fine line
between noticing something is

00:50:56.300 --> 00:51:02.100 align:middle line:84%
there and refusing to
see it or really, really,

00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:03.890 align:middle line:90%
really focusing on it, yes?

00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:06.170 align:middle line:84%
If you really, really,
really focus on it,

00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:07.550 align:middle line:90%
you create more of the same.

00:51:07.550 --> 00:51:08.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:51:08.350 --> 00:51:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>> If you repress it, you create
the energy charge within you

00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:13.680 align:middle line:90%
that needs to be dealt with.

00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:15.920 align:middle line:84%
So then the only
choice is the middle

00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:20.480 align:middle line:84%
of the road, so to speak, which
is you can notice it is there,

00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:22.520 align:middle line:84%
but you do not
give it any energy.

00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Or if there is
something within you

00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:27.410 align:middle line:84%
that needs to be
healed regarding that,

00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:31.590 align:middle line:84%
that healing will come from
your embracing the experience,

00:51:31.590 --> 00:51:33.950 align:middle line:84%
learning from the
experience that you've had,

00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:38.480 align:middle line:84%
not judging it, and learning
from that experience in such

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:41.010 align:middle line:84%
a way that the energy
itself can be released.

00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:41.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's everything
in life, from--

00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:44.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Everything.

00:51:44.310 --> 00:51:49.120 align:middle line:84%
>> All of these situations
to relationships to traumas

00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:50.870 align:middle line:90%
to, you know, everything.

00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:52.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful.

00:51:53.680 --> 00:52:00.590 align:middle line:84%
The snake is definitely a symbol
of the Sirius energy, which

00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:03.080 align:middle line:84%
we've already
established, but often we

00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:08.030 align:middle line:84%
have this Sirian gate in
the summertime, in July.

00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's associated
with the dog star--

00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:52:11.470 --> 00:52:14.510 align:middle line:90%
>> --the dog energy.

00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:17.710 align:middle line:84%
Could you elaborate a little
bit more on the dog energy?

00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Simply the way that we
would interpret that is that,

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:26.720 align:middle line:84%
for humans, the dog is the being
in the animal kingdom that is

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:29.390 align:middle line:90%
of the most service to humanity.

00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And the Sirian energy, in a
sense, plays the same role.

00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Not that we are
dogs, so to speak,

00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:41.030 align:middle line:84%
but that our love and
loyalty and commitment to you

00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:43.430 align:middle line:84%
is the same, which
is one of the reasons

00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:50.190 align:middle line:84%
why that imagery was associated
with us, because of our--

00:52:50.190 --> 00:52:54.020 align:middle line:84%
well, some would say
in the past tenacity,

00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:56.990 align:middle line:84%
but we have grown
and evolved, too.

00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:59.450 align:middle line:84%
So now we walk side
by side with you,

00:52:59.450 --> 00:53:03.050 align:middle line:84%
rather than dragging you
on a leash, so to speak.

00:53:03.050 --> 00:53:04.415 align:middle line:90%
A little Sirian humor.

00:53:04.415 --> 00:53:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So we would be the
dogs in that situation.

00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:07.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:07.090 --> 00:53:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, what goes around
comes around, yes?

00:53:09.130 --> 00:53:09.950 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:10.850 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:14.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, another animal that's also
associated with Sirius energy

00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:17.300 align:middle line:90%
is the dolphin.

00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And what's the
relationship there,

00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:24.610 align:middle line:84%
and how is that connected
to Sirius energy?

00:53:24.610 --> 00:53:26.360 align:middle line:84%
So we would be the
dogs in that situation.

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:27.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:29.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, what goes around
comes around, yes?

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:30.000 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:30.920 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:34.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, another animal that's also
associated with Sirius energy

00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:37.340 align:middle line:90%
is the dolphin.

00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And what's the
relationship there,

00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:44.850 align:middle line:84%
and how is that connected
to Sirius energy?

00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a little bit
esoteric, we have to say.

00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:48.030 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Because from
our point of view,

00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:53.840 align:middle line:84%
actually the whales have a
stronger Sirian connection with

00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:55.490 align:middle line:90%
you than the dolphins do.

00:53:55.490 --> 00:53:57.180 align:middle line:90%
But let us explain what we mean.

00:53:57.180 --> 00:53:58.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:58.610 --> 00:54:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>> The dolphin energy on your
world is a way to introduce you

00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:09.080 align:middle line:84%
to fourth density consciousness
from an indigenous species

00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:11.210 align:middle line:90%
on your planet.

00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:13.910 align:middle line:84%
The dolphin
consciousness itself,

00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:18.200 align:middle line:84%
their experience of reality is
very much of a fourth density

00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:19.370 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:54:19.370 --> 00:54:22.580 align:middle line:84%
However, it is still
singular, meaning

00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:24.950 align:middle line:84%
that, just as you have
one body, so to speak,

00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:27.500 align:middle line:84%
that you are aware of
animating this reality,

00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:31.920 align:middle line:84%
the dolphin reality
is very similar.

00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:37.340 align:middle line:84%
However, the whale energy
represents your beginnings

00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:39.060 align:middle line:84%
into fifth density
consciousness,

00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:42.090 align:middle line:84%
which represents more group,
the beginning of group

00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:43.500 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, when you
associate the Sirian energy

00:54:50.130 --> 00:54:54.480 align:middle line:84%
with the whale consciousness,
it is a way for humanity

00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:57.930 align:middle line:84%
not only to, of course, become
accustomed to fourth density

00:54:57.930 --> 00:55:00.480 align:middle line:84%
energy, but also
begin to, in a sense,

00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:05.440 align:middle line:84%
dip your toe into fifth density
group consciousness, as well,

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:08.130 align:middle line:84%
which really is
necessary to fully

00:55:08.130 --> 00:55:10.620 align:middle line:84%
be able to embrace fourth
density consciousness,

00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:12.870 align:middle line:84%
because you have
to kind of also be

00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:15.570 align:middle line:84%
comfortable with the idea
of heading toward group

00:55:15.570 --> 00:55:16.940 align:middle line:90%
consciousness, as well.

00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:17.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Hm.

00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:19.390 align:middle line:90%
In what way?

00:55:19.390 --> 00:55:24.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, us humans would probably
look at dolphins and whales

00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:28.200 align:middle line:84%
as being almost the same,
other than the size,

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:30.285 align:middle line:84%
as far as being aquatic
creatures, mammals.

00:55:30.285 --> 00:55:33.120 align:middle line:90%


00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:36.115 align:middle line:84%
What's the difference
there between the dolphin

00:55:36.115 --> 00:55:36.990 align:middle line:90%
and the whale energy?

00:55:36.990 --> 00:55:43.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Whale beings actually can
embody group consciousness.

00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So it might
sound very mundane,

00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:52.050 align:middle line:84%
but it's one of the reasons
why their bodies are so large,

00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:57.840 align:middle line:84%
as a way to be able to ground
such an intense energy and have

00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:03.810 align:middle line:84%
the brain size as a way to
be able to have that conduit

00:56:03.810 --> 00:56:06.030 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness that can
be channeled, in a sense,

00:56:06.030 --> 00:56:07.890 align:middle line:90%
into the physical reality.

00:56:07.890 --> 00:56:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>> So in a way,
they're living portals?

00:56:10.050 --> 00:56:11.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Grounding that Sirian
energy in the planet?

00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:15.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:18.270 align:middle line:84%
However, when we
say Sirian energy,

00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:19.810 align:middle line:84%
we are talking, in
terms of whale--

00:56:19.810 --> 00:56:20.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>> --we are talking more
specifically of what we have

00:56:23.370 --> 00:56:27.810 align:middle line:84%
termed Third Era Sirian, which
is well after the awakening.

00:56:27.810 --> 00:56:33.600 align:middle line:84%
So it's not singular embodied
Sirian energy any longer.

00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:37.050 align:middle line:84%
It's moving more into the
awakened group consciousness

00:56:37.050 --> 00:56:37.980 align:middle line:90%
Sirian energy.

00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:39.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Almost more advanced.

00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:46.320 align:middle line:84%
As you guys are upper level or
upper echelon fourth density

00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:49.470 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, humanity
is just starting

00:56:49.470 --> 00:56:50.985 align:middle line:90%
to touch the fourth density.

00:56:50.985 --> 00:56:54.960 align:middle line:90%


00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:56.880 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like you
guys have an awareness

00:56:56.880 --> 00:57:00.510 align:middle line:84%
of these different
versions of Sirius

00:57:00.510 --> 00:57:02.880 align:middle line:90%
energy, these different tiers.

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Will humans then start to
interact with future versions

00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:07.942 align:middle line:90%
of ourselves?

00:57:07.942 --> 00:57:09.025 align:middle line:90%
>> It's already happening.

00:57:09.025 --> 00:57:10.108 align:middle line:90%
>> It's already happening.

00:57:10.108 --> 00:57:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>> It is already
happening for sure.

00:57:13.170 --> 00:57:17.970 align:middle line:84%
This idea of the
different eras was

00:57:17.970 --> 00:57:20.430 align:middle line:84%
expressed through the
galactic heritage cards

00:57:20.430 --> 00:57:23.850 align:middle line:84%
to show three different
eras of a civilization.

00:57:23.850 --> 00:57:26.040 align:middle line:84%
So you have the
first era, which is

00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:31.140 align:middle line:84%
more of the third density,
polarized, child-like or young

00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:32.130 align:middle line:90%
species.

00:57:32.130 --> 00:57:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Second era is when the
awakening just starts to happen,

00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:39.400 align:middle line:84%
the healing and the
integration starts happening,

00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:40.750 align:middle line:90%
which is where humanity is now.

00:57:40.750 --> 00:57:41.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:57:41.550 --> 00:57:44.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Third era is
the awakened era.

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:48.000 align:middle line:84%
So once you begin to
enter the second era

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:51.860 align:middle line:84%
and you start opening your
consciousness more to the idea

00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:55.470 align:middle line:84%
that you are part of
a holographic reality,

00:57:55.470 --> 00:57:59.520 align:middle line:84%
then the natural next step is
that you start encountering

00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:02.920 align:middle line:90%
other aspects of you.

00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:08.330 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's ETs or
future humans matters not.

00:58:08.330 --> 00:58:09.330 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:58:09.330 --> 00:58:11.230 align:middle line:90%
So a lot to look forward to.

00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:12.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:58:12.030 --> 00:58:14.820 align:middle line:90%


00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:18.900 align:middle line:84%
>> The Japanese people
themselves seem to have

00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:20.970 align:middle line:90%
a strong Sirian connection.

00:58:20.970 --> 00:58:22.500 align:middle line:90%
Could you elaborate on that?

00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Do they have more
of a connection

00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:25.950 align:middle line:84%
than, say, some
of the other races

00:58:25.950 --> 00:58:29.790 align:middle line:90%
or ethnic groups on our planet?

00:58:29.790 --> 00:58:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The Japanese do not
have more of a connection.

00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:36.810 align:middle line:84%
What you're sensing is that,
because many of these students

00:58:36.810 --> 00:58:38.740 align:middle line:84%
have worked with
Lyssa many times--

00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:39.540 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:42.040 align:middle line:84%
>> --that they're already
kind of primed to that energy.

00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:42.840 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>> But one of the reasons why
this information was given

00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:52.350 align:middle line:84%
in Japan first has to do with,
going back to what we were

00:58:52.350 --> 00:58:55.275 align:middle line:84%
talking about in terms of
School of the Nine Serpents--

00:58:55.275 --> 00:58:56.100 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:58:56.100 --> 00:58:59.370 align:middle line:84%
>> --there were many of
those schools within Asia,

00:58:59.370 --> 00:59:01.750 align:middle line:84%
and many within
what is now Japan.

00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:02.550 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:59:02.550 --> 00:59:04.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's more of an
Asian conscious--

00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:08.100 align:middle line:90%
maybe that collective--

00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:10.180 align:middle line:90%
Asian collective consciousness?

00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:14.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Well there were schools
also all around the planet--

00:59:14.130 --> 00:59:17.550 align:middle line:84%
South America, North
America, Africa, et cetera--

00:59:17.550 --> 00:59:21.660 align:middle line:84%
but because of the specific
group we were working with,

00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:24.060 align:middle line:84%
many of them were
connected to that energy.

00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:25.960 align:middle line:90%
>> I understand.

00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And many of Lyssa's
students in Japan

00:59:29.490 --> 00:59:32.010 align:middle line:84%
have spoken about
channeling Hamon, as well,

00:59:32.010 --> 00:59:34.890 align:middle line:90%
this pure energy.

00:59:34.890 --> 00:59:40.510 align:middle line:84%

with our energy for very

00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:41.310 align:middle line:90%
specific purposes--

00:59:41.310 --> 00:59:42.110 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:43.810 align:middle line:90%

00:59:43.810 --> 00:59:44.610 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:59:44.610 --> 00:59:47.580 align:middle line:84%
>> We're not, you know,
flying around connecting with

00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:48.950 align:middle line:90%
everyone, so to speak.

00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And we don't mean that
in an elitist way.

00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:53.550 align:middle line:84%
It's just simply that we are
working with different people

00:59:53.550 --> 00:59:54.540 align:middle line:90%
with different things.

00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:56.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Understood.

00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:58.200 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for your time.

00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Would there be any last final
messages for this audience

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:05.815 align:middle line:90%
as it's growing in humanity?

01:00:05.815 --> 01:00:08.670 align:middle line:90%


01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:11.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there are
so many messages.

01:00:11.770 --> 01:00:12.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:00:12.570 --> 01:00:13.900 align:middle line:90%
And we covered a lot today.

01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:14.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:00:14.970 --> 01:00:20.430 align:middle line:84%
But we want to say that we know
that there is a lot happening

01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:24.100 align:middle line:84%
on the world that is causing
a lot of fear and panic

01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:29.940 align:middle line:84%
and distaste, let's say,
for humanity at this time,

01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:33.410 align:middle line:84%
and the sense of not
knowing what can be done.

01:00:33.410 --> 01:00:35.640 align:middle line:84%
It's going to seem
like a paradox,

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:40.050 align:middle line:84%
but what needs to
be done is to begin

01:00:40.050 --> 01:00:46.600 align:middle line:84%
to cultivate the idea of letting
go and not doing out there,

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:52.980 align:middle line:84%
but going inward now, for the
landscape on which to work

01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:54.810 align:middle line:90%
is now inward.

01:00:54.810 --> 01:00:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to start to
see that this is much more

01:00:58.050 --> 01:01:01.710 align:middle line:84%
than just a platitude,
but it actually

01:01:01.710 --> 01:01:05.640 align:middle line:84%
is going to change the
consciousness of your planet

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:10.380 align:middle line:84%
when you go inward and address
the things inward that have not

01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:14.340 align:middle line:84%
been addressed up until this
time on the individual level,

01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:19.530 align:middle line:84%
because ultimately, you are
all fractals of one hologram,

01:01:19.530 --> 01:01:23.550 align:middle line:84%
and so everything
everyone is experiencing

01:01:23.550 --> 01:01:26.250 align:middle line:90%
is felt by the whole hologram.

01:01:26.250 --> 01:01:29.190 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, when
you do your part,

01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:31.500 align:middle line:90%
the entire hologram is affected.

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:33.450 align:middle line:90%
This is, again, not a platitude.

01:01:33.450 --> 01:01:35.730 align:middle line:90%
It's literal mechanics.

01:01:35.730 --> 01:01:37.590 align:middle line:90%
So we are here.

01:01:37.590 --> 01:01:41.190 align:middle line:84%
Your Sirian friends are here,
and many, many other friends

01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:43.350 align:middle line:84%
are here to assist
you with this,

01:01:43.350 --> 01:01:47.340 align:middle line:84%
whether it is to give you
a hug or hold your hand

01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:54.300 align:middle line:84%
and say go for it, or simply
to send the love to you

01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:57.250 align:middle line:84%
to give you the strength
to move forward.

01:01:57.250 --> 01:02:00.010 align:middle line:84%
My people have
been through this.

01:02:00.010 --> 01:02:01.140 align:middle line:90%
We know.

01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And we do know, unfortunately,
that all we can do

01:02:05.250 --> 01:02:08.190 align:middle line:84%
is support you and
love you through it.

01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:11.940 align:middle line:84%
But with that support and
love, and with your fortitude

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:15.600 align:middle line:84%
and your amazing
character as human beings,

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:19.020 align:middle line:84%
you will do what is needed,
and you will, in fact,

01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:25.260 align:middle line:84%
create that reality of love,
harmony, and peace that you

01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:31.900 align:middle line:84%
seek on your world as long as
first is cultivated within.

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:35.890 align:middle line:84%
Much love to you, and thank
you once again for the project

01:02:35.890 --> 01:02:38.480 align:middle line:84%
you are doing that
assists so many.

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:41.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, thank you for your
assistance and for your love.

01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:48.220 align:middle line:84%
It's much felt. And continuing
this journey together.

thousands of years

01:03:34.570 --> 01:03:37.960 align:middle line:84%
since we sat with
humans around this lake.

01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And in those ancient times, we
talked of the times to come,

01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:51.090 align:middle line:84%
where humanity would
forget who they were.

01:03:51.090 --> 01:03:57.480 align:middle line:90%


01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:00.180 align:middle line:90%

to watch the grass grow.

01:04:14.570 --> 01:04:18.320 align:middle line:84%

your love for this planet.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And here we are now,
thousands of years

01:04:26.450 --> 01:04:36.740 align:middle line:84%
in the future from that time,
once again sitting by the lake.

that you planted then,

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:50.335 align:middle line:90%
they now are sprouting.

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:58.630 align:middle line:84%

to the remembrance

01:04:58.630 --> 01:04:59.660 align:middle line:90%

Beyond identity,
beyond nationality,

01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:20.266 align:middle line:84%
beyond planetary identity,
but simply part of the one.

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:36.110 align:middle line:84%
may still be a long
one, as we sense it,
