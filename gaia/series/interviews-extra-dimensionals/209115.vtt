I felt a deep

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.490 align:middle line:84%
It's like an ancient knowing,

sometimes my legs will move.

from the top of my head,
and straight into my heart.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like an energy
surge that I can't control.

So I just have to go with it.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.240 align:middle line:84%

and get out of the

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And as we step through
those boundaries,

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.900 align:middle line:84%
we move into a new paradigm,

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.400 align:middle line:90%
to fresh new energies.

00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:16.730 align:middle line:10%
so much on the
world right now is

00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:22.490 align:middle line:10%
because it can be a
tool that if embraced,

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:28.700 align:middle line:10%
can introduce a malleability
to the consciousness

00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:32.420 align:middle line:10%
beyond the rigidity of the mind.

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:37.280 align:middle line:84%
It requires those who
are utilizing that tool

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:42.620 align:middle line:84%
to really surrender
to the process, which

00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:45.890 align:middle line:90%
is very difficult for the ego.

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
makes it so powerful,

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:53.060 align:middle line:84%
because it trains
the ego to let go

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:55.880 align:middle line:84%
to a more fluid state
of consciousness

00:42:55.880 --> 00:43:00.860 align:middle line:84%
through which the actual
true essence of the universe

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:02.600 align:middle line:90%
can come through.

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:03.780 align:middle line:90%
Does this make sense?

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:05.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, beautiful explanation.

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:06.200 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:06.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:08.222 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for your patience.

00:43:08.222 --> 00:43:09.620 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:29.358 align:middle line:90%


00:43:29.358 --> 00:43:30.775 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, team
light language.

00:43:30.775 --> 00:43:35.110 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHING] It's the name
that you've sort of adopted,

00:43:35.110 --> 00:43:36.850 align:middle line:90%
or I've given you guys.

00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:40.100 align:middle line:84%
We just got back from
Lisa's contact retreat,

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:43.540 align:middle line:84%
and it was an
amazing experience.

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And you all had a
great time, right?

00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:47.155 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:43:47.155 --> 00:43:48.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Phenomenal.

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:51.340 align:middle line:10%
So let's start with Bobbie.

00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:52.930 align:middle line:90%
What got you into this?

00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:55.000 align:middle line:84%
What got you into
light language?

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.570 align:middle line:84%
- All right, light language,
I took a channeling class.

00:43:58.570 --> 00:44:01.330 align:middle line:84%
It was Lisa's first channeling
class in the states--

00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:02.890 align:middle line:90%
no, second, I'm sorry.

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And I was very interested
in the integration,

00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:09.940 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily
channeling per se,

00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:13.420 align:middle line:84%
but I was interested in getting
in touch with my own higher

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:14.390 align:middle line:90%
self.

00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And when I took
the class, I felt

00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:21.070 align:middle line:90%
an energy coming through me.

00:44:21.070 --> 00:44:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And my hands were
just going wild,

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:26.050 align:middle line:84%
and then they wanted
to start moving.

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:28.390 align:middle line:90%
So I started signaling, right?

00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:32.390 align:middle line:84%
Then after that, I just
kept asking myself,

00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:36.850 align:middle line:90%
I wonder if I could speak.

00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:38.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Speak like in a
channeling sense?

00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:40.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Speak in light language, yes.

00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:42.705 align:middle line:90%
And this is after much practice.

00:44:42.705 --> 00:44:44.080 align:middle line:84%
>> So not necessarily
channeling,

00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:45.370 align:middle line:84%
but actually speaking
light language.

00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:47.703 align:middle line:84%
>> Speaking light language,
because I knew that the hand

00:44:47.703 --> 00:44:49.090 align:middle line:90%
symbols were light language.

00:44:49.090 --> 00:44:50.155 align:middle line:90%
>> Precursors to that.

00:44:50.155 --> 00:44:51.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:52.600 align:middle line:90%
And so then I did.

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:54.610 align:middle line:90%
I first started with gibberish.

00:44:54.610 --> 00:44:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And then the gibberish
turned into something

00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:00.880 align:middle line:84%
that I knew was not
gibberish, but I really

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:03.160 align:middle line:90%
couldn't understand what it was.

00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:05.210 align:middle line:84%
So I played with
that for some time.

00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought, I wonder if
I could write light language?

00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:11.540 align:middle line:90%
And I actually could.

00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:14.080 align:middle line:84%
So I just asked myself
the possibilities,

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:16.150 align:middle line:90%
and it just manifested.

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:18.760 align:middle line:90%
I asked could I possibly sing?

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:20.080 align:middle line:90%
And I can actually sing.

00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:23.680 align:middle line:84%
So it was just an energy
that came through, just

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:26.530 align:middle line:90%
a powerful, powerful energy.

00:45:26.530 --> 00:45:28.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Harry, how about yourself?

00:45:28.090 --> 00:45:32.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I do remember
playing with this as a child,

00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:34.540 align:middle line:10%
not really knowing what it was.

00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:36.100 align:middle line:10%
But I remember
going out in nature,

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:38.680 align:middle line:10%
and just kind of using my hands,
and talking what I thought

00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:41.140 align:middle line:10%
was just making up
language, but communicating

00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:43.060 align:middle line:10%
with plants and animals.

00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And I just knew that there
was a deep connection when

00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:48.280 align:middle line:84%
I did that, but I didn't
really understand it.

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:54.078 align:middle line:84%
And recently I read Jamye
Price's book on light language,

00:45:54.078 --> 00:45:55.870 align:middle line:84%
and started playing
with that a little bit.

00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:57.880 align:middle line:84%
Although, it was in the
dark room with the door

00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:59.620 align:middle line:90%
closed by myself.

00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:00.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, sure.

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And then I took Lisa's
channeling class,

00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:06.170 align:middle line:84%
and that helped me step
forward a little bit more.

00:46:06.170 --> 00:46:09.543 align:middle line:84%
And then with Bobbie
practicing the light language,

00:46:09.543 --> 00:46:11.210 align:middle line:84%
then we kind of would
practice together.

00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And so it's kind of
evolved from that.

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And we saw you guys
have a conversation.

00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:17.542 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:46:17.542 --> 00:46:19.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And because
Rica-San translated.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.167 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that was wonderful.

00:46:20.167 --> 00:46:22.035 align:middle line:90%
>> That was very powerful.

00:46:22.035 --> 00:46:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Good to have
it in the family.

00:46:23.410 --> 00:46:24.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:25.490 align:middle line:90%
Right, it helps.

00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:26.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:46:26.830 --> 00:46:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And Michelle, how
about yourself?

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:33.050 align:middle line:84%
>> So my light language kind
of started through osmosis with

00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:33.850 align:middle line:90%
Bobbie.

00:46:33.850 --> 00:46:36.910 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting next to her, and
she was doing light language.

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I could
feel the energy coming at me.

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And I understood
what she was saying.

00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And it was just gibberish,
but I could feel the energy.

00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And I turned around to
her and said, oh my gosh,

00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:53.530 align:middle line:90%
I understand what you're saying.

00:46:53.530 --> 00:46:56.890 align:middle line:90%
And that's how I got into it.

00:46:56.890 --> 00:46:58.150 align:middle line:90%
I borrowed her book.

00:46:58.150 --> 00:47:01.630 align:middle line:84%
She had the Light Language
book that Jamye Price wrote.

00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And I read it, and it
had some great tips

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:05.570 align:middle line:90%
on how to get started.

00:47:05.570 --> 00:47:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And I started
experimenting that way.

00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:11.680 align:middle line:84%
I started trying to write
it, and it was just flowing.

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:13.670 align:middle line:84%
>> And so you started
writing the symbols?

00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:15.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and then we would just
get together and experiment

00:47:18.850 --> 00:47:23.710 align:middle line:84%
with it with each other,
and just allow it to flow.

00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:24.722 align:middle line:90%
That's how it started.

00:47:24.722 --> 00:47:25.930 align:middle line:90%
It was just from experiments.

00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Around the same
time, about a year ago?

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:27.520 align:middle line:90%
>> It was.

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:30.590 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it started a
year and a half ago.

00:47:30.590 --> 00:47:35.490 align:middle line:84%
We were all in Lisa's
channeling class.

00:47:35.490 --> 00:47:36.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Sol?

00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:38.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, my story is
a little bit longer.

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:42.820 align:middle line:90%
I went to Peru in 1995.

00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And there were four of us
on kind of a long adventure.

00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:50.260 align:middle line:84%
So we went to Sillustani,
which is a ancient burial

00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:53.380 align:middle line:84%
ground of the Inca, but we
found out the burial ground

00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:56.320 align:middle line:84%
was more pre-Incan,
about 740 years

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.550 align:middle line:90%
before the time of Christ.

00:47:57.550 --> 00:48:01.450 align:middle line:84%
So there was a burial
stone and I was guided.

00:48:01.450 --> 00:48:03.130 align:middle line:90%
It had a snake on the top of it.

00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:05.410 align:middle line:84%
I was guided to put my
hands and my forehead on it.

00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And after that, I started
speaking the language.

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:10.845 align:middle line:84%
And all the way for the rest
of the trip I started speaking.

00:48:10.845 --> 00:48:12.220 align:middle line:84%
Heaven knows what
I was speaking,

00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:13.280 align:middle line:90%
but I was speaking it.

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And when I got
back to the States,

00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:17.560 align:middle line:84%
the writing started
coming through,

00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:20.920 align:middle line:84%
and I wrote different
versions of languages I guess.

00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:24.730 align:middle line:84%
So I started a search
to discover what it was,

00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:26.530 align:middle line:84%
because I spoke it
and sang it in my car.

00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:28.260 align:middle line:90%
And they said, you're not crazy.

00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:30.260 align:middle line:84%
We don't think you're
crazy, but we have no idea

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:31.360 align:middle line:90%
what you're speaking of.

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And I finally found
someone that told me

00:48:33.650 --> 00:48:37.315 align:middle line:84%
that there would be a time
where I would meet others that

00:48:37.315 --> 00:48:38.690 align:middle line:84%
could speak it,
and we would know

00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:40.110 align:middle line:90%
what we were speaking together.

00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:43.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very heart
thing coming together

00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:45.080 align:middle line:84%
with people that now
were exploring it.

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:47.990 align:middle line:84%
So I have only done it
for myself personally.

00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:49.370 align:middle line:90%
I speak in my car.

00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And I prayed, because I
found out in the Bible

00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:54.435 align:middle line:84%
they talk about
speaking in tongue

00:48:54.435 --> 00:48:56.060 align:middle line:84%
is one of the gifts
of the Holy Spirit,

00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:59.510 align:middle line:84%
and also translating is one of
the gifts of the Holy Spirit.

00:48:59.510 --> 00:49:02.030 align:middle line:84%
So now with the
divine feminine coming

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:04.970 align:middle line:84%
through more, which
is the Holy Spirit,

00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:06.480 align:middle line:90%
it's coming out more and more.

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:07.940 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very grateful
for this time.

00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:12.360 align:middle line:84%
But I prayed, and I got to
be able to translate it.

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:15.050 align:middle line:84%
They would give me a download,
and I would speak the language,

00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:16.467 align:middle line:84%
and then we'd get
the translation,

00:49:16.467 --> 00:49:18.590 align:middle line:84%
but nothing like in
the contact retreat

00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:21.180 align:middle line:84%
where she was able to
translate it right away.

00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:22.320 align:middle line:90%
So that was a gift for me.

00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:23.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And how long ago
was this experience

00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:28.123 align:middle line:90%
with the serpent stone.

00:49:28.123 --> 00:49:30.420 align:middle line:10%
>> 1995, so it's
been a long time ago.

00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:34.250 align:middle line:84%
So I've been very
closeted for many years

00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:35.850 align:middle line:90%
waiting for this time to come.

00:49:35.850 --> 00:49:36.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:38.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you
for coming forward.

00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:39.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:42.080 align:middle line:84%
>> This is definitely an
exciting time being witness

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:48.030 align:middle line:84%
to this, and just having spoken
with Jamye yesterday she said,

00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:50.305 align:middle line:90%
just every year--

00:49:50.305 --> 00:49:52.430 align:middle line:84%
well, especially the past
I guess one or two years,

00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:56.180 align:middle line:84%
it's really exploded
exponentially, the number

00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:58.020 align:middle line:90%
of people coming through.

00:49:58.020 --> 00:49:58.820 align:middle line:90%
We're in Sedona.

00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:03.080 align:middle line:84%
We had a light language
conference, I guess.

00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:04.370 align:middle line:90%
Did you guys know about that?

00:50:04.370 --> 00:50:05.170 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, well, next time,
you got to go here.

00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:10.430 align:middle line:84%
So thank you all
for coming forward.

00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:11.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:14.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think you're
by doing this interview,

00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:17.810 align:middle line:84%
you're helping others who
are still in the closet

00:50:17.810 --> 00:50:19.865 align:middle line:90%
so to speak, in coming forward.

00:50:19.865 --> 00:50:23.430 align:middle line:90%


00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:28.790 align:middle line:84%
Sol, when you feel the
transmissions afterwards,

00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:33.560 align:middle line:84%
for example, does
it very every time?

00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>> In terms of I get
the light language,

00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:38.473 align:middle line:84%
and then what they
do is they get--

00:50:38.473 --> 00:50:40.640 align:middle line:84%
it's sort of like the cliff
notes if you're studying

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:45.080 align:middle line:84%
a volume of books, the language
translation is more of a cliff

00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:48.248 align:middle line:84%
note version, where you
can't really translate it,

00:50:48.248 --> 00:50:49.790 align:middle line:84%
where people say
you can't translate,

00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:51.748 align:middle line:84%
you really can't translate,
because it's sound,

00:50:51.748 --> 00:50:55.100 align:middle line:84%
and frequency, and color, and
different vibrational octaves.

00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:57.740 align:middle line:84%
But the translation is
more for the logical mind.

00:50:57.740 --> 00:50:59.850 align:middle line:84%
The logical mind needs
something to relate to.

00:50:59.850 --> 00:51:03.890 align:middle line:84%
So it helps I think, the body
bridge those two realities.

00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:05.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:06.470 align:middle line:90%
And Bobbie, how about you?

00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:12.080 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel-- emotionally, what
are you feeling when or after?

00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:14.040 align:middle line:90%
Or how does it-- what happens?

00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I feel a lot of energy
coming down through my crown

00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:18.680 align:middle line:90%
chakra.

00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And I just-- a lot
of heart, there's

00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:26.990 align:middle line:84%
a lot of heart
feeling between me.

00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And I try to pick up like if
I'm channeling for someone,

00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:33.720 align:middle line:84%
try to pick up the vibration so
that we can make a connection.

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, I like
to do a one-on-one more,

00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:39.710 align:middle line:84%
because it's more
effective I feel

00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:42.890 align:middle line:84%
for me, and for the person
who I'm channeling for.

00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:48.710 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of also can respond to
the person I'm channeling for.

00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:51.270 align:middle line:84%
So there's a really
strong connection.

00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:52.070 align:middle line:90%
>> And it varies?

00:51:52.070 --> 00:51:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>> It totally varies
from person to person.

00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:55.730 align:middle line:90%
>> That you're channeling for.

00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:51:56.870 --> 00:52:03.190 align:middle line:84%
>> When you say channeling for,
have you done this for people

00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:03.990 align:middle line:90%
then?

00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:04.520 align:middle line:90%
You've channeled?

00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:05.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>> And what for, I guess?

00:52:07.890 --> 00:52:08.690 align:middle line:90%
In what sense?

00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:11.480 align:middle line:90%
Do people ask for healings?

00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:13.315 align:middle line:84%
>> We haven't really
gotten into that.

00:52:13.315 --> 00:52:14.690 align:middle line:84%
We're just still
kind of playing.

00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:19.040 align:middle line:84%
It's just more of an experiment,
and experiencing with friends,

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:21.870 align:middle line:84%
and things like that,
just to, I think,

00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:24.630 align:middle line:90%
understand it more for myself.

00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:25.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And I guess every
time you do it,

00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:28.525 align:middle line:84%
you're getting
deeper and deeper.

00:52:28.525 --> 00:52:29.325 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:52:29.325 --> 00:52:30.125 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:52:30.125 --> 00:52:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:34.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Harry, how about you?

00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:39.830 align:middle line:84%
When it comes through, is
there an application for it?

00:52:39.830 --> 00:52:42.770 align:middle line:90%
Or is it just spontaneous?

00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:45.080 align:middle line:84%
>> It's usually
pretty spontaneous.

00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:48.115 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's always
a very deep feeling.

00:52:48.115 --> 00:52:50.490 align:middle line:84%
I usually have tears in my
eyes when it's coming through,

00:52:50.490 --> 00:52:52.910 align:middle line:90%
which I think is fairly common.

00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:57.350 align:middle line:84%
But it's very deep,
emotive feelings.

00:52:57.350 --> 00:53:02.960 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be very
multi-dimensional in that it's

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:05.690 align:middle line:84%
very difficult to
put any words on it.

00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:08.120 align:middle line:84%
There might be some concepts
that you get with it,

00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:09.310 align:middle line:90%
or I get with it.

00:53:09.310 --> 00:53:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>> What are some of the concepts
maybe that you've received?

00:53:11.810 --> 00:53:17.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, maybe like very
ancient history of maybe that

00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:19.970 align:middle line:90%
person's being.

00:53:19.970 --> 00:53:22.750 align:middle line:90%


00:53:22.750 --> 00:53:23.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:53:23.570 --> 00:53:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, Rica did--
particularly with you,

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.877 align:middle line:84%
say there was an ancient
wisdom, an ancient--

00:53:28.877 --> 00:53:29.960 align:middle line:90%
>> She did say that, yeah.

00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:31.770 align:middle line:84%
>> This ancient
entity coming through.

00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:32.570 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:53:32.570 --> 00:53:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And Michelle, we didn't really
have in our little channeling

00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:38.900 align:middle line:84%
circle, you were present,
and I kept looking over.

00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, I think
she wants to say something.

00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know you were part
of this group at that time.

00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:46.160 align:middle line:90%
How about you?

00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:51.800 align:middle line:84%
When you do it at home, or with
friends, what kind of messages

00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:53.960 align:middle line:84%
are you receiving, or
emotions are you feeling?

00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>> When it comes through,
I feel it here instantly.

00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And it connects me with
whoever I'm in front of.

00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And I could just
feel their heart.

00:54:04.590 --> 00:54:08.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's feeling like their
personality, their who they

00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:12.590 align:middle line:90%
are, and my legs start moving.

00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, my legs
get involved in it,

00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:16.410 align:middle line:90%
and my hands get involved.

00:54:16.410 --> 00:54:20.870 align:middle line:84%
So I just kind of go with the
flow of what's coming through.

00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:23.000 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what I'm saying.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm feeling them.

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And I've just been
having fun with it,

00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:30.320 align:middle line:90%
and experimenting with it.

00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:32.310 align:middle line:90%
My daughter started as well.

00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:34.020 align:middle line:84%
So we've just been
going back and forth.

00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:36.240 align:middle line:90%
So right now, it's just fun.

00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:38.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure what's happening.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going with the flow,
and that's what it's doing.

00:54:40.850 --> 00:54:44.090 align:middle line:84%
It's forcing me to just go with
the flow of what's happening,

00:54:44.090 --> 00:54:48.560 align:middle line:84%
and not using my mind to
figure out what's going on.

00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:56.450 align:middle line:84%
>> All of you had this amazing
experience at the retreat where

00:54:56.450 --> 00:55:00.020 align:middle line:84%
Sasha sort of asked everybody
to come to the circle.

00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:03.320 align:middle line:84%
So Lisa asked whoever
wanted to, or whoever

00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:05.300 align:middle line:84%
felt the calling to
come to the circle,

00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:07.940 align:middle line:84%
and to channel some
light language.

00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And I found it a quite
beautiful moment.

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:13.940 align:middle line:84%
There was so much energy
swirling in the circle,

00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:15.150 align:middle line:90%
and just hearing it.

00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:20.532 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted to
ask, what was happening?

00:55:20.532 --> 00:55:21.740 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we'll start with sound.

00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:25.382 align:middle line:90%
What was happening in your--

00:55:25.382 --> 00:55:29.720 align:middle line:84%
as a download emotions feeling
at that time in the contact

00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:32.810 align:middle line:84%
retreat, under the stars,
under this ancient--

00:55:32.810 --> 00:55:36.630 align:middle line:84%
it felt so ancient, the
ritual or something.

00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:38.720 align:middle line:84%
But what did you feel
during that time?

00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>> I think for me, it felt
coming together that was quite

00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:46.460 align:middle line:84%
profound, because it's like
being separate for so long,

00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:49.340 align:middle line:84%
and now is the time we're all
coming together in a different

00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:51.500 align:middle line:90%
way, and more harmonious way.

00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:54.440 align:middle line:90%
So that was very nice.

00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:56.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Michelle, how about you?

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.120 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a different feeling
when you're doing it with other

00:55:59.120 --> 00:55:59.990 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:02.900 align:middle line:84%
The energy, it just feels
different than when you're

00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:04.460 align:middle line:90%
one-on-one or by yourself.

00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:07.400 align:middle line:84%
So I could feel the intensity
of everyone else around.

00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And it just created like
a swirling of energy

00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:13.880 align:middle line:84%
that you could feel
the connection,

00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:18.230 align:middle line:84%
and you can feel it
beyond where we were.

00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:20.210 align:middle line:90%
So it just it was very intense.

00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:22.330 align:middle line:90%
And it was very grounding too.

00:56:22.330 --> 00:56:23.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Harry, how about you?

00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>> It was very intense.

00:56:25.550 --> 00:56:31.550 align:middle line:84%
It felt very sacred,
very communal, very much

00:56:31.550 --> 00:56:33.220 align:middle line:90%
a communal experience.

00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And I did feel a connection
not with just those who

00:56:37.550 --> 00:56:40.400 align:middle line:84%
were physically present,
but with other energies that

00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:42.170 align:middle line:90%
were present also.

00:56:42.170 --> 00:56:46.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you have any recollection

How about you, Bobbie?

00:57:02.090 --> 00:57:04.740 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, it was also
very, very powerful.

00:57:04.740 --> 00:57:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think it grounded, or
integrated an energy within me

00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:12.230 align:middle line:84%
that I had not
experienced before.

00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And Sash'a-- the ship was
above, the contact ship.

00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And I really felt
that I connected

00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:22.280 align:middle line:90%
with an energy from there.

00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:24.710 align:middle line:90%
It just came in, it seated.

00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like the
energy I was broadcasting.

00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like it was an
energy that was perhaps

00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:38.540 align:middle line:90%
welcoming everyone there.

00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:40.790 align:middle line:84%
So I could really
understand the essence

00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:42.300 align:middle line:90%
of what was coming through.

00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:45.320 align:middle line:84%
So it was a totally different
experience for me Yeah,

00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:46.790 align:middle line:90%
so it was real powerful.

00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:50.708 align:middle line:84%
>> So not necessarily-- was it
still your usual essence star

00:57:50.708 --> 00:57:53.000 align:middle line:84%
family that was coming through,
or something different?

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Totally different.

00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:55.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:57:55.310 --> 00:57:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>> I was a few people
away from Bobbie,

00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:00.230 align:middle line:84%
and having been
practicing with them,

00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:02.360 align:middle line:84%
when the energy came
through and I looked over,

00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:05.540 align:middle line:84%
it was definitely a different
energy that embodied her,

00:58:05.540 --> 00:58:08.690 align:middle line:84%
and was very powerful, such that
the languaging that was coming

00:58:08.690 --> 00:58:12.860 align:middle line:84%
through was very profound, very
ancient, almost of the land.

00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:14.550 align:middle line:90%
It was very profound.

00:58:14.550 --> 00:58:15.900 align:middle line:90%

I was standing right
next to Bobbie,

00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:19.910 align:middle line:90%
and it was like a broadcast.

00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:20.840 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:22.100 align:middle line:90%
>> I was broadcasting.

00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, I don't know
what I was telling everyone,

00:58:24.490 --> 00:58:25.865 align:middle line:84%
but I was telling
them something.

00:58:25.865 --> 00:58:28.940 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHING] I was
like, listen to me.

00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:32.010 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I'm here
to tell you something.

00:58:32.010 --> 00:58:32.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:58:32.810 --> 00:58:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:39.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though at first
it felt kind of chaotic,

00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:42.230 align:middle line:90%
it sort of found its resonance.

00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And then there was
less of the overlap,

00:58:45.770 --> 00:58:47.570 align:middle line:90%
and it just felt like a flow.

00:58:47.570 --> 00:58:48.630 align:middle line:90%
Did you guys feel that?

00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:51.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, in the
songs and everything.

00:58:51.590 --> 00:58:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, it was a
unique experience.

00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:58.310 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, something new
for this contact.

to be doing with it?

00:59:07.970 --> 00:59:08.850 align:middle line:90%

00:59:08.850 --> 00:59:11.480 align:middle line:84%

So I would like to
play around, and see

00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:20.030 align:middle line:84%
if we can interpret our
own, because I really

00:59:20.030 --> 00:59:22.730 align:middle line:90%

I know the energy is there.

00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:32.510 align:middle line:84%

it's the communication.

which also connects
with the stars.

00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:46.880 align:middle line:84%
So I want to kind
of explore that

as maybe being out in
nature more, and using it

sort of a team, quote unquote,

01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:31.880 align:middle line:84%

explore a little more about

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:35.060 align:middle line:84%
the meaning, and what it
actually is here for, because I

01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:38.360 align:middle line:84%
think it's a gift to open to it,
and I've been having fun with

it privately.

01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:41.840 align:middle line:84%

it in another way,

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:43.350 align:middle line:90%

I feel like intergalactic,
but somehow it

01:00:47.690 --> 01:00:49.730 align:middle line:84%
has a place because
communication

01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:52.235 align:middle line:84%
is going to be very big
in terms of that area,

01:00:52.235 --> 01:00:55.022 align:middle line:84%
to be able to communicate
from the heart center.

01:00:55.022 --> 01:00:56.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm really looking
forward to that,

01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:58.280 align:middle line:84%

what we're saying too

01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:59.825 align:middle line:90%

our galactic history, you

an amazing job diving into that.

of accept that we are from

01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:28.590 align:middle line:84%

galactic history revealed,

shift into that reality,

01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I see you you, and I
see you, and I see you.

01:04:18.650 --> 01:04:21.010 align:middle line:90%
And I wish I remembered it--

01:04:21.010 --> 01:04:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>> But that's beautiful.

01:04:22.010 --> 01:04:24.110 align:middle line:84%
>> But that's essentially
what it was saying is,

01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:25.950 align:middle line:84%
we're all reflections
of each other.

01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:26.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>> And when we open our heart,
people with big hearts come in.

01:04:30.550 --> 01:04:31.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:32.300 align:middle line:90%
Right.

01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:33.704 align:middle line:90%
Yes, thank you.

01:04:33.704 --> 01:04:35.120 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:40.790 align:middle line:90%


01:04:40.790 --> 01:04:43.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Luckily, you were able to
make it to the session we had

01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:44.790 align:middle line:10%
yesterday.

01:04:44.790 --> 01:04:48.410 align:middle line:84%
What were your thoughts on
just the whole experience?

01:04:48.410 --> 01:04:51.650 align:middle line:84%
>> That was the first light
language experience that I had

01:04:51.650 --> 01:04:53.180 align:middle line:90%
participated in.

01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And prior to that,
I thought maybe

01:04:56.810 --> 01:05:02.570 align:middle line:84%
it was information that's
not able to be articulated.

01:05:02.570 --> 01:05:08.360 align:middle line:84%
But as I sat in the circle, some
thoughts started to come to me.

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like the heart
is a frequency transmitter.

01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:18.210 align:middle line:90%
And this is scientific fact.

01:05:18.210 --> 01:05:21.800 align:middle line:84%
It's 60 times more of
a electromagnetic field

01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:24.440 align:middle line:84%
than any other
organ in the body.

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like, and saw a
visual that when we speak,

01:05:31.610 --> 01:05:37.850 align:middle line:84%
we're moving energy through this
transmission from the heart,

01:05:37.850 --> 01:05:39.350 align:middle line:90%
through our voice.

01:05:39.350 --> 01:05:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And our voice language
is a structure.

01:05:42.770 --> 01:05:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And structure provides a
way for the ego to judge.

01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:56.010 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm speaking
to you, the energy

01:05:56.010 --> 01:05:58.890 align:middle line:84%
that my heart wants to
convey can be twisted.

01:05:58.890 --> 01:06:01.800 align:middle line:84%
It can be angled in
such a way that I

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:06.330 align:middle line:84%
can cover certain things, or
I can give it the right angle.

01:06:06.330 --> 01:06:08.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Based on your gender
or something like--

01:06:08.210 --> 01:06:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and same thing
with receiving information.

01:06:10.770 --> 01:06:12.430 align:middle line:90%
When you receive information.

01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:16.200 align:middle line:10%
You can view it like if
someone hands you a present,

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:19.410 align:middle line:10%
there is something inside.

01:06:19.410 --> 01:06:23.400 align:middle line:84%
But how I package that present,
I can hide certain aspects,

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:27.450 align:middle line:84%
or I can give it the right
angle, both when I give to you,

01:06:27.450 --> 01:06:30.700 align:middle line:84%
and then when you receive
it, the same thing.

01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:33.600 align:middle line:84%
So I feel that light
language is a way that

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:36.000 align:middle line:90%
bypasses the ego filter.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of that,
it's pure frequency.

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's the
electromagnetic signature.

01:06:43.950 --> 01:06:47.310 align:middle line:84%
It's like when you
express something

01:06:47.310 --> 01:06:52.710 align:middle line:84%
to somebody purely even without
language, you can feel emotion.

01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
ego has a hard time to judge.

01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:01.470 align:middle line:84%
So I got the feeling
that light language

01:07:01.470 --> 01:07:06.180 align:middle line:84%
is like literally
the language of love,

01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:09.330 align:middle line:84%
because it's expressed
in such a pure way.

01:07:09.330 --> 01:07:11.020 align:middle line:90%
And it has two purposes.

01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:15.810 align:middle line:84%
One purpose is to be able
to express without the ego,

01:07:15.810 --> 01:07:18.120 align:middle line:84%
but the other thing is
the person receiving that

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:19.980 align:middle line:84%
also doesn't have
the opportunity

01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:24.030 align:middle line:84%
to judge, or to hear
what they want to hear,

01:07:24.030 --> 01:07:26.890 align:middle line:84%
so they also receive
that information.

01:07:26.890 --> 01:07:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And then the second thing
is that it's not only

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:33.660 align:middle line:84%
a way for you to give
and receive information,

01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:39.610 align:middle line:84%
but it's also a way that
humans can associate with it.

01:07:39.610 --> 01:07:43.830 align:middle line:84%
So you can't imagine
the leap to telepathy

01:07:43.830 --> 01:07:46.320 align:middle line:90%
is too far of a leap for us.

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And we connect with
information, with language.

01:07:50.670 --> 01:07:53.350 align:middle line:84%
You see, even we want to
know, what does it mean?

01:07:53.350 --> 01:07:55.500 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean?

01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:57.760 align:middle line:10%
It's a way that we
can connect with.

01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:02.520 align:middle line:84%
So if we can bridge the
gap, not the big jump,

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:07.530 align:middle line:84%
telepathy, and not where
we filter through the ego,

01:08:07.530 --> 01:08:10.740 align:middle line:84%
but in between, and language
can still be a bridge.

01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:13.320 align:middle line:84%
It can still transmit
energy, but in a way

01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:14.950 align:middle line:90%
that bypasses the ego filter.

01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
language of love.

01:08:17.550 --> 01:08:21.100 align:middle line:84%
The whole weekend has been about
you saw in the very beginning,

01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:22.510 align:middle line:90%
we were talking about confusion.

01:08:22.510 --> 01:08:23.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:08:23.310 --> 01:08:25.019 align:middle line:90%
>> That was one of the themes.

01:08:25.019 --> 01:08:30.300 align:middle line:84%
And the Andromeda, and Andromeda
being always in this state

01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:31.350 align:middle line:90%
of flux, and change.

01:08:31.350 --> 01:08:33.330 align:middle line:84%
They can't create
structure, so they

01:08:33.330 --> 01:08:35.609 align:middle line:90%
learn to move through change.

01:08:35.609 --> 01:08:37.529 align:middle line:84%
And this whole weekend
has been about that.

01:08:37.529 --> 01:08:40.680 align:middle line:90%
It's confusion.

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:43.890 align:middle line:84%
It's unstructured,
and teaching us

01:08:43.890 --> 01:08:49.950 align:middle line:84%
that you can't rely on something
to judge it, to filter it.

01:08:49.950 --> 01:08:54.000 align:middle line:84%
We just have to learn to
move, and just moving within.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.850 align:middle line:84%
You remember last night
with the light language,

01:08:56.850 --> 01:09:00.450 align:middle line:84%
and everybody together,
all the language

01:09:00.450 --> 01:09:03.540 align:middle line:84%
coming through, over,
and over, and over.

01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:05.399 align:middle line:84%
And I had this
thought come to me,

01:09:05.399 --> 01:09:12.120 align:middle line:84%
and it said, confusion is a
tool for us to bypass the ego

01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:15.120 align:middle line:84%
and let go of the ego, because
you don't have that structure

01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:16.500 align:middle line:90%
to hold on to.

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:21.779 align:middle line:84%
And that is an inroad into
inter-dimensional contact,

01:09:21.779 --> 01:09:25.290 align:middle line:84%
because as we were learning
that ET contact is not

01:09:25.290 --> 01:09:26.130 align:middle line:90%
about out there.

01:09:26.130 --> 01:09:27.210 align:middle line:90%
It's about in here.

01:09:27.210 --> 01:09:29.909 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the day,
we're contacting ourselves.

01:09:29.909 --> 01:09:32.059 align:middle line:90%
