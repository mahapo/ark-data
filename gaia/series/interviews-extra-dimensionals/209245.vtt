00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.880 align:middle line:84%
>> The fact that I can go
to other dimensional places,

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.580 align:middle line:84%
including Telos, if I choose
to, are now within my abilities

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.600 align:middle line:90%
in your realm.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.220 align:middle line:90%
And here's the good news--

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.620 align:middle line:90%
so is everybody else.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.160 align:middle line:84%
You have to find that
alignment to make sure

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.070 align:middle line:84%
that your vibration matches
that what's around you.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:27.880 align:middle line:90%


00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.580 align:middle line:90%
We carry light.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.810 align:middle line:90%
You carry light to help Gaia.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.000 align:middle line:84%
It's part of your role to
help the universe evolve.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And so as a light worker,
I don't go to Shasta

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.210 align:middle line:90%
seeking something from the monk.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.610 align:middle line:84%
It's always an energy
exchange, believe me.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.710 align:middle line:90%
And I get as much as I give.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.510 align:middle line:90%
But I'm a light worker.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm supposed to go
there and plant my light

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.470 align:middle line:84%
to assist that connection
from the higher realms here.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.360 align:middle line:90%
My job is to pull that light.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And everywhere I go, I
leave those things behind.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.810 align:middle line:84%
The more I do that, the more I
see energetic portals in Shasta

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.650 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:23.340 align:middle line:90%


00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.370 align:middle line:90%
Find your alignment first.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.760 align:middle line:84%
When you do, then
you're in a position

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.330 align:middle line:84%
to be aware of all the things
that are going on around you.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.420 align:middle line:84%
Then you find some
sacred ground.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.340 align:middle line:84%
When I went to Shasta looking
for energetic portals,

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.190 align:middle line:90%
I found them energetically.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.630 align:middle line:84%
When I get out in nature, I
see these energy signatures.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.130 align:middle line:84%
They look like heat coming
off a sidewalk with form.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.780 align:middle line:84%
It's-- you see them
there, unmistakable now.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.090 align:middle line:84%
You just have to
step into that aura

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.820 align:middle line:84%
and take advantage of
what's been left behind

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.200 align:middle line:84%
by somebody else who left
awesome intentions behind.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.220 align:middle line:84%
It's always an energy
exchange, all the more reason

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.550 align:middle line:84%
why I can't emphasize more for
people to find their alignment.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Because once you do, you
can connect to the things

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.160 align:middle line:90%
that are around you.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And when you do,
it's magnificent.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.730 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:23.730 --> 00:04:12.330 align:middle line:90%


00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, here we are
in lovely Mount Shasta,

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.180 align:middle line:90%
which is right there.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.722 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the
cameras can see it.

00:04:17.722 --> 00:04:22.530 align:middle line:84%
But we're at the bottom of Mount
Shasta, just behind Black Butte

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:23.460 align:middle line:90%
right here.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.160 align:middle line:90%
And we're speaking with Lowell.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.160 align:middle line:84%
You have a fantastic
story, my friend--

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>> --and a fantastic adventure.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.580 align:middle line:84%
We've been on a
couple of adventures

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.840 align:middle line:84%
the past couple of days,
but for another project.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.170 align:middle line:84%
Last time I was in Shasta, I
interviewed Asara, Asara Adams.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.240 align:middle line:10%
And I have a feeling
this is going

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.760 align:middle line:10%
to fit into that story,
the story of Telos, Adama,

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.760 align:middle line:10%
who I got to speak
to through Asara,

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.310 align:middle line:10%
and who you got to
speak to in person.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell us about that.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.710 align:middle line:90%
>> I had been in Shasta.

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.430 align:middle line:84%
The intent was to come up here
during COVID for some R&R.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And when things relaxed and
people could move around

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.200 align:middle line:84%
a little bit, I chose
to go find nature.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.490 align:middle line:84%
I was going to go solo and just
wanted to go to national parks.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And in my planning, to
make a long story short,

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.930 align:middle line:84%
Shasta was what just
came into focus.

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And from where I
was in Santa Rosa,

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.250 align:middle line:84%
it's four hours
as the crow flies.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.220 align:middle line:90%
And so it was an easy commute.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.710 align:middle line:90%
I had never been there before.

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Driven by lots of times going
to Oregon and sightseeing

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.050 align:middle line:84%
because I like to
drive in the car.

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.540 align:middle line:84%
But I had never had
the chance to stop,

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.670 align:middle line:84%
although all you had
certainly heard lots

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.720 align:middle line:84%
of about what goes on
in Shasta and energy

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.640 align:middle line:90%
that seems to be there.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.250 align:middle line:84%
So the plan was I was going
to come up for a week.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And then I was going to meet
my son for a week in Tahoe

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.650 align:middle line:84%
after that, and we'll figure
out the rest after that.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:56.670 align:middle line:90%
He was unemployed.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And look, I-- there's no
consulting work for hotel guys

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.050 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.750 align:middle line:84%
It was a good time
to just do what--

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.970 align:middle line:84%
if I had nothing else in the
world to do, what would I do?

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.340 align:middle line:84%
I would travel, and I
would spend time in nature.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.280 align:middle line:90%
Here's where it started.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.170 align:middle line:84%
Then the universe
decided that they

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:15.910 align:middle line:84%
were going to kick in and
show me some special things.

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.190 align:middle line:84%
So the one week
turned into five.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.360 align:middle line:90%
I just stayed.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:27.180 align:middle line:84%
I continued to extend my time
here because the energy here,

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.710 align:middle line:90%
it's an assimilation.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.790 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it just takes
time to get used to that energy.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And I was two weeks in to hiking
every day, significant hiking.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm not 30 years old
anymore, and I should

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.740 align:middle line:90%
have been tired the next day.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And it was, like I said, two
weeks later that somebody

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.540 align:middle line:84%
had made a remark in
one of the parking lots

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.580 align:middle line:84%
about their energy level
and how they felt good.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I
just had to stop and think,

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.160 align:middle line:84%
wait a minute, I should be
worn out like hell, I am not.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.520 align:middle line:84%
There's some
physicality about it.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.810 align:middle line:84%
I tend to meditate when
I can wherever I can.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.390 align:middle line:84%
Because here's where you
find your peace and solace,

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:09.570 align:middle line:84%
and now I want to connect with
that and let my inner being

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:11.250 align:middle line:90%
appreciate all that.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:17.320 align:middle line:84%
So in the course of one of those
days-- it was the end of July--

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.680 align:middle line:84%
it was a weekend, and I
was kind of planning out

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.030 align:middle line:90%
what I was going to do.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:26.020 align:middle line:84%
The Peace Garden in Mount Shasta
is a beautiful thing to see.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And so it was on my
radar for the morning.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.405 align:middle line:84%
And then I didn't
know what I was

00:07:29.405 --> 00:07:31.170 align:middle line:90%
going to do in the afternoon.

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:34.470 align:middle line:10%
The things that had
come across my attention

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.020 align:middle line:10%
was a trip up to the
top of Black Butte

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.420 align:middle line:10%
because I understood,
if you were willing,

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.330 align:middle line:10%
you could commute all the
way to the very top of it.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.590 align:middle line:10%
It's 6,900 feet and change.

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, OK, well, I
might be able to do that.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.930 align:middle line:84%
I read some of the reviews,
and they gave their suggestions

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:57.090 align:middle line:84%
on whether that kind of thing
should or should not be done.

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Anybody my age and my sense
wouldn't have done it,

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:00.930 align:middle line:90%
but here we went.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:05.910 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, when that was done, I
went back to Panther Meadows

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:08.110 align:middle line:84%
to just figure out what
I was going to do next.

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:09.570 align:middle line:84%
So I picked-- found one
of the picnic tables--

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:10.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Panther Meadows
is up on Shasta.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.480 align:middle line:90%
>> It's-- yes.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>> It's one of
the highest spots.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.605 align:middle line:84%
That's actually where
I interviewed Asara.

00:08:16.605 --> 00:08:18.810 align:middle line:10%
So we had her walking
around Panther Meadows.

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:25.110 align:middle line:10%
And then just off to the side
is where she brought in Adama.

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:30.000 align:middle line:84%
>> That whole area-- for hiking,
there are a couple of streams

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.200 align:middle line:90%
up there in the area.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.250 align:middle line:84%
It's just green and
beautiful back there.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:34.830 align:middle line:90%
And so that was--

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:38.190 align:middle line:84%
I like to see things from as
high a perspective as I can.

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:39.809 align:middle line:84%
So I always kind of
trigger for that.

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:42.600 align:middle line:84%
When I was in Colorado going
at the top of Mount Evans, man,

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.460 align:middle line:84%
that was-- every
other month, it was

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.010 align:middle line:90%
kind of a trip on a weekend.

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:48.940 align:middle line:90%
I just like that perspective.

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.070 align:middle line:90%
So I wanted to get it here.

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And the highest place
you can drive to

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:54.330 align:middle line:90%
is up Everett Memorial Highway.

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And you will eventually end
up, provided the road is open,

00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.430 align:middle line:90%
at the top of Panther Meadows.

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:02.370 align:middle line:10%
At this picnic table I
found, I was looking out,

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:03.510 align:middle line:10%
while people are mingling.

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.460 align:middle line:84%
It's Friday, and people
are starting to come and go

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.260 align:middle line:90%
and there.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And there are only a half
dozen picnic tables at all.

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:11.640 align:middle line:84%
It's not really meant
for people to hang.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.370 align:middle line:84%
You're going to park here,
and then go to track.

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.740 align:middle line:84%
But one of the tables
was open, so I sat at it

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.810 align:middle line:90%
and started to look at Shasta.

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:21.660 align:middle line:84%
And Shastina, for whatever
reason, caught my eye.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.670 align:middle line:90%
Now, imagine the sun.

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:27.480 align:middle line:84%
It's noon, so the sun is
starting almost overhead.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And the shadows are starting to
cast on this side of Shastina.

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And for someone that grew up
around the Mississippi River,

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:38.490 align:middle line:90%
where we had caves--

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:40.980 align:middle line:84%
we explored them all, we
knew what they were like--

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.430 align:middle line:84%
when you looked at it from where
I was, there was almost-- some

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.200 align:middle line:84%
of these things,
and more than one,

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.870 align:middle line:84%
looked like they could
be cave entrances.

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:51.450 align:middle line:84%
Where I wanted to go
was along that trail.

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:53.100 align:middle line:84%
But there was a
place where I was

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.200 align:middle line:84%
going to have to
just crawl up rock

00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:01.110 align:middle line:84%
or whatever was there to get to
the areas I was curious about.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:03.180 align:middle line:84%
There were a few
places that were just

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.370 align:middle line:84%
kind of natural
energy for Texas,

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:10.440 align:middle line:84%
where you would see, in
Redwood forests there,

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:14.220 align:middle line:84%
circles of redwoods,
fairy circles.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.822 align:middle line:84%
And you know that there is
activity in the middle of that.

00:10:16.822 --> 00:10:18.030 align:middle line:90%
There were rock outcroppings.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:19.947 align:middle line:84%
>> You could sense that
when you were walking?

00:10:19.947 --> 00:10:21.570 align:middle line:90%
>> There were a couple of those.

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:23.415 align:middle line:84%
There were a couple
of rock outcroppings

00:10:23.415 --> 00:10:25.270 align:middle line:90%
that were that same thing.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:27.900 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing I saw
was a rock outcropping

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.390 align:middle line:84%
that was just natural,
like it was meant

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:31.990 align:middle line:90%
for someone to stand here.

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And once you did, you
just felt an energy.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, I would have
stayed there longer,

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.350 align:middle line:84%
but I saw another
one right over here

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:43.320 align:middle line:84%
that looked like it had
promise, similar to this,

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.220 align:middle line:90%
but just up a little bit higher.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.260 align:middle line:84%
So I moved from
here up to there.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And when I got in the
same kind of position

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.203 align:middle line:84%
and I was going to get
ready to just kind of stand

00:10:52.203 --> 00:10:54.120 align:middle line:84%
here a moment, anchor
my light, and then we'll

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.170 align:middle line:90%
see what's going on.

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, I noticed one
more spot over here.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And it was actually against
the face of Shastina.

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.300 align:middle line:90%


00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:08.280 align:middle line:84%
There were three rocks that
kind of encircled this space.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.310 align:middle line:84%
And here was a rock
that was a little bit

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:16.500 align:middle line:84%
higher than my inseam,
but narrow and wide.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.300 align:middle line:84%
Then there was a
huge boulder here

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.740 align:middle line:90%
and another boulder over here.

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And they just kind of made this
circular closure right here.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And your back would have
been against Shastina.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:29.560 align:middle line:84%
So I crawled over
that spot here.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.590 align:middle line:84%
What I always do when I
find a place-- and again,

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:36.660 align:middle line:84%
there was an energy surge that
just kind of grabbed you--

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.760 align:middle line:84%
I always like to ground
my light where I am.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And so I had my crystals
I carry with me.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And my habit is to
draw an infinity symbol

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.540 align:middle line:90%
in the sand or the dirt.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.130 align:middle line:90%
My crystal goes in the middle.

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And I take three
infinity breaths

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:54.900 align:middle line:90%
to anchor my light there.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.970 align:middle line:84%
I've accomplished what
I needed to be here.

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:59.830 align:middle line:84%
That is the residue I'm
going to leave behind.

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And then I just get to enjoy
this, and share my energy

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:04.470 align:middle line:90%
with the environment I'm in.

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And is that kind
of all self-taught?

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.320 align:middle line:90%
How did--

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.330 align:middle line:90%
>> It just kind of came to me.

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.065 align:middle line:84%
It just feels good
when I do that.

00:12:11.065 --> 00:12:12.690 align:middle line:84%
So the other night
when we were talking

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:17.100 align:middle line:84%
about going out on mission and
finding these vortexes, well,

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:20.700 align:middle line:84%
that was when it just triggered,
look, we're light workers,

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:24.210 align:middle line:84%
we're supposed to be anchoring
our energy and assisting Gaia.

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.805 align:middle line:90%
And I was finished with that.

00:12:26.805 --> 00:12:28.680 align:middle line:84%
I thought, I'm going to
sit here for a while.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:32.280 align:middle line:84%
The sun was kind
of over my head.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And my back was
against the rock.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And on the rock was this
brush that grows there.

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:43.260 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of dried out,
so this was not soft at all.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.210 align:middle line:84%
But I was having some
water and grapes,

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:49.620 align:middle line:84%
and I was listening
to tunes on my phone.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.360 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, I couldn't
hear the music anymore.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.160 align:middle line:90%
I was done.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.190 align:middle line:84%
I'd put whatever
I was having away.

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:57.840 align:middle line:90%
And the music stopped.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.090 align:middle line:84%
So I reached into my
pocket to get my phone out,

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:02.350 align:middle line:90%
and there's no power.

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:06.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, this was fully
charged when I left the car

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:07.780 align:middle line:90%
way less than an hour ago.

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And it has a mophie on it, so
power should not be an issue.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.710 align:middle line:84%
As I started to
try and fire it up,

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.890 align:middle line:84%
again and I'm holding
the power button down,

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:21.870 align:middle line:84%
I sense almost like a shadow
that was coming from behind me,

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:26.700 align:middle line:84%
like the sun would be moving
quickly enough to shadow you,

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:30.250 align:middle line:84%
but also like an environment
coming from beneath me.

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I tried
to regulate that idea,

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:38.430 align:middle line:84%
I felt something
cool from behind me.

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, I turn around, and
there's a hole behind me.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>> And it wasn't there before.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.720 align:middle line:84%
>> As I-- there was
nothing behind me.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.200 align:middle line:84%
I was leaned up
against solid surface.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.000 align:middle line:90%
It is large enough--

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm 6 feet tall.

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:55.200 align:middle line:84%
It was probably another
couple of feet over me.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.060 align:middle line:84%
It looked like it
had been carved out,

00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:04.380 align:middle line:84%
like it was an outside
exposure for a volcanic tube.

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.480 align:middle line:90%
I turned around, and I stood up.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And as the light was beginning
to adjust to this darkness,

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:14.070 align:middle line:84%
you could tell that there was
a rise, and it kind of went up.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:17.070 align:middle line:90%
And then it went downward.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.190 align:middle line:84%
But as I looked
further, it looked

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:22.530 align:middle line:90%
like there was somebody there.

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:26.670 align:middle line:84%
Off on the left-hand side to
me and maybe 30 yards from

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:28.770 align:middle line:90%
where I was, there was somebody.

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And if I had to guess,
it looked like that

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:35.190 align:middle line:90%
was somebody was like my size.

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:38.610 align:middle line:84%
The next thing I heard was,
would you like to see Telos?

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:41.210 align:middle line:90%


00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>> My heart raced a little.

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:44.570 align:middle line:90%
I--

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:46.403 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you know it was
coming from that guy?

00:14:46.403 --> 00:14:49.190 align:middle line:84%
Or-- when you-- you just--
where did you hear it?

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:51.780 align:middle line:90%
>> It came from that direction.

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.188 align:middle line:90%
So I assumed--

00:14:53.188 --> 00:14:54.230 align:middle line:90%
>> It was that guy, yeah.

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:56.030 align:middle line:90%
>> --it was that guy.

00:14:56.030 --> 00:15:02.360 align:middle line:10%
There's-- I'm nowhere
near anybody else.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.920 align:middle line:90%
It had to be whoever it was.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.440 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, I said yes.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.970 align:middle line:90%
So I made my way down.

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And as I got closer,
maybe within 10 feet,

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:14.450 align:middle line:90%
he was not my size.

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:18.320 align:middle line:84%
This guy was adorned
in a white garment.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.180 align:middle line:84%
But he had these
ribbons of color.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:25.040 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't know if that was
some kind of Telos bling,

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.740 align:middle line:84%
or whether that was
some kind of badge that

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.410 align:middle line:90%
represented a position he held.

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:31.670 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know.

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:34.500 align:middle line:84%
>> But at the time, you
didn't know about Telos.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.750 align:middle line:90%
>> I did not know about Telos.

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:37.160 align:middle line:84%
>> So when he said, would
you like to go in to Telos,

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.060 align:middle line:84%
did you even know what
that was at the time?

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:39.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-mm.

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:43.430 align:middle line:84%
The only background
I knew at all

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:47.720 align:middle line:84%
was that I have had some
experience understanding

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:53.240 align:middle line:84%
Atlantean backgrounds
and regressions I've

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.160 align:middle line:90%
had helped through.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.492 align:middle line:84%
So I know I have
history in Atlantis.

00:15:57.492 --> 00:15:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're going
to learn about Atlantis,

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:01.790 align:middle line:84%
you can't help but
learn about Lemuria.

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:04.670 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
learn about both,

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:08.300 align:middle line:84%
Telos is eventually one of
those stories that comes along,

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:12.360 align:middle line:84%
that because if what really
happened during the fall.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And if we are to believe
in the history that

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:20.510 align:middle line:84%
included the Lemurians,
that this, what happened

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:24.380 align:middle line:84%
underneath Mount Shasta
and Telos was developed,

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:28.640 align:middle line:84%
probably has a lot more
credence than we're giving it.

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.290 align:middle line:90%
But it was not on my radar.

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:33.590 align:middle line:84%
When I was going to Mount
Shasta, and part of it is I

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:36.410 align:middle line:84%
got a spiritual journey, and
I'm interested in expressing

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:37.430 align:middle line:90%
that while I'm there.

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:41.300 align:middle line:84%
You'd certainly heard lots of
stories about Saint Germain.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.430 align:middle line:10%
And he's a real being.

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:44.940 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't a legend.

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:48.120 align:middle line:84%
He came out and shared
what he had to give,

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.910 align:middle line:90%
and gave it to Guy.

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And it was his job then to
perpetuate the information.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:57.590 align:middle line:84%
So in my mind, if I can run
into any ascended master,

00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:59.660 align:middle line:90%
you would make my day.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:03.560 align:middle line:84%
Visiting Telos was
not on that wishlist.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.740 align:middle line:90%
This was all new to me.

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:12.319 align:middle line:84%
As I got closer,
he had blond hair.

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:17.240 align:middle line:84%
If I had to describe him,
he was Scandinavian in look.

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:22.940 align:middle line:84%
But they're-- all of them that
I saw had complexions that were

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:24.619 align:middle line:90%
like flawless.

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:25.670 align:middle line:90%
And they weren't--

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:26.750 align:middle line:90%
>> What does that mean?

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:27.550 align:middle line:90%
Like--

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:30.440 align:middle line:84%
>> You know how we
look when we mature?

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Your skin begins to
just change with age.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see, yeah.

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:35.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Flawless.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Wrinkles start creeping
in and that kind of thing.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.003 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't have that?

00:17:39.003 --> 00:17:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, no
wrinkles, no-- mm-mm.

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:42.450 align:middle line:90%
All of them that I saw.

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:43.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>> We'll get to Adama
and the women that I saw.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.210 align:middle line:90%
None of-- just flawless.

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And it makes you wonder if
our physicality is really

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:56.040 align:middle line:90%
moving to a crystalline form.

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.400 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if they've
already evolved

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:03.770 align:middle line:84%
to that, which would explain
their lifespans and maybe

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:05.120 align:middle line:90%
their just physicality.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.020 align:middle line:90%
Who knows.

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, before we get into
that, let's back it up.

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:08.120 align:middle line:90%
So you see--

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:08.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's go back.

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>> You the opening in the cave.

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:10.260 align:middle line:90%
>> I see this guy.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.427 align:middle line:90%
>> There's a guy down there.

00:18:11.427 --> 00:18:14.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And he is now at least
a foot taller than I am.

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.930 align:middle line:90%
He says, you can call me Alex.

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:19.370 align:middle line:10%
Well, that'll be
easy to remember.

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:20.510 align:middle line:90%
That's my son's name.

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yes, we
know about your son Alex.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.110 align:middle line:90%
Follow me.

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:26.340 align:middle line:90%
So now we begin down this.

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:27.140 align:middle line:90%
>> What did you--

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:28.910 align:middle line:90%
when he said that, did that--

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:30.570 align:middle line:90%
>> How do you respond to that?

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:32.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, did it disturb you?

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.075 align:middle line:84%
Or was it-- what is the
feeling at this point?

00:18:35.075 --> 00:18:42.920 align:middle line:84%
>> From this point on, I was
not in a period of engagement.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.230 align:middle line:90%
I just wanted to soak it all in.

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:48.080 align:middle line:84%
I now know solidly, I'm
here as an observer.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And so in my mind, I'm just
going to take all this in,

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:52.340 align:middle line:90%
and I'll sort it out later.

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.790 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to say anything.

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:54.930 align:middle line:90%
I just want to listen.

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And I-- that's just kind
of how it panned about.

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:04.610 align:middle line:84%
He just had a narrative
that helped educate me

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:07.130 align:middle line:84%
during this whole process,
which is how I learned what

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:09.080 align:middle line:90%
I learned while I was there.

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.270 align:middle line:84%
But what I saw was
the magnificent part.

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
wish that there was

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:14.780 align:middle line:84%
some kind of cinematic
thing I could

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:19.790 align:middle line:84%
download that everyone else
could see what's already here,

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:22.280 align:middle line:84%
that we've talked
about, and nobody

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.690 align:middle line:90%
has had any feet on the ground.

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:26.030 align:middle line:84%
This was not a
meditative journey, me

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:27.900 align:middle line:90%
sitting in that spot outside.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:28.700 align:middle line:90%
I was inside.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>> This wasn't an
astral projection.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:33.380 align:middle line:84%
This was, you were physically
going inside this cave.

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:34.530 align:middle line:90%
So you followed Alex down.

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:35.330 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:36.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Got all the way
down to the bottom.

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And as you proceeded
down, you could

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:40.480 align:middle line:84%
see that there was an
area down there that

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.030 align:middle line:90%
was illuminated in some way.

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:44.140 align:middle line:90%
>> In some way--

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:45.430 align:middle line:90%
where was it coming from?

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:47.960 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:48.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, when--

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:49.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Was it--

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.940 align:middle line:84%
>> You asked the question,
so I'll cover it now.

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:54.640 align:middle line:84%
Both here, now that
you mentioned it,

00:19:54.640 --> 00:20:00.650 align:middle line:84%
and when I describe Telos
itself, anywhere we went,

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:02.660 align:middle line:90%
there was no direct sunlight.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.198 align:middle line:84%
And somebody asked me
yesterday about it.

00:20:05.198 --> 00:20:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't occur
to me until then.

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.198 align:middle line:84%
They said, did you
see any shadows?

00:20:08.198 --> 00:20:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And no, I did not
see any shadows.

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:14.300 align:middle line:84%
So where does natural
sunlight come from?

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:18.980 align:middle line:84%
I can only speculate that
it's crystal in nature.

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's an energy that
just works its way in ways

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:24.920 align:middle line:84%
that we're just not
meant to understand yet.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.878 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's kind of coming
from all directions?

00:20:26.878 --> 00:20:27.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Everywhere.

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:29.390 align:middle line:90%
Everything was illuminated.

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know
if that changes

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:32.630 align:middle line:90%
during the cycle of a day.

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:36.410 align:middle line:84%
I was there for what
seemed like hours.

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:38.420 align:middle line:84%
But it was more like
an hour and 20 minutes.

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:39.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Huh.

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>> So now we're in
this staging area.

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And directly across from
us were five more tubes

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:49.250 align:middle line:84%
like we just came
out of over there,

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:51.770 align:middle line:84%
similar to volcanic
tubes, which would

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:54.140 align:middle line:84%
be natural underneath
Shasta and Shastina.

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:56.550 align:middle line:84%
>> How long was it that you
had to walk down this thing

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:57.350 align:middle line:90%
into the--

00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:59.298 align:middle line:90%
>> Maybe another 30 yards.

00:20:59.298 --> 00:21:00.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it wasn't that far then.

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:01.700 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:03.092 align:middle line:90%
It--

00:21:03.092 --> 00:21:04.820 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:07.670 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy.

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:12.710 align:middle line:84%
Once I got there, there's
no conception of dimension.

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Where am I in the scheme
of inside the mountain?

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.390 align:middle line:90%
Or am I underground?

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:23.120 align:middle line:84%
You flash, wonder where
that is, but I'm just

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.460 align:middle line:84%
going to tuck those
questions aside until later.

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:28.670 align:middle line:84%
Because I just want to
absorb what's in the moment

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:31.835 align:middle line:84%
so that I can recall it later
to the best of my abilities.

00:21:31.835 --> 00:21:34.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And you were kind of thinking
that in the moment, you think?

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:38.810 align:middle line:84%
>> As quickly as your mind can
process such things like that.

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:43.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Immediately to our left was
some kind of structure that was

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.410 align:middle line:90%
approximately 6 by 6.

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And it had what appeared to be
like two buckets seats on it.

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:52.820 align:middle line:84%
Over beyond that,
there was another one.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And over here to
this side, there

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:56.780 align:middle line:90%
was another one, same things.

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:59.930 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't tell you what kind of
material they were made out of.

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:01.940 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to say they
look like crystal.

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:03.470 align:middle line:90%
But it didn't look like that.

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:05.540 align:middle line:84%
It certainly wasn't wood,
and it wasn't metal.

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:08.240 align:middle line:90%
And God knows what it was.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.780 align:middle line:84%
Alex got into the
left-hand seat of this

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:14.240 align:middle line:84%
and gestured for me
to sit next to him.

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And once I sat down,
this thing levitated.

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And we began to move
in the direction--

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Did it have any give when
you sat in it, or was it solid?

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:29.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Whatever motion it had--
and I knew we were moving--

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.820 align:middle line:84%
it didn't feel like
I was going anywhere.

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:32.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So-- but I know
you're moving.

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:38.240 align:middle line:84%
There's no sensation
of wind or any of that.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:41.690 align:middle line:84%
The things that you would think
physically you would experience

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:43.340 align:middle line:90%
you didn't experience it.

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:46.310 align:middle line:84%
>> As we're coming
out of this tube,

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:49.070 align:middle line:84%
and now on the other side
there's light coming from

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:53.420 align:middle line:84%
the other side, so now there's
something coming on, there are

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:55.765 align:middle line:84%
crystals embedded
into the walls.

00:22:55.765 --> 00:22:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And now that
there's enough light

00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:00.140 align:middle line:84%
coming in the other direction,
it's beginning to refract it.

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:02.448 align:middle line:84%
And by the time you
get to the end of it,

00:23:02.448 --> 00:23:04.490 align:middle line:84%
it looks like you're in
a kaleidoscope around you

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:07.080 align:middle line:84%
because the crystals
are just flaming up.

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And once we got into that
area and it opened up,

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:14.870 align:middle line:84%
your breath just is
gone because now you're

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:17.990 align:middle line:84%
overseeing level 1
of the city of Telos.

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And it immediately takes
us up to some level

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:26.390 align:middle line:84%
so that in those pictures
you've seen of cityscapes,

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:28.850 align:middle line:84%
this is what I'm
looking at right now.

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:36.360 align:middle line:84%
Telos is circular
in orientation.

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:41.090 align:middle line:84%
So this white pyramid is in the
middle of what I'm looking at.

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And all around it are
crystal structures

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:44.900 align:middle line:90%
that are just gorgeous.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Could you estimate
the size of this pyramid?

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:48.560 align:middle line:90%
Is it massive like the--

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:49.360 align:middle line:90%
>> It's massive.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Like the Giza pyramid?

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:54.083 align:middle line:84%
>> It holds allegedly
10,000 people inside of it.

00:23:54.083 --> 00:23:55.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Inside the pyramid alone?

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:56.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Inside the pyramid.

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:57.080 align:middle line:90%
>> So--

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.490 align:middle line:90%
>> It's their main temple space.

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:01.670 align:middle line:84%
Although there are smaller
temples around that level,

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:02.690 align:middle line:90%
this is it.

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Wow, so this view you
had was just enormous.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:08.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Enormous.

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:09.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Right over there.

00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:10.520 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:14.690 align:middle line:84%
So how long did it
seem like you were

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:17.570 align:middle line:84%
traveling on this hovering
thing to get there?

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:19.550 align:middle line:90%
>> It didn't take long.

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:22.290 align:middle line:90%
The-- minutes?

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:23.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Minutes?

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:23.600 align:middle line:90%
Really, wow.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Minutes to just
get through that,

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:29.030 align:middle line:84%
and then everything else is
like, OK, that was old news.

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:32.585 align:middle line:84%
Now getting to see this
from that perspective,

00:24:32.585 --> 00:24:34.460 align:middle line:84%
here's where the questions
you were asking me

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:37.070 align:middle line:84%
about light conditions
focused into me.

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:39.765 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm looking around,
this place is cavernous.

00:24:39.765 --> 00:24:40.640 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a big cavern.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Cavernous.

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:43.400 align:middle line:90%
You can't see the top.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:46.190 align:middle line:84%
But there's light, like
there's sunlight up there.

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:48.140 align:middle line:84%
But there's no sunlight
and no shadows.

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:50.960 align:middle line:90%
So how is this all illuminated?

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:54.670 align:middle line:84%
At the top of the
pyramid is a capstone.

00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:57.290 align:middle line:90%


00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:59.020 align:middle line:90%
I used to know the name of it.

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.150 align:middle line:90%
But it was donated by Venus.

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:03.710 align:middle line:90%
And apparently it has function.

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:06.590 align:middle line:90%
When I saw it, it was a white.

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:07.870 align:middle line:90%
>> A capstone inside was--

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:09.370 align:middle line:90%
>> On the top of the pyramid.

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you know it
was donated by Venus?

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>> My research has told
me, and people have--

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:15.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Confirmed.

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:17.500 align:middle line:84%
>> --confirmed that
that's where it came from.

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.140 align:middle line:84%
Alex had mentioned it
when he was describing it

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:22.030 align:middle line:90%
that this is where--

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:25.690 align:middle line:90%
it had been donated by Venus.

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:29.110 align:middle line:84%
What I learned subsequently
is that the color

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:31.990 align:middle line:84%
of the capstone changes
based on conditions.

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:34.510 align:middle line:84%
I, then, of course,
my mind went, well,

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:36.070 align:middle line:84%
I guess maybe during
the day it just

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:38.800 align:middle line:90%
changes for daily or night.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And now what I understand
is that there are colors

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:45.730 align:middle line:90%
of a day associated with that.

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And the source I got my
information from today, Dianne

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:52.720 align:middle line:84%
Robbins, who's been
an author on Telos

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:56.980 align:middle line:84%
and has an authoritative
perspective, said--

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:58.480 align:middle line:84%
she says, well,
what day is today?

00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.530 align:middle line:90%
Today is Wednesday.

00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:01.070 align:middle line:90%
Oh, today's indigo day.

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:04.030 align:middle line:84%
So when the capstone is indigo,
apparently the population

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:06.610 align:middle line:90%
wears indigo.

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>> It's so great
because you're--

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:10.210 align:middle line:84%
the way you describe
it, the visuals are--

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:13.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm receiving visuals.

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:14.680 align:middle line:90%
And it's amazing.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:17.170 align:middle line:84%
>> It does me good
to hear that, really.

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:22.120 align:middle line:84%
I understand what this
message is supposed to be.

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:26.950 align:middle line:84%
I want to make sure that I can
paint as vivid an illustration

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:28.900 align:middle line:90%
as I can.

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:31.330 align:middle line:84%
Here's what we get
to look forward to.

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:35.500 align:middle line:84%
Here's the next civilization
that we should be enjoying.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And with Ascension right
around the corner, guys, here's

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:41.950 align:middle line:90%
a snapshot of what is coming.

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:44.030 align:middle line:84%
These people aren't
going anywhere.

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:45.730 align:middle line:84%
They've been waiting
in the wings for us

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:47.650 align:middle line:84%
to get our act
together for a while.

00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And they had no reason
to come and interact.

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.370 align:middle line:84%
There are stories that
they used to do that.

00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:57.910 align:middle line:84%
The last thing I could
find-- and actually,

00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:00.580 align:middle line:84%
when I asked Dianne
what she knew about it,

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:03.490 align:middle line:84%
the last interaction,
any physical interaction

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:08.200 align:middle line:84%
with Lemurians seemed
to be in like the '40s.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.990 align:middle line:84%
They used to come into town,
and they would barter with gold.

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And they would get
what they needed.

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.320 align:middle line:90%
But no one's seen them since.

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.570 align:middle line:90%
We can only speculate that--

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:19.750 align:middle line:84%
why would they want to get
messed up in this dimension,

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:25.510 align:middle line:84%
when, after what I've seen
and the way that they embrace

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:30.940 align:middle line:84%
that whole law of love
kind of mantra, here's

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:31.780 align:middle line:90%
where we're going.

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:33.460 align:middle line:90%
Here's the snapshot.

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let's go back to the
visual of-- we talked about

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:36.900 align:middle line:90%
a pyramid.

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:38.890 align:middle line:90%
You said a circular city.

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Were there are
things flying around

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:43.030 align:middle line:84%
like you see in the movies,
like "Fifth Element,"

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:44.350 align:middle line:90%
or that kind of thing?

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:47.620 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I didn't see any
activity in the air.

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:52.000 align:middle line:84%
There were plenty of people
that were just wandering around.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And they just seemed
to be in groups.

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:56.170 align:middle line:90%
My focus wasn't on them.

00:27:56.170 --> 00:28:01.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm just trying to take
in this fairytale vision.

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:04.840 align:middle line:84%
You always wonder--
the closest thing

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:07.570 align:middle line:84%
that I've found in any
illustrations I can see

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:09.730 align:middle line:84%
is there's some mockups
of what people think

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:11.290 align:middle line:90%
Atlantis used to look like.

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was centrific
in form too.

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:18.760 align:middle line:84%
That's the closest frame of
reference I have to what I saw.

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:25.060 align:middle line:84%
But the city wasn't like
connected with water.

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:27.760 align:middle line:84%
It just had natural
byways inside it.

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:28.770 align:middle line:90%
But it was circular.

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:29.950 align:middle line:90%
>> What's a byway?

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Just places for
you to negotiate.

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:34.810 align:middle line:84%
If they had a car, you'd
drive your car, or how people

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:35.920 align:middle line:90%
walk from place to place.

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Like governmental buildings
or something like that?

00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:41.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, on the first
level, I was informed,

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:44.140 align:middle line:84%
here's where the
administrative part.

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:48.910 align:middle line:84%
There is a king and queen that
oversee Telos, Ra and Rana.

00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:49.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Ra and Rana?

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:52.810 align:middle line:84%
>> They are the sovereign
king and queen of Telos.

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:54.650 align:middle line:90%
And they oversee it.

00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:56.470 align:middle line:90%
However, there is a council.

00:28:56.470 --> 00:29:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's six feminine,
six masculine.

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And Adama is the 13th
person on the council--

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:08.500 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, so they--

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.510 align:middle line:84%
>> --to make sure that
energies are balanced.

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:11.890 align:middle line:90%
>> And they told you this.

00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:13.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.850 align:middle line:90%
>> So let's get to that point.

00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:18.190 align:middle line:90%
So you saw this Alex.

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:19.730 align:middle line:90%
Where did you go next?

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:23.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, after we finished
this, we came down--

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:25.870 align:middle line:90%
so we were going somewhere else.

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:28.520 align:middle line:84%
How we got there-- because
it was kind of a blur.

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.610 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to take
in what I was seeing.

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And here's where I was able
to kind of make contact, eye

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:36.880 align:middle line:90%
contact with people.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.950 align:middle line:90%
Granted, they're a ways away.

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:40.780 align:middle line:90%
But I can look into their eyes.

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And the sense that I got was
I knew them, and they knew me.

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:46.870 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't just one person.

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:49.060 align:middle line:84%
There was probably
four or five people

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:52.180 align:middle line:84%
as we went past them that I
tried to make eye contact with,

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:54.920 align:middle line:84%
it just felt like
a little love hug.

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:55.720 align:middle line:90%
>> A love hug.

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:56.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Familiarity.

00:29:56.530 --> 00:30:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And then after that, we found
ourselves on the third level.

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:03.880 align:middle line:84%
On the way there, he
described the second level

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:09.010 align:middle line:84%
was some additional
housing, manufacturing.

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And whatever schooling they
have is located in that area.

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>> So Alex was kind of like
your Universal Studio Tour guide

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:15.980 align:middle line:90%
guy, kind of.

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.283 align:middle line:84%
Like over to the left and
duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.

00:30:18.283 --> 00:30:19.450 align:middle line:90%
Is that how it was, kind of?

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:23.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, in retrospect, I think
that he was there to help me

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:28.030 align:middle line:84%
see enough of Telos
to claim, here it is.

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And when we tell you it
has these number of levels,

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:33.760 align:middle line:84%
you have experience
with that, so

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:38.860 align:middle line:84%
that in my little humanness that
needs tangibility, I got it.

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:41.410 align:middle line:90%
I got to see what I witnessed.

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:45.070 align:middle line:84%
The third level is where
they grow all of their food.

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's the most incredible
hydroponics factory

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:52.990 align:middle line:90%
you've ever seen, racks of--

00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:56.380 align:middle line:84%
the entire population
is vegetarian.

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:59.560 align:middle line:84%
Whatever proteins they take
in is in the form of nuts

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:01.520 align:middle line:90%
and that type of protein thing.

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:07.030 align:middle line:84%
But what this population
eats is all grown here.

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:08.575 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow, the entire population?

00:31:08.575 --> 00:31:09.040 align:middle line:90%
>> All of it.

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:09.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, the--

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is about how
many, do you think?

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a good question.

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:15.520 align:middle line:90%
And I would love to validate it.

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:19.600 align:middle line:84%
Here's what I know,
that during the fall

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:24.760 align:middle line:84%
and when the remaining Lemurians
found their way to Telos

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:27.790 align:middle line:84%
and established themselves,
the number that seems--

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:30.640 align:middle line:84%
that people agree on is there
were 25,000 of them that

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:34.540 align:middle line:84%
were left, took what they could
before the entire population

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:37.430 align:middle line:84%
was gone, found their spot
in Telos and made home.

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:40.600 align:middle line:84%
It's said today that's
a million and a half.

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm not surprised by that.

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:45.820 align:middle line:84%
It's also been described that
this cavity that I was in

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:51.040 align:middle line:84%
and these five levels amassed
somewhere around 25 miles

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:53.270 align:middle line:90%
of space.

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:57.500 align:middle line:84%
So I'm anxious to go
back and look at more.

00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:59.560 align:middle line:90%
But anyway, back to this.

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:00.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, back on the tour.

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>> It was just the idea that an
entire population of those kind

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:07.000 align:middle line:90%
of numbers--

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.800 align:middle line:90%
and they still eat regularly.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:13.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, OK, three times a
day or two times a day or--

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know what
their habits are.

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:19.660 align:middle line:84%
But this just
regenerates in a way

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:24.610 align:middle line:84%
that, by the time it's
time for the next thing,

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:30.670 align:middle line:84%
this area of agriculture
has just perpetuated itself

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:31.510 align:middle line:90%
all over again.

00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:33.520 align:middle line:90%
Somehow it's more rapid.

00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to
think that that comes

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:36.790 align:middle line:90%
from crystal energy, of course.

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:38.140 align:middle line:90%
They're going to master that.

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:41.530 align:middle line:84%
But these guys have
access to technologies

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:45.760 align:middle line:90%
that we are hoping to evolve to.

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And we think we're pretty
technologically savvy

00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:49.090 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:51.460 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they don't have to worry
about GMOs and that type.

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:52.260 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:53.060 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:57.100 align:middle line:84%
They've got some kind of crystal
magic fueling their plants.

00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:57.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:01.815 align:middle line:84%
Well, it makes my
mind begin to wander

00:33:01.815 --> 00:33:03.190 align:middle line:84%
when you think
about what's going

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:08.590 align:middle line:84%
to happen with Ascension and
the physicalities of our bodies.

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:12.760 align:middle line:84%
My wonder is, if we can really
take in our energy directly

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:13.870 align:middle line:90%
from the sun--

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:14.830 align:middle line:90%
because think about it.

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:16.840 align:middle line:84%
When we eat, that's
exactly what we're doing.

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.090 align:middle line:84%
That solar energy
goes into plants.

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And really, that's
the healthiest part.

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:22.060 align:middle line:90%
We all know that.

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:24.490 align:middle line:84%
Every one of us that
eat vegetarianly

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:27.370 align:middle line:84%
know that the best
nutrients from the sun

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:29.530 align:middle line:84%
came out of these plants
because it's natural.

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:31.570 align:middle line:84%
Once we cook it, it loses
a little bit of that.

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And then meat, that's
a whole other realm.

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:35.920 align:middle line:90%
We get that.

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:39.610 align:middle line:84%
These people have figured
out how that works.

00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:43.120 align:middle line:84%
But I'm wondering, once we
take on a crystalline form,

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.290 align:middle line:90%
do we still eat that way?

00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Or do I just get my energy
directly from the sun?

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:49.360 align:middle line:84%
So let's take that
one step further.

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.850 align:middle line:84%
If I don't have to
eat, I don't really

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:54.580 align:middle line:84%
need to produce
any waste, right?

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:55.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:58.030 align:middle line:84%
That's what I-- through my
other interviews talking

00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:01.360 align:middle line:84%
with some of the other
extra-dimensional beings

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:04.930 align:middle line:84%
and their civilizations, they've
kind of gotten to that state.

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:08.710 align:middle line:84%
>> I have this idea that
the energy is metabolized

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:10.120 align:middle line:90%
in another way.

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:12.050 align:middle line:90%
And it's all used.

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:17.260 align:middle line:84%
So there's no residual
left to have to deal with.

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:19.523 align:middle line:84%
And then you just think
of all the landfills

00:34:19.523 --> 00:34:21.940 align:middle line:84%
and what we have to deal with
here in the third dimension.

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And wow, it'll be nice not
to have to deal with that.

00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:30.580 align:middle line:84%
The fourth level, I understand,
is some more manufacturing.

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:36.489 align:middle line:84%
And they have some parks
and places to enjoy nature.

00:34:36.489 --> 00:34:39.909 align:middle line:90%
Then the fifth level, which I--

00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:42.280 align:middle line:90%
here's what I want to see next.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:50.449 align:middle line:84%
This level is nothing but
nature, lakes, forest, flora

00:34:50.449 --> 00:34:53.510 align:middle line:84%
and fauna that used
to be on the surface,

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:59.000 align:middle line:84%
some we have never seen, animals
some have been on the surface.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.100 align:middle line:84%
Some have not been
on the surface

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:04.220 align:middle line:90%
that we have never seen.

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:09.200 align:middle line:84%
One day, we'll have the
opportunity to do so.

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:13.820 align:middle line:84%
Now that I understood
what I just took in,

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:15.380 align:middle line:84%
we're done with
this description,

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:17.310 align:middle line:84%
and we're back on
the first level.

00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And over to this--
when we first came in,

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:22.370 align:middle line:84%
there was a circular
room over here

00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:25.760 align:middle line:84%
that I would have
thought was a temple.

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:27.720 align:middle line:90%
And that's where we ended up.

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:30.650 align:middle line:90%
So this hovercraft lands here.

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:33.590 align:middle line:90%
And now my feet are on Telos.

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
doorway, really about

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.820 align:middle line:84%
the size of this
aperture right here.

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:42.170 align:middle line:84%
But along the sides, there
are like crystal panels

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:46.370 align:middle line:90%
which form this building.

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:49.160 align:middle line:84%
On the outside of
it was this etching

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:52.370 align:middle line:90%
that sure looked familiar to me.

00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:55.100 align:middle line:84%
When I had come to
Shasta the first time,

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:57.380 align:middle line:84%
I kind of familiarized
myself with downtown

00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:59.090 align:middle line:84%
and got to know some
of the shopkeepers.

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:01.620 align:middle line:84%
There was one shop that
was just so colorful.

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:02.840 align:middle line:90%
It just drew you in.

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:07.550 align:middle line:10%
Haruko is Blue Star Child.

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:12.140 align:middle line:10%
And the first day I
went in, I'm looking,

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:14.420 align:middle line:10%
and she's got 10 foot
ceilings in here.

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:19.130 align:middle line:84%
She's got some drawings that
are 10 feet tall and in panels

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:20.570 align:middle line:90%
this wide.

00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:24.830 align:middle line:84%
What I learned on my return
is she hand-draws those.

00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And when you see these, they're
almost perfect symmetric images

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:31.620 align:middle line:90%
of one another.

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And these are her
interpretations

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:36.680 align:middle line:90%
of new light codes.

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:40.520 align:middle line:84%
They were on inscribed
into the crystal wall here

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:41.870 align:middle line:90%
and the crystal wall there.

00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:42.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:44.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I thought I
had recognized it.

00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And I said Alex, I've
seen this before.

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh, yeah,
that's Haruko's work.

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:52.140 align:middle line:90%
That is the light code.

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:52.940 align:middle line:90%
>> He said that.

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:53.720 align:middle line:90%
He said Haruko specifically

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>> He said that.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:58.580 align:middle line:84%
That's the light code for
the new world blueprint.

00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And that one is the new
human angelic footprint.

00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:04.790 align:middle line:84%
We loved it so much we
engraved it right here.

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:08.690 align:middle line:84%
This room is the
council chamber.

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:13.570 align:middle line:84%
In the middle of it is
a circular wooden table

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:17.230 align:middle line:84%
embedded with beautiful crystals
with 15 chairs around it.

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And the room is
circular in nature.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:23.200 align:middle line:84%
But what you first express, what
you learn when you first move

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:27.370 align:middle line:84%
and your first is, there is a
palpable energy that is just

00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:29.290 align:middle line:90%
like pressing your chest.

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And my frame of that
kind of warm embrace

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:37.840 align:middle line:84%
came the first time I was
in an ayahuasca journey.

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And Mother Ayahuasca put her
arms around you and hung on.

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:45.310 align:middle line:84%
You just never wanted to
leave that sense of bliss.

00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:50.380 align:middle line:84%
This was an energy
that you felt.

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:52.600 align:middle line:84%
It made me think
afterwards, yeah, I

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:54.640 align:middle line:84%
guess if you were going
to have to be in a spot

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.432 align:middle line:84%
where you had to make
some decision-making,

00:37:56.432 --> 00:37:59.470 align:middle line:84%
you would get everybody
in this love fest first.

00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:01.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it had
the same effect on them

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:02.710 align:middle line:90%
that it did on me.

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:06.470 align:middle line:84%
All I can tell you is
that it was palpable.

00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:08.380 align:middle line:90%
It felt physical.

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:12.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, as soon as I was
getting used to that,

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:14.230 align:middle line:90%
five people walk in.

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:19.440 align:middle line:84%
There are four women
and a gentleman.

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:21.670 align:middle line:90%
They're all taller than I am.

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And the gentleman is
taller than they are.

00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And I recognize right away
from pictures I've seen of--

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.750 align:middle line:90%
that's Adama.

00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:36.120 align:middle line:84%
Adama is probably
8-plus feet tall.

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And he's as
magnificent as anybody.

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:42.000 align:middle line:84%
But he, when-- after
I saw Alex at first,

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.100 align:middle line:84%
and then I saw these
women, who you just

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:45.760 align:middle line:90%
expect to be beautiful.

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.930 align:middle line:84%
They all kind of looked
Scandinavian to me.

00:38:48.930 --> 00:38:53.730 align:middle line:84%
They have kind of a British kind
of accent when they do speak.

00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:57.990 align:middle line:84%
But holy cow, their
complexions are flawless.

00:38:57.990 --> 00:39:01.470 align:middle line:84%
Their skin just didn't
show any signs of age.

00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:02.850 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:06.970 align:middle line:84%
So they gestured me
to sit in a chair.

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:07.770 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>> The five that came
out were all women.

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:12.045 align:middle line:90%
>> Four women and Adama.

00:39:12.045 --> 00:39:13.200 align:middle line:90%
And so after--

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>> But there was
still the 13 chairs?

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:19.470 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, apparently, we were
going to use the room.

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And there were only
the seven of us then.

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:27.550 align:middle line:84%
So once I was seated, then
they took their positions.

00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:30.780 align:middle line:84%
So there was a female, and
then Adama, and another female,

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:32.610 align:middle line:84%
and then me, and
then another female,

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:34.950 align:middle line:84%
and Alex, and then
another female.

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And they all introduced
themselves to me

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:39.130 align:middle line:84%
and kind of gave me a
little bio on who they were.

00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:40.650 align:middle line:90%
But it went-- phht.

00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:44.670 align:middle line:84%
Other than-- I remember the name
of Adama, of course, and Alex.

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the
first woman who

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:49.030 align:middle line:84%
spoke who told me
her name was Shyama.

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Shyama.

00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:52.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And the only reason I
remember her is because when

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:55.060 align:middle line:84%
the dialogue began
it came from her.

00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:58.600 align:middle line:84%
So if you thought that there
was a chair for this meeting,

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:01.620 align:middle line:90%
she is that person.

00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:08.470 align:middle line:84%
She began to tell me the nature
of what was going on in Telos--

00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:10.650 align:middle line:90%
so this was last summer--

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:12.600 align:middle line:90%
prior to the winter solstice.

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And there was certainly
lots of sense in the air

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:21.510 align:middle line:84%
that the shift might be
imminent around winter solstice,

00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:26.310 align:middle line:90%
that the council was--

00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:28.920 align:middle line:84%
they believed that
the shift is imminent.

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And they believed it
was winter solstice.

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:36.030 align:middle line:84%
When she said that, chills
just went through my body.

00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:38.010 align:middle line:90%
Because look, I believe that.

00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:42.240 align:middle line:84%
I've been led to believe
that the shift in whatever

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:45.630 align:middle line:84%
solar flash that might
manifest itself in that way,

00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:47.640 align:middle line:90%
it's coming.

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Never mind I believe that I
came back in this incarnation

00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:54.280 align:middle line:84%
because the shift is going
to happen in my lifetime.

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:56.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, did she specifically
say solar flash?

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.120 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:00.240 align:middle line:84%
>> They mentioned that there
was going to be some type

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.180 align:middle line:90%
of phenomenon.

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And again, I believe in the
cyclical nature of the universe

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:07.710 align:middle line:90%
and how the cosmos works.

00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not paying
attention right now,

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:14.160 align:middle line:84%
we got bombarded with solar
energy from the sun now.

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:16.540 align:middle line:84%
>> In fact, yesterday and
the day before yesterday,

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:18.450 align:middle line:90%
we had some major--

00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:19.870 align:middle line:90%
what do you call it?

00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:20.670 align:middle line:90%
>> CMEs

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:21.470 align:middle line:90%
>> CMEs.

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I watch-- it's one of the
rabbit holes I found my way

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:26.760 align:middle line:90%
down into.

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:31.080 align:middle line:84%
If I understood the
nature of the universe

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:34.590 align:middle line:84%
and how it's cycling
into its new section,

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:39.870 align:middle line:84%
and where the Age of
Aquarius really kicks in,

00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:42.270 align:middle line:84%
according to the
linear timelines,

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:46.560 align:middle line:84%
I understand our solar system
entered this photon belt

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:50.190 align:middle line:84%
now for the next
2,000 years in 2012.

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:56.050 align:middle line:84%
By 2016, our entire solar
system now was in this.

00:41:56.050 --> 00:41:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And so now for the
next 2,000 years,

00:41:58.350 --> 00:42:02.730 align:middle line:84%
we're bathed with high
frequency photon energy that's

00:42:02.730 --> 00:42:05.310 align:middle line:84%
coming from Halcyon,
passing through our sun,

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:07.660 align:middle line:90%
and feeding its solar system.

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:12.690 align:middle line:84%
So these little maladies
that we think we're feeling,

00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:15.870 align:middle line:84%
think that there
is energy that--

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:19.590 align:middle line:84%
if you want to think of as
we're being mutated in some way

00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:22.620 align:middle line:84%
because there's changes
taking place with us--

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:23.850 align:middle line:90%
>> On a cellular level.

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:26.190 align:middle line:90%
>> --on a molecular DNA level.

00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's not changes so much
as we're getting to the point

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:32.760 align:middle line:84%
where the two strands that have
been here all along that we've

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:35.970 align:middle line:84%
been functioning on, and the
10 that we've been taught

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:37.440 align:middle line:90%
were all these deadlies.

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:38.490 align:middle line:90%
>> The junk cells yeah.

00:42:38.490 --> 00:42:40.470 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not junk DNA.

00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:42.630 align:middle line:90%
It's waiting to be activated.

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And now that our awakening
is coming around, all of us

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:47.670 align:middle line:90%
have been here before.

00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:49.080 align:middle line:90%
We have memories.

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:50.880 align:middle line:90%
We know what was here before.

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:53.610 align:middle line:84%
But something had to
trigger us out of that.

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:56.220 align:middle line:84%
Some of us have found
it along the way.

00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:59.980 align:middle line:84%
In my case, I was
awakened five years ago.

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:04.380 align:middle line:84%
I've been fortunate to
learn over the last, oh,

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:07.692 align:middle line:84%
several months especially, now
that the story has kind of got

00:43:07.692 --> 00:43:09.150 align:middle line:84%
out and you meet
these other people

00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:11.130 align:middle line:84%
that have had
similar experiences,

00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:14.730 align:middle line:84%
that their experiences
are just as remarkable.

00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And we're all moving
in the same direction.

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:18.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:21.290 align:middle line:90%
So Shyama-- Shyone?

00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:22.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Shyama.

00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:25.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Shyama was telling
you this event,

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:28.640 align:middle line:84%
something's going to
happen leading up to 2012--

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:29.790 align:middle line:90%
or, I'm sorry, 12, 20--

00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, winter solstice.

00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:33.795 align:middle line:90%
>> Was it-- it's the opposite.

00:43:33.795 --> 00:43:35.440 align:middle line:90%
So wait.

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:40.570 align:middle line:84%
2012 would be 2012,
December 21, 2012.

00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And then it's sort of like
the opposite of that is 2021.

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:46.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:47.540 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:50.230 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even put that
synchronicity together.

00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so then it's 2021,
which is still December 21.

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.600 align:middle line:90%
And then now we're--

00:43:58.600 --> 00:43:59.860 align:middle line:90%
all the numbers match anyway.

00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:03.202 align:middle line:84%
So it's just that
window is lopsided in.

00:44:03.202 --> 00:44:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Every time you turn
around, you figure out another

00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:07.570 align:middle line:84%
connection, and it finally
resonates with you.

00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:10.780 align:middle line:84%
But oh, I just
learned another thing.

00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:11.620 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:12.420 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>> It's good to keep your
eyes open and your ear open.

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:17.680 align:middle line:84%
But man, you got to
have an open heart

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:19.940 align:middle line:90%
to receive any of this first.

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>> So she's going down the list
of stuff coming down the pipe.

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:26.320 align:middle line:84%
>> That's really
what their focus was.

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
they want to reintegrate

00:44:29.590 --> 00:44:31.580 align:middle line:90%
with the surface.

00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:32.380 align:middle line:90%
It's their wish--

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:33.490 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what they said?

00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:37.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Absolutely, their wish, that
they have things that they want

00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:38.230 align:middle line:90%
to share with us.

00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like human
beings aren't without merit.

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:48.140 align:middle line:84%
We have free will and the
ability to be creative,

00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:51.640 align:middle line:84%
which is an anomaly
in the universe.

00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's watching what
we're doing right now.

00:44:55.090 --> 00:44:56.180 align:middle line:90%
They don't have free will.

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:56.980 align:middle line:90%
>> They don't?

00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>> But we live in
this third dimension,

00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:02.620 align:middle line:84%
and we were supposed to come
here and experiment and learn.

00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're pretty
much done with this.

00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:07.765 align:middle line:84%
But Earth is not the only
third-dimensional planet.

00:45:07.765 --> 00:45:10.660 align:middle line:90%


00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:12.640 align:middle line:90%
I can't chase that rabbit hole.

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:19.360 align:middle line:90%
But when the shift happens, we--

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:22.913 align:middle line:84%
it's a physical
shift, first of all.

00:45:22.913 --> 00:45:24.580 align:middle line:84%
People need to
understand the difference

00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:27.632 align:middle line:84%
between planetary ascension
and physical ascension.

00:45:27.632 --> 00:45:28.840 align:middle line:90%
They're two different things.

00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, explain that.

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Mother Earth is the one
that is being bathed with this

00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:36.760 align:middle line:90%
photon energy.

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And earthquakes
that we're suffering

00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:41.140 align:middle line:84%
and tornadoes and
all the other things

00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:45.020 align:middle line:84%
are manifestations of
this new energy coming in.

00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:47.830 align:middle line:84%
If you pay attention to any
of these solar storms that

00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:50.890 align:middle line:84%
are coming and see how
our magnetic field has

00:45:50.890 --> 00:45:53.980 align:middle line:84%
deteriorated, we're
just in a spot

00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:56.980 align:middle line:84%
where there's more of that
that comes in all the time.

00:45:56.980 --> 00:46:00.400 align:middle line:84%
There's a solar wind that
comes out of the coronal holes

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:01.720 align:middle line:90%
in the sun all the time.

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:02.750 align:middle line:90%
You can spot them.

00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And you see them, it looks
like big brown spots.

00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:07.270 align:middle line:84%
That's actually
magnetic information.

00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And there's what's
called an EMF,

00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:13.030 align:middle line:84%
an electromagnetic frequency
line between the sun and here.

00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:15.130 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't have
to randomly find us.

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:18.550 align:middle line:84%
It follows this
path and bathes us.

00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:22.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, what the magnetic
field can bounce off of it,

00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:25.330 align:middle line:84%
that just goes around
the Earth harmlessly.

00:46:25.330 --> 00:46:28.000 align:middle line:84%
However, we're to
the point where

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:34.150 align:middle line:84%
now the magnetic fields on
both top and bottom are moving.

00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:37.307 align:middle line:84%
They're not geographic
north anymore.

00:46:37.307 --> 00:46:38.890 align:middle line:84%
But they haven't
been for a long time.

00:46:38.890 --> 00:46:39.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, we've
been watching that.

00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Even airplanes-- we were
just having this conversation

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:47.810 align:middle line:84%
how even airports are having
to realign their magnetic north

00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:48.610 align:middle line:90%
instruments.

00:46:48.610 --> 00:46:50.950 align:middle line:90%
And runways are having to--

00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:54.070 align:middle line:84%
they're having to redo,
because pilots are landing--

00:46:54.070 --> 00:46:57.280 align:middle line:84%
having to figure out
things very quickly.

00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:58.990 align:middle line:90%
We're moving faster every year.

00:46:58.990 --> 00:47:01.480 align:middle line:84%
It seems it's getting
further off course.

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:03.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, consider the
natural phenomenon.

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:07.720 align:middle line:84%
You've seen all these stories
about whale pods being beached

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:11.830 align:middle line:84%
and animals that use
that magnetic frequency

00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:13.720 align:middle line:90%
for their migratory patterns.

00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And man, somehow their
compasses are off.

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:22.300 align:middle line:84%
They didn't do that because
they wanted to beach themselves.

00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:25.750 align:middle line:84%
They can't find the navigation
that somehow is just adjusting.

00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:30.850 align:middle line:84%
So Earth is just
adjusting to all this too.

00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And when she finally
ascends, which

00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:38.290 align:middle line:84%
that's the planetary part,
those sentient beings

00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:41.410 align:middle line:84%
that are on here have the
choice to go with her.

00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:45.130 align:middle line:84%
We don't get to ascend
separate from her.

00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:46.720 align:middle line:90%
We go with her.

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:49.660 align:middle line:84%
There are those of
us that are happy

00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:51.380 align:middle line:90%
in the third-dimensional world.

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And they want to stay and finish
playing out their lessons.

00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:58.960 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be cool,
from the way I understand

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:02.530 align:middle line:84%
how ascension works because
it's going to be immediate.

00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:04.870 align:middle line:84%
The day it happens,
it's like a snapshot.

00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:07.540 align:middle line:84%
You're going to just have a
different kind of awareness

00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:10.030 align:middle line:84%
and know that you're
just somewhere else.

00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:14.690 align:middle line:84%
Whatever made things were around
us won't be around us anymore.

00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:17.350 align:middle line:84%
We're back to square
one to start all over.

00:48:17.350 --> 00:48:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And those individuals
that chose not to ascend

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:23.180 align:middle line:84%
will find
third-dimensional places

00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:25.340 align:middle line:84%
to play out the rest
of their lessons.

00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:28.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, do you think that's
what happened with Telos--

00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:32.120 align:middle line:84%
with Lemuria back in
the day when there was

00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:35.193 align:middle line:84%
the fall, the dimension
that we're aware of,

00:48:35.193 --> 00:48:36.860 align:middle line:84%
and then they kind
of ascended, and they

00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:40.266 align:middle line:84%
chose to ascend in their--
in the cave, so they say?

00:48:40.266 --> 00:48:46.730 align:middle line:84%
>> They were-- they all
had a higher frequency.

00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:49.310 align:middle line:84%
I would like to
think that they had

00:48:49.310 --> 00:48:54.980 align:middle line:84%
even higher than
fifth-dimensional awareness.

00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:57.080 align:middle line:84%
But from how I ended
dimension-- how

00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:58.670 align:middle line:84%
I understand
dimensionality, once you

00:48:58.670 --> 00:49:00.425 align:middle line:84%
get to sixth-level
dimensionality,

00:49:00.425 --> 00:49:02.780 align:middle line:84%
you no longer require
physical form.

00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:04.610 align:middle line:84%
So fifth dimension
is really where

00:49:04.610 --> 00:49:09.620 align:middle line:84%
that caps out for a physical
humanity kind of body.

00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:10.730 align:middle line:90%
>> So you sit down.

00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:12.530 align:middle line:90%
So-- remind me her name.

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:13.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Shyama.

00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:15.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Shyama tells you that
about the Ascension story,

00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:18.050 align:middle line:84%
which you were a little
bit familiar with.

00:49:18.050 --> 00:49:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And you're getting
excited because you--

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:22.520 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm a believer.

00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:24.980 align:middle line:84%
When they validated what
I thought was coming,

00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:28.830 align:middle line:84%
man, if these beings think
that the shift is imminent,

00:49:28.830 --> 00:49:30.930 align:middle line:90%
then we're good to go.

00:49:30.930 --> 00:49:32.180 align:middle line:90%
>> And you went down the line.

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And then you said you forgot
what the others were saying.

00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>> They all introduced
themselves before this dialogue

00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:38.690 align:middle line:90%
with her began.

00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And again, they repeated
their names to me.

00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:45.240 align:middle line:90%
I just-- I couldn't retain it.

00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:50.000 align:middle line:84%
I remember her because she
just continued the dialogue.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And then you
eventually got to Adama.

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:54.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Adama kind of closed it all.

00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:55.910 align:middle line:90%
We weren't finished with her.

00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see.

00:49:56.450 --> 00:49:57.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:57.250 --> 00:50:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Once she kind of set the
stage on what they wanted

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:05.900 align:middle line:84%
and what their goal was, to
reintegrate with the surface

00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:09.440 align:middle line:84%
beings, now I was going to find
out why I got invited to this

00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:10.550 align:middle line:90%
party.

00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:12.360 align:middle line:90%
There were three reasons.

00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:15.050 align:middle line:84%
The first was that I
had demonstrated it

00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:16.850 align:middle line:84%
well enough to them
that I can hold

00:50:16.850 --> 00:50:21.620 align:middle line:90%
fifth-dimension consciousness.

00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:24.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And how did they explain
you doing that, just by you,

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:26.390 align:middle line:90%
you being Lowell?

00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:27.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Apparently so.

00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:29.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Maybe your meditations.

00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:31.050 align:middle line:90%
>> It's been a while.

00:50:31.050 --> 00:50:33.380 align:middle line:84%
It took me a while
to get to that place,

00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:37.145 align:middle line:84%
where I am settled
with my truths.

00:50:37.145 --> 00:50:39.890 align:middle line:90%


00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:43.430 align:middle line:84%
They were hard fought
and happily won.

00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:48.980 align:middle line:84%
But they're still-- they
were truths nonetheless.

00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:51.860 align:middle line:84%
During your career when you're
working for someone else

00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:54.920 align:middle line:84%
and under the influence of all
the other things in your life

00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:57.740 align:middle line:84%
from the outside, you're
always afraid to say

00:50:57.740 --> 00:50:59.090 align:middle line:90%
what's really in your heart.

00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:02.090 align:middle line:90%
It's always your first impulse.

00:51:02.090 --> 00:51:04.760 align:middle line:84%
But you don't let it out for
whatever the reason is-- hurt

00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:07.640 align:middle line:90%
somebody's feelings, whatever.

00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:10.250 align:middle line:84%
My first ayahuasca journey
said that very thing.

00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:12.620 align:middle line:84%
Mother Ayahuasca said
in the middle of it,

00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:14.900 align:middle line:90%
you know your truths.

00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Be bold and confident
in saying them.

00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know what
that meant at the time.

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:22.880 align:middle line:90%
So you tuck it away.

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And when it finally
integrates, when now you

00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:29.150 align:middle line:84%
come into these kind of
truths and miraculous

00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:32.000 align:middle line:84%
things that can be
explained no other way,

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.490 align:middle line:84%
you just have to let
it come out the way

00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:37.250 align:middle line:84%
that spirit expresses
it in you without trying

00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:39.660 align:middle line:90%
to filter it in any way.

00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>> So they told you
that you have the heart.

00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:43.640 align:middle line:84%
You have the heart to
carry this message.

00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:46.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, two was I was the--

00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:47.930 align:middle line:90%
I am the protector of Gaia.

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And where I'm going next,
I've made the choice

00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:54.500 align:middle line:90%
to stay with New Earth.

00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, whatever the role
of protector of Gaia means,

00:51:59.630 --> 00:52:01.550 align:middle line:90%
that's what I get to do next.

00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:03.740 align:middle line:90%
I envisioned in my mind that--

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:06.037 align:middle line:90%
>> At that time, you didn't--

00:52:06.037 --> 00:52:08.120 align:middle line:84%
they said this, and you
were kind of on that path.

00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:10.400 align:middle line:84%
>> That was at the ayahuasca
journey two years ago.

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:11.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK, so you--

00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:12.470 align:middle line:90%
>> How did they know?

00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:13.340 align:middle line:90%
>> It resonated.

00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:14.360 align:middle line:90%
You felt that.

00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:15.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:16.880 align:middle line:90%
But it's true.

00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:20.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm so tied to nature.

00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:23.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm just in my element
when I'm there.

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:26.960 align:middle line:84%
When they suggested that was
a role I would get to play,

00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:30.080 align:middle line:90%
man, I just delighted in that.

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:35.420 align:middle line:84%
I had-- I saw myself
as a sorcerer of types.

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:37.010 align:middle line:90%
And I had a staff.

00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:40.010 align:middle line:90%
And the staff had a crystal.

00:52:40.010 --> 00:52:41.887 align:middle line:90%
I have this crystal staff.

00:52:41.887 --> 00:52:43.595 align:middle line:84%
>> Was this during
your ahuyasca journey?

00:52:43.595 --> 00:52:44.395 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:52:44.395 --> 00:52:45.500 align:middle line:90%
Here it is.

00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:47.420 align:middle line:90%
It's a piece of sugilite.

00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:48.920 align:middle line:90%
It's purple in nature.

00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:50.540 align:middle line:90%
It is a love stone.

00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:54.980 align:middle line:84%
But it's also a stone
of transmutation.

00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:59.240 align:middle line:84%
So changing negative
energy into light

00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:01.010 align:middle line:84%
is exactly what
this thing is for.

00:53:01.010 --> 00:53:06.080 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, once I got to
where I would be able to assist

00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:09.860 align:middle line:84%
others with their journey, and
maybe you weren't a willing

00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:13.760 align:middle line:84%
participant-- you wanted to
go, but you weren't sure--

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:19.760 align:middle line:84%
a moment with the crystal
would help you see the truth.

00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And now you can
make your decision.

00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:25.900 align:middle line:84%
But once your heart
has been enlightened

00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:29.650 align:middle line:84%
and your karma still
has to be cleared.

00:53:29.650 --> 00:53:31.630 align:middle line:84%
That's what the fourth
dimension is about.

00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:34.450 align:middle line:84%
You've got to make your
balance before you can ascend.

00:53:34.450 --> 00:53:35.950 align:middle line:90%
But it's a quick process.

00:53:35.950 --> 00:53:38.020 align:middle line:84%
You're not staying
in 4D very long.

00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:40.690 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm, you're going home.

00:53:40.690 --> 00:53:41.710 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:53:41.710 --> 00:53:43.760 align:middle line:90%
>> And what was the third thing?

00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:46.150 align:middle line:84%
So nature-- heart, big
heart, nature connections--

00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:51.730 align:middle line:84%
>> That they were looking
for beings, surface beings,

00:53:51.730 --> 00:53:56.290 align:middle line:84%
that would be willing to be
emissaries when the time when

00:53:56.290 --> 00:54:00.520 align:middle line:84%
the shift came and humanity's
consciousness rose to the point

00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:03.910 align:middle line:84%
where they would wish to
communicate with us again.

00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:08.200 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to see if I would be
interested in being an emissary

00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:09.520 align:middle line:90%
when that came.

00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:10.630 align:middle line:90%
>> And how did that feel?

00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:11.430 align:middle line:90%
>> [SIGHS]

00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:12.618 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:54:12.618 --> 00:54:14.110 align:middle line:90%


00:54:14.110 --> 00:54:15.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Humility.

00:54:15.730 --> 00:54:18.910 align:middle line:90%
Gratitude.

00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:21.610 align:middle line:90%
Just humbling.

00:54:21.610 --> 00:54:24.370 align:middle line:84%
It's just a wave
that comes over you.

00:54:24.370 --> 00:54:29.050 align:middle line:84%
The notion that comes
into your head is, why me?

00:54:29.050 --> 00:54:31.750 align:middle line:84%
But you don't
articulate that right.

00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:34.270 align:middle line:84%
I just answered, I
would be honored to.

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And with that, the
meeting was done.

00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:40.510 align:middle line:84%
They stood up, and they
bowed in my direction,

00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:41.560 align:middle line:90%
and they were off.

00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:44.440 align:middle line:84%
They accomplished whatever
task they needed to be.

00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:48.640 align:middle line:84%
Looking back at it, I got
enough of a view of Telos

00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:51.130 align:middle line:90%
to see that this is legit.

00:54:51.130 --> 00:54:55.240 align:middle line:84%
They expressed what they were
interested in communicating

00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:56.180 align:middle line:90%
with me.

00:54:56.180 --> 00:54:57.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, you said Adama closed.

00:54:57.490 --> 00:54:58.780 align:middle line:90%
Did he have any closing words?

00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, he just said--

00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:07.180 align:middle line:84%
he confirmed that they were
honored that I would be--

00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:09.192 align:middle line:84%
he represented the
council on this matter.

00:55:09.192 --> 00:55:10.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to remember
the way he said it

00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:12.700 align:middle line:90%
because it was so elegant.

00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:14.680 align:middle line:84%
He represented the
council in this matter.

00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And they were all in agreement
that the shift was imminent

00:55:19.450 --> 00:55:21.370 align:middle line:84%
and that, if you
were willing to be

00:55:21.370 --> 00:55:25.330 align:middle line:84%
an emissary when the time came,
we would really appreciate it.

00:55:25.330 --> 00:55:27.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Did-- what did
his voice sound like?

00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:28.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Deep.

00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:29.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Deep.

00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:30.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Deep, resonating--

00:55:30.370 --> 00:55:31.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:37.150 align:middle line:84%
>> --like there was a vibration
physically when he spoke,

00:55:37.150 --> 00:55:39.975 align:middle line:84%
more so than the other
people in the room.

00:55:39.975 --> 00:55:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't like they
didn't have great statures.

00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:45.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm 6 feet tall, and I was the
shortest person in the room.

00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Adama is just an
overwhelming-- but, oh, my God.

00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:49.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Long hair.

00:55:49.930 --> 00:55:50.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:50.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah?

00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:51.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:53.650 align:middle line:90%
>> And blond you said?

00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:55.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Blond, all looked--

00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:57.070 align:middle line:90%
had Scandinavian looks.

00:55:57.070 --> 00:55:59.140 align:middle line:84%
>> And wore the same
kind of robe stuff?

00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>> White garments,
not the same apparel,

00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:05.000 align:middle line:84%
but just a simple
white kind of garment.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:05.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:07.900 align:middle line:84%
Did they all have this
ribbon thing that Alex had?

00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:08.700 align:middle line:90%
Just Alex.

00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Alex-- Adama had
some other kind of sash.

00:56:12.190 --> 00:56:18.730 align:middle line:84%
I had-- you got to think
that the high priest would

00:56:18.730 --> 00:56:21.010 align:middle line:84%
have some other kind of
designation in that way.

00:56:21.010 --> 00:56:23.770 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think--
we're all looking

00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:26.050 align:middle line:84%
at things from our
third-dimensional, the way

00:56:26.050 --> 00:56:29.470 align:middle line:84%
that our ego wants
to classify things.

00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:31.240 align:middle line:90%
That's not important to them.

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:34.120 align:middle line:90%
They're all part of one another.

00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:36.010 align:middle line:84%
They just have
different roles to play.

00:56:36.010 --> 00:56:38.830 align:middle line:84%
They all have unique,
individual gifts.

00:56:38.830 --> 00:56:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, when you
knit that all together,

00:56:41.530 --> 00:56:47.860 align:middle line:84%
that collective community
is capable of accomplishing

00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:49.580 align:middle line:90%
things that are magic.

00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:50.892 align:middle line:90%
Wait till we get there.

00:56:50.892 --> 00:56:53.350 align:middle line:84%
>> During this time, is that--
did they give you more about

00:56:53.350 --> 00:56:55.165 align:middle line:84%
their civilization and
what they're doing?

00:56:55.165 --> 00:56:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:56:55.450 --> 00:56:56.658 align:middle line:90%
>> No, they didn't give you--

00:56:56.658 --> 00:56:58.750 align:middle line:84%
>> When the meeting was
over, we left the room,

00:56:58.750 --> 00:57:01.060 align:middle line:84%
got back on the hovercraft,
and made our way back

00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:03.227 align:middle line:90%
to the staging area.

00:57:03.227 --> 00:57:04.810 align:middle line:84%
I had not said a
word other than that.

00:57:04.810 --> 00:57:05.665 align:middle line:84%
>> Did they give you
anything to drink?

00:57:05.665 --> 00:57:06.465 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:57:06.465 --> 00:57:07.690 align:middle line:90%
Or water, offer you anything?

00:57:07.690 --> 00:57:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>> No, there was no
refreshment opportunity.

00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:11.680 align:middle line:90%
It was not that.

00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:13.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Were you thirsty
at all or hungry?

00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:13.870 align:middle line:90%
Did you feel any of that?

00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:15.578 align:middle line:84%
>> No, didn't even
think about any of it.

00:57:15.578 --> 00:57:17.405 align:middle line:84%
None of it-- nothing
occurred to me

00:57:17.405 --> 00:57:19.280 align:middle line:84%
other than what was
going on around the time.

00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:20.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Bathroom breaks or anything?

00:57:20.290 --> 00:57:20.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Nope.

00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:21.220 align:middle line:90%
>> No?

00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:22.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:22.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:24.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>> When we got to the
end, I had two questions.

00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:31.450 align:middle line:90%
Would I get to come back?

00:57:31.450 --> 00:57:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And he answered, yes,
you'll be able to return

00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:35.230 align:middle line:90%
before the shift.

00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:36.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Was this to Alex or Adama?

00:57:36.670 --> 00:57:37.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Alex.

00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:41.420 align:middle line:90%
>> When that is, I don't know.

00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:42.670 align:middle line:90%
All I can tell you--

00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:44.920 align:middle line:84%
and those others
that still believe

00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:47.680 align:middle line:84%
that winter solstice was
when the shift was supposed

00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:51.800 align:middle line:84%
to happen, those that look at
it and say, well, what happened,

00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:53.950 align:middle line:90%
nothing happened--

00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:55.390 align:middle line:84%
>> To some people,
to some of us--

00:57:55.390 --> 00:57:56.080 align:middle line:90%
>> --think again.

00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:57.372 align:middle line:90%
>> --some major stuff happened.

00:57:57.372 --> 00:57:58.810 align:middle line:90%
>> It's all going on.

00:57:58.810 --> 00:58:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's been going
on for a while.

00:58:01.250 --> 00:58:04.450 align:middle line:90%
It's just finally crescendoing.

00:58:04.450 --> 00:58:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And all our work
right now is just

00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:10.605 align:middle line:84%
to try and help illuminate
for other people.

00:58:10.605 --> 00:58:11.980 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
going to get it.

00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:13.730 align:middle line:84%
Some of them have heard
something about it

00:58:13.730 --> 00:58:14.990 align:middle line:90%
and maybe are curious.

00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And there are those
that'll never get it.

00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:20.260 align:middle line:84%
All we get to do before
the end-- because look,

00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:24.400 align:middle line:84%
when I thought it was winter
solstice, the idea that you

00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:27.910 align:middle line:84%
and I were going to have this,
to document it in some way,

00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:30.490 align:middle line:84%
we were never going to have
a chance to play it out.

00:58:30.490 --> 00:58:32.950 align:middle line:84%
The shift was going to
come and go before then.

00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:34.280 align:middle line:90%
But it hasn't yet.

00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:39.250 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, we're not done
with whatever we're here to do.

00:58:39.250 --> 00:58:41.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm not finished
because I'm still here.

00:58:41.710 --> 00:58:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And there's-- look at where
I've found myself since that

00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:47.500 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And if you just look
at what happened

00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:51.430 align:middle line:84%
to me over the last few
days with the crystal

00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:54.550 align:middle line:84%
skull and that
energy enhancement,

00:58:54.550 --> 00:58:59.570 align:middle line:84%
how did I get there, and the
benefits that came out of that?

00:58:59.570 --> 00:59:04.450 align:middle line:84%
The second question was, can
I tell anybody else about

00:59:04.450 --> 00:59:06.010 align:middle line:90%
what happened to me here?

00:59:06.010 --> 00:59:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And he kind of smiled,
and he said, the council--

00:59:09.610 --> 00:59:12.220 align:middle line:84%
the fact that we believe
that the shift is imminent,

00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:14.530 align:middle line:84%
you can tell anybody
that you want.

00:59:14.530 --> 00:59:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not
going to be like

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.180 align:middle line:84%
they're going to find their way
down here without the same way

00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:20.920 align:middle line:90%
that you found your way here.

00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:22.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:59:22.570 --> 00:59:27.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Going back,
this idea of six--

00:59:27.310 --> 00:59:30.250 align:middle line:84%
you said six and six and
then Adama was the 13.

00:59:30.250 --> 00:59:31.750 align:middle line:90%
Was that six male, six female?

00:59:31.750 --> 00:59:32.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:34.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that something
that Alex told you?

00:59:34.030 --> 00:59:34.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:59:34.830 --> 00:59:36.610 align:middle line:90%
And it was purposeful.

00:59:36.610 --> 00:59:39.430 align:middle line:84%
It's to balance
masculine energy.

00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:41.890 align:middle line:84%
In order for us to
ascend, everything

00:59:41.890 --> 00:59:44.432 align:middle line:90%
is going to have to be balanced.

00:59:44.432 --> 00:59:46.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that what he said,
too, or are you just--

00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:46.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:59:46.690 --> 00:59:47.890 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, he can explain that.

00:59:47.890 --> 00:59:49.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's been kind of
ingrained into me since I was

00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:50.890 align:middle line:90%
young anyway.

00:59:50.890 --> 00:59:52.390 align:middle line:90%
I always had--

00:59:52.390 --> 00:59:57.400 align:middle line:84%
I understood feminine
energy and how it

00:59:57.400 --> 00:59:59.500 align:middle line:90%
worked with masculine energy.

00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:00.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm a hockey player.

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm a pretty macho guy.

01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:05.620 align:middle line:84%
But I could always see the
feminine side of things.

01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:08.980 align:middle line:84%
I got to say that was
just preparation--

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:10.090 align:middle line:90%
not preparation.

01:00:10.090 --> 01:00:11.440 align:middle line:90%
That's who I was.

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.040 align:middle line:90%
That's who we all are.

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:14.950 align:middle line:84%
We just have to remember
that's who we are,

01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:18.520 align:middle line:84%
and that's our
relationship with others.

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:20.080 align:middle line:90%
It's recall.

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:22.270 align:middle line:84%
But it's buried
in that DNA that's

01:00:22.270 --> 01:00:24.130 align:middle line:90%
just waiting to be activated.

01:00:24.130 --> 01:00:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And there's some trigger
that hits all of us.

01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:31.690 align:middle line:84%
I know part of my DNA has
already been activated.

01:00:31.690 --> 01:00:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Some of that came from records
I got back from the Akash.

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:39.190 align:middle line:84%
It's not some information
that's out there somewhere

01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:40.510 align:middle line:90%
we have access to.

01:00:40.510 --> 01:00:43.090 align:middle line:84%
Man, it's an
interconnection we have

01:00:43.090 --> 01:00:47.420 align:middle line:90%
to a whole realm of information.

01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And when we take how
beautiful every individual is

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:57.580 align:middle line:84%
and their individual gifts
and their contributions

01:00:57.580 --> 01:00:59.380 align:middle line:84%
and how beautiful
that is, now when

01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:01.630 align:middle line:84%
you start to put all those
together because there's

01:01:01.630 --> 01:01:06.130 align:middle line:84%
no duplication, holy cow, look
at what we can accomplish,

01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:09.610 align:middle line:84%
and the gifts that we have
when her piece comes into play

01:01:09.610 --> 01:01:13.120 align:middle line:84%
and his piece comes into play
and your piece and my piece.

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's been a few months,
but I interviewed Asara.

01:01:17.850 --> 01:01:20.250 align:middle line:90%
She channeled in Adama.

01:01:20.250 --> 01:01:24.030 align:middle line:84%
We had just found out about
you, literally like the day

01:01:24.030 --> 01:01:25.440 align:middle line:90%
before the interview.

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:28.792 align:middle line:84%
And I reached out to her-- when
we were talking, I said, hey,

01:01:28.792 --> 01:01:30.000 align:middle line:90%
do you know this guy, Lowell?

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yeah,
he reached out to me.

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:33.300 align:middle line:84%
I think you called
her or something.

01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:33.870 align:middle line:90%
>> I did.

01:01:33.870 --> 01:01:35.340 align:middle line:84%
Look, when I came
off the mountain,

01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:37.298 align:middle line:84%
the first thing you want
to do is just validate

01:01:37.298 --> 01:01:39.510 align:middle line:90%
what the hell happened to me.

01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:43.630 align:middle line:84%
When I came off back
to the parking lot,

01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:46.620 align:middle line:84%
the first thing that you just
think is none of these people

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:48.700 align:middle line:84%
have any idea what
just happened to me.

01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And my way down the mountain,
I'm trying to figure out,

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.090 align:middle line:90%
what do I do with this?

01:01:54.090 --> 01:01:58.260 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing I think
is, Bev at the crystal shop,

01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:01.410 align:middle line:84%
she'll resonate with
this, or she's got to--

01:02:01.410 --> 01:02:03.270 align:middle line:84%
she's certainly aware
of Telos, and she's

01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:05.880 align:middle line:90%
part of that whole energy here.

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:07.980 align:middle line:84%
She can at least
help me, point me

01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:09.663 align:middle line:84%
to somebody that can
help me with this.

01:02:09.663 --> 01:02:10.830 align:middle line:90%
>> So you went to Bev first.

01:02:10.830 --> 01:02:12.990 align:middle line:90%
>> I went to see Bev first.

01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:15.600 align:middle line:90%
And she had people in there.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:18.960 align:middle line:84%
I had enough time to
tell her what happened.

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:22.305 align:middle line:84%
And she just kind of
looked at me like it was--

01:02:22.305 --> 01:02:23.310 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what happens.

01:02:23.310 --> 01:02:24.630 align:middle line:90%
>> She expected.

01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:25.930 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a surprise.

01:02:25.930 --> 01:02:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And I was kind of
surprised by that

01:02:27.630 --> 01:02:31.570 align:middle line:84%
because this was
magnificent to me.

01:02:31.570 --> 01:02:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And then I tried to go
see Haruko because--

01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:35.730 align:middle line:84%
look, you need to
see what I saw.

01:02:35.730 --> 01:02:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>> The light codes,
right, right, right.

01:02:36.330 --> 01:02:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>> She was closed that
day, so I didn't get to.

01:02:38.490 --> 01:02:40.380 align:middle line:90%
I had to go back.

01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:42.750 align:middle line:84%
>> What did Haruko
say when you told her?

01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:43.950 align:middle line:90%
>> I think she--

01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:48.430 align:middle line:84%
it didn't really register yet,
until I had posted it again

01:02:48.430 --> 01:02:49.230 align:middle line:90%
on Facebook.

01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:50.370 align:middle line:90%
And then we friended.

01:02:50.370 --> 01:02:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think once
she got a chance

01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:55.590 align:middle line:90%
to digest it then, oh, my God.

01:02:55.590 --> 01:02:59.580 align:middle line:84%
I had gone back to the
shop before I left town

01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:02.400 align:middle line:84%
because she has some
smaller versions

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:04.290 align:middle line:84%
of these great big
things she's drawn,

01:03:04.290 --> 01:03:08.130 align:middle line:84%
and I just wanted to have one
so that people could understand

01:03:08.130 --> 01:03:11.910 align:middle line:84%
what it is that I saw, because
her work is incredible.

01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:13.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Cool, I look
forward to meeting her.

01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:17.980 align:middle line:84%
>> You'll freak out when you see
that, to see this little woman,

01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:19.410 align:middle line:90%
she does these by hand.

01:03:19.410 --> 01:03:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And they take about three
months for her to produce.

01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:25.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And then Asara,
what led you to Asara?

01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:26.700 align:middle line:90%
>> I started to--

01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:28.710 align:middle line:84%
when I got back
to my room, I just

01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:31.440 align:middle line:84%
started to research anything I
could find about anybody that

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:34.110 align:middle line:90%
had any connections to Telos.

01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Asara was one of
those that came up.

01:03:36.030 --> 01:03:38.430 align:middle line:90%
So she had contact information.

01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:42.510 align:middle line:84%
So I got a voicemail,
left my dialogue.

01:03:42.510 --> 01:03:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And within a half an
hour, she called me back.

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:48.180 align:middle line:84%
We were on the phone
for the next two hours

01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:51.060 align:middle line:84%
so that I could
find some validation

01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:55.380 align:middle line:84%
from someone that has some kind
of connection to Telos, Adama.

01:03:55.380 --> 01:03:57.270 align:middle line:90%
You seem to have that.

01:03:57.270 --> 01:03:58.800 align:middle line:90%
I need a touchstone.

01:03:58.800 --> 01:03:59.820 align:middle line:90%
Can you help?

01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And she couldn't have
been more gracious.

01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:06.150 align:middle line:84%
>> She did mention that,
during your conversation,

01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:10.030 align:middle line:84%
you mentioned a couple of spots
that she had seen astrally,

01:04:10.030 --> 01:04:12.510 align:middle line:84%
that she had been
there and seen,

01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:15.460 align:middle line:84%
that she had never
published or talked about,

01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:19.440 align:middle line:84%
which confirmed for her
that you were really there.

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>> She did tell me
that after the fact.

01:04:21.570 --> 01:04:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And it just made me feel good
because this is a crazy story.

01:04:27.690 --> 01:04:29.160 align:middle line:90%
Who's going to validate it?

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:31.830 align:middle line:90%
I was alone.

01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:34.830 align:middle line:84%
I can tell crazier
stories than this.

01:04:34.830 --> 01:04:37.410 align:middle line:90%
And--

01:04:37.410 --> 01:04:39.210 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

01:04:39.210 --> 01:04:44.250 align:middle line:84%
There's just no reason for me to
make this particular story up.

01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:47.130 align:middle line:84%
It's just, I have
a new appreciation

01:04:47.130 --> 01:04:50.790 align:middle line:84%
for every time you want the
universe to surprise you,

01:04:50.790 --> 01:04:54.210 align:middle line:84%
she blows you away with
what she shows you next,

01:04:54.210 --> 01:04:58.680 align:middle line:84%
if you're just open
to an experience.

01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:03.810 align:middle line:84%
I have had experiences
with people that channel.

01:05:03.810 --> 01:05:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And there are those
that are authentic,

01:05:06.330 --> 01:05:07.830 align:middle line:90%
and you know it right away.

01:05:07.830 --> 01:05:11.310 align:middle line:84%
There is a sense that
you get in their aura

01:05:11.310 --> 01:05:15.120 align:middle line:84%
when they begin to
express those things that

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:16.680 align:middle line:90%
need be expressed from them.

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:18.420 align:middle line:90%
It's authentic.

01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:20.490 align:middle line:84%
I've had those
experiences with them.

01:05:20.490 --> 01:05:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And I've also had experiences
with the chandlers

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:26.010 align:middle line:90%
that don't go that way.

01:05:26.010 --> 01:05:27.430 align:middle line:90%
She was not that.

01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And so it was warming for me to
contact Asara and have her just

01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:39.420 align:middle line:84%
listen to what it is, and
then make of it what you will.

01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:43.350 align:middle line:84%
Then when she said, you
described things to me

01:05:43.350 --> 01:05:47.310 align:middle line:84%
that I've seen but I
have never talked about.

01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And I asked her, why have you
never expressed those things?

01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:54.270 align:middle line:84%
She said, because
I was told not to.

01:05:54.270 --> 01:05:57.340 align:middle line:84%
The day will come when
they'll allow me to do that.

01:05:57.340 --> 01:05:59.580 align:middle line:84%
But the things that I've
been allowed to talk about,

01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:00.403 align:middle line:90%
they say yes.

01:06:00.403 --> 01:06:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And then there are things that
I'm not allowed to talk to,

01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:04.604 align:middle line:90%
and that is one of them.

01:06:04.604 --> 01:06:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:09.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's amazing
that you went there.

01:06:09.930 --> 01:06:12.240 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing that you're
able to share this.

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And we're still kind of
unpacking and developing

01:06:15.870 --> 01:06:23.490 align:middle line:84%
this connection that we have to
the mountain and its portals.

01:06:23.490 --> 01:06:24.780 align:middle line:90%
Who knows what's next, right?

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>> The good news is that they're
here and that we get to do it

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:29.880 align:middle line:90%
again.

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:31.200 align:middle line:90%
The question is when.

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:36.030 align:middle line:84%
So all we can do is
prepare for that day.

01:06:36.030 --> 01:06:38.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And keep doing
our work, our play.

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>> We have busy work to do
before the universe is done

01:06:41.010 --> 01:06:42.150 align:middle line:90%
with us.

01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:43.590 align:middle line:90%
I guess that's what we just do.

01:06:43.590 --> 01:06:47.040 align:middle line:84%
We'll march through those
steps until the next thing.

01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:50.040 align:middle line:84%
But look at what the
next thing was for me.

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:53.260 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was coming to do
an interview with Reuben--

01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:54.060 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>> --to follow up on
the Telos interview.

01:06:57.330 --> 01:07:02.460 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, I found myself
in a crystal skull quest

01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:07.110 align:middle line:84%
with three opportunities to sit
with a crystal that affected me

01:07:07.110 --> 01:07:08.880 align:middle line:90%
in profound ways.

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:12.810 align:middle line:90%
And my battery is still--

01:07:12.810 --> 01:07:15.150 align:middle line:90%
maybe a few months after this--

01:07:15.150 --> 01:07:16.560 align:middle line:90%
and we will talk, of course.

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:19.102 align:middle line:84%
>> You're glowing, but that's
half because we were in the sun

01:07:19.102 --> 01:07:19.996 align:middle line:90%
all day yesterday.

01:07:19.996 --> 01:07:20.796 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

01:07:20.796 --> 01:07:22.785 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, there's just
still lots to process.

01:07:22.785 --> 01:07:24.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, there's a lot.

01:07:24.310 --> 01:07:25.740 align:middle line:90%
>> But everybody needs to know.

01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:27.707 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you for sharing.

01:07:27.707 --> 01:07:28.507 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for--

01:07:28.507 --> 01:07:29.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks for asking me.

01:07:29.550 --> 01:07:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>> --for your willingness
to go on this journey,

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:34.530 align:middle line:84%
both with us in
the crystal skull,

01:07:34.530 --> 01:07:37.290 align:middle line:84%
and for sharing your
journey with Telos,

01:07:37.290 --> 01:07:39.740 align:middle line:90%
and merging these worlds.

01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:43.490 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what we're
doing here with my show.
