00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:22.280 align:middle line:84%
more aware of where you continue
to enforce your limitation,

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.230 align:middle line:84%

How do you bring them in?

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So I just close my eyes and
allow my consciousness to sort

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.820 align:middle line:84%
of step outside and
take a few deep breaths.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.290 align:middle line:84%
Usually about
three deep breaths,

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.540 align:middle line:90%
and the Council will come in.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And if you and the listening
audience can kind of also

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.310 align:middle line:90%
be in that moment.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Just close your eyes
and take a deep breath,

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.000 align:middle line:84%
you can maybe even feel for the
energy coming in as they do.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.270 align:middle line:84%
If someone's new to channeling
and they've never seen it,

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.010 align:middle line:84%
my eyes are closed, and my
voice changes a little bit.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.300 align:middle line:84%
The cadence of my speaking
changes a little bit.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.320 align:middle line:84%
But I tell people, even when
they're watching an interview,

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.070 align:middle line:84%
the more they can just
really take a deep breath

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.900 align:middle line:84%
and feel for the
energy coming in,

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.750 align:middle line:90%
it's an incredible experience.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And while the words
and the wisdom

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.220 align:middle line:84%
and all the wonderful
things that they say

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.550 align:middle line:84%
are so incredible for
everyone, no matter

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.010 align:middle line:84%
when you're listening
to it or watching it,

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.470 align:middle line:84%
it is bringing in a
frequency and vibration

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.230 align:middle line:84%
that you can feel no matter
where you are as you're having

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.490 align:middle line:90%
the experience here with us.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.040 align:middle line:90%
So have fun with it.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.840 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy it.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so excited to share
this with you and your audience.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.150 align:middle line:90%
Are you present?

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Are you aware of what's
happening in the moment

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.755 align:middle line:90%
or do you go completely out?

00:03:48.755 --> 00:03:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>> I am.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.150 align:middle line:84%
It's a much different
perspective.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.310 align:middle line:90%
It's a much different awareness.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.220 align:middle line:84%
It's like my consciousness
merges with theirs,

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.490 align:middle line:84%
and I see things from
a much broader level.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.350 align:middle line:84%
I've done many of sessions
that were emotional,

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.770 align:middle line:84%
either extremely
positive or some

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.650 align:middle line:84%
that people were dealing with
some really emotional things

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.030 align:middle line:90%
during the session.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And from that state of
consciousness with the Council,

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.040 align:middle line:90%
everything is known.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And from that
perspective, there's

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.160 align:middle line:84%
no forgetting of who you are
and the divine eternal being

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.450 align:middle line:90%
that you are.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.700 align:middle line:90%
And so there is not a sadness.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.000 align:middle line:84%
They don't go into
that grief or sadness.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.330 align:middle line:84%
So when I am receiving
them and channeling them,

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.850 align:middle line:84%
I experience it from
that perspective as well.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.310 align:middle line:90%
Just knowing that all is well.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.920 align:middle line:84%
That there's nothing wrong,
and that there's nothing wrong

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.980 align:middle line:84%
certainly with you or
anyone listening to it that

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.820 align:middle line:84%
may be going
through a huge shift

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.800 align:middle line:84%
or transformation in
their own consciousness,

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.930 align:middle line:84%
no matter what emotion
comes up during that.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:58.330 align:middle line:90%
Well--

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.240 align:middle line:90%
>> But it'll be fun.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we'll see how emotional
it gets today, but, yeah,

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.640 align:middle line:84%
it's pretty much just trying
to explore certain aspects

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.710 align:middle line:84%
and explore the Council
and explore this world.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And to find out more about
our world and how it works.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:15.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.560 align:middle line:90%
You're ready to go?

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.370 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:19.373 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:05:19.373 --> 00:05:20.359 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>> We are so pleased
and delighted to have

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.490 align:middle line:84%
the opportunity to speak
with you on this fine day,

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.530 align:middle line:90%
our dear and wonderful friend.

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:48.670 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:50.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.850 align:middle line:84%
We tell you that while our
words to you are important,

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:56.740 align:middle line:84%
this is a vibrational experience
to remember the truth of who

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.580 align:middle line:84%
you really are and why you are
here in this life experience

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.170 align:middle line:84%
and what you intended
when you chose

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:06.580 align:middle line:84%
this magnificent adventure
of coming here into form.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.270 align:middle line:84%
The eternal, ever-present
being that you are,

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.460 align:middle line:84%
here focused in the
human experience

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.600 align:middle line:84%
for the joy of it all,
for the opportunity

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.570 align:middle line:84%
to explore multiple
different experiences

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.390 align:middle line:84%
in form, multiple different
dimensions in form.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And then to remember the
multi-dimensional nature of all

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.750 align:middle line:84%
that you are so
that you can begin

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.810 align:middle line:84%
to understand your
limitless potential here

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.170 align:middle line:84%
in this human experience
to do and to be

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.560 align:middle line:84%
and to have all
that you are here

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.380 align:middle line:90%
in this experience with you.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.320 align:middle line:84%
You are everything
you wish to be.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.280 align:middle line:90%
You already are, indeed.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.830 align:middle line:90%
It is all within you.

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>> So with that
said, in your words--

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.690 align:middle line:84%
and you kind of said this
just now-- but in your words,

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.535 align:middle line:90%
what is the human experience?

00:06:57.535 --> 00:07:00.904 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:00.904 --> 00:07:05.850 align:middle line:90%


00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>> The eternal, ever-present,
limitless being of light that

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:14.130 align:middle line:84%
you are, and you focus
yourself into form.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:18.330 align:middle line:84%
Most of you think that the
experience of transitioning out

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:22.410 align:middle line:84%
is the part that is sad or
difficult or full of grief

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:23.880 align:middle line:90%
and sorrow for you.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.650 align:middle line:84%
But taking the huge, expansive,
magnificent being that you are

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:37.680 align:middle line:84%
and focusing yourself into form
is a much more heavy experience

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.190 align:middle line:84%
sort of say than the last
breath that you take,

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:45.090 align:middle line:84%
where you transition into higher
dimensions of consciousness.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:49.980 align:middle line:84%
But all that separates you from
any dimension of consciousness

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.010 align:middle line:90%
is one single breath, truly.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:54.450 align:middle line:90%
Breath is life.

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And from the moment you
take your first breath,

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.800 align:middle line:84%
till the moment you
take your last breath,

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.000 align:middle line:84%
there will be a breath
in every moment for you.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And it is in that
breath that you

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:08.580 align:middle line:84%
may remember all of what you
are and why you are here.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And while from your perspective
in the human experience,

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:16.850 align:middle line:84%
you are perceiving most often
through your physical senses

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:19.350 align:middle line:84%
what you see, what you hear,
what you taste, what you touch,

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:22.440 align:middle line:84%
what you smell, and even
what you think is a sense,

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.160 align:middle line:84%
is a physical sense of how
you interpret your reality.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you think
is really going on here.

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:32.789 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is there so, so,
so much more going on here.

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And the more you allow
yourself to align

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.970 align:middle line:84%
with all that is here for
you, the more glorious

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:41.610 align:middle line:90%
your life experience will be.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:47.070 align:middle line:84%
You move into this dimension
of consciousness, this density,

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:49.140 align:middle line:84%
this state of
consciousness where

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:56.920 align:middle line:84%
you are focused in form not
so much to learn lessons.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that was
true at one time.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:04.230 align:middle line:84%
You're also not here so much to
right the wrongs of your past,

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:07.800 align:middle line:84%
even though that may have
been true at one time.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.040 align:middle line:84%
You are also not here
to save a broken world.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.110 align:middle line:84%
You might wish to be the change
you wish to see in the world,

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:16.380 align:middle line:84%
but you're not here to
save or fix the world.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.360 align:middle line:84%
You're here to be
all that you are,

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.320 align:middle line:84%
and you are here to fully
awaken and self-realize

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.570 align:middle line:90%
all that you are.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:30.240 align:middle line:84%
Imagine bringing all
of that here and now.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.330 align:middle line:84%
You would not want for
anything ever again.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:38.175 align:middle line:84%
You would not need from a
state of lack or not enough.

00:09:38.175 --> 00:09:40.800 align:middle line:84%
You would be in the fullness and
the wholeness and completeness

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.217 align:middle line:84%
of all that you
are, and you would

00:09:42.217 --> 00:09:45.600 align:middle line:84%
take that big magnificent being
with you everywhere you go.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And you would not have to go
after and take massive action

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:51.360 align:middle line:90%
and make anything really happen.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.182 align:middle line:84%
You could allow it
all to come to you.

00:09:54.182 --> 00:09:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And that does not mean
that you would not

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:57.300 align:middle line:90%
pursue the things you enjoy.

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.880 align:middle line:84%
That does not mean that
you would not take action,

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:03.870 align:middle line:84%
but it would be from the place
of alignment and inspiration.

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And what you would see
from our perspective

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.780 align:middle line:84%
is this broad
expanse of light that

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.630 align:middle line:84%
is your force field, that
extends from you, depending

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:16.170 align:middle line:84%
on how much you are
allowing in every direction.

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And you would never
question why everything

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.890 align:middle line:84%
was coming to you, because
you would see the force

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:24.430 align:middle line:84%
field of light that you were
drawing experience from,

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:27.570 align:middle line:84%
which means all of the
resources, all of the ideas,

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.820 align:middle line:84%
all of the inspiration,
all of the connections

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.010 align:middle line:84%
that you could
ever need and more

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:33.945 align:middle line:90%
are here for you in this moment.

00:10:33.945 --> 00:10:37.310 align:middle line:90%


00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:41.750 align:middle line:84%
You are moving through
an experience based

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:45.260 align:middle line:84%
on the level of light
that you are allowing

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.930 align:middle line:84%
or the energy that
you are allowing.

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And we know that you have
many questions about energy,

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.090 align:middle line:84%
and we will answer your
specific questions.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:57.200 align:middle line:84%
But you are the energy
that creates worlds.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.350 align:middle line:90%
Everything is already created.

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:05.420 align:middle line:84%
Everything that will ever be
needed is already created.

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:09.170 align:middle line:84%
Your job is to align with
it and draw it to you.

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:12.440 align:middle line:84%
You do not get in this life
what you want as much as you

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:16.250 align:middle line:90%
get what you are.

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And you get more
of what you are.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:23.279 align:middle line:90%

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:30.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Going back to the beginning
of the human experience

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:37.740 align:middle line:84%
and developing these five senses
at childbirth or before birth

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:41.980 align:middle line:84%
in conception, we have a lot
of controversy right now,

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:45.920 align:middle line:84%
especially in our political
arenas around abortion.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And at what age and what
time and how does this work.

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:51.060 align:middle line:10%
And I'm wondering
if the Council had

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:56.880 align:middle line:10%
anything to say about
is there a right time?

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:02.370 align:middle line:84%
When does the actual life
force enter into the womb,

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:03.870 align:middle line:90%
and how does that work?

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>> With any and all issues that
you consider issues that either

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.510 align:middle line:84%
need to be solved or have
multiple different opinions

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:16.510 align:middle line:84%
or what some believe is
right and wrong, understand,

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:19.140 align:middle line:84%
anytime you are associating
right and wrong with anything

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.260 align:middle line:84%
in your human experience, you
are automatically limiting it

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.110 align:middle line:84%
and you will at
your own suffering.

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:27.960 align:middle line:84%
When you think you know what
another soul's journey should

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:32.700 align:middle line:84%
be, which means what is
right and wrong for them.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, we agree that
some of you would

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:41.280 align:middle line:84%
say that to take the life
of anything is wrong,

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.470 align:middle line:84%
and there is others
that would say

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:47.790 align:middle line:84%
that something unwanted moving
into the human experience

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:53.460 align:middle line:84%
where you have a choice
early on is right.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.710 align:middle line:84%
The most important
thing we want you

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:59.370 align:middle line:84%
to receive from
us in this time is

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:04.620 align:middle line:84%
understand that your
power in the moment

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:10.980 align:middle line:84%
will always guide you
clearly to the highest truth.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.590 align:middle line:84%
The reason issues like
this are so heated

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:15.330 align:middle line:84%
is because for
many, they are not

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:22.380 align:middle line:84%
facing the real situation or
the reality of having to choose.

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:26.130 align:middle line:84%
You are all here in an
experience of free will.

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:29.290 align:middle line:84%
You can call it an experiment
of free will if you choose,

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:31.920 align:middle line:84%
but you are all
here with free will.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And then you want to
impose your will on others

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.970 align:middle line:84%
because you think you know what
is right and wrong for others.

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:37.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:42.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And you also believe that
what others choose has any

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.220 align:middle line:90%
impact of your life.

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And you will cause a
great amount of suffering

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:50.220 align:middle line:84%
and distraction and frustration
and resistance and reaction,

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.260 align:middle line:84%
which is what will keep
you from your own joy,

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.170 align:middle line:84%
your own peace,
the love that you

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:59.130 align:middle line:84%
are when you go around
trying to solve all

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:02.010 align:middle line:84%
the wrongdoing in
the world because you

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:03.360 align:middle line:90%
think you know what is right.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:07.800 align:middle line:84%
There is no wrong and bad
the way you think it to be.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.960 align:middle line:84%
But you will always at
your own suffering when

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.250 align:middle line:90%
you try to choose for another.

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:15.420 align:middle line:84%
Whether it is your partner
who you dearly love

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.580 align:middle line:84%
or a group of people,
where you think

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:20.430 align:middle line:84%
you have more awareness
and more knowledge

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:22.740 align:middle line:90%
and you try to choose for them.

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:27.720 align:middle line:84%
You will always be giving
away your own freedom.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:33.570 align:middle line:84%
We would tell you all in
the example of abortion

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:40.080 align:middle line:84%
that you all have
the right to choose.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And if in your own
experience, you have a belief

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:51.750 align:middle line:84%
and you choose in
alignment to that belief,

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:57.270 align:middle line:84%
you will feel a sense
of peace in your choice.

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:06.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And so the experience of a
soul coming into form is not

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:08.850 align:middle line:90%
an accident.

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:10.820 align:middle line:90%
It's not an accident.

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And if a being was in
trajectory to move into form

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:20.930 align:middle line:84%
through a particular portal
of a being or a human,

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:24.620 align:middle line:84%
it is a great,
wonderful thing to agree

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:27.830 align:middle line:84%
to be a mother or
a father, to be

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:31.280 align:middle line:84%
a vessel by which
a being would come

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:35.030 align:middle line:90%
into this human experience.

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And the greatest gift
that you give is life.

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:44.330 align:middle line:84%
So for those who believe
life is the answer here,

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.360 align:middle line:84%
we agree that the most
wonderful gift that you give

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.850 align:middle line:90%
is the gift of life.

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:52.710 align:middle line:90%
What a beautiful thing.

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And you often think that
you have chosen your parents

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.930 align:middle line:84%
because of what they are going
to give you and do for you.

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:04.230 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is, oftentimes
you choose your parents

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:09.570 align:middle line:84%
for what they don't give
you so that you will develop

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:13.950 align:middle line:84%
your clarity around what
is most important to you,

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:16.950 align:middle line:90%
often in the absence of it.

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:20.040 align:middle line:84%
But you don't like that
very much because you decide

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.900 align:middle line:84%
what a perfect
mother is, and you

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:24.330 align:middle line:84%
decide what a perfect
father is, even

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:26.310 align:middle line:90%
though there is no such thing.

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:28.440 align:middle line:84%
You collect the
data and information

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.570 align:middle line:84%
from what you see everybody
else's parents doing,

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:33.030 align:middle line:84%
and then you judge and
compare your own parents

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:35.680 align:middle line:84%
to what they should or
shouldn't have been doing,

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.700 align:middle line:84%
which will always cause
resistance and reaction.

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:47.100 align:middle line:84%
If you can shift back to the
absolute joy and appreciation

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:50.190 align:middle line:84%
for the opportunity
to move into form--

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:54.510 align:middle line:84%
and we tell you,
for some of you who

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:58.440 align:middle line:84%
think that you have come here
as some sort of punishment

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.230 align:middle line:84%
or that you're fallen
angels or that you're here

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:05.040 align:middle line:84%
to get it right because you
didn't get it right in the past

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:12.270 align:middle line:84%
or that you're here to save the
world, it's not that at all.

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:17.220 align:middle line:84%
You are here to be part
of this time here and now.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:21.690 align:middle line:84%
There is a part of you, the
multi-dimensional part of you,

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:24.150 align:middle line:84%
the extra-dimensional
part of you,

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:27.660 align:middle line:84%
that has already fully
awakened and self-actualized

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:30.150 align:middle line:90%
and reemerged the source.

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:34.700 align:middle line:84%
The light and the
adventure and what

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:40.530 align:middle line:84%
you experience on your own
path and your own journey

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:47.460 align:middle line:84%
to self-realization or ascension
or expanding your consciousness

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.390 align:middle line:90%
and form.

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And as you expand your
own consciousness,

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.480 align:middle line:84%
as you more fully awaken
to all that you are

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.780 align:middle line:84%
and what is possible for you,
you make it easier for others.

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:03.190 align:middle line:84%
You expand the potentials
and possibilities for others.

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's a wonderful
thing, but it never

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:10.020 align:middle line:84%
was your job to tell
them how to do it

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.230 align:middle line:84%
or what choices
they should make.

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:15.270 align:middle line:90%
You are here as way-showers.

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:20.180 align:middle line:84%
You especially, your
crew, all those watching,

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:23.610 align:middle line:84%
you are here to show others
that a better way is possible.

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:27.790 align:middle line:84%
Expand awarenesses,
expand consciousness.

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:33.680 align:middle line:10%
But, in all of
that, do not forget

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:37.130 align:middle line:10%
that expanding the
peace within you,

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:40.160 align:middle line:10%
expanding the joy
within you, expanding

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:44.720 align:middle line:10%
the love and the abundance
and the well-being

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.910 align:middle line:10%
and the creativity and the
excitement and the enthusiasm

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:58.240 align:middle line:10%
within you should always
be your greatest mission.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:01.390 align:middle line:84%
You are here to express
all that you are in form.

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:04.110 align:middle line:90%


00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And the more you focus
on greater levels

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:13.070 align:middle line:84%
of your own self-expression,
the more delightful

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:15.050 align:middle line:84%
you will find this
human experience to be.

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:17.790 align:middle line:90%


00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>> I think with that, you
just answered my question,

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:21.943 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to throw
it out there anyways.

00:19:21.943 --> 00:19:24.640 align:middle line:90%


00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:28.210 align:middle line:84%
What is the most
practical way to--

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:33.620 align:middle line:84%
in a world of laws, right
now in our political reality,

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:37.450 align:middle line:84%
we're trying to figure this
abortion thing out and all

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:39.340 align:middle line:84%
this stuff, and you
sort of answered

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:45.730 align:middle line:84%
the question of how to apply
that on an individual level.

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:50.470 align:middle line:90%
But collectively, is there--

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:56.740 align:middle line:84%
how do we let everybody choose
their own way, when yet we

00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:00.610 align:middle line:84%
are structured reality
of laws and governments

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:05.620 align:middle line:84%
and these things are
so structured, right,

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:11.230 align:middle line:84%
and don't allow for these
types of greater freedoms.

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:13.667 align:middle line:84%
How do we move and
navigate in that structure?

00:20:13.667 --> 00:20:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think you kind of answered
it with the individual thing,

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:17.530 align:middle line:84%
but if there's anything
just to follow up.

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:19.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's give you the
highest perspective first.

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:20.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>> First off, as sovereign
beings, fully realized,

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:29.770 align:middle line:84%
free to be all that you are,
you do not need laws to tell you

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:32.270 align:middle line:84%
not to harm each other
and act unconsciously.

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:33.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:39.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Your laws are merely based
for and based in a level

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:44.380 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness
unaware of your power.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And not power to control
others or to manipulate

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:52.390 align:middle line:84%
or to push an effort,
but your power that

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:56.980 align:middle line:90%
is the enemy within you.

00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:00.960 align:middle line:90%
So your laws are based--

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:04.270 align:middle line:84%
your human laws are based
on a third dimensional state

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:06.610 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, if you
wish to call it that.

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Where you in that state
of consciousness, you

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.623 align:middle line:84%
look at your body, you look
at others bodies and you say,

00:21:12.623 --> 00:21:13.540 align:middle line:90%
well, we are separate.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:14.170 align:middle line:90%
We are different.

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:14.650 align:middle line:90%
I am me.

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:16.983 align:middle line:84%
I am the personality that I
know is me, and you are you,

00:21:16.983 --> 00:21:20.090 align:middle line:84%
the personality that you know
is you, so we are separate.

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:23.920 align:middle line:10%
The basis of that dimension of
consciousness is separation.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And in separation, there is
lack, there is not enough.

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:31.510 align:middle line:84%
There is prejudice, there is
judgment, there is suffering,

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:36.900 align:middle line:84%
there is fear,
there is limitation.

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And so long as you are in that
dimension of consciousness,

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:43.940 align:middle line:84%
you will not get
rid of those things

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:48.090 align:middle line:84%
that exist in the third
dimension of consciousness.

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And so don't try
to change the laws.

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Don't try to change
the political system.

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:55.040 align:middle line:84%
Don't push against it because
you're just creating resistance

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:55.970 align:middle line:90%
and reaction.

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:58.040 align:middle line:84%
Go to the higher
state of consciousness

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:03.030 align:middle line:84%
and move your being,
your thought process,

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:07.130 align:middle line:84%
your experience into a higher
dimension of consciousness,

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:09.050 align:middle line:84%
where you begin to
live in alignment

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:12.460 align:middle line:84%
with spiritual
and universal law,

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:15.311 align:middle line:84%
which is based on freedom,
which is based on love.

00:22:15.311 --> 00:22:18.257 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:18.257 --> 00:22:24.160 align:middle line:90%


00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.060 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:27.060 align:middle line:84%
Can you just double-check
the focus on that one?

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:31.480 align:middle line:90%


00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:32.990 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:33.790 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:34.900 align:middle line:90%
And we're rolling.

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And we're just talking
about the laws in--

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:43.840 align:middle line:84%
universal laws, following the
universal laws individually.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>> So universal laws are
always available to you.

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And from that
perspective of alignment

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:51.910 align:middle line:84%
to a state of
consciousness where

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:54.790 align:middle line:84%
you are allowing
your life to unfold

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:57.490 align:middle line:84%
based on spiritual
universal laws,

00:22:57.490 --> 00:22:59.080 align:middle line:90%
and you are aligned with that.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.000 align:middle line:90%
The basis of that is freedom.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.920 align:middle line:90%
The basis of that is oneness.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:07.360 align:middle line:84%
You understand that you cannot
harm another with automatically

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:12.910 align:middle line:84%
having done harm to you
before any external experience

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:13.840 align:middle line:90%
occurred.

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.790 align:middle line:90%
That is karma.

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:19.240 align:middle line:84%
What you do to another
is automatically

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:23.830 align:middle line:84%
done onto you, which
means any sort of harm.

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Understanding that the more
you raise your consciousness

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:30.670 align:middle line:84%
and awareness, and you
all operate from alignment

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:36.310 align:middle line:84%
to a greater sense of awareness,
in the state of allowing

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:40.930 align:middle line:84%
your own energy
to serve you, you

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:43.780 align:middle line:84%
move through this
human experience

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.980 align:middle line:90%
in a much different way.

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And there is no need for
political agendas and laws.

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And we do not say that with
any judgment whatsoever

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:58.630 align:middle line:90%
from our side.

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:01.660 align:middle line:84%
If you are still very
much tied into what

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:04.720 align:middle line:84%
is going on in the
political systems,

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:09.460 align:middle line:84%
in your economic systems, your
taking your consciousness down

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:12.730 align:middle line:90%
into that dimension.

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's never going to
feel very good to you

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.270 align:middle line:84%
once you have been in these
higher states of awareness.

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:21.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, we wouldn't
push against it.

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:23.890 align:middle line:90%
We wouldn't resist it.

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:29.440 align:middle line:84%
We would practice your oneness,
the wisdom that you have,

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:33.010 align:middle line:90%
the awareness that you have.

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:35.670 align:middle line:84%
So if you are sitting
and watching someone

00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:39.570 align:middle line:84%
that is, let's just say, in a
political office that triggers

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:45.390 align:middle line:84%
you a bit or a leader of
some country or even a person

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:50.370 align:middle line:84%
in your life or often someone
that you love triggers you,

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:53.490 align:middle line:84%
if you can begin
to be aware of what

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:56.040 align:middle line:84%
about it is triggering
you, something about it

00:24:56.040 --> 00:25:02.610 align:middle line:84%
is deeming you powerless, or
you are choosing in that moment

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:06.240 align:middle line:84%
to go into a story
of why you are

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.520 align:middle line:84%
a victim or powerless
over your situation,

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:13.690 align:middle line:84%
it will always cause
you to get triggered.

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:17.610 align:middle line:84%
There's no better time for
you to remember the power

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:21.000 align:middle line:84%
within you, because you
have the opportunity

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.870 align:middle line:84%
to witness all sorts of
events and occurrences

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:28.620 align:middle line:84%
that are not happening
really truly in your reality.

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And in those moments,
you can choose

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:36.750 align:middle line:84%
to be the truth of who you
are instead of reacting to it.

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:38.790 align:middle line:84%
If all of a sudden,
you all stop giving

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:43.920 align:middle line:84%
all of your attention and
energy to the unwanted,

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.400 align:middle line:90%
it would fade away.

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.550 align:middle line:90%
>> It would, really.

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:50.580 align:middle line:84%
The reason that you have so much
oil production on your planet

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:53.390 align:middle line:84%
now is because you've just
been pushing against it

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:54.190 align:middle line:90%
and fighting it.

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't like something,
don't give it your attention.

00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:middle line:84%
You are voting with
your attention.

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.660 align:middle line:84%
When you talk about it, when you
talk about how much you don't

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:06.990 align:middle line:84%
like it, when you go
out and post things

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:10.290 align:middle line:84%
or write things that
are against something,

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:11.720 align:middle line:90%
you're giving it your attention.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you stop giving it your
attention or you focus on what

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.820 align:middle line:84%
you want more of, you'll
get more of what you want.

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:20.700 align:middle line:90%
So tell us what you want.

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:23.040 align:middle line:84%
What do you want to
see in your reality?

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:26.214 align:middle line:90%

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>> You said-- not right now,
but you've said in past that all

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:40.883 align:middle line:84%
energy already exists, that
we're not creating anything.

00:26:40.883 --> 00:26:42.050 align:middle line:90%
Could you elaborate on that?

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:45.140 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not that
you're not creating.

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:47.780 align:middle line:84%
Because you are creating
in your experience.

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:51.680 align:middle line:84%
But you think that when you want
to have more money that you've

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.470 align:middle line:90%
got to create the money.

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:54.270 align:middle line:90%
You don't.

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:56.450 align:middle line:90%
You just need to draw it to you.

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:59.840 align:middle line:84%
Your consciousness is the
greatest wealth on the planet.

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:02.810 align:middle line:84%
Your wisdom is what will
make you the wealthiest

Your own power.

Fully allowing your energy.

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:14.730 align:middle line:84%
You talk about
energy as it relates

to alternative resources,
to fossil fuels.

with your care for your planet.

I'm worried about someone.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm worried about the planet.

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:36.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm worried about
the environment.

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:39.720 align:middle line:90%
It deems you powerless.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:44.460 align:middle line:90%
Worry is so disempowering.

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:45.720 align:middle line:90%
What do you get from worrying?

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:46.520 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:49.010 align:middle line:90%
Feeling worse.

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:53.790 align:middle line:84%
Feeling awful, depressed,
powerless, stuck.

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:55.100 align:middle line:90%
Worry does nothing.

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:56.120 align:middle line:90%
Why are you worried?

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.340 align:middle line:90%
Because you care.

00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:58.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:27:58.140 --> 00:27:58.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Why do you care?

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Because you love
nature, because you

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:05.540 align:middle line:84%
love others, because
you love the animals.

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:09.740 align:middle line:84%
When you say, I love this
planet, I love the oceans,

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:13.580 align:middle line:84%
I love the animals,
that feels really good.

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:16.580 align:middle line:84%
When you say, I'm really
worried about the planet,

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:19.670 align:middle line:84%
we understand what
you mean, but you're

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:24.380 align:middle line:84%
deeming yourself powerless
over what you want.

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:28.940 align:middle line:84%
When you love it and you
focus that incredible source

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:31.730 align:middle line:84%
energy that is you in
the direction of anything

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:34.560 align:middle line:84%
that you have your
attention focused on,

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:38.090 align:middle line:84%
you are far more powerful
and you can feel it.

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:41.048 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that you're not
creating, you are creating.

00:28:41.048 --> 00:28:42.840 align:middle line:84%
If you took out a piece
of paper right now,

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.910 align:middle line:84%
you drew us a pretty picture,
you created that picture.

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:48.570 align:middle line:90%


00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:51.930 align:middle line:84%
But oftentimes, you think
what you want is something

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:53.040 align:middle line:90%
that you have to create.

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And we're telling
you, it's all here.

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:55.530 align:middle line:90%
It's all been created.

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:57.613 align:middle line:84%
Everything that you're
ever going to need and more

00:28:57.613 --> 00:28:58.590 align:middle line:90%
is here now.

00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:03.390 align:middle line:84%
However, as you expand, you
are always becoming more.

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:08.250 align:middle line:84%
We say that you, in your own
human journey, you're perfect.

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:11.880 align:middle line:84%
The being that you are,
the soul, the eternal being

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.220 align:middle line:90%
that you are, you're perfect.

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:17.730 align:middle line:84%
Yet you're always expanding
and becoming more.

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:20.280 align:middle line:84%
The universe is expanding,
consciousness is expanding.

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.230 align:middle line:84%
You're expanding
and becoming more,

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:25.400 align:middle line:84%
but not because
there's not enough.

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Again, the not
enoughness is based only

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:32.950 align:middle line:90%
in a dimension of separation.

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:36.800 align:middle line:84%
So you're creating, but
you didn't create the roses

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:37.600 align:middle line:90%
in the yard.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.280 align:middle line:90%
You didn't create the tree.

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.930 align:middle line:90%
You didn't create the planet.

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:42.100 align:middle line:90%
You didn't create the stars.

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:43.000 align:middle line:90%
You didn't create the sun.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.260 align:middle line:90%
You didn't create the moon.

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:47.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, you sort of did, but not
for the way you're saying it.

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:51.580 align:middle line:84%
You are actually the energy
that creates worlds and created

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:55.000 align:middle line:84%
this world, but it wasn't
your singular consciousness

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.540 align:middle line:84%
or your own intellect
that created it.

00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:00.880 align:middle line:84%
We would say that you are
part of the intelligence that

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:01.970 align:middle line:90%
created it all.

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:02.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:07.360 align:middle line:84%
>> The same intelligence
that somehow determined how

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:11.260 align:middle line:84%
precisely perfect to place the
planet in relation to the sun

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:12.873 align:middle line:90%
so that you can have life here.

00:30:12.873 --> 00:30:13.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:17.530 align:middle line:84%
>> It is also what beats your
heart and grows your hair

00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:20.650 align:middle line:84%
and your skin and
blinks your eyes.

00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:23.860 align:middle line:90%
And there is intelligence here.

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:25.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>> And you don't have to figure
it out for that intelligence

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:29.850 align:middle line:90%
to work for you.

00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:34.130 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
figure out how to draw

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:37.230 align:middle line:90%
to you all that you are.

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:40.200 align:middle line:84%
Your only job is to
get into the flow

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:43.140 align:middle line:84%
and allow it to come
open to your energy.

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Very few of you on
this planet have fully

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:50.070 align:middle line:84%
realized how to open
to your own energy.

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:53.080 align:middle line:90%


00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:59.020 align:middle line:84%
But when you do, amazing,
extraordinary, miraculous

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:02.548 align:middle line:84%
things will become
possible for you.

00:31:02.548 --> 00:31:05.536 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:31:05.536 --> 00:31:11.030 align:middle line:90%


00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:14.906 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what color peace is.

00:31:14.906 --> 00:31:15.904 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

00:31:15.904 --> 00:31:23.890 align:middle line:90%


00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:26.240 align:middle line:90%
First instincts, it's gray.

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Peace is gray?

00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:29.510 align:middle line:90%
>> For me.

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:31.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good.

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:38.320 align:middle line:10%
So if you go into your
heart and into your being

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:42.160 align:middle line:10%
and you activate
the color of gray,

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.960 align:middle line:10%
and you begin to feel that
color coming from within you

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:49.870 align:middle line:10%
in the area around your heart,
that is your power sourceness,

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:53.290 align:middle line:10%
your power center,
it's the engine sort

00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:55.870 align:middle line:10%
of say in your heart.

00:31:55.870 --> 00:32:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to
expand that light that

00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:05.730 align:middle line:84%
is coming from your
heart, your power source.

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:09.135 align:middle line:84%
And it's expanding from
you in every direction.

00:32:09.135 --> 00:32:11.260 align:middle line:10%
To the top of your head to
the bottom of your feet,

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:14.260 align:middle line:10%
out your fingertips so that
every cell in your body

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:15.610 align:middle line:10%
is aligned with peace.

00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:18.580 align:middle line:10%
And now you are
invoking the color

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:23.410 align:middle line:10%
gray into every
cell of your body.

00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And now the light is expanding
from you in every direction,

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:33.080 align:middle line:90%
emanating that color gray.

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:38.304 align:middle line:84%
Or it may even appear
silver to you at this point.

00:32:38.304 --> 00:32:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And it expands in
every direction

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:43.598 align:middle line:84%
until you realize that
you have this force

00:32:43.598 --> 00:32:45.140 align:middle line:84%
field all around
you, and it's coming

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:47.210 align:middle line:84%
from you and through
you and to you,

00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:48.710 align:middle line:90%
emanating in every direction.

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And now you are infusing the
frequency of peace from you

00:32:55.350 --> 00:33:04.090 align:middle line:84%
in a force field that expands
as far as you can focus.

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And you have the ability
to do this with anything.

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:08.090 align:middle line:90%
Did you just create peace?

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:09.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:11.900 align:middle line:10%
It was already
here, but you took

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:15.410 align:middle line:10%
your focus and your
intention and you moved it

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:20.980 align:middle line:10%
into your experience, and
you also moved it into form.

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:23.950 align:middle line:10%
So that is your power to create.

00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:27.460 align:middle line:90%


00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:30.880 align:middle line:84%
You can draw, you can color,
you can create beauty,

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:34.180 align:middle line:84%
you can create beautiful
music, you can dance.

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:38.320 align:middle line:90%
All is part of creation.

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:43.330 align:middle line:84%
But the real understanding that
we want to get across to you

00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:47.680 align:middle line:84%
is, it's not that you have
to create so much the thing

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:48.820 align:middle line:90%
that you want.

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:50.500 align:middle line:84%
It is drawing it
to you, and then

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.270 align:middle line:84%
understanding that
you have the power

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:58.270 align:middle line:84%
to focus from the core of
your being in the force field

00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:02.620 align:middle line:84%
all around you that
which you want.

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And that what you want
more of in your world.

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:08.149 align:middle line:90%
You understand?

00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.949 align:middle line:90%
>> I understand.

00:34:08.949 --> 00:34:09.749 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:34:09.749 --> 00:34:12.757 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:34:12.757 --> 00:34:32.909 align:middle line:90%


00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:35.010 align:middle line:84%
>> We are ready to
begin, our friend.

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:35.810 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:40.050 align:middle line:84%
So the Council has come
through in the past talking

00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:44.489 align:middle line:84%
a lot about the fifth
dimension, and different beings

00:34:44.489 --> 00:34:47.940 align:middle line:84%
have different definitions
of dimensions and densities.

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just wondering
if the Council could

00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:54.812 align:middle line:84%
go into their version of
what is the fifth dimension

00:34:54.812 --> 00:34:56.280 align:middle line:90%
and the importance of it.

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>> We begin by telling you
as it relates to dimensions,

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:04.050 align:middle line:84%
we don't say it to you in a way
to create a hierarchical order.

00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:06.730 align:middle line:84%
That all of a sudden I'm
focused on the fifth dimension,

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:08.540 align:middle line:84%
or I feel myself in
it and therefore I'm

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:10.790 align:middle line:84%
better than those that are
in the fourth or the third.

00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:13.680 align:middle line:84%
There's no one in
any dimension ever

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:17.970 align:middle line:84%
that believes themselves to be
of higher order than any other,

00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:21.990 align:middle line:84%
no matter what dimension of
consciousness they are in.

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:25.410 align:middle line:84%
If you are in the understanding
of unity consciousness,

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:30.130 align:middle line:84%
you realize we are all one, and
we are all here for each other.

00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Some of us stay on
this side or our side

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:39.400 align:middle line:84%
so that you do not forget
the truth of who you are.

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.610 align:middle line:90%
We are here for you.

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:45.030 align:middle line:10%
We are in a higher
dimension of consciousness,

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:48.060 align:middle line:10%
and the experience of
channeling for most all

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:50.820 align:middle line:10%
is one that can raise
their own frequency

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:53.970 align:middle line:10%
to be able to access higher
dimensions of consciousness.

00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And we focus in such a way that
we can meet you vibrationally

00:35:57.690 --> 00:36:00.660 align:middle line:84%
and the one that you
call a channeler or one

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:04.140 align:middle line:84%
who is channeling is
receiving and interpreting

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:08.850 align:middle line:84%
streams of consciousness
or awareness

00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:13.020 align:middle line:84%
that you verbalize so
that many others can

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:16.770 align:middle line:84%
understand beyond just the
frequency or the sound.

00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:21.480 align:middle line:84%
But it is more than anything, as
we have said to you, a feeling.

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:24.220 align:middle line:90%


00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:25.290 align:middle line:90%
It's a feeling.

00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:30.090 align:middle line:84%
So dimensions of consciousness
are not vastly different.

00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:32.010 align:middle line:84%
You will feel and
experience things

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:34.300 align:middle line:84%
in different dimensions
of consciousness.

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:38.580 align:middle line:84%
We know there are some that talk
about even higher dimensions

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:41.040 align:middle line:90%
of sixth, seventh eighth, 12th.

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And while all that
is well and good

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.600 align:middle line:84%
and we do not
disagree in any way

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:48.270 align:middle line:84%
that there are multiple
dimensions of consciousness,

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:49.980 align:middle line:84%
we bring it forth
at this time so

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:51.840 align:middle line:84%
that you begin to
understand what

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:54.240 align:middle line:84%
is emerging in your
human experience

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:58.110 align:middle line:84%
in a way that metaphorically
helps your brain to determine

00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:03.480 align:middle line:84%
why you often find yourself
in such a different state

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:06.990 align:middle line:84%
when you are in the
same room with someone.

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:09.897 align:middle line:84%
You are not in a different
place, but you are.

00:37:09.897 --> 00:37:11.730 align:middle line:84%
You're in a different
state of consciousness

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:14.190 align:middle line:84%
even though you're
sitting in the same room.

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:18.030 align:middle line:84%
They can be in fear and
suffering and overwhelm,

00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:20.850 align:middle line:84%
and you can be in a
dimension of consciousness,

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:24.160 align:middle line:84%
feeling, and directing
the peace within you.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.850 align:middle line:84%
Feeling joyful and
free and not even

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:29.130 align:middle line:90%
in judgment of where they are.

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:32.520 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes the thing that trips
you up in the human experience

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:35.570 align:middle line:84%
is what you often
refer to as empathy.

00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:38.910 align:middle line:84%
When you find yourself in
a higher state of awareness

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:43.980 align:middle line:84%
or consciousness, you know
that this person or being who

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:49.960 align:middle line:84%
is perceivable suffering in that
moment is what you would say,

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.080 align:middle line:90%
full of sorrow or fear.

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And you try to go down
into their dimension

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:58.950 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness and
pull them or drag them

00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:00.810 align:middle line:90%
up to where you are.

00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And you kindhearted
beings that you are,

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:07.650 align:middle line:84%
we understand why you
do this, but to stay

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:11.520 align:middle line:84%
in a state of compassion
is to keep your heart open,

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:17.190 align:middle line:84%
to focus your presence,
to hold and create

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:20.310 align:middle line:84%
a space where you expand
the state of consciousness

00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:24.270 align:middle line:84%
that you're in or the light
around you that it makes it

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:27.630 align:middle line:84%
easier for someone else
to remember their way back

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:30.330 align:middle line:84%
to the light or back to
the truth of who they are.

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:33.660 align:middle line:84%
But not because you need
to fix them or save them.

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:36.660 align:middle line:84%
You cannot get sick enough
to make a sick person well,

00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:40.770 align:middle line:84%
and you cannot get sad enough
to make a sad person happy.

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:43.120 align:middle line:84%
It's a different state
of consciousness.

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.930 align:middle line:84%
So we want you to
be aware that what

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:49.590 align:middle line:84%
you call a new Earth or a heaven
on Earth or a fifth dimension

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:51.120 align:middle line:84%
or higher states
of consciousness

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:52.740 align:middle line:90%
are here for you now.

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And for most all of you
that are listening to this

00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:59.760 align:middle line:84%
or will ever listen to this,
part of why you're here

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:06.030 align:middle line:84%
is to bring heaven to Earth,
to move light into form.

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Peace, joy, abundance,
freedom, harmony, well-being

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:14.940 align:middle line:90%
in your world.

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:18.780 align:middle line:84%
They are not shooting peace
down from lightning bolts

00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:20.860 align:middle line:90%
on some other planet.

00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:25.260 align:middle line:84%
They are not putting
bags of joy in craft

00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:26.730 align:middle line:90%
and dropping it down to you.

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:29.370 align:middle line:90%


00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:30.900 align:middle line:90%
They aren't.

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:34.440 align:middle line:84%
You are here to be
the joy in the world.

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:37.410 align:middle line:84%
You are here to be
peace in the world.

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:40.847 align:middle line:90%


00:39:40.847 --> 00:39:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And you are here
to be the change

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:46.260 align:middle line:84%
you wish to see in
the world, but not

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:49.640 align:middle line:84%
by trying to get everyone
to agree with you.

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:50.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:52.840 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:59.570 align:middle line:90%


00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:03.590 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of wanted to
make an example of myself,

00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:07.520 align:middle line:84%
something I am going through
right now to help me.

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:10.220 align:middle line:90%


00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And a lot was said
today, so I think

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.630 align:middle line:84%
we can apply a lot from
what was said today,

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:16.370 align:middle line:84%
and I'm already
seeing this situation

00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:17.900 align:middle line:90%
through a different lens.

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:22.050 align:middle line:90%
But in the past, I've had--

00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:24.840 align:middle line:84%
I think all of us has and
I'll sort of generalize--

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.700 align:middle line:84%
but I can go into
more specifics if you

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:29.460 align:middle line:90%
need to work with that energy.

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:35.400 align:middle line:84%
We've all had people in
our past that causes--

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:42.340 align:middle line:84%
or we say they cause us
problems or give us a hard time.

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And in this case,
business affairs having--

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:48.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Be specific.

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:48.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Be specific.

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:50.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:55.410 align:middle line:84%
So there's this guy in my
life that had some business

00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:59.910 align:middle line:84%
dealings with, and it
was a pretty bumpy ride,

00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:03.020 align:middle line:90%
and we parted ways.

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And once I parted ways, it was
like a big weight lifted off

00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:09.880 align:middle line:90%
my shoulder.

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And I started focusing on
this energy and these things.

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:18.550 align:middle line:84%
But every now and then, that
guy just pops back into my life

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:21.970 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden for thinking
that I've cleared this energy

00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:25.540 align:middle line:84%
and that I'm not going
to give it attention.

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:27.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm assuming-- actually,
I'm not assuming,

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:30.820 align:middle line:84%
I know for sure there's a reason
this guy keeps popping back

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:31.790 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:36.130 align:middle line:84%
It's to put my attention
and focus on something.

00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:38.230 align:middle line:90%
But is it even--

00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:41.020 align:middle line:84%
>> To help you transcend the
limitation that you have made

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:41.840 align:middle line:90%
your truth.

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:42.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:47.550 align:middle line:90%
>> So what is it that you want?

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:49.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I'm just wondering--

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:55.080 align:middle line:84%
because in my frame of mind,
I feel like I've already

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:58.260 align:middle line:90%
transcended that energy.

00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:00.588 align:middle line:84%
Obviously I haven't because
he wouldn't be showing up.

00:42:00.588 --> 00:42:02.130 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you feel
when he shows up?

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:05.830 align:middle line:90%


00:42:05.830 --> 00:42:09.865 align:middle line:90%
Resentment, shame, guilt, anger?

00:42:09.865 --> 00:42:12.110 align:middle line:84%
>> A little bit of
little bit of anger.

00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:12.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:15.140 align:middle line:90%
>> So what's the anger?

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:16.230 align:middle line:90%
>> The anger is--

00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:17.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Did he wrong you?

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:19.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Sort of the wronged me thing.

00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:23.390 align:middle line:90%
>> He wronged you in what way?

00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:26.030 align:middle line:84%
>> It's difficult
to go into the--

00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:27.016 align:middle line:90%
>> Financially?

00:42:27.016 --> 00:42:29.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Financially in a company.

00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:32.452 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you have a
contract, an agreement?

00:42:32.452 --> 00:42:33.410 align:middle line:90%
>> We had an agreement.

00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:35.780 align:middle line:84%
Agreements were broken,
that kind of thing.

00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:38.750 align:middle line:90%


00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:42.200 align:middle line:90%
And integrity was not used.

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:45.830 align:middle line:90%
>> So let's ask you something.

00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:53.940 align:middle line:84%
So did you have any
intuition when you entered

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:59.340 align:middle line:84%
into an agreement with him
that maybe you shouldn't?

00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:00.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:01.290 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:03.330 align:middle line:90%
>> So this is forgiveness.

00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:05.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Not of him.

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:06.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:07.830 align:middle line:90%
>> This is you.

00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:08.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Forgiving you for
betraying your own soul,

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:16.290 align:middle line:90%
your own higher awareness.

00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>> When you thought that the
only way to get what you wanted

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:27.510 align:middle line:84%
was to muscle through
this feeling or intuition.

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>> That you could
outwork it, outsmart it.

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:34.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is why when people
ask us why they don't feel like

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:42.120 align:middle line:84%
they are getting the guidance
they want or the intuition they

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:45.150 align:middle line:84%
want, it's because
in moments like this,

00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:49.140 align:middle line:84%
when you go against
your own knowing,

00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:52.410 align:middle line:84%
you betray a bit
of your own soul,

00:43:52.410 --> 00:43:53.680 align:middle line:90%
and there is shame in that.

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:55.280 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:43:55.280 --> 00:44:01.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And that shame and guilt
is the emotion that most often

00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:06.250 align:middle line:84%
keeps you in
density or in heavy,

00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:10.570 align:middle line:84%
dense emotional states
on allowing your energy.

00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:13.290 align:middle line:90%
So this is about forgiving you.

00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:18.720 align:middle line:84%
So he is from the
highest perspective,

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:23.670 align:middle line:84%
there is only love between you
and any of those rotten buggers

00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:27.300 align:middle line:84%
out there that have
wronged you in your life.

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:28.830 align:middle line:90%
There is only love.

00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:32.370 align:middle line:84%
So to dislike
someone, especially

00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:34.500 align:middle line:84%
someone that you have
known and enjoyed

00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:36.910 align:middle line:84%
even a few moments
of happiness with--

00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:37.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Never feels very good.

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in a
state like you are,

00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:44.880 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't feel very
good to be unresolved.

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:50.790 align:middle line:84%

Yeah.

In your mind, see
the image of it.

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:41.670 align:middle line:84%
Now with your eyes closed,
hold out your hand,

00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:45.180 align:middle line:90%
with your palm face up.

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And with your eyes closed,
just in your awareness,

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:54.650 align:middle line:84%
we want you to move this
image from your head

00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:57.800 align:middle line:90%
down into your hand.

00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And just see this image of
this scene with this person

00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:06.490 align:middle line:84%
and move it into the
palm of your hand.

00:46:06.490 --> 00:46:08.222 align:middle line:84%
And now with your
eyes closed, just

00:46:08.222 --> 00:46:10.430 align:middle line:84%
imagine that you can see it
in the palm of your hand.

00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:10.990 align:middle line:90%
Can you see that?

00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:11.990 align:middle line:90%

00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:15.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it smaller now?

00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:17.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Much smaller?

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>> But that's OK.

00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:20.630 align:middle line:84%
Size of it doesn't
matter so much,

00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:24.260 align:middle line:84%
but just your awareness of how
you've moved it out from you

00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:27.870 align:middle line:84%
automatically makes it a
much smaller situation.

00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:38.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, we want you to bless it
from your big, powerful point

00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:39.970 align:middle line:84%
of presence and
the love that you

00:46:39.970 --> 00:46:43.420 align:middle line:84%

00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready, raise
your palm up towards the light,

00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:11.450 align:middle line:84%
and imagine the
brightest light you

00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:16.690 align:middle line:84%
have ever seen coming
down from above you.

00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:25.230 align:middle line:84%
Coming all the way down,
flowing down like liquid light

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:27.420 align:middle line:90%
into the palm of your hand.

00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:30.860 align:middle line:90%
And the light is all around you.

00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:38.240 align:middle line:84%
Your entire hand and this image
is now immersed in the light.

00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And as you raise your
palm a little higher

00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:43.190 align:middle line:84%
and you feel the light
coming all the way

00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:46.340 align:middle line:84%
down over your wrist, down your
arm, down through your elbow,

00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:49.070 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to
the ground beneath you,

00:47:49.070 --> 00:47:51.740 align:middle line:84%
the light focusing more
powerfully than ever before,

00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:52.580 align:middle line:90%

00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:55.700 align:middle line:84%

to dissipate into the light,

until piece by piece by
a little pot of matter,

00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:12.160 align:middle line:84%
by little particle,
every single particle

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:15.250 align:middle line:84%
has now reemerged
into the light.

00:48:15.250 --> 00:48:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And all that you see in the
palm of your hand is the light.

00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:26.010 align:middle line:90%
Do you feel that?

>> Yeah.

And if you do not go back
into the story or the shame

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:40.960 align:middle line:84%
or the blame, you
have transcended

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:47.140 align:middle line:84%
this experience back into the
truth, which is into the light.

the words, "I am forgiven."

any time with anything.

It doesn't take very long.

00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:49.330 align:middle line:84%
But if you take a moment and
really allow yourself to--

00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:52.650 align:middle line:90%


00:49:52.650 --> 00:49:53.920 align:middle line:90%
allow yourself the courage.

00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:05.200 align:middle line:84%
The courage to see more deeply
what this is really about,

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:07.720 align:middle line:90%
most people are so--

00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:10.480 align:middle line:84%
much of their focus
and their attention

00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:12.020 align:middle line:84%
is on what they're
triggered about.

00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's out there, and
they're powerless to change it,

00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:16.040 align:middle line:84%
and they're powerless
to control it,

00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:19.610 align:middle line:84%
and they're powerless to
keep it away from them.

00:50:19.610 --> 00:50:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And so you continue to
perpetuate that powerlessness,

00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:25.640 align:middle line:84%
and in that pushing against it,
you draw to you the very thing.

00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:26.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:29.620 align:middle line:84%
>> But when you
take a few moments--

00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:31.600 align:middle line:90%
this is the real work.

00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:36.150 align:middle line:84%
This is what is meant
by the word "work."

Our teachings are
simple if you do them.

00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:43.810 align:middle line:90%
But this is the real work.

00:50:43.810 --> 00:50:46.480 align:middle line:90%
Take a few moments and do it.

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And see-- hold that
compassionate space

00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:55.690 align:middle line:84%
for yourself and have the
courage to really see--

00:50:55.690 --> 00:50:58.288 align:middle line:90%
really see what it's about.

We just remind you

00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:36.580 align:middle line:84%
as you are going through
your life experience, what

00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:42.640 align:middle line:84%
would serve all of you is
to experience and open more

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:48.800 align:middle line:84%
to your own power, your
own energy, your own light.

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And you do that in doing the
things that bring you joy,

00:51:53.570 --> 00:51:56.090 align:middle line:84%
being in nature, being
with your loved ones,

00:51:56.090 --> 00:52:01.310 align:middle line:84%
creating, writing,
music, animals.

00:52:01.310 --> 00:52:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Allow yourself to do the
things that bring you joy.

00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:11.000 align:middle line:84%
You will naturally open and be
in a state of allowing and more

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.070 align:middle line:90%
in the flow.

00:52:13.070 --> 00:52:18.380 align:middle line:84%
Also finding it-- and it's
so simple that oftentimes you

00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:21.080 align:middle line:90%
want that more difficult way.

00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:23.870 align:middle line:84%
But as you go deeper
into the moment

00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:26.960 align:middle line:84%
and begin to feel it
expand, and you're

00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:34.110 align:middle line:84%
more aware of where you continue
to enforce your limitation

00:52:34.110 --> 00:52:39.120 align:middle line:84%
versus empower yourself
to be all that you are.

00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:42.300 align:middle line:84%
In your daily life, when
you find yourself triggered

00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:45.210 align:middle line:84%
or reacting or in
resistance or in judgment,

00:52:45.210 --> 00:52:49.980 align:middle line:84%
teach your body to stop
and become present.

00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:51.790 align:middle line:90%
What is it that you want?

00:52:51.790 --> 00:52:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And more importantly, what
is it that you want to feel?

00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And take three seconds,
five seconds, a minute, five

00:52:57.210 --> 00:53:00.180 align:middle line:90%
minutes, and really feel it.

00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:06.930 align:middle line:84%
And you will see your ability
to transcend all the unwanted

00:53:06.930 --> 00:53:10.710 align:middle line:84%
without having to fight
or push against it,

00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:15.150 align:middle line:84%
but to align with the
truth and the power

00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:18.370 align:middle line:90%
and the energy that is you.

00:53:18.370 --> 00:53:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And then focus that in
the force field, which is

00:53:22.830 --> 00:53:25.200 align:middle line:90%
the environment all around you.

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:27.960 align:middle line:84%
That's where reality is
being created for you.
