00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So I would hike down, swim,
and hang out at the heiau,

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.750 align:middle line:84%
which is where a lot of the
locals and auntie and uncles

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.080 align:middle line:84%
and kind of Kahuna elders would
hang out at this very sacred

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.670 align:middle line:90%
site.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.260 align:middle line:90%
And I did this a lot.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And the locals took
notice of me and started

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:27.950 align:middle line:90%
calling me Dolphin Girl.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.040 align:middle line:90%


00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And I came out of
the bay one day,

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.710 align:middle line:84%
and this auntie who
has now crossed over,

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.950 align:middle line:84%
she was sitting at the
heiau site, stringing a lei.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.300 align:middle line:90%
And she said, you.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.470 align:middle line:90%
Come here.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.520 align:middle line:90%
We know what you are.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.830 align:middle line:90%


00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.990 align:middle line:84%
She said, you may have
been born of Earth.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.600 align:middle line:84%
But we see you as
being from the stars.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.290 align:middle line:84%
You're a representative
of the stars.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And she told me, you
spend as much time

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.749 align:middle line:90%
as you can with those dolphins.

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:10.160 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And then it was very lovely
too, and gave me like, you know,

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.460 align:middle line:90%
aloha.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think even
in that moment, she

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.780 align:middle line:84%
called me a kama'aina, which
is a child of the land.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:30.238 align:middle line:84%
And to receive that welcoming
from a Hawaiian auntie is just,

00:02:30.238 --> 00:02:32.214 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's sacred.

00:02:32.214 --> 00:02:51.120 align:middle line:90%


00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Gita Rose.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.378 align:middle line:90%
>> Reuben Langdon.

00:02:53.378 --> 00:02:54.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Here we are in Hawaii.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Here we are in Hawaii.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>> So beautiful.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.410 align:middle line:90%
>> We just had an amazing week.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.210 align:middle line:90%
>> We did.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>> And we did our
ETA contact retreat.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:04.660 align:middle line:90%
Our first--

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Our first ever, the
maiden voyage of it.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.800 align:middle line:90%
>> I think you went pretty good.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.842 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel about it?

00:03:09.842 --> 00:03:11.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it was a success.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.640 align:middle line:90%
It went very well, absolutely.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And had other channelers
to come here to be with us,

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.000 align:middle line:84%
and people that resonate
with connecting to their star

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.800 align:middle line:90%
family.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And we had dolphin visits
and whale interaction

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.380 align:middle line:84%
and just beautiful connection
with people and friends

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.180 align:middle line:90%
and family.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.050 align:middle line:90%
And yeah.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.200 align:middle line:90%
>> And you're channeler?

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes I am.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>> An actress?

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:34.480 align:middle line:90%
>> An actor--

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Singer.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>> --an artist, singer,
dancer, channel.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.050 align:middle line:90%
A human.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>> A human.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:41.800 align:middle line:90%
>> On planet Earth.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.690 align:middle line:84%
>> How did this
all start for you?

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.023 align:middle line:90%
How did you get into channeling?

00:03:45.023 --> 00:03:47.310 align:middle line:90%
How did you get into being you?

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, channeling
Bella specifically

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.900 align:middle line:90%
has been a 10 year journey.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And remembering my
connection with her

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.500 align:middle line:90%
and with the other hybrids.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.280 align:middle line:84%
But I've always been a channel,
even though I didn't have

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.830 align:middle line:90%
that word in my vocabulary.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.020 align:middle line:84%
Always been an actor, telling
stories, singing songs.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.089 align:middle line:84%
I was so connected to
imagination and the land

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:19.500 align:middle line:90%
and elementals.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Always, that was a frame
of perspective for me.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.100 align:middle line:84%
But vocal channeling itself,
and extraterrestrials, I

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.410 align:middle line:90%
had no awareness of.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.080 align:middle line:84%
I think when I was young,
I had seen "The X-Files,"

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.370 align:middle line:84%
and seen like,
those what if UFOs--

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.170 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And this was in the
mid to late 90s.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.470 align:middle line:84%
So I had a concept, a
very, very narrow scope

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.540 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrials and aliens.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.690 align:middle line:84%
But it was like complete
blinders were on.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, oh,
that's boy stuff.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.800 align:middle line:90%
Like, sci-fi stuff is boy stuff.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.810 align:middle line:90%
Sci-fi.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and it was just blinders.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:03.045 align:middle line:10%
And I had a reading with
a friend of mine who--

00:05:03.045 --> 00:05:07.010 align:middle line:10%
it was my first introduction
to clairaudients, or

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.180 align:middle line:10%
clairsentients,
clairvoyant connections.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.942 align:middle line:10%
And just the fact that someone
had that type of connection

00:05:11.942 --> 00:05:14.400 align:middle line:10%
with self, it was the first
psychic that I'd met in person.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.810 align:middle line:84%
I was like, you have to
tell me everything you know,

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.180 align:middle line:90%
like, it's real?

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.080 align:middle line:90%
Magic is real?

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.800 align:middle line:90%
And so, she gave me a reading.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And said, you have all of
these extraterrestrials

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.655 align:middle line:90%
in your space.

00:05:27.655 --> 00:05:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't even
know what that meant.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And she explains, oh,
in your auric field,

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.788 align:middle line:84%
in your agreements,
in your energy.

00:05:34.788 --> 00:05:38.175 align:middle line:90%
It was like, aliens are real?

00:05:38.175 --> 00:05:39.570 align:middle line:90%
She's like, yeah.

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:40.500 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of other
people think so too.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:48.370 align:middle line:90%
And in that moment, oh, duh!

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.600 align:middle line:90%
Aliens are real.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.400 align:middle line:90%
Came to my mind.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.240 align:middle line:84%
It was just like, the grass
is green, the sky is blue.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.400 align:middle line:90%
Duh.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And then I also had
the understanding,

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.960 align:middle line:84%
not only do they exist, but
it's part of our human genome.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.090 align:middle line:84%
It's part of what we
understand to be modern human.

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.840 align:middle line:10%
And that came in that instant.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And then a few weeks later, she
invited me over to her house

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.030 align:middle line:84%
and we were beginning to
be really good friends.

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And kind of diving
down different rabbit

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.960 align:middle line:84%
holes, different esoteric
thought and a bit

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.780 align:middle line:84%
of conspiracy
exploration theories

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.570 align:middle line:84%
or alternative truths,
histories, alternative reality

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.280 align:middle line:90%
exploration.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And she offered for me to smoke
a bit of marijuana with her.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And I, in the past, had
no frame of reference

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.520 align:middle line:84%
for these very expansive
states of consciousness.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.910 align:middle line:84%
So when I was a
teenager, marijuana

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.710 align:middle line:84%
would activate like, this
deep transcendental like,

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.500 align:middle line:84%
transcendental meditation,
where I would feel

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.480 align:middle line:90%
like I was speaking with God.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And my punk rock
friends are listening

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.580 align:middle line:84%
to The Misfits and throwing
Funyuns at each other.

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, it was
scary for me, because I

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.347 align:middle line:90%
didn't know what it was.

00:07:04.347 --> 00:07:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Was it more in a party sense?

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.040 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.867 align:middle line:84%
There was no ceremony or
ritual or, you know, I mean,

00:07:09.867 --> 00:07:11.950 align:middle line:84%
it's its own ritual and
its own ceremony in a way,

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:14.140 align:middle line:84%
and its own spiritual
exploration.

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:19.150 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of what it can
truly activate for someone,

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:24.460 align:middle line:84%
I had no foundation
of awareness for it.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.510 align:middle line:84%
But at this point, up to
meeting my friend Jen,

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:33.220 align:middle line:84%
I had began some interest
in traditional Vipassana

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.480 align:middle line:90%
meditation.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:39.580 align:middle line:10%
And had a bit more of an
understanding of those states.

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And so when she invited
to partake and enjoy

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:45.100 align:middle line:90%
the marijuana, I was like, yeah.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:45.460 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:46.377 align:middle line:90%
That feels really fun.

00:07:46.377 --> 00:07:47.800 align:middle line:90%
Like, sure.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.630 align:middle line:90%
And I took one really good hit.

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And I immediately just felt
this huge, overwhelming fear.

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And I felt comfortable enough
to express this to her.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And she offered to
lead me through what's

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.640 align:middle line:90%
called a parts work exercise.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:08.080 align:middle line:84%
So you allow the emotion to
take a form, a shape, an animal,

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.990 align:middle line:84%
a being, whatever it
represents itself as.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.300 align:middle line:90%
And to create a safe space.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And for me, she used the
place of a theater, which

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:16.960 align:middle line:90%
for me was really comforting.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.910 align:middle line:90%
Very homey.

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And allowed the form,
or whatever it was,

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:25.270 align:middle line:84%
the fear, to take the
expression on the stage.

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, it
turned into a dragon for me.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.568 align:middle line:84%
And she said, and get as
far away as you need to.

00:08:30.568 --> 00:08:32.110 align:middle line:10%
So immediately, I
went all the way up

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:33.652 align:middle line:10%
against the back
wall of the theater,

00:08:33.652 --> 00:08:36.789 align:middle line:10%
the very back, back,
back, tippy-top balcony,

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:38.830 align:middle line:10%
and watched the dragon.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:41.289 align:middle line:84%
And it was a bit of a meditation
that she led me through.

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:44.320 align:middle line:84%
But, in my own time,
getting closer and closer

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.280 align:middle line:90%
to the dragon.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.550 align:middle line:84%
So I went then to the
mezzanine, down into the floor,

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:51.560 align:middle line:84%
to the orchestra, and then right
up to the lip of the stage.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And once I allowed myself
up to the lip of the stage,

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:58.480 align:middle line:84%
the dragon's scales
turned into mirrors.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And I understood the
fractal of everything

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:03.220 align:middle line:84%
and the interconnectivity
of everything

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.380 align:middle line:90%
and that everything is a mirror.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And once I received
that, I was, in a way,

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.540 align:middle line:84%
shot up into the
catwalk where they

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:17.400 align:middle line:84%
hang the lights, the tippy-top
perspective of the theater.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And I was encased in
this really sweet cocoon.

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:22.100 align:middle line:90%
It's what it felt like.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And I was aware that my body
was talking in that moment.

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:28.040 align:middle line:84%
That's when the
channeling began.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.570 align:middle line:84%
So I was very aware
that there were

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:31.920 align:middle line:90%
words coming out of my mouth.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And I was also
simultaneously receiving

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:39.860 align:middle line:84%
energy pictures, and
very clear precise words

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.960 align:middle line:84%
that were different from
what was coming out.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you know
what was being said?

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.380 align:middle line:90%
>> No, not really.

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.360 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And this was a very
comfortable state for me.

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:54.680 align:middle line:10%
Because a lot of
times, it'll happen,

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.990 align:middle line:10%
you know, when you're
on stage that, you know,

00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:00.440 align:middle line:10%
kind of go through the routine,
and the words are coming out,

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.870 align:middle line:10%
the song and dance
is coming out.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:03.370 align:middle line:84%
But there's still
that rolling like,

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:06.390 align:middle line:84%
oh, I didn't eat enough today
or, you know, whatever it is.

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And so that split awareness
was really cozy for me.

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And then I began to receive
more specific information

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:19.130 align:middle line:90%
and invitation.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:22.370 align:middle line:84%
They were explaining themselves
to be extraterrestrial

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:23.340 align:middle line:90%
in nature.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.940 align:middle line:84%
So that I would
understand simply enough.

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.490 align:middle line:84%
That this is how
they make contact

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:34.430 align:middle line:84%
is through biological
receivers and transmitters,

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:40.430 align:middle line:84%
that I have an agreement,
and would I like to begin?

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:42.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Did they say who they were?

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:42.897 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:10:42.897 --> 00:10:44.330 align:middle line:90%
Uh-uh.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.330 align:middle line:84%
But the frequency
was so specific.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And I was told very
boldly and bravely

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:58.720 align:middle line:84%
and honestly that we won't
sugar coat it for you.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.870 align:middle line:84%
There is going to be a period
where this is challenging.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And you will feel
slightly alienated--

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.200 align:middle line:90%
pun intended.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.400 align:middle line:90%
That was said.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:13.220 align:middle line:84%
So the humor was already
beginning to come through.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:19.122 align:middle line:84%
But we can promise you,
this is observation.

00:11:19.122 --> 00:11:20.080 align:middle line:90%
>> What does that mean?

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Just meaning,
this is how it is.

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:24.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm wearing a black shirt.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.510 align:middle line:90%
You're wearing a gray shirt.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:27.340 align:middle line:90%
This is how it is.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:31.600 align:middle line:84%
We can promise you that at the
end of the day, once you reach

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.230 align:middle line:84%
the, you know, the certain level
of the mountain, you will know

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:40.600 align:middle line:84%
that love is real, that magic
is real, that imagination

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.040 align:middle line:90%
is the key to everything.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:46.000 align:middle line:84%
Everything that you had
an inkling about when

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.720 align:middle line:84%
you were a child, you will
know to the fiber of your being

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.260 align:middle line:90%
that it's just how it is.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:13:03.370 align:middle line:90%


00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:05.430 align:middle line:90%
And, so I came out of it.

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And Jen was very
reassuring, and knew that

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.350 align:middle line:84%
to tell me, OK, so that's
called vocal channeling.

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:13.150 align:middle line:90%
It's a thing.

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:14.610 align:middle line:90%
It's a phenomenon.

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And the energy that came
through is very specific.

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:24.150 align:middle line:84%
You may want to go and check
out this particular channel, who

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:26.190 align:middle line:90%
is well-known in this circle.

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:27.000 align:middle line:90%
And so I did.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And I went and listened
to some YouTube videos

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:36.150 align:middle line:84%
and had this just visceral
response, just crying and like,

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:40.197 align:middle line:84%
remembering something I
had forgotten I forgot.

00:13:40.197 --> 00:13:42.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Something you-- remembering
something you've forgotten that

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:43.230 align:middle line:90%
you forgot.

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:43.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:45.060 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes, like,
we can, like be aware.

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:46.130 align:middle line:90%
We're like, oi.

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:48.520 align:middle line:84%
You know, I feel like I
forgot something, right?

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Like a deja vu
kind of moment?

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:51.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Kind of, yeah.

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:53.220 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, kind of just
this spiral of like I--

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:57.710 align:middle line:84%
like I forgot I even
forgot about it.

00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:13:58.510 --> 00:13:59.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:00.070 align:middle line:90%
Like, whoa.

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:02.530 align:middle line:10%
It was like a full re-membering.

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:05.340 align:middle line:90%


00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And so once the activation and
the spark began to blossom,

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:14.280 align:middle line:84%
synchronicity just
began to unfold.

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:20.160 align:middle line:84%
That gave me more affirmation
that this very much, in ways,

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.660 align:middle line:90%
is a lineage, is a family.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:25.920 align:middle line:90%
And then I'm not the only one.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm not alone in this.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.960 align:middle line:84%
Meeting different
channelers and finding

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.460 align:middle line:84%
different people
that were connected

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.930 align:middle line:90%
to this particular lineage.

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And so that was just really
soothing and really calming.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.227 align:middle line:84%
Because at times, it
was, like they told me,

00:14:41.227 --> 00:14:43.560 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be a little
challenging, a little intense.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.740 align:middle line:84%
But finding that
connection and that network

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.870 align:middle line:84%
and that family was
really supportive.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:51.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And the lineages,
is that the Yahyel?

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah so the Yahyel are
one of the five hybrid races.

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:58.530 align:middle line:84%
So they're also
connected to and family

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:01.420 align:middle line:90%
with the Sassani or Shakani.

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.240 align:middle line:90%
There's also the ShaYahYel.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.960 align:middle line:84%
There's many different labels
for these different five races,

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:10.110 align:middle line:84%
that throughout the years, I
begin to remember and connect

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:11.340 align:middle line:90%
with more.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.140 align:middle line:84%
But in those early
years, it was more so

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.910 align:middle line:84%
the human representatives
that I was kind

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:16.290 align:middle line:90%
of finding and understanding.

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And, of course-- and
having certain dreams

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:22.530 align:middle line:84%
with the being that
I like to call Eely,

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:27.480 align:middle line:84%
that's been, in the Sassani
language, that means mirror.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.810 align:middle line:84%
So again, the dragon showed
itself as the mirror.

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And then in different dreams,
I had different rememberings

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:39.360 align:middle line:84%
of this Eely being,
that is the mirror.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.990 align:middle line:90%
And also the messenger.

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.880 align:middle line:90%
And it's kind of fun.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.370 align:middle line:90%
We can say it without saying it.

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:47.580 align:middle line:84%
But if people are
part of it, they

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:48.840 align:middle line:90%
know who we're talking about.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.130 align:middle line:90%
So, that's kind of sweet.

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:52.640 align:middle line:90%


00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And all the while,
too, I was being

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:58.950 align:middle line:84%
taught how to
channel the channel,

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:02.920 align:middle line:90%
without medicine or marijuana.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.850 align:middle line:84%
So being taught through
meditation and guidance

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:10.800 align:middle line:84%
how to alter my own frequency to
get into the channeling state.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So the marijuana kind of
acted as a permission slip

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.240 align:middle line:90%
to experience that frequency?

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:17.450 align:middle line:90%
And it-

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And then you
could go back there.

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:19.420 align:middle line:90%
You could revisit it.

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:20.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I could revisit it.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.863 align:middle line:90%
And it just, it activated it.

00:16:23.863 --> 00:16:25.530 align:middle line:84%
I think there may be
even certain things

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:28.800 align:middle line:84%
within the chemical components
of the plant that perfectly

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.180 align:middle line:90%
aligned with my body.

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know all
the science about it.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.600 align:middle line:84%
Might be fun to
research that later.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:37.900 align:middle line:84%
But it just felt like, I
mean, complete take off.

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:41.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I've had many plant
medicine experiences that,

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:43.902 align:middle line:84%
once I found it, then later,
without the medicines,

00:16:43.902 --> 00:16:45.110 align:middle line:90%
I could go back and revisit--

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's the point
of the permission slip.

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.000 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.010 align:middle line:90%
So I would feel--

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:55.290 align:middle line:84%
I describe it as
like, a knocking.

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:58.040 align:middle line:84%
I would feel the energy
very politely knocking.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:58.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yup.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:01.170 align:middle line:90%
>> And it was always my choice.

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:03.690 align:middle line:84%
That was also part of
the initial download,

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:08.130 align:middle line:84%
is you will choose and re-choose
and re-choose this agreement.

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:11.339 align:middle line:84%
Every time that you enter
into that channeling state,

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:13.710 align:middle line:90%
it's the one moment choice.

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:16.085 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not like something's
taking you over and you kind

00:17:16.085 --> 00:17:16.160 align:middle line:90%
of--

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:16.550 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:17.069 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:17.369 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:18.536 align:middle line:90%
And if I could do it today--

00:17:18.536 --> 00:17:19.369 align:middle line:90%
I can do it today.

00:17:19.369 --> 00:17:20.169 align:middle line:90%
>> Yup.

00:17:20.169 --> 00:17:22.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And channel and then
see how far it goes.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.510 align:middle line:84%
If I choose, you know,
two years from now

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:26.955 align:middle line:84%
to not do this, to
never go public with it,

00:17:26.955 --> 00:17:28.830 align:middle line:84%
like, even in this now,
I'm like, very aware.

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:31.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, oh, I'm re-choosing
the choice to do this.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Now it's part of the-- yeah.

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Now it's part of the
initial download as well.

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:41.580 align:middle line:84%
So that was part
of the training was

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:45.870 align:middle line:90%
feeling the power of choice.

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And basically, that
allowed me to begin

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:53.790 align:middle line:84%
to raise my frequency so I could
match the frequency of what

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:55.050 align:middle line:90%
it was I was connecting to.

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:57.380 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what it
was at that time either.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:58.690 align:middle line:90%
I was just full trust with it.

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:01.260 align:middle line:84%
It just felt so nice and
just fun and playful.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:07.140 align:middle line:10%
And also quite
intelligent and precise.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:12.330 align:middle line:10%
And very skilled, like,
this is not our first rodeo.

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:13.130 align:middle line:90%
Like, we got you.

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:14.880 align:middle line:84%
Like, this is some--
we're like, you know,

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.470 align:middle line:84%
this is what-- this
is how we do it.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:17.730 align:middle line:90%
This is protocol.

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:21.840 align:middle line:84%
So there was that structure
within the lineage that

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.430 align:middle line:90%
felt really comforting as well.

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Like I just felt like another
student going to school.

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:28.650 align:middle line:84%
But it was this, you know,
me sitting in a chair

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:30.817 align:middle line:84%
and meditating and being
led through these different

00:18:30.817 --> 00:18:34.530 align:middle line:84%
emotions within myself to look
at different aspects of my ego

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:37.380 align:middle line:84%
and let it go, getting
comfortable with being

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:38.360 align:middle line:90%
uncomfortable.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:39.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:39.960 align:middle line:90%
Yup.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:40.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Getting comfortable with--

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:42.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Were you doing it
in front of people?

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:42.890 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no, no.

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:43.920 align:middle line:90%
This is just me.

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.810 align:middle line:84%
This was in the
very first months

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:49.920 align:middle line:84%
of me learning how to
channel, of me learning

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:54.000 align:middle line:84%
how to raise my frequency
to be in the state

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.010 align:middle line:84%
where sounds would
even come through.

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:58.230 align:middle line:90%
It was silent for months.

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:02.760 align:middle line:84%
Of me just being led through
these different meditation

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:08.070 align:middle line:84%
activations around honoring
seeing the emotion,

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:11.460 align:middle line:84%
knowing what it is, and feeling
the emotion for the sake

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.020 align:middle line:90%
of the emotion itself.

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And then finding the
belief underneath it

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:17.390 align:middle line:84%
and realizing, oh, and
like, letting it go,

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:18.190 align:middle line:90%
and moving through.

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:21.400 align:middle line:84%
This was all part of me
learning how to channel.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Gotcha.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.450 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's why I call, I
was channeling the channel.

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:26.383 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:26.383 --> 00:19:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And a big teaching that
came through was getting really

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.580 align:middle line:84%
comfortable in doubt and knowing
that whatever comes through is,

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.200 align:middle line:84%
you know, what needs
to come through.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.870 align:middle line:90%


00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:38.380 align:middle line:90%
Resting in the unknown.

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:39.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yup.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And that there is a knowing
in knowing that we don't know.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yup.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.863 align:middle line:84%
>> And that is
something that we know.

00:19:45.863 --> 00:19:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And just getting really
comfortable in that.

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually,
words started to come.

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:53.100 align:middle line:90%
Or sounds came first, actually.

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:53.900 align:middle line:90%
Pardon me.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:57.202 align:middle line:84%
Like, sounds and light
language kind of things.

00:19:57.202 --> 00:19:59.645 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you know what light
language was at the time, or--

00:19:59.645 --> 00:20:01.270 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I may
have come across it.

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:02.280 align:middle line:90%
But I don't think--

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so really.

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:06.240 align:middle line:84%
It was a few years
later where I was

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:12.730 align:middle line:84%
able to listen to other
people and was like, whoa.

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:13.530 align:middle line:90%
Fun.

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:16.802 align:middle line:84%
That's so like, similar to
what's coming through me.

00:20:16.802 --> 00:20:18.510 align:middle line:84%
It was a bit later
that was more of like,

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:19.960 align:middle line:90%
a synchronicity for me.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.830 align:middle line:90%


00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think I got
to a phase where

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:30.120 align:middle line:84%
some kind of sentences and
monologues were coming through.

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:30.950 align:middle line:90%
But very short.

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:35.280 align:middle line:10%
>> And I received
the guidance that,

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:38.190 align:middle line:10%
it's going to be so much more
fun and really easy for you

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:40.830 align:middle line:10%
if you just ask friends that
you think are maybe kind

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:45.220 align:middle line:10%
of interested and have them
ask whatever is coming through,

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:46.170 align:middle line:10%
ask questions.

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:50.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And there were many different
things that came in and out

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:56.610 align:middle line:84%
that I understood was part of
the process of working through

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:58.230 align:middle line:84%
different aspects
of my ego construct,

00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:59.760 align:middle line:90%
my personality construct.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:03.960 align:middle line:84%
Different aspects of my negative
ego or limiting constructs.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And being just part
of the process to

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:11.395 align:middle line:84%
find, eventually,
whatever the entity was.

00:21:11.395 --> 00:21:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And what part of the country
were you in at this time?

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:15.312 align:middle line:84%
>> I was where I
was born and raised.

00:21:15.312 --> 00:21:19.260 align:middle line:84%
So Marin County, just
north of San Francisco.

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:20.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:22.840 align:middle line:84%
>> And at one point,
you lived in Hawaii?

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.280 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:25.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.400 align:middle line:90%
So that was a bit late--

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.210 align:middle line:90%
shortly after.

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:30.060 align:middle line:84%
So the activation, the
remembering happened.

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:33.270 align:middle line:84%
I began kind of playing
around with channeling.

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And I started to remember
also interactions

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:40.500 align:middle line:84%
with the greys, a very
specific type of gray that

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.290 align:middle line:90%
is connected to this lineage.

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:45.630 align:middle line:84%
So I'll go into it briefly,
just if some people haven't

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:46.440 align:middle line:90%
heard it before.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Because it's important
to understand.

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:52.380 align:middle line:84%
So they are a very specific
timeline of humanity

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:54.510 align:middle line:84%
that de-evolved,
essentially, that had

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:57.450 align:middle line:90%
a heavy reliance on technology.

00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And severed their connection
with, essentially,

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:05.520 align:middle line:84%
what we can label the feminine
aspect, the emotional aspect,

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:11.370 align:middle line:84%
that then resulted in a severe
disconnect with their planet.

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:14.400 align:middle line:90%


00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:17.220 align:middle line:90%
The planet became uninhabitable.

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:18.750 align:middle line:84%
They had to go
inside of the planet.

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:21.540 align:middle line:90%
They began cloning themselves.

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And eventually lost the
ability to procreate.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:30.990 align:middle line:84%
As it's been shown to me, it
was in this specific timeline,

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:33.690 align:middle line:90%
humanity then died out.

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And even in one timeline,
even in one thread

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:41.785 align:middle line:84%
of all of the potential
timelines, it's like, oh,

00:22:41.785 --> 00:22:43.410 align:middle line:84%
we just-- we don't
want this to happen.

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:43.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:45.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Like the one was like, no.

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:49.590 align:middle line:84%
Like, this can't--
it's so special.

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And so, the mantis
beings sent the awareness

00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:04.340 align:middle line:84%
of a certain type of technology
that is the body of the gray

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:08.030 align:middle line:84%
that they could fully
transition themselves

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:10.190 align:middle line:90%
into this particular body.

00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And then-- which is a
prototype body that gets

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.095 align:middle line:90%
used throughout the multiverse.

00:23:14.095 --> 00:23:16.220 align:middle line:84%
This is why I feel it's
really relevant to be like,

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:18.470 align:middle line:84%
this is a very
specific type of gray.

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:22.520 align:middle line:84%
Because there are many
different types of souls

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:24.650 align:middle line:84%
that can utilize
this prototype body.

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:30.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And with the
aid of the mantis,

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:34.570 align:middle line:84%
and the aid really just
of the collective will,

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:38.710 align:middle line:84%
these specific types of
gray beings, the [HEBREW],,

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:41.350 align:middle line:84%
as they're being called,
which is a Hebrew word that

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:44.710 align:middle line:84%
translates to
hunger or emptiness.

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:49.240 align:middle line:84%
They were able to connect in
a sense travel back in time.

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:52.450 align:middle line:84%
Connect with different
parallel versions

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:55.060 align:middle line:84%
existing in the one moment
of their over souls.

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:56.080 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:01.060 align:middle line:84%
>> To have an agreement with
different aspects of themself,

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:06.910 align:middle line:84%
to be able to collect
physical DNA, energetic DNA,

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:10.270 align:middle line:90%
emotional DNA, intelligence.

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:14.080 align:middle line:84%
To begin to create
these hybrid races.

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And to also serve
as an activation

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.730 align:middle line:90%
in ways for specific timelines.

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:22.630 align:middle line:84%
As I understand it,
our timeline of human

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:26.680 align:middle line:84%
would be activated to
becoming a little bit closer

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:31.690 align:middle line:84%
to a version of the
next hybrid race.

00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:34.690 align:middle line:84%
So this gets really like,
it's a lot of cosmology.

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:35.845 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot of information.

00:24:35.845 --> 00:24:36.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:37.850 align:middle line:84%
I've covered a lot of
it in the show already.

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:38.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:41.740 align:middle line:84%
I just-- I think it's so
important to boil it down

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:44.330 align:middle line:90%
to the morals of it, right?

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:45.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:45.930 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:47.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Because it just-- it's just--

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:49.330 align:middle line:90%
I think it's very true.

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:51.040 align:middle line:84%
But there's some
people that are like,

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.665 align:middle line:84%
maybe when they're
listening, you know?

00:24:52.665 --> 00:24:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Like, and it's just,
honor your emotions

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.970 align:middle line:84%
and the connection
with each other

00:24:57.970 --> 00:24:59.830 align:middle line:84%
and the connection
with the planet.

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:02.380 align:middle line:84%
And like, that's something
that we can all get behind.

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:02.620 align:middle line:90%
>> For sure.

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:03.420 align:middle line:90%
>> You know?

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of how far
out we need to go,

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:07.330 align:middle line:84%
it's just a really
beautiful story.

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:09.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yup.

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:11.260 align:middle line:84%
>> So at this
point, I began to--

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:15.700 align:middle line:84%
and I state that because, if
there's just one person that

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:19.540 align:middle line:84%
is learning this, hearing
this for the first time,

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:21.890 align:middle line:84%
without that kind of grounding
of the importance just

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:26.910 align:middle line:84%
of the story, we tend
to go really far out.

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:28.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:29.305 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's where I went.

00:25:29.305 --> 00:25:29.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:30.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I went.

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:33.250 align:middle line:90%
Because also too, I was--

00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:34.420 align:middle line:90%
oh yeah.

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:37.440 align:middle line:84%
Because that's part of the
process, too, of once we make

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:41.850 align:middle line:84%
these really high frequency
family, very close connections,

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:46.500 align:middle line:84%
we begin to be activated by
the translation of our highest

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:49.380 align:middle line:84%
joy, which part of the process
is getting that slightly

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:51.000 align:middle line:90%
confused with anxiety.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.460 align:middle line:84%
Because that brings up all
the fun, interesting beliefs

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:55.110 align:middle line:90%
that we get to look at, right?

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:57.572 align:middle line:84%
So it's so important just
to read that in the story.

00:25:57.572 --> 00:25:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And that was my
personal experience

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:03.180 align:middle line:84%
is I got really confused for
a bit there in different ways.

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:05.700 align:middle line:10%
But also, that
allowed me to begin

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:10.307 align:middle line:10%
to remember different
memories from my childhood.

00:26:10.307 --> 00:26:11.640 align:middle line:90%
This would happen in the dreams.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:17.190 align:middle line:84%
This would happen in like,
daydream states, meditations.

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:22.890 align:middle line:84%
I also had a few very
physical sightings of craft.

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:25.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yup.

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:26.400 align:middle line:90%
Taken aboard ships?

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.390 align:middle line:90%
That kind of stuff?

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:27.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:28.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.270 align:middle line:90%
And memories of it.

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:33.870 align:middle line:84%
So it seems like it's been
part of the grand design

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:37.440 align:middle line:84%
for my experience to
have it rest somewhere

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.420 align:middle line:90%
in the dream state.

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And I so deeply honor
those individuals

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:44.550 align:middle line:84%
that have come from
earlier generations where

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:47.010 align:middle line:84%
it is, without a
shadow of a doubt,

00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:49.590 align:middle line:84%
that something physical
has come into their space.

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:53.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's perhaps where we
get the more classic abduction

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.397 align:middle line:90%
term from.

00:26:54.397 --> 00:26:56.730 align:middle line:84%
Because understandably, we're
interacting with an aspect

00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:58.710 align:middle line:90%
of our own denial.

00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:59.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yup.

00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.940 align:middle line:90%
>> You know?

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:00.840 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.000 align:middle line:84%
In terms of the gray in
this particular [HEBREW],,

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.570 align:middle line:84%
it's an aspect of what has
been suppressed now coming

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:08.200 align:middle line:90%
up and mirroring itself.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And so, that's going to
bring up all sorts of things

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:14.640 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the fear and
the, I mean, the deep trauma

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.590 align:middle line:90%
being reflected.

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:19.650 align:middle line:84%
So I so greatly honor what
people have gone through.

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And there's also many
different other programs

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:26.290 align:middle line:84%
where people could be having
different experience as well.

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:30.900 align:middle line:84%
But for me, it's been
mainly in this dream realm.

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's been my
journey to fully know

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:38.670 align:middle line:84%
and inner stand within myself
that there is a fine hair's

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:42.120 align:middle line:84%
difference between what
we call the astral dream

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.670 align:middle line:84%
and what we experience
as the physical dream.

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:46.170 align:middle line:90%
It's really fine.

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:48.570 align:middle line:10%
So-- but yes.

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:52.470 align:middle line:84%
Remembering
experiences on craft.

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:58.080 align:middle line:84%
Many different teachers within
the lineage, different aspects

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.360 align:middle line:90%
of the Sassani, Shakani--

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:03.030 align:middle line:84%
there's different evolutions
of these different beings,

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:03.270 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:04.770 align:middle line:84%
Different timelines,
different densities.

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:05.340 align:middle line:90%
Again, there's like--

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:06.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, sure.

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:06.890 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a big--

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:09.480 align:middle line:90%
it's lots of books.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.310 align:middle line:90%
And the YahYel as well.

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:15.030 align:middle line:90%
And then also, elemental beings.

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:20.880 align:middle line:84%
Different beings from Norse
mythology would come in.

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:23.410 align:middle line:84%
So I was beginning to
open up to the other side.

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:24.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:24.810 align:middle line:90%
The whole gamut.

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:25.530 align:middle line:90%
>> The whole gamut.

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:26.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
loving and very kind.

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:30.265 align:middle line:84%
And then in times, you
know, I would also,

00:28:30.265 --> 00:28:32.640 align:middle line:84%
because it was the experience
to kind of go super far out

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:36.480 align:middle line:84%
and come back, you know,
in terms of the anxiety.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And began to resonate
myself as what

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:40.750 align:middle line:90%
we might call hybridized human.

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:41.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:44.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So something that was very
much born here, very human.

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:48.720 align:middle line:84%
But have received different
activations along the way.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.890 align:middle line:90%
And I'm by far not the only one.

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:51.820 align:middle line:90%
>> True.

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:53.320 align:middle line:84%
I've had hybrids
on the show before.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>> OK cool.

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:55.820 align:middle line:90%
We're here.

00:28:55.820 --> 00:29:17.556 align:middle line:90%


00:29:17.556 --> 00:29:24.417 align:middle line:84%
(SINGING) I know who
I am and the things.

00:29:24.417 --> 00:29:27.231 align:middle line:90%
I've done.

00:29:27.231 --> 00:29:32.530 align:middle line:90%
I know I'm here in service.

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:35.736 align:middle line:90%
Here for the one.

00:29:35.736 --> 00:29:47.811 align:middle line:90%


00:29:47.811 --> 00:29:57.510 align:middle line:90%
I am the character on the stage.

00:29:57.510 --> 00:30:07.320 align:middle line:84%
We only ever know so
far down the page.

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:10.465 align:middle line:90%
Recall line.

00:30:10.465 --> 00:30:15.680 align:middle line:90%


00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:18.150 align:middle line:90%
And wait for our divine.

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:22.840 align:middle line:90%


00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.900 align:middle line:90%
One, two, three, four.

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:28.300 align:middle line:84%
(SINGING) Galactic
intuition, transition age.

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:29.100 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:33.240 align:middle line:90%
Gita, this is Gita.

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:37.790 align:middle line:10%
I don't-- a song for your Gita.

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:38.590 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:42.305 align:middle line:84%
Galactic intuition,
transition age.

00:30:42.305 --> 00:30:43.105 align:middle line:90%
Balance.

00:30:43.105 --> 00:30:47.400 align:middle line:90%
Gita, my name is Gita.

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:51.874 align:middle line:90%
It's nice to meet ya.

00:30:51.874 --> 00:31:01.140 align:middle line:90%


00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:02.494 align:middle line:90%
Flow.

00:31:02.494 --> 00:31:08.756 align:middle line:84%
Twice I said no to the
game I walked away.

00:31:08.756 --> 00:31:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Well now, we're coming together,
and we found the way to play.

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:21.560 align:middle line:84%
All our ancestors are
stars and they say

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:24.290 align:middle line:90%
that they're the same as us.

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:30.630 align:middle line:84%
So now it's time
to make me famous.

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:31.430 align:middle line:90%
Shit!

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:32.230 align:middle line:90%
Go!

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:35.830 align:middle line:90%
Gita, this is Gita.

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:39.510 align:middle line:90%
A song for your Gita.

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:43.230 align:middle line:84%
Galactic intuition,
transition age.

00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:44.030 align:middle line:90%
One more.

00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:48.370 align:middle line:90%
Gita, this is Gita.

00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:53.215 align:middle line:90%
It's nice to meet ya.

00:31:53.215 --> 00:31:55.720 align:middle line:90%


00:31:55.720 --> 00:32:05.040 align:middle line:90%
Oh I remember that rainbow door.

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:07.860 align:middle line:90%


00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:17.290 align:middle line:84%
But forever more,
on the stage, it's

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:24.466 align:middle line:84%
galactic intuition
transition age.

00:32:24.466 --> 00:32:52.530 align:middle line:90%


00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Then the calling of
Hawaii began to come.

00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:59.940 align:middle line:84%
I never really had
a big excitement

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:02.430 align:middle line:90%
of coming to these lands.

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:05.580 align:middle line:10%
My dad, Darrell-- his
name is Darrell Taylor--

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:08.820 align:middle line:10%
lived on Oahu for
a couple of years

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:11.750 align:middle line:10%
after his service in the navy.

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:14.190 align:middle line:84%
It's funny, he still wears
Hawaiian shirts to this day.

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:17.700 align:middle line:90%


00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.630 align:middle line:84%
He had come here and
lived here for a while.

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:21.240 align:middle line:90%
So I had that connection.

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:26.170 align:middle line:84%
But it just really just
kind of came out of nowhere.

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:26.970 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:27.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Was he here at the time?

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:28.770 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no, no.

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:29.940 align:middle line:90%
That was in the--

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:30.915 align:middle line:90%
way before I was born.

00:33:30.915 --> 00:33:31.715 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:33:31.715 --> 00:33:33.700 align:middle line:84%
>> So he was in the
late 70s, early 80s.

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:34.500 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:38.760 align:middle line:84%
>> He lived on Oahu
for a few years.

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:41.070 align:middle line:84%
But that was really
the only connection

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:43.470 align:middle line:90%
that I had with these lands.

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:47.550 align:middle line:84%
But it began to feel
more and more important

00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:48.690 align:middle line:90%
that I come here.

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And that Hawaii was
a representation

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:54.810 align:middle line:90%
and a symbol of planet Earth.

00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And as I was connecting to all
of these galactic energies,

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:02.130 align:middle line:90%
that it would help me ground.

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:03.150 align:middle line:90%
Simply enough.

00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And find union with the
stars and the Earth.

00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:11.370 align:middle line:90%
And bring that together.

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And then I would be able to, in
ways, like, return to the womb,

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:18.150 align:middle line:90%
and rebirth myself.

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:23.550 align:middle line:10%
And it would be this just
supremely loving, feminine,

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:31.800 align:middle line:10%
powerful space that was also
very integral and intentional.

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:36.864 align:middle line:84%
But had so much flow and support
for me to bloom and blossom.

00:34:36.864 --> 00:34:38.489 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that I
would need to be here

00:34:38.489 --> 00:34:40.830 align:middle line:84%
for an extended amount
of time, that I would

00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:43.380 align:middle line:90%
need to get a one way ticket.

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:45.230 align:middle line:90%
But it was overwhelming for me.

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:46.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:48.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And so I didn't
jump right away.

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:51.420 align:middle line:84%
Because I think I did know
enough about the lands

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:57.240 align:middle line:84%
to know the, perhaps, the
story that outsiders aren't

00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.740 align:middle line:90%
necessarily treated very well.

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:02.970 align:middle line:84%
That there may be a bit of
a judgment or non openness

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:04.350 align:middle line:90%
to outsiders coming in.

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:09.180 align:middle line:10%
And I was also seeing
myself as a symbol

00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:11.880 align:middle line:10%
as something bringing,
perhaps, what

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:15.000 align:middle line:10%
we would call a very
alien frequency to Earth,

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.460 align:middle line:10%
and kind of balancing that
outsider coming to Earth.

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:22.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Gotcha.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:25.170 align:middle line:84%
>> So I was really taking my
time and listening and making

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:26.810 align:middle line:90%
sure.

00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And then synchronicities
started to come in.

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And I still like,
pushed it away.

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:32.780 align:middle line:90%
Pushed it away.

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:34.180 align:middle line:90%
Because it was just a lot.

00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, I was
working at a really fun

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:38.610 align:middle line:90%
vintage boutique.

00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:42.000 align:middle line:84%
I was the assistant manager of
a vintage boutique in downtown

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.020 align:middle line:90%
San Rafael in Marin County.

00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And one day, a group
of Hawaiians come in.

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And they're wearing
Hawaiian shirts.

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And just the sweetest
uncle auntie energy.

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And they ask me, hey, could
we play ukulele in your store?

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:02.460 align:middle line:90%
Could we sing in your store?

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:05.960 align:middle line:10%
And the glint behind
this one uncle's eye,

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:11.370 align:middle line:10%
this like, trickster knowingness
just caught my breath.

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:12.990 align:middle line:84%
But I said, yeah,
of course, you know?

00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And I never-- I didn't
ask, you know, why or how

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:15.810 align:middle line:90%
did you know to come here?

00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:16.500 align:middle line:90%
Or why are you here?

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:17.300 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:20.070 align:middle line:84%
But because I almost don't want
to like, break the magic of it,

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:21.990 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:24.370 align:middle line:84%
So they sat and played
their music in the store

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:26.370 align:middle line:84%
and all these people came
in, made a whole bunch

00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:27.310 align:middle line:90%
of sales that day.

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:28.930 align:middle line:90%
It was really magical, yeah.

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:32.690 align:middle line:90%
And but still, I didn't go.

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:35.010 align:middle line:90%
I still was like, didn't go.

00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:35.810 align:middle line:90%
And then I--

00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:37.310 align:middle line:84%
>> But you had the
calling, though?

00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:37.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, for sure.

00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:38.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:39.500 align:middle line:90%
>> It was for months.

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:41.530 align:middle line:84%
For months, this
calling, and like,

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:45.050 align:middle line:90%
the drumbeat was getting louder.

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:49.340 align:middle line:90%
But I kept pushing it away.

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And then I had a dream where
I was swimming with dolphins.

00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:57.290 align:middle line:90%
And again, dolphins are great.

00:36:57.290 --> 00:37:00.110 align:middle line:84%
At that point, I
was slightly aware

00:37:00.110 --> 00:37:03.830 align:middle line:84%
that they have connections
to galactic frequencies,

00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:06.650 align:middle line:84%
that they're portals
and connections

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:08.870 align:middle line:90%
and they're able to--

00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:11.480 align:middle line:84%
that they're aliens, in a way,
right here in our own ocean.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.280 align:middle line:84%
I had somewhat of
awareness of that.

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.800 align:middle line:90%


00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And it was nothing that was
ever an excitement of mine

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:19.610 align:middle line:90%
to go swim with dolphins.

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:21.140 align:middle line:90%
It was just, you know?

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And, I'm swimming with
them in this dream.

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And then I hear this
thundering, [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And I wake up, like I've been
dropped back in to my body.

00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:39.350 align:middle line:10%
And I had a good
enough understanding

00:37:39.350 --> 00:37:43.680 align:middle line:10%
of phonetic spelling to be able
to sound it out and type it in

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:44.480 align:middle line:10%
and look it up.

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And found out that it translates
to gateway of the gods.

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And that it is a specific bay
on the big island of Hawaii.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And that a lot of dolphins
are known to swim there.

00:37:56.270 --> 00:38:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's a sacred site,
a kapu forest, a heiau,

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:03.110 align:middle line:84%
which is a sacred site
where they honor gods.

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:06.380 align:middle line:90%
So I booked a one way ticket.

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:08.690 align:middle line:90%
I had a big backpack and $800.

00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:12.050 align:middle line:10%
And knew enough of the
teachings of the hybrid lineage

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:14.615 align:middle line:10%
at this point to follow my joy.

00:38:14.615 --> 00:38:18.770 align:middle line:10%
And so I landed a really sweet
work trade at a beautiful place

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:20.420 align:middle line:10%
called Pineapple Park.

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And I helped make
beds and clean house.

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And was close enough to the
King Kamehameha Trail, which

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:29.420 align:middle line:84%
is a very sacred
trail that goes down

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:30.930 align:middle line:90%
to the Captain Cook's Monument.

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:32.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>> If we want to look at it
in terms of a larger story,

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:37.160 align:middle line:84%
was perhaps how I
resonate, in a way,

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:40.220 align:middle line:84%
as the outsider coming
from somewhere else.

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:41.762 align:middle line:84%
And how do we do
this with integrity?

00:38:41.762 --> 00:38:42.562 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:38:42.562 --> 00:38:44.540 align:middle line:84%
How do we have this
union and this merge

00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:48.500 align:middle line:84%
and this re-connection
in a new way?

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, I
just followed my instincts.

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And the land began
to speak to me more.

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And I would go
down to Kealakekua,

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:57.960 align:middle line:84%
and I would swim
with the dolphins

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:00.930 align:middle line:84%
and spend hours and hours
and hours with them.

00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And learned that
telepathy is very real.

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:08.160 align:middle line:10%
Even though I had begun
to trust that and know

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:11.070 align:middle line:10%
that with the
channeling, it just

00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:14.880 align:middle line:10%
made it that much more
concrete in my experience.

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:19.290 align:middle line:84%
I began to get more memories
of my connection as a hybrid.

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And also my connection
to other programs.

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:24.690 align:middle line:90%
But that made me really strong.

00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:26.065 align:middle line:84%
Remembering some
of these things.

00:39:26.065 --> 00:39:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And also was able to tap
into some of the techniques

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:33.270 align:middle line:84%
that I learned in these
different programs.

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And teaching me to be
able to swim deeper,

00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:37.140 align:middle line:84%
so I could stay
with them longer.

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:40.110 align:middle line:84%
But also knowing how
it is appropriate

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:43.050 align:middle line:84%
what protocols to
use when interacting

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:44.700 align:middle line:90%
with an alien species.

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:47.940 align:middle line:84%
So learning them as
animals, we might say.

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:50.580 align:middle line:90%
So knowing when they're resting.

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:51.780 align:middle line:90%
It's not appropriate.

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:54.030 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, you know, we do it.

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:56.100 align:middle line:90%
But it's not optimum.

00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:59.273 align:middle line:84%
It's not the best way
to interact with them

00:39:59.273 --> 00:40:00.190 align:middle line:90%
when they're sleeping.

00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:04.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Knowing that sometimes, it
may look like they're playing.

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:07.140 align:middle line:84%
But no, they're slapping
the keiki, the babies,

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:08.670 align:middle line:90%
and you know, go to bed.

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:10.190 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And learning them as a
culture, as their own race.

00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And me feeling, again,
giving me the opportunity

00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:23.920 align:middle line:84%
to allow myself to feel more so
like the alien or the outsider

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.170 align:middle line:90%
or the malihini, the newcomer.

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:28.580 align:middle line:90%


00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:31.020 align:middle line:84%
To learn what is
appropriate and how

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:35.280 align:middle line:84%
do we best make contact
with another race,

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.565 align:middle line:90%
with an alien species.

00:40:36.565 --> 00:41:04.260 align:middle line:90%


00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And so from there, I
continued to play and explore

00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:10.410 align:middle line:90%
and also continue to channel.

00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:11.210 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:15.380 align:middle line:84%
>> And to share with people and
aligned with people that knew

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:20.450 align:middle line:84%
of a particular lineage and
were excited to, you know,

00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:22.670 align:middle line:90%
see what I had to share.

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
too, that's really

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:31.480 align:middle line:84%
when it solidified into
being a hybrid child.

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And I knew it was a girl, it
was a child at that point.

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And I understood her to
be of the Yahyel race.

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:39.870 align:middle line:90%
But she was young.

00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:42.470 align:middle line:84%
But it was, the
doors had opened.

00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And there was the
singular entity

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:49.040 align:middle line:84%
that had presented herself that
was really exciting for me.

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.570 align:middle line:90%


00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And aligning with
synchronicities.

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:55.760 align:middle line:90%
She said that she--

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.860 align:middle line:84%
her ship-- she
was on a ship that

00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:00.890 align:middle line:84%
was above Maui, above
Haleakala that she still

00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:03.217 align:middle line:90%
continues to say till this day.

00:42:03.217 --> 00:42:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Did that happen while
you were in Hawaii?

00:42:05.050 --> 00:42:06.620 align:middle line:90%
That came through?

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And it was very,
very specific.

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And then I had a confirmation--
a loose confirmation,

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:14.180 align:middle line:84%
in a way-- just of the
importance of Maui and people

00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:17.270 align:middle line:84%
being called Brigitte Nielsen,
was writing her blog at that

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:19.100 align:middle line:90%
point, and shared that she--

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:20.870 align:middle line:90%
around the same day--

00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:23.120 align:middle line:84%
that she had been
called to go to Maui.

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:24.222 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh OK.

00:42:24.222 --> 00:42:26.180 align:middle line:84%
She had her hybrid children
blog at that point.

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And it just, it was a sweet
kind of confirmation, in a way.

00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:31.370 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:33.160 align:middle line:90%
>> When did you get the tattoos?

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>> That was a few
months later, I suppose.

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:42.590 align:middle line:84%
So I had a vision of these
very specific spirals

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:43.630 align:middle line:90%
on my shoulder.

00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:47.570 align:middle line:10%
And I went to a tattoo
artist in Kailua Kona.

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:48.890 align:middle line:90%
Because I was wanting tattoos.

00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:51.290 align:middle line:84%
I had many different
ideas for tattoos.

00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:54.955 align:middle line:84%
And he asked, what do
you-- what's one of them?

00:42:54.955 --> 00:42:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I've got
an idea of these spirals

00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:57.880 align:middle line:90%
on my shoulder.

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:00.278 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, what
kind of spiral?

00:43:00.278 --> 00:43:02.070 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I don't know
how to describe it.

00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:02.930 align:middle line:90%
It's like a double--

00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:03.730 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And he, so he opened up,
he had a symbol book.

00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:06.530 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh!

00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:07.010 align:middle line:90%
That one!

00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:08.180 align:middle line:90%
That's it right there.

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:09.950 align:middle line:90%
He's like, OK.

00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:11.487 align:middle line:90%
That's a really powerful symbol.

00:43:11.487 --> 00:43:13.445 align:middle line:84%
And he saw that specifically
on your shoulders.

00:43:13.445 --> 00:43:15.020 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, yeah.

00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:17.510 align:middle line:10%
And he's like, that's a
really traditional tattoo

00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:20.370 align:middle line:10%
from Indonesia.

00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:21.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:21.970 align:middle line:90%
Not Hawaii?

00:43:21.970 --> 00:43:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-mm.

00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:25.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think it's been
used all through, you know,

00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:26.800 align:middle line:90%
the South Pacific.

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:27.840 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>> But he specifically
said Indonesia and Ireland.

00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:31.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Ireland too?

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:32.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Ireland.

00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And they would tattoo
them on the shoulders

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.270 align:middle line:84%
to signify going
into the journey,

00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:40.400 align:middle line:84%
or going into the
battle, whether it

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:43.310 align:middle line:84%
be an external battle or the
internal physical battle.

00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:44.990 align:middle line:90%
It was done for both reasons.

00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And he also told
me, in that moment,

00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:49.460 align:middle line:84%
it's a really sacred
symbol because it

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:52.430 align:middle line:90%
is the depiction of our galaxy.

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:55.130 align:middle line:84%
Different galaxies take on
different spiral patterns.

00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:59.767 align:middle line:84%
And this specific
one is our galaxy.

00:43:59.767 --> 00:44:01.100 align:middle line:90%
And he said, you should really--

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:03.470 align:middle line:84%
I highly recommend that
you get that tattooed.

00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:05.790 align:middle line:84%
If you saw that in the
vision, it's powerful.

00:44:05.790 --> 00:44:06.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:09.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And he also said
that traditionally,

00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:13.100 align:middle line:84%
in specifically Indonesia,
and in specifically Ireland,

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:15.485 align:middle line:90%
tattoos were done by women.

00:44:15.485 --> 00:44:16.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And he said, so I
advise you, and I--

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:23.310 align:middle line:84%
to go to this specific
tattoo artist who is a woman.

00:44:23.310 --> 00:44:25.910 align:middle line:84%
She was born here
on the islands.

00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:27.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
tattoo that on you.

00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:28.500 align:middle line:90%
He was not from here.

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:29.300 align:middle line:90%
He was a male.

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:30.678 align:middle line:90%
And he was like, no.

00:44:30.678 --> 00:44:32.970 align:middle line:84%
Please, like, I don't want
to take your money for that.

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:34.428 align:middle line:84%
Come back to me
for something else.

00:44:34.428 --> 00:44:35.410 align:middle line:90%
But go to a--

00:44:35.410 --> 00:44:38.810 align:middle line:84%
and he specifically recommended
a particular tattoo artist.

00:44:38.810 --> 00:44:39.980 align:middle line:90%
And it's interesting.

00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:42.710 align:middle line:84%
This was definitely
before Disney

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:45.050 align:middle line:90%
released the movie "Moana."

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:47.130 align:middle line:90%
So when that movie came out--

00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>> I forgot.

00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:48.770 align:middle line:90%
She has tattoos?

00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:49.760 align:middle line:90%
>> No, she doesn't have tattoos.

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:50.600 align:middle line:90%
But it's on her sail.

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:51.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it's on her sail.

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:52.100 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:55.445 align:middle line:10%
>> And this very specific spiral
is on the heart of the ocean

00:44:55.445 --> 00:44:57.905 align:middle line:10%
that she gives back to Nafiti.

00:44:57.905 --> 00:45:01.850 align:middle line:84%
So she's able to bring
the heart and allow

00:45:01.850 --> 00:45:04.940 align:middle line:84%
the feminine
expression of the will

00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:07.880 align:middle line:90%
back into its rightful place.

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:09.110 align:middle line:90%
And the movement.

00:45:09.110 --> 00:45:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And Moana is aided by Maui
to be able to do this.

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:16.630 align:middle line:10%
So there is a lot of
interesting synchronicities.

00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And we're all echoes
of each other, right?

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:19.130 align:middle line:90%
We're all stories.

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:20.360 align:middle line:90%
And there's all these fractals.

00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:22.818 align:middle line:84%
And there's all the, you kn
ow, the chicken and the egg way

00:45:22.818 --> 00:45:23.840 align:middle line:90%
of telling story.

00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And always just different
mirrors of each other.

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:30.290 align:middle line:84%
So that was a fun
synchronicity for me.

00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:32.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:35.360 align:middle line:90%
So then, we got to Hawaii.

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:37.670 align:middle line:84%
How do we get back to where
you started channeling

00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:39.320 align:middle line:84%
and then now, you're
part of my show?

00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:40.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:41.270 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:43.412 align:middle line:84%
At some point, I just knew
that it was time for me

00:45:43.412 --> 00:45:44.620 align:middle line:90%
to come back to the mainland.

00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:47.180 align:middle line:90%


00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:48.950 align:middle line:84%
That the lands would
always be with me

00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:51.410 align:middle line:84%
and it was time to go on to
the next phase of the hero's

00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:52.210 align:middle line:90%
journey.

00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:54.380 align:middle line:90%


00:45:54.380 --> 00:46:02.070 align:middle line:84%
I saw a ship one night shortly
after I had returned home.

00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:04.530 align:middle line:90%
I had a long day at work.

00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:05.970 align:middle line:90%
I had a very long day.

00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:08.100 align:middle line:84%
6:00 in the morning
working in a coffee shop,

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:10.410 align:middle line:84%
and then taught a yoga
class, and then played music

00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:11.210 align:middle line:90%
with my friends.

00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:13.407 align:middle line:90%
It was like, a 15 hour day.

00:46:13.407 --> 00:46:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And I was getting out of my car
in a residential neighborhood,

00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:19.340 align:middle line:90%
again in San Rafael.

00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And I saw a triangular shaped
craft go over the houses,

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.800 align:middle line:84%
right across the street
and behind the hill.

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And it was about the
size of a 50 cent piece.

00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:32.070 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:34.310 align:middle line:84%
>> It was like, you
know, a good size.

00:46:34.310 --> 00:46:35.820 align:middle line:90%
And I had a thought like, oh.

00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:37.470 align:middle line:90%
That's very real.

00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:38.490 align:middle line:90%
That's not from here.

00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:41.550 align:middle line:84%
That's like, Sassani
galactic federation.

00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:42.360 align:middle line:90%
Oh look at that.

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:43.500 align:middle line:90%
Like, look at the details.

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:46.000 align:middle line:84%
Like, that looks exactly like
it would look like in a movie.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Like, I could even see like,
the, like, hexagon imprints

00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:50.940 align:middle line:90%
of the lights.

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:51.240 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:52.540 align:middle line:90%
It was like, very detailed.

00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And in my mind,
I was like, yeah.

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:54.810 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:55.530 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:57.090 align:middle line:84%
Like, our CGI's
getting really good.

00:46:57.090 --> 00:46:58.040 align:middle line:90%
That's not CGI.

00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:00.050 align:middle line:10%
Like, that's what it would
look like in a movie.

00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:02.620 align:middle line:90%
And I was very blase about it.

00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And then it crossed behind
the trees and behind the hill.

00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:10.707 align:middle line:10%
And I knew I could go and run
up after it if I wanted to,

00:47:10.707 --> 00:47:12.540 align:middle line:10%
like, just to be sure
to like, see it again.

00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:13.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:17.250 align:middle line:84%
>> But my honest excitement
was just to go to bed.

00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:18.530 align:middle line:90%
I was like, what's up, dudes?

00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:19.470 align:middle line:90%
Like, I know who you are.

00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:20.040 align:middle line:90%
Like, thanks.

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:20.550 align:middle line:90%
It's good.

00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:21.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm good.

00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:22.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm just-- I'm going to bed.

00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:25.140 align:middle line:90%
Like, whatever.

00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:27.030 align:middle line:90%
And I was so blase about it.

00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And I unpacked my things
and was brushing my teeth

00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:33.120 align:middle line:84%
and looked at myself in the
mirror, and was like, dude.

00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:34.140 align:middle line:90%
Stop.

00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:35.980 align:middle line:90%
Just take a minute.

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:36.780 align:middle line:90%
You saw that.

00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:38.680 align:middle line:90%
That was very, very real.

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:40.440 align:middle line:90%
Acknowledge this special moment.

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And also acknowledge how
perfect your response was.

00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:46.980 align:middle line:84%
You were just so
natural and like,

00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:49.120 align:middle line:84%
that's what we were
looking for, in a way.

00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:52.770 align:middle line:84%
It was just like,
what's up, you know?

00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And then at that point, I
began to know that it was time.

00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:59.680 align:middle line:84%
This was perhaps
a few years ago.

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:01.890 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a very long blog
that a lot of people read.

00:48:01.890 --> 00:48:03.120 align:middle line:90%
I did it in stages.

00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:06.330 align:middle line:84%
Because it was very much in
my integrity to make sure

00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:09.630 align:middle line:84%
that I had integrated
as much as possible.

00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:11.280 align:middle line:84%
That I had understood
really fully,

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:14.340 align:middle line:90%
it's always about the story.

00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:15.832 align:middle line:84%
There was also
synchronicities that

00:48:15.832 --> 00:48:18.040 align:middle line:84%
needed to happen with
different friends, different co

00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:20.820 align:middle line:84%
creators, different
mirrors, different channels

00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:24.840 align:middle line:84%
of their own spirit that allowed
for the alignment of the Isabel

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:26.175 align:middle line:90%
name to come through.

00:48:26.175 --> 00:48:27.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right, right.

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:30.240 align:middle line:10%
>> The bell that rings
spontaneously on its own in one

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:32.370 align:middle line:10%
channeling with an individual.

00:48:32.370 --> 00:48:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And then, I never told
that story to anyone.

00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:37.890 align:middle line:90%
And then there was--

00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:41.220 align:middle line:84%
it was resonated through
the sound of my voice.

00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:44.700 align:middle line:84%
My voice hit a frequency
that I'd never felt.

00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And as a vocalist, that was
pretty impressive for me

00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:50.220 align:middle line:84%
to experience a part
of my range and a part

00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:53.515 align:middle line:84%
of the mask in this part of
the voice that I'd never felt.

00:48:53.515 --> 00:48:54.640 align:middle line:90%
And it was sent through me.

00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And I had that split duality
again, like, ooh, wait for it.

00:48:58.330 --> 00:48:59.310 align:middle line:90%
Wait for it.

00:48:59.310 --> 00:49:01.310 align:middle line:90%
And then ding.

00:49:01.310 --> 00:49:02.850 align:middle line:84%
A bell went off
in the next room.

00:49:02.850 --> 00:49:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>> So you kind of
knew it was coming?

00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:06.870 align:middle line:90%
I was prepared for it.

00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And prepared for the sound
to come through as well.

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:13.710 align:middle line:84%
Everything is so artfully,
strategically, perfectly done,

00:49:13.710 --> 00:49:17.400 align:middle line:84%
where I am always taken care
of, and always making sure

00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:21.360 align:middle line:84%
that my body is going
to be, you know,

00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:23.400 align:middle line:84%
never harmed or
anything in the process.

00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of
my alignment, right,

00:49:25.290 --> 00:49:27.167 align:middle line:90%
of matching her frequency.

00:49:27.167 --> 00:49:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And then there-- I never
told that story to anyone

00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:32.020 align:middle line:84%
except for the individual
that was in the room.

00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And then I was with another
friend of mine, Kyle.

00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And he asked, when I was
channeling for friends, just

00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:42.060 align:middle line:84%
still privately,
do you have a name?

00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:46.310 align:middle line:10%
And she said, we think it's
fun if you get it for yourself.

00:49:46.310 --> 00:49:48.480 align:middle line:84%
We're whispering it
to you right now.

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:51.683 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I just
heard is a bell.

00:49:51.683 --> 00:49:52.510 align:middle line:90%
And oh.

00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:52.920 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:53.720 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:55.970 align:middle line:90%
So then I was in the channeling.

00:49:55.970 --> 00:50:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And can look through
certain windows,

00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:03.070 align:middle line:84%
be more conscious when
it's relevant for me.

00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:05.340 align:middle line:84%
And so I was very aware
that it just happened.

00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:08.680 align:middle line:90%
And was like, whoa.

00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:09.510 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:10.200 align:middle line:90%
So we had her name.

00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>> You finally got a name.

00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:10.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:50:10.850 --> 00:50:11.808 align:middle line:90%
>> We had her name now.

00:50:11.808 --> 00:50:15.120 align:middle line:84%
So again, the synchronicity
began to unfold.

00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And there came a point where,
again, synchronicity aligned.

00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that it was time for
me to step from the shadows.

00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:27.660 align:middle line:84%
The number of dreams
and physical reflections

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:29.320 align:middle line:90%
of the dream.

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And I met a friend of mine by
the name of Sadie Strunk, who

00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:37.980 align:middle line:84%
was doing a fun YouTube
channel and had excitement

00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:39.540 align:middle line:90%
about connecting with me.

00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:42.450 align:middle line:10%
So I flew her out
to California and we

00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:47.070 align:middle line:10%
got together and
did the first video

00:50:47.070 --> 00:50:49.570 align:middle line:10%
that we shared on Facebook.

00:50:49.570 --> 00:50:50.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:50:50.370 --> 00:50:52.340 align:middle line:10%
>> And at this point, I was
very aware of your show.

00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:53.640 align:middle line:90%
I was aware of Vashta Narada.

00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:54.960 align:middle line:90%
I was aware of Gabe Solomon.

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:56.880 align:middle line:84%
I was aware of, you know,
all these different,

00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:59.850 align:middle line:84%
you know, people kind of
within this community.

00:50:59.850 --> 00:51:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And Brigitte Nielsen,
who I mentioned before.

00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:03.150 align:middle line:90%
And [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:06.220 align:middle line:84%
Like, you know, I was like,
oh, I was stalking you guys.

00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:07.150 align:middle line:90%
Because it's fun.

00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:07.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>> I was watching and waiting,
and like, and integrating.

00:51:12.450 --> 00:51:17.498 align:middle line:10%
And so it was kind of like my
glass ceiling to think, oh,

00:51:17.498 --> 00:51:18.540 align:middle line:10%
wouldn't that be so cool?

00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:22.590 align:middle line:84%
Like, one day, maybe I'll get
to be on Interview with ED.

00:51:22.590 --> 00:51:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And this was still on
the Vimeo at this point.

00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And so I shared the
video on Facebook.

00:51:29.010 --> 00:51:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And two weeks later, there was
a message from you in my inbox.

00:51:34.290 --> 00:51:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And it was just further
confirmation, right,

00:51:37.350 --> 00:51:40.350 align:middle line:84%
of the imagination that
it's all perfectly planned

00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:42.540 align:middle line:84%
and the orchestration
of everything.

00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, there were
people within the community,

00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:48.720 align:middle line:84%
within the channeling network,
within the hybrid lineage

00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:51.420 align:middle line:84%
community that were excited
and supportive of what

00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:53.520 align:middle line:84%
I was doing and
began sharing things

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:55.830 align:middle line:84%
and knew that I had
to build a website

00:51:55.830 --> 00:51:58.110 align:middle line:84%
and started offering
sessions, pardon me.

00:51:58.110 --> 00:52:01.650 align:middle line:84%
It happened very
naturally and organically.

00:52:01.650 --> 00:52:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And then at some
point, as I began

00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:08.550 align:middle line:84%
to get more integrated and
stronger with Bella's energy,

00:52:08.550 --> 00:52:12.690 align:middle line:84%
she shifted from being a
child into being an adult.

00:52:12.690 --> 00:52:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And sharing, yes,
that she is a Yahyel.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:15.900 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, sure.

00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:18.200 align:middle line:84%
There is a timeline where
she still is a child.

00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:19.650 align:middle line:84%
But it's more
appropriate for her

00:52:19.650 --> 00:52:21.910 align:middle line:90%
to come through as an adult.

00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:22.910 align:middle line:90%
>> And reasons being?

00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:23.720 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:26.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know, we can
learn a lot from the wisdom

00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:29.250 align:middle line:90%
of children, of course.

00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:32.220 align:middle line:84%
But there are some
things that, no matter

00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:36.102 align:middle line:84%
how wise or how
connected a child is,

00:52:36.102 --> 00:52:37.560 align:middle line:84%
there are some
things that you just

00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:39.160 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't send a child to do.

00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:39.960 align:middle line:90%
It's just not--

00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:42.993 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably wouldn't-- people
taking lessons wouldn't share

00:52:42.993 --> 00:52:44.160 align:middle line:90%
certain things with a child.

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:44.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Perhaps.

00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:45.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:48.660 align:middle line:10%
And there are certain things,
especially with this lineage

00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:53.370 align:middle line:10%
and with the experiencers
and members of the program,

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:55.320 align:middle line:10%
there are certain
sensitive issues

00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:58.560 align:middle line:10%
that need to be talked
about, things, you know,

00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:03.330 align:middle line:10%
that Bella is trained to
be able to hold that space

00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:06.870 align:middle line:10%
and to be that friend.

00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And that, almost like
a therapist, in a way.

00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:11.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So is Isabel sort of
the child version of Bella,

00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:12.420 align:middle line:90%
in a way?

00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:13.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Well yeah, sure.

00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:13.620 align:middle line:90%
We could say that.

00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:14.662 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's kind of fun.

00:53:14.662 --> 00:53:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And also like, she just
has a frequency, you know?

00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:18.330 align:middle line:90%
Like, all these beings.

00:53:18.330 --> 00:53:20.770 align:middle line:84%
The name is just something
that we have to use.

00:53:20.770 --> 00:53:21.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:53:21.570 --> 00:53:25.780 align:middle line:10%
>> And also, her and the lineage
in her family always like

00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:27.000 align:middle line:10%
to play with words.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:27.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yup.

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So the Is- a- belle came
through very specifically

00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:36.720 align:middle line:84%
as a reminder that we
are all is a bells.

00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:39.450 align:middle line:84%
That we are all our
perfect channels

00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:42.001 align:middle line:90%
in the greater orchestra.

00:53:42.001 --> 00:53:45.330 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I guess the two,
I do kind of have a slight--

00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:48.250 align:middle line:84%
but it's Bella is more
so preferred, like the--

00:53:48.250 --> 00:53:49.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:53:49.050 --> 00:53:49.700 align:middle line:84%
>> If we really want
to get technical--

00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:51.492 align:middle line:84%
>> We just spent the
whole week with Bella.

00:53:51.492 --> 00:53:52.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:53:52.370 --> 00:53:54.750 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and even her child
self is like, no, I'm Bella.

00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And everyone else
is Is- a- bells.

00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:57.240 align:middle line:90%
And I'm an Isabelle too.

00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:00.790 align:middle line:90%
It's her way to play with words.

Because we know fear.

We only see white
because we see black.

00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:41.540 align:middle line:10%
Not this or that, this and that.
