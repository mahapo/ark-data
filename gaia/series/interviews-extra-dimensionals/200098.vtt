00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Karen, Welcome

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.213 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome to LA.

00:01:30.213 --> 00:01:31.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, thank you very much.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.580 align:middle line:84%
It's so nice to be in
this amazing weather.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>> It's amazing weather,
and it's January.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.190 align:middle line:84%
It's almost the new year,
and we're in short sleeves.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm sweating.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:42.870 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm refusing to sweat.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:43.390 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, don't sweat.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.598 align:middle line:90%
>> Until after the interview.

00:01:44.598 --> 00:01:46.270 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, good move.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.180 align:middle line:10%
And you're here for
the Channel Panel.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.390 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm here for the
Channel Panel, yeah.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Very exciting.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.260 align:middle line:10%
>> And to meet you and many
friends that I haven't met face

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.640 align:middle line:10%
to face, but I've known
through Facebook and different

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.097 align:middle line:10%
channeling contact, YouTube,
and all these things.

00:02:01.097 --> 00:02:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're
originally from America.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.970 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm from South Carolina.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:04.560 align:middle line:90%
>> South Carolina?

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.190 align:middle line:90%
I was born in Tennessee.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.289 align:middle line:84%
I grew up primarily
in South Carolina.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.620 align:middle line:84%
We lived in the Washington,
DC area until I was about 10.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And then we moved
to South Carolina,

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.733 align:middle line:84%
and then I went to
university there.

00:02:14.733 --> 00:02:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And then I moved
to New York City.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.340 align:middle line:90%
I was an actress and a singer.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
pursuing more music.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, I was
always really much more busy

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.480 align:middle line:84%
with my spirituality, so
I just took a decision

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.220 align:middle line:84%
that I wasn't as
dedicated as I needed

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.443 align:middle line:84%
to be to be in the
show business world.

00:02:33.443 --> 00:02:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a lot of dedication.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:35.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.410 align:middle line:10%
And I didn't like living in
a car or starving and all

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.305 align:middle line:10%
that stuff.

00:02:40.305 --> 00:02:41.430 align:middle line:90%
But I did some nice things.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.310 align:middle line:90%
I had fun, and it was enjoyable.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.400 align:middle line:90%
And then I had an opportunity.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.250 align:middle line:84%
I moved to Florida, and then
after that, I moved to Europe,

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.050 align:middle line:84%
and I've been in the
Netherlands since 2000.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Since 2000, wow.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.830 align:middle line:90%
17 years?

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, in the
Netherlands proper?

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.190 align:middle line:84%
>> In the Hague in
the Netherlands.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, where?

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.000 align:middle line:84%
>> It's about 45
minutes from Amsterdam.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.440 align:middle line:90%
>> What drew you there?

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I was working for a sport
nutrition company, who--

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.870 align:middle line:84%
it was a company that
made high protein bars.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.810 align:middle line:84%
It was the first company that
ever made a high protein bar.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And they were bought
by a Dutch company,

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.780 align:middle line:84%
and I was the international
sales manager for them.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And then they gave
me the opportunity

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.660 align:middle line:84%
to go when they bought them,
because they wanted to set up

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.600 align:middle line:90%
the European business.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.900 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, yes, I'll go.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.400 align:middle line:90%
>> And was that--

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.310 align:middle line:84%
I guess you went, and
you fell in love and--

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>> No, well, I fell in
love with the country.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.770 align:middle line:84%
I just decided if I was going
to go, I was really going to go.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.530 align:middle line:84%
You know, I wasn't going to just
kind of go, stay for a year.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.880 align:middle line:84%
I moved lock, stock,
and barrel over.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.420 align:middle line:90%
And I just thought, I'm going.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And I just had no
reservation about doing it,

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.790 align:middle line:84%
and I got on the
plane, and there I was,

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.760 align:middle line:90%
and I'm still there.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, is it easy to navigate?

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.760 align:middle line:84%
I've never been-- I've actually
never really been to Europe,

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.970 align:middle line:90%
so that's the thing.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the Netherlands is
one of the countries that is

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.270 align:middle line:84%
the easiest, because everybody
speaks perfect English,

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.890 align:middle line:90%
the entire country--

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.090 align:middle line:84%
young, old, and
everything in between.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.890 align:middle line:90%
They speak English.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.290 align:middle line:84%
They're very, very
entrepreneurial as a country.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.740 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones that invent
so many of the things that

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:09.638 align:middle line:90%
are out there.

00:04:09.638 --> 00:04:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And they come out
of the Netherlands.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.640 align:middle line:90%
It's a very open society.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.790 align:middle line:84%
They were the first
to enact gay marriage.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.089 align:middle line:90%
They have very lax--

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:22.960 align:middle line:84%
not lax but permissive laws
when it comes to drugs.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Not that I do drugs, but
just the fact that they

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.310 align:middle line:84%
look at it like, you
know, it's better

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.248 align:middle line:90%
to prevent than to demonize.

00:04:29.248 --> 00:04:31.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, they're one of the
countries that sort of took

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.590 align:middle line:90%
that stance and--

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and they do
that on so many things.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.320 align:middle line:84%
It's a socialist
country, but it's

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.990 align:middle line:84%
also very free,
so much more free

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.360 align:middle line:90%
than I think even in America.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.510 align:middle line:84%
>> --They value things
differently than we value them.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're doing
your practice--

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.180 align:middle line:84%
spiritual practices
and teachings

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.180 align:middle line:90%
out of the Netherlands--

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.445 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:55.445 --> 00:04:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>> --Primarily, or Europe,
because you have many events

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:58.630 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I do.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.310 align:middle line:84%
I do a lot of channeling events
and personal sessions, as well

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.390 align:middle line:90%
as I've been on YouTube a lot.

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.200 align:middle line:84%
So I do-- I work
with Human Colony.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.260 align:middle line:84%
I used to have a radio show with
Rob Gauthier on his network.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.700 align:middle line:84%
When he had his network, it
was myself, Daniel Scranton,

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Roxanne Swainhart, Rob,
and some other people.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And we all had a show, and
that's how I really came in.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And I started
channelling like right

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.795 align:middle line:84%
at that moment when
I had the radio show.

00:05:24.795 --> 00:05:26.170 align:middle line:84%
But I was having
the radio show--

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.660 align:middle line:84%
it's called "About Oneness,"
and it was just really

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.060 align:middle line:84%
about talking about
things I found fascinating

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.700 align:middle line:84%
and the people that were
living their life in a way that

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.512 align:middle line:90%
reflected my sort of worldview.

00:05:36.512 --> 00:05:38.220 align:middle line:84%
>> And you would
interview these people--

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.303 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I'd interview them.

00:05:39.303 --> 00:05:41.260 align:middle line:84%
It's just a radio
show, and it was

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.380 align:middle line:84%
online on Blog Talk Radio,
and then shortly thereafter, I

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.680 align:middle line:84%
ended up with the same show,
but on Pyramid One network,

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.720 align:middle line:90%
so I was doing it twice a week.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd started channeling
and it sort of went from there.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So before the show,
where you channeling or--

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I'll tell you, I've--

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.830 align:middle line:84%
I said my similar spiritual
practice has always

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.038 align:middle line:90%
been my most important thing.

00:06:01.038 --> 00:06:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And when I say that, I
really, really mean it.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.910 align:middle line:84%
I was a kid, from the
time I could utter

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.850 align:middle line:90%
words, that was God-focused.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.070 align:middle line:84%
Without even knowing
what God was,

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.440 align:middle line:84%
I just knew that
there was something.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And I had this thing where
I just couldn't accept

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.940 align:middle line:90%
that you couldn't talk to God.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.357 align:middle line:84%
I was incensed as a
five-year-old child,

00:06:24.357 --> 00:06:26.440 align:middle line:84%
because I just was like,
why won't you talk to me?

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.440 align:middle line:84%
You know, and I would
really walk around and talk

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.510 align:middle line:84%
to the sky and sort
of demand and state

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.920 align:middle line:84%
my case about why I
should be able to connect.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And-- but you know, if
you're in Christianity,

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.120 align:middle line:84%
which my family was
never religious,

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.673 align:middle line:84%
but they are
American Christians.

00:06:43.673 --> 00:06:45.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably in growing
up in the South--

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Growing up in the South.

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:47.627 align:middle line:84%
>> --You're exposed
to that a lot.

00:06:47.627 --> 00:06:51.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but not in any
kind of fervent way,

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:52.960 align:middle line:90%
but just that we had a Bible.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.370 align:middle line:90%
We were Christian.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, and-- but
I was told, no, God

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:58.790 align:middle line:90%
didn't talk to people anymore.

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:59.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Anymore?

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:00.710 align:middle line:90%
Anymore, really?

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>> But he did in the
Bible, obviously.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:03.360 align:middle line:90%
I guess so.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, anymore, yeah.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a part of me that
just didn't find that that

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:09.993 align:middle line:90%
could be possible.

00:07:09.993 --> 00:07:11.410 align:middle line:10%
It didn't resonate
with me at all,

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.660 align:middle line:10%
and I was really
determined that--

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.390 align:middle line:10%
you know, it's like some people
are going to climb a mountain.

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:20.020 align:middle line:84%
I was going to find God,
and that was my motivation.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.873 align:middle line:10%
And when I was about I guess
six or seven years old,

00:07:23.873 --> 00:07:25.540 align:middle line:10%
I was at my grandmother's,
and I was off

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.082 align:middle line:10%
playing on the
railroad tracks, which

00:07:27.082 --> 00:07:28.360 align:middle line:10%
she lived up in the mountains.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And I was, again, sort of having
this, why won't you talk to me?

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.910 align:middle line:90%
Where are you?

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And I just heard, we're
here, and we love you.

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:41.630 align:middle line:90%
And then I was suspicious.

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:42.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Where's that voice?

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:43.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, who is it?

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.010 align:middle line:90%
But it was an internal voice.

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't
auditory, but I was--

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.520 align:middle line:84%
and I was like,
well, who are you?

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.400 align:middle line:90%
And I heard, we are God.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.050 align:middle line:90%
And-- and I accepted it.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:59.320 align:middle line:84%
It was just so loving,
and then I, you know,

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.380 align:middle line:84%
had this thing of, well, how
do I know it's really you?

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.537 align:middle line:90%
And I was told that--

00:08:04.537 --> 00:08:06.120 align:middle line:84%
>> So even at six,
you're asking this.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:06.920 align:middle line:90%
That's wise.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.780 align:middle line:84%
>> I was discerning-- yeah,
because people had said, oh,

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.530 align:middle line:84%
make sure you're not
talking to the devil,

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:12.405 align:middle line:90%
and all these things.

00:08:12.405 --> 00:08:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And you know, just
it's fear-based,

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.770 align:middle line:84%
but it was in me
already, that fear.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't want to have
any kind of bad contact,

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.010 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't want anything
that would be wrong.

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:25.990 align:middle line:90%
But I sincerely wanted that.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And they told me that
they would show me

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.130 align:middle line:90%
a dove when it was them.

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:34.870 align:middle line:84%
So in my eye sight, with my eyes
open and with my eyes closed,

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:38.150 align:middle line:84%
I can see a white
dove when they come.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And I was told, a dove you
will see when you speak to me.

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:42.600 align:middle line:90%
That's what I was told.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.600 align:middle line:90%
And then I still see it.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.710 align:middle line:90%
>> You still see the dove.

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:45.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:47.565 align:middle line:84%
When they want my attention,
then I see this little dove.

00:08:47.565 --> 00:08:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's usually here or
here, just a little white sort

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.030 align:middle line:90%
of shape.

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:53.450 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a nice
little validation that

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:54.880 align:middle line:84%
you're connecting
to that energy.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And so I will tell you,
as my connection with them

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:04.030 align:middle line:84%
evolved, things lined up
that couldn't have lined up

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:09.010 align:middle line:84%
if it wasn't sort of
predetermined in a way,

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:12.100 align:middle line:90%
because I found out later--

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:14.180 align:middle line:84%
because my definition
of who they were

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:18.370 align:middle line:84%
and what I was connecting to
changed over time as I grew,

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.020 align:middle line:90%
as I learned more things.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.427 align:middle line:84%
First, then I thought,
well, maybe it's my angels.

00:09:22.427 --> 00:09:24.010 align:middle line:84%
Then I thought, well,
maybe it is God.

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:25.070 align:middle line:90%
And I went back and forth.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:26.903 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought, OK,
it's my higher self.

00:09:26.903 --> 00:09:29.950 align:middle line:84%
I finally kind of clued in that
it was the higher, larger part

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:31.607 align:middle line:90%
of me, the knowing part of me.

00:09:31.607 --> 00:09:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>> About how old were you at
this time by the time you--

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:34.773 align:middle line:90%
>> By six and seven.

00:09:34.773 --> 00:09:35.573 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:09:35.573 --> 00:09:38.125 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean it started that I was
talking to them all the time,

00:09:38.125 --> 00:09:39.700 align:middle line:84%
you know, and I was
asking questions,

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:40.760 align:middle line:90%
and they would answer questions.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Would you do this in
front of other people?

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.240 align:middle line:90%
So did your parents--

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:43.720 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.470 align:middle line:90%
>> --Were they concerned?

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:45.270 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.447 align:middle line:90%
No, my mom-- my mom--

00:09:47.447 --> 00:09:49.030 align:middle line:84%
I've never told
anybody this, but when

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:52.420 align:middle line:84%
I was a little girl, like
little, little, my mom told me,

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:53.500 align:middle line:90%
you're really special.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean every parent
says that to me.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.980 align:middle line:84%
But she-- I asked her,
and she would say,

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:59.440 align:middle line:84%
you have the ability
to understand things

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:04.030 align:middle line:84%
that people much older than
you can't understand deeply.

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And I apparently
had that from when

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.900 align:middle line:84%
I was a really young
child, and she just

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:13.300 align:middle line:84%
said-- so when I told her that
I was having this experience,

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.440 align:middle line:90%
she believed me.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, good.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And she did, but I have to
also say that my mom also

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.340 align:middle line:90%
has experiences.

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:24.330 align:middle line:90%
>> And so, you know, it helps.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:27.220 align:middle line:84%
But it was never like promoted
or talked about in my house,

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.970 align:middle line:84%
but it wasn't pooh-poohed
or any denial about it

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:34.360 align:middle line:90%
or made feel weird about it.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:39.580 align:middle line:84%
I had such a love of God and
whatever I thought god was.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:43.440 align:middle line:84%
But I would ask them questions,
and they would teach me things.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And the first concept they
ever taught me was something

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:49.330 align:middle line:84%
they called all time
at the same time.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.820 align:middle line:90%
And they showed me that using--

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.792 align:middle line:84%
I remember, because I was
sitting reading the comics.

00:10:54.792 --> 00:10:57.250 align:middle line:84%
You know, I used to-- you know,
you'd get the Sunday paper,

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:59.740 align:middle line:84%
and you'd have the
big comic section.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And they said to me that
if I looked at the comics,

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.730 align:middle line:84%
that that's how time was, that
it was like little sections.

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:09.640 align:middle line:84%
But then they showed
me in my mind's eye

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.040 align:middle line:84%
an entire comic book
but stretching out

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.390 align:middle line:90%
as far as you could see.

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And they said, this is
everything that's happening.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:17.990 align:middle line:90%
And it's all right now.

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you can move
from section to section

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.720 align:middle line:90%
if you want to.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:27.140 align:middle line:84%
So that's what they told
me, and they taught me--

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.178 align:middle line:84%
they told me that when I
would walk into a room,

00:11:29.178 --> 00:11:31.470 align:middle line:84%
the room would appear, and
when I would leave the room,

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:32.940 align:middle line:90%
the room was gone.

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:33.740 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:34.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:38.740 align:middle line:84%
It's-- being that age, to put
it in those reference points,

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:39.860 align:middle line:90%
it's probably very simple.

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:42.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, very
simple but so clear.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And so then I started
to get concerned about,

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.490 align:middle line:90%
what did I need to know?

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:47.510 align:middle line:90%
What did I need to know?

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
go get your Bible.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And for me, this Bible
was this big Bible.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:55.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:57.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Now in my life, it's
really like this big.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:58.870 align:middle line:84%
But when I was
little, it was big.

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And it was, this is
how religious we were.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of pages,
and they're thin, so.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.733 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it was one
of those big ones,

00:12:03.733 --> 00:12:06.780 align:middle line:84%
but it was in the closet
under a box in a box.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:10.330 align:middle line:84%
So to get it, you had
to really work for it.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.770 align:middle line:84%
But so I went and
got it, and they just

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:16.760 align:middle line:84%
said, open it to the
first page you see.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:17.990 align:middle line:90%
And I just trusted.

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:22.647 align:middle line:84%
I just had no qualms, and
I just flipped it open.

00:12:22.647 --> 00:12:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And they said, now
look down and read.

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:26.210 align:middle line:84%
So I had to be older,
because I could read--

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:27.810 align:middle line:90%
seven or eight now.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And it was a verse, and
it said, if a man says

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:36.370 align:middle line:84%
he loves God but hates his
neighbor, he is a liar.

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:39.650 align:middle line:84%
For how can he love
God, who he has seen,

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:41.850 align:middle line:84%
and hate his neighbor,
who he has not seen?

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:42.850 align:middle line:90%
No, I said it backwards.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:43.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Put it the other way, yeah.

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:43.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, sorry.

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:45.710 align:middle line:84%
How can he love God
who he has not seen

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:46.870 align:middle line:84%
and hate his neighbor,
who he has seen?

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:47.670 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:49.067 align:middle line:90%
It was 1 John 4:20.

00:12:49.067 --> 00:12:50.150 align:middle line:90%
And then they said to me--

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's John--

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:51.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:52.515 align:middle line:84%
>> --That's all
you need to know.

00:12:52.515 --> 00:12:53.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, beautiful.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:55.170 align:middle line:84%
>> They said, that's
all you need to know.

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:57.920 align:middle line:84%
Always ask yourself if
this is love or not love.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And so that became my truth,
that I measured everything.

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:03.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And I would look
at everything and go,

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:05.270 align:middle line:90%
is this love?

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:06.070 align:middle line:90%
Is this not love?

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:07.075 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:13:07.075 --> 00:13:08.270 align:middle line:90%
And from such a young age.

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, so I was--

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:10.465 align:middle line:90%
>> Wish I had that.

00:13:10.465 --> 00:13:12.465 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it took me a
little while to get there.

00:13:12.465 --> 00:13:15.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So I was armed with
that, and, you know, I--

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:17.210 align:middle line:84%
I was always sort of
searching for people

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:22.460 align:middle line:84%
who had the same sort of
connection or devotion

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:28.970 align:middle line:84%
or love of this
relationship that I had.

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And I sort of went
into Christianity

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:33.270 align:middle line:84%
in the sort of holy
roller churches.

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, these
people love God, you know.

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And then there was a lot
of other stuff in there

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:41.900 align:middle line:84%
that was very judgmental
and fear-based.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And I just said,
well, this isn't love.

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:47.150 align:middle line:84%
But it didn't change my
relationship with God.

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:49.790 align:middle line:84%
It just made me know that
that wasn't the place for me.

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And then I think, by this
time, I'm moving into college.

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:56.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm about 18, 19 years old.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:14:00.110 align:middle line:84%
I read Paramahansa Yogananda's
"Autobiography of a Yogi."

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:03.010 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's why you went the
other day to the temple and--

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:03.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>> You have a little
connection there.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, because that was such
a nice connection that we went

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:06.970 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:09.290 align:middle line:84%
But that was really the
opening, and for so many people,

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:10.090 align:middle line:90%
that's the opening.

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:11.030 align:middle line:10%
>> Sure, yeah.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.222 align:middle line:10%
Well, especially
here in LA and--

00:14:13.222 --> 00:14:14.930 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, yeah, because
you have the temple.

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:19.750 align:middle line:10%
>> What he brought here to the
community and to Hollywood,

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:20.550 align:middle line:10%
you know.

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:21.380 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's--

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, so you're lucky here.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.120 align:middle line:84%
I was in the deep
south, so I was

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.970 align:middle line:90%
a little bit of a weird person.

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:29.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Me, too.

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:31.835 align:middle line:90%
I was raised in Atlanta, so.

00:14:31.835 --> 00:14:33.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, so-- but I didn't care.

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:34.730 align:middle line:90%
You know, I didn't care.

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And I just made that
sort of my devotion

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:42.070 align:middle line:84%
to learn as much as I
could about everything

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:45.390 align:middle line:84%
and just to find the truths that
I knew but didn't maybe have

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:47.730 align:middle line:90%
a terminology for or whatever.

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And then through that,
I came into Hinduism.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:51.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Hinduism, OK.

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:56.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and I started studying
the Gita and the Vedic texts,

00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:00.090 align:middle line:84%
and I studied Sanskrit
and Sanskrit pronunciation

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:03.090 align:middle line:84%
and light, the light
sounds of that.

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:06.300 align:middle line:90%
And it's really in-depth.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:11.010 align:middle line:84%
So I was having all of
this sort of connection,

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:13.110 align:middle line:90%
and I was quite happy with it.

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And then in 2010,
Theos said to me,

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:19.440 align:middle line:84%
do you not want
to know our name?

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And I promise you,
I had never thought

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:26.830 align:middle line:84%
about them having a name or
being a sort of personality.

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:32.130 align:middle line:84%
I just thought they were my
guides, my God connection.

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:33.967 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked,
what is the name?

00:15:33.967 --> 00:15:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, we've
chosen this name specifically

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:40.530 align:middle line:84%
for you so that you understand
who you're speaking to.

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And they said that
we are called Theos.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.490 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:45.430 align:middle line:90%
Theos with an S.

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Theos with an S,
and Theos means God.

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:48.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's the
communication of God.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I forget, there's another
woman who also channels Theo.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that the same energy?

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:58.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know, because
I've never seen her.

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I know that she was the one
that told Esther Hicks that she

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:03.780 align:middle line:90%
would be channeling.

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:04.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:05.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's right.

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:06.927 align:middle line:84%
>> But I don't know
anything about Theo.

00:16:06.927 --> 00:16:09.510 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, yeah, I'm just wondering
if it might be the same energy

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:10.570 align:middle line:90%
now that I'm getting to--

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:11.370 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:11.790 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:12.590 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:15.990 align:middle line:84%
I know that Theos has said
that they are, you know,

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:17.640 align:middle line:84%
because we have
multiple incarnations.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:21.220 align:middle line:10%
And there's a very highly chance
that they're coming through

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:22.020 align:middle line:10%
in a different way.

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:26.515 align:middle line:84%
I know that when I go
into my meditative state,

00:16:26.515 --> 00:16:28.890 align:middle line:84%
and they're about to come
through, right before they come

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:31.470 align:middle line:84%
through, I always hear
stuff like, hi, you know,

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:32.700 align:middle line:90%
really fast energy.

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And they've got a
very mellow energy

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.880 align:middle line:84%
when they come through me,
but they sound a little bit

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.090 align:middle line:90%
like Bashar.

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:38.730 align:middle line:84%
They sound a little
bit like Aikon.

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:41.550 align:middle line:84%
They get a little bit
like Roxy, really.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:45.180 align:middle line:84%
So I think-- what I have
this picture in my mind

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:49.710 align:middle line:84%
is that there's sort
of a cone of knowledge.

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And then all these channelers
are placed around it.

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And then we're all drawing from
the same source, obviously.

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think sometimes when I
hear, like, it's usually right

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:04.980 align:middle line:84%
before Theos says, we're
here, I hear all the other--

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:05.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Chatter.

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:09.033 align:middle line:84%
>> --Chatter of like someone
that sounds like Bashar.

00:17:09.033 --> 00:17:10.950 align:middle line:84%
You know, how Bashar's
like, oh, eh, you know,

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:13.690 align:middle line:90%
and Aikon's like, hi.

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:14.490 align:middle line:90%
You know, really--

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:15.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, even Aishwa.

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:16.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, Aishwa.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And so I hear that right
before, and I always think,

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.700 align:middle line:90%
is that going to come out of me?

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And then Theos comes through the
way they come through for me.

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:27.267 align:middle line:90%
So I think it's really--

00:17:27.267 --> 00:17:29.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't have clarification,
but this is what

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.713 align:middle line:90%
I'm starting to see visually.

00:17:30.713 --> 00:17:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's generally how I
start to get information.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.340 align:middle line:84%
I start to see it visually,
and then eventually, they'll

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:36.430 align:middle line:90%
explain it to me.

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:39.320 align:middle line:90%
But I think it's all the same.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, but--

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:43.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And the same, but I think
maybe like Roxanne's over here,

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:44.670 align:middle line:90%
and, you know--

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:45.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Rob's over there.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.892 align:middle line:90%
>> Rob's over there, seriously.

00:17:46.892 --> 00:17:47.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.220 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, and that's been
my journey with the series,

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.790 align:middle line:84%
you know, and I'm
interviewing all you guys,

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:53.910 align:middle line:84%
the channelers and these
different energies coming

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:54.780 align:middle line:90%
through.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And you know, some
of the details--

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:03.090 align:middle line:84%
you know, Bashar has got a story
about the Sasani and the Zetas

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:07.290 align:middle line:84%
and Aishwa and the Ayel, and
even though Bashar mentions

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:09.937 align:middle line:84%
the Ayel, but Aishwa's
stories are a little bit

00:18:09.937 --> 00:18:10.770 align:middle line:90%
different than that.

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:14.940 align:middle line:84%
So these details, I've noticed,
is where things get a little--

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.440 align:middle line:90%
they don't match up so well.

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And then people sort
of point that out.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.840 align:middle line:84%
But I'm-- and I love
getting into the details.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.330 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, there's
these universal truths,

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:29.250 align:middle line:84%
these universal throughs
that everybody agrees on,

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:32.610 align:middle line:84%
whether you're Bashar
or I'm sure today we'll

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:33.570 align:middle line:90%
get into Theos.

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And he's going to
say-- he, she, they are

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:38.880 align:middle line:90%
going to say this same thing.

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:39.930 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:40.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:42.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, they have a
very specific message.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:44.815 align:middle line:84%
Their message is really
love and oneness.

00:18:44.815 --> 00:18:46.440 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of people
out there do it,

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:50.860 align:middle line:84%
but they really don't-- because
they're sort of evolved beyond

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:51.660 align:middle line:90%
incarnation.

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:52.800 align:middle line:90%
They're not incarnated.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.140 align:middle line:84%
They're not associated
with any race.

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.872 align:middle line:84%
I love your term
"extra-dimensional,"

00:18:56.872 --> 00:18:58.330 align:middle line:84%
because that's
truly what they are.

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:00.230 align:middle line:90%
They're-- my higher self--

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:03.810 align:middle line:84%
>> And I came through Windy and
Nora as I was sort of searching

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:05.100 align:middle line:90%
for a title for the series.

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.295 align:middle line:90%
They were like, uh--

00:19:06.295 --> 00:19:07.170 align:middle line:90%
>> They're brilliant.

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:10.140 align:middle line:84%
To see them channel together
is also lovely, yeah.

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:13.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, but Theos, he--

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:18.730 align:middle line:84%
or not he, but they just
really stay on that,

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:21.010 align:middle line:84%
and they don't get into a
lot of the worldly stuff,

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:22.780 align:middle line:84%
though they have
opinions, if asked.

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:24.318 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:19:24.318 --> 00:19:25.360 align:middle line:90%
I might ask a little bit.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.872 align:middle line:90%
>> No, that's fine.

00:19:26.872 --> 00:19:28.580 align:middle line:84%
But they-- that's just
sort of the thing.

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:31.445 align:middle line:84%
So when I started channeling,
if you want to know

00:19:31.445 --> 00:19:32.320 align:middle line:90%
the way it happened--

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Please.

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:39.010 align:middle line:84%
>> --I was watching Abraham
Hicks on a-- she does a pod--

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:39.810 align:middle line:90%
not podcast.

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:43.060 align:middle line:84%
She does a weekly
live broadcast.

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:45.830 align:middle line:84%
You can pay, pay per
view kind of thing.

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And when you're watching it,
there's like a little chat.

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And everyone is like,
hi from the Netherlands,

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.540 align:middle line:90%
hi from wherever.

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:55.145 align:middle line:90%
And my name went scrolling down.

00:19:55.145 --> 00:19:56.020 align:middle line:90%
And then this woman--

00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:57.478 align:middle line:84%
>> Why would your
name scroll down?

00:19:57.478 --> 00:19:58.390 align:middle line:90%
Because you went, hi?

00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:59.380 align:middle line:90%
>> I was saying hi.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.700 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I was saying hi, and then
in the chat, all these people.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.533 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- it goes
really fast, so you just

00:20:03.533 --> 00:20:05.508 align:middle line:84%
are watching all
these texts go by.

00:20:05.508 --> 00:20:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, the YouTube
Live or Facebook Live.

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:08.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, that kind of thing.

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, this woman goes,

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.310 align:middle line:84%
is that Karen Neumann
from South Carolina?

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:13.720 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, who's that?

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:14.520 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And then she told me she--
her name was Priscilla.

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:20.170 align:middle line:10%
And she had been a
metaphysical teacher of mine

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:22.210 align:middle line:10%
when I was like 19
years old, and I'd

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:26.350 align:middle line:10%
gone to one of her things of
meet your angels kind of thing

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:29.390 align:middle line:10%
and how to see auras
or something like that.

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:31.940 align:middle line:90%
And so she was American.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Her partner was a
channel back in the '80s.

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And they had moved
out to Sedona,

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:40.960 align:middle line:84%
and then she was now
living in France.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:41.990 align:middle line:90%
So she came.

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:44.080 align:middle line:84%
We exchanged emails,
and we talked, and then

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:47.435 align:middle line:84%
she came to visit me,
like, two weeks later.

00:20:47.435 --> 00:20:48.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it was really fast.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And we were having
a conversation,

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:54.435 align:middle line:84%
and we were talking about
Abraham and channeling

00:20:54.435 --> 00:20:55.310 align:middle line:90%
and all these things.

00:20:55.310 --> 00:21:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you know, I'm
surprised you don't channel.

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:03.050 align:middle line:90%
And I said, why?

00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:04.767 align:middle line:90%
You know, why?

00:21:04.767 --> 00:21:05.600 align:middle line:90%
Why would I do that?

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, I just feel
inspired to tell you that maybe

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:11.560 align:middle line:90%
you want to think about it.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:14.035 align:middle line:84%
And that's how Theos
talks sometimes.

00:21:14.035 --> 00:21:16.990 align:middle line:84%
They're really like, maybe
you just want to consider it.

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:18.160 align:middle line:90%
>> A little suggestion.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's up to you.

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:21.510 align:middle line:90%
No pressure.

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:25.220 align:middle line:90%
But if you want to, you know.

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:28.360 align:middle line:84%
So I thought about it
for about two years,

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:32.950 align:middle line:84%
and then I had started the
radio show with Rob Gauthier.

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:34.190 align:middle line:90%
And I was sitting--

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:35.440 align:middle line:90%
>> And you weren't channeling.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:36.720 align:middle line:84%
You were just doing
the interviews--

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I was just doing
the interviews.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:38.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's talk about oneness.

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:44.320 align:middle line:84%
>> And I was sitting at home,
and I just had this feeling

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:48.440 align:middle line:84%
like there was a pressure
here in my throat.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.888 align:middle line:84%
And I always check with them,
and I was-- by this time,

00:21:51.888 --> 00:21:52.930 align:middle line:90%
I was calling them Theos.

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:54.763 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, Theos,
what is this, you know?

00:21:54.763 --> 00:21:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And-- and they said,
well, if you want to talk,

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:01.920 align:middle line:90%
we will talk through you.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.660 align:middle line:90%
And I said, that's channeling?

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
that would be channeling.

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.530 align:middle line:90%
And so I thought, OK.

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I think I waited
another two days to do it.

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:12.370 align:middle line:90%
And then I just did it.

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:15.490 align:middle line:90%
I just let the sound come out.

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if
anybody who's watching this

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:20.110 align:middle line:84%
has ever channeled or
wants to channel or--

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:23.080 align:middle line:84%
the sensation is
that there's just

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.690 align:middle line:84%
water or some flow
of something that

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:27.940 align:middle line:90%
just wants to come out of you.

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:31.000 align:middle line:90%
It's not scary or forceful.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.950 align:middle line:90%
It's just sort of there.

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And you can choose to let
it out or not let it out.

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And so I just sort of sat
down and was like, well,

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:39.670 align:middle line:90%
here goes nothing, you know.

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And then I didn't have
anybody to ask questions.

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.850 align:middle line:84%
So I just asked some
questions, because I knew

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:47.210 align:middle line:90%
that that was the thing to do.

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And I asked a question, and then
they went into this whole thing

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:54.460 align:middle line:84%
that I had never known
about them-- who they were,

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:55.600 align:middle line:90%
what their--

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.360 align:middle line:84%
>> It was you verbally
now speaking--

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.405 align:middle line:90%
>> Now verbally talking.

00:22:58.405 --> 00:22:59.690 align:middle line:90%
>> --Talking about this, yeah.

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:01.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And so I was
recording it as well.

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was sort of going
back and forth between me

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:07.820 align:middle line:90%
and then them answering.

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:09.610 align:middle line:90%
And so I-- it was amazing.

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:14.010 align:middle line:84%
I wrote this, I think, four-page
thing all about where they were

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:17.800 align:middle line:84%
or where they said
they were, just

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.980 align:middle line:84%
all these different things
that I had never thought to ask

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:23.800 align:middle line:90%
that just came pouring out.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like, well, why
didn't I ask this before?

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And they said that they
were from the Shekhinah.

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:32.020 align:middle line:84%
They were in the Shekhinah,
which I didn't even

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:33.960 align:middle line:84%
know what a Shekhinah
was, but the Shekhinah

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.323 align:middle line:84%
in the Jewish Bible is
the presence of God.

00:23:37.323 --> 00:23:38.740 align:middle line:84%
So everything that
they talk about

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.560 align:middle line:84%
is where they-- that
they're in this presence,

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.870 align:middle line:84%
that they're having
this connection.

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:45.430 align:middle line:90%
They're all about oneness.

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:47.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean I didn't even know
oneness was a thing until they

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:48.950 align:middle line:90%
said it to me, you know.

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:50.242 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, before that you didn't--

00:23:50.242 --> 00:23:51.160 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't know it.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.540 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't have--

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>> But was your show at the
time, the one about oneness?

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:56.282 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it became about oneness.

00:23:56.282 --> 00:23:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it became after these--

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:01.015 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they had been talking
about oneness my whole life

00:24:01.015 --> 00:24:01.970 align:middle line:90%
as I got older.

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:04.600 align:middle line:84%
But I'm saying I
learned it from them.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And "oneness" sort of became a
term in the world consciousness

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:12.400 align:middle line:84%
about the time that I
started to do my show.

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.960 align:middle line:84%
So it had started
to really raise up,

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.377 align:middle line:84%
because people
really were talking

00:24:15.377 --> 00:24:18.190 align:middle line:90%
about oneness before, you know.

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:20.080 align:middle line:90%
And so that sort of came out.

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a woman on the
radio station named Victoria

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:26.650 align:middle line:90%
Vives, and she had a show.

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:28.240 align:middle line:10%
Because the radio
station was new,

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.460 align:middle line:10%
we were all
interviewing each other.

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And she had me on
her show, and I

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:34.360 align:middle line:90%
said, oh, I started channeling.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh, do
you want to channel?

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:38.380 align:middle line:90%
I thought, oh, man.

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:39.980 align:middle line:90%
I've never channeled before.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:40.780 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:42.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Publicly, yeah.

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:46.160 align:middle line:84%
>> I channeled one time,
that session at my computer.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:49.930 align:middle line:90%
And so I did my thing and--

00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Live or in the studio?

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:54.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Live on the radio, and
she started asking questions.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, just
all this stuff came out.

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, this
is really real.

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:02.540 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:03.610 align:middle line:90%
This is real.

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:04.510 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, I'm a channel.

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:05.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Channeling.

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:06.220 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm just a channel.

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:07.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm a channel now.

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:08.823 align:middle line:90%
So that was it.

00:25:08.823 --> 00:25:09.740 align:middle line:90%
That's how it started.

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:13.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And you were able to
get into it pretty quickly.

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:15.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, because I knew them.

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:16.672 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, you already had that--

00:25:16.672 --> 00:25:19.860 align:middle line:10%
>> And I was comfortable
with the energy of them.

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:21.340 align:middle line:84%
The channeling
itself-- you know,

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:28.300 align:middle line:84%
it's a dynamic of being used to
letting the information flow,

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:30.910 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time,
I'm a medium as well.

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And I know that whatever
I get, just to let it out,

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:36.910 align:middle line:90%
and I don't question it.

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:39.530 align:middle line:90%
I just express it.

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:43.900 align:middle line:10%
And in that way, I think I had
a little bit of pre-training

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:44.780 align:middle line:10%
in how to do it.

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:46.660 align:middle line:10%
And really, I think
channeling is just

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:47.860 align:middle line:10%
another form of mediumship.

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.880 align:middle line:10%
It's just a different form.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:54.010 align:middle line:84%
>> For my show, I was
regressed by Barbara Lamb.

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:55.630 align:middle line:84%
But I was still
aware and present,

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:57.880 align:middle line:84%
but I really got
to understand what

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:01.900 align:middle line:84%
it felt like to sort
of take the back seat

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:03.290 align:middle line:90%
and let things come through.

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:04.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So you know, we all
have access to this.

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:08.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, we all do.

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:11.950 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- you
know, it happens.

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:16.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean you're an actor, and
with artists, it's a second--

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.520 align:middle line:90%
it's second nature.

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:22.130 align:middle line:90%
It's part of how you create.

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:25.300 align:middle line:84%
But-- because channeling
doesn't have to be this.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.020 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be
this informational thing.

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:32.110 align:middle line:84%
But it can be expressed
in any way that's where

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:36.050 align:middle line:90%
you're expressing the soul's--

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:36.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Desire.

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:39.010 align:middle line:84%
>> --Loving, and
desire, and knowing.

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a great book
called "Stealing Fire."

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:43.080 align:middle line:84%
I think I mentioned
that last night.

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.413 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I'm excited to read it.

00:26:44.413 --> 00:26:48.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's sort of a
mainstream book, a bestseller.

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:52.180 align:middle line:10%
And they talk about flow
states, and now, you

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:55.930 align:middle line:10%
know, the Navy, Navy
SEALs, and Silicon Valley,

00:26:55.930 --> 00:27:00.130 align:middle line:10%
and all these elitists
in our society

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:02.760 align:middle line:10%
are now exploring what--

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.260 align:middle line:10%
they're not using the
term "channeling."

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:06.940 align:middle line:90%
They're using flow states.

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:08.190 align:middle line:90%
But it's the exact same thing.

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And there's this one
guy named Jason Silva.

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:12.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've
followed his work.

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:15.870 align:middle line:84%
He's been on "Brain Games," and
he does these little snippets

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:18.510 align:middle line:84%
called "The Shots of Awe,"
which are these little YouTube

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:21.030 align:middle line:90%
10-minute--

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:23.430 align:middle line:84%
5 to 10-minute
snippets of him just--

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:24.900 align:middle line:90%
basically, he's channeling.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:27.298 align:middle line:84%
He finds a subject,
and he just goes into,

00:27:27.298 --> 00:27:28.590 align:middle line:90%
and he calls it his flow state.

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And there's a chapter
devoted to him

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:33.270 align:middle line:84%
in the book, where
he talks about it.

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And since I'm doing the
series and understanding this,

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:37.110 align:middle line:90%
that's--

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>> It's the same.

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:38.200 align:middle line:90%
>> It's the channel.

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.130 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:41.363 align:middle line:84%
So when we can access
these flow states--

00:27:41.363 --> 00:27:42.780 align:middle line:84%
and they talk about
it in the book

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:46.330 align:middle line:84%
that it's really so many
different ways to access it,

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:50.410 align:middle line:84%
so through shamanism and
psychedelics is one way.

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:54.330 align:middle line:84%
But just in the meditative
state and really following

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:58.410 align:middle line:84%
your passion and getting
excited about something.

00:27:58.410 --> 00:27:59.840 align:middle line:90%
Improv for actors--

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:00.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>> You know, we--

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:01.760 align:middle line:90%
>> I did improv.

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:02.500 align:middle line:90%
It's the same.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:03.458 align:middle line:90%
>> It's the same thing.

00:28:03.458 --> 00:28:05.460 align:middle line:84%
You know, because when
you get out of your head,

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:08.730 align:middle line:84%
you get out of the way, and then
you have that direct connection

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:09.690 align:middle line:90%
to who you are.

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:10.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:12.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, and you're boom.

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And you don't-- you don't
give the brain time to think.

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:18.210 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:20.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's the
direct connection.

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And we all have
access to this, and--

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:24.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I've had experiences.

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting to
know that, like, you know,

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:33.320 align:middle line:84%
it's just a flow that happens
for every single person

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:34.892 align:middle line:90%
in different moments.

00:28:34.892 --> 00:28:36.350 align:middle line:84%
It's usually-- like
a lot of people

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:37.790 align:middle line:84%
say, oh, when I
go in the shower,

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:41.570 align:middle line:84%
I get such information,
because you're just

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:44.030 align:middle line:84%
busy washing your
hair or your body,

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:45.950 align:middle line:90%
and you're not thinking so much.

00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And then all this stuff
just starts coming,

00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:52.250 align:middle line:84%
and all that a channel does
is they just find that state--

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:53.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:55.110 align:middle line:90%
>> --Actively and sit in it.

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's not happening
as much by chance

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.838 align:middle line:90%
as it is happening by will or--

00:28:59.838 --> 00:29:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, a lot of
it's self-judgment.

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:04.560 align:middle line:84%
You know, what gets in
our way is we think--

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:07.080 align:middle line:84%
we think about what the other
people or what other things

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:10.020 align:middle line:84%
or what the uni-- you know,
is going to think about us.

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you have
the great actors like even

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:14.565 align:middle line:90%
Jim Carrey and--

00:29:14.565 --> 00:29:18.180 align:middle line:84%
who is very open about
this information now--

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:21.120 align:middle line:84%
who get out of
their way, get out

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.010 align:middle line:84%
of the way to let whatever
it is come through

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:24.700 align:middle line:90%
and not have that self-judgment.

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:25.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's where the
true artistry comes through.

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:28.340 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
your truest feature.

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:35.040 align:middle line:84%
You know, you--
in Hinduism, they

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:41.040 align:middle line:84%
talk about that in the
creation of the world,

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:44.070 align:middle line:84%
you have the descending grace
and the ascending grace.

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And the descending grace is
sort of the wholeness source

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.780 align:middle line:90%
energy coming into the world.

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And as that energy
comes in, there's

00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:56.260 align:middle line:84%
the forgetfulness
of who you are.

00:29:56.260 --> 00:30:03.662 align:middle line:84%
And so those states can
be seen as hindrances

00:30:03.662 --> 00:30:04.620 align:middle line:90%
of knowing who you are.

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:07.320 align:middle line:84%
But if you're talking about
from God's source coming in,

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:13.020 align:middle line:84%
those were the gifts that were
given to allow this experience.

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And then as you start
to ascend, then these

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:20.760 align:middle line:84%
become your tripping
stones, the things

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:22.830 align:middle line:90%
that you need to let go of.

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:28.500 align:middle line:84%
So part of that is creativity
that you don't, as an artist

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:30.420 align:middle line:84%
or as just a human
being, you think

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:32.970 align:middle line:84%
that you're good at one
thing, but you don't

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:35.950 align:middle line:90%
realize you can do everything.

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>> We come in to have that,
to have that sort of singular

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:41.370 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:43.950 align:middle line:84%
But we've truly, if
we were totally open,

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:45.330 align:middle line:90%
we could do everything.

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:47.610 align:middle line:84%
But then again, if we were
totally, totally open,

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:49.230 align:middle line:90%
we would not be in the body.

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:50.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Not be in this existence.

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.530 align:middle line:84%
People tease me,
because as an actor--

00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:56.100 align:middle line:84%
and you start getting
into certain roles

00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:58.050 align:middle line:84%
and going down
certain ways, and then

00:30:58.050 --> 00:31:01.350 align:middle line:84%
eventually,
especially comedians,

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:03.828 align:middle line:90%
I find that there's no shame.

00:31:03.828 --> 00:31:06.245 align:middle line:84%
You get rid of that shame,
that shamefulness that-- you're

00:31:06.245 --> 00:31:07.425 align:middle line:84%
like, well, if I
do this, people are

00:31:07.425 --> 00:31:09.030 align:middle line:84%
going to judge me and
think about me this way.

00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:10.905 align:middle line:84%
But if you can just
start shedding that away,

00:31:10.905 --> 00:31:12.560 align:middle line:84%
then your true
self comes through.

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And however ridiculous
and however--

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know,
whatever's in you comes out,

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:21.660 align:middle line:84%
and even if it's dark, which,
you know, it's still in you.

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And you need to be willing
to honestly see yourself.

00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:29.070 align:middle line:84%
If you're really
trying to expand,

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:32.010 align:middle line:84%
you have to be able to look
at the light and the dark

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:33.990 align:middle line:84%
equally and stand
in the middle of it

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:36.840 align:middle line:84%
and observe it and
say, OK, that is.

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:40.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's-- none of
it's bad in the larger part

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:40.920 align:middle line:90%
of anything.

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:41.720 align:middle line:90%
It's all--

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:44.110 align:middle line:90%
We're all actors on this planet.

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:44.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:47.460 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, some of us actually
do the acting job more than

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:47.870 align:middle line:90%
others.

00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:48.340 align:middle line:90%
But we're all actors.

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:49.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, actors should
understand it more than

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:50.750 align:middle line:90%
anybody.

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and I think they do,
but we're told as a society

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:55.380 align:middle line:90%
that that's acting.

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:57.150 align:middle line:90%
This is real life.

00:31:57.150 --> 00:32:02.100 align:middle line:84%
But I think a lot of actors do
sort of get into these roles,

00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:07.290 align:middle line:84%
and just by putting on-- trying
these different roles and these

00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:09.240 align:middle line:90%
different suits on--

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>> It has to be opening.

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:13.050 align:middle line:84%
I have to imagine that if
you play a character that's

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:16.050 align:middle line:84%
really dark or really
light, it's going

00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:17.880 align:middle line:90%
to affect you in some way.

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:21.480 align:middle line:84%
You're going to see-- you're
going to see your own demons,

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:24.200 align:middle line:84%
your own angels, and
you're going to--

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:28.170 align:middle line:84%
hopefully, if you're an
actively participant,

00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:30.540 align:middle line:84%
you're integrating all
of it and accepting it.

00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:33.000 align:middle line:84%
But what a gift to
be able to explore

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.350 align:middle line:90%
all these different realities.

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:38.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and we live in
this Hollywood, California,

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:43.980 align:middle line:84%
you know, sort of the
stage of the world.

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And we get to try on all these
different roles, and everybody

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:47.700 align:middle line:90%
just to watch.

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of nasty,
dark stuff behind it all as well

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:53.680 align:middle line:90%
that's now coming out.

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:54.570 align:middle line:90%
And we're now--

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:56.100 align:middle line:90%
>> It all is coming up.

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:58.003 align:middle line:84%
>> We're sort of
addressing that and saying,

00:32:58.003 --> 00:33:00.670 align:middle line:84%
we can play on the stage, and we
don't have to go there anymore.

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:03.350 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to do
those nasty things.

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:05.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's sort
of evolution, too.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:10.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you think
about that in creation,

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:12.540 align:middle line:90%
every experience is wanted.

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And those experiences,
as awful as they are,

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:22.200 align:middle line:84%
are just a result
of possibility.

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of like you can
say, OK, we've done that now.

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:28.560 align:middle line:84%
We know what that's
about, so maybe now we've

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.210 align:middle line:90%
explored that enough.

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:31.680 align:middle line:90%
And you can move out of it.

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:36.220 align:middle line:84%
But there's the part that
almost in the dualistic society,

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:40.230 align:middle line:84%
even though non-duality is what
we really are, in dualism, you

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:42.960 align:middle line:90%
have to have opposites.

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:45.000 align:middle line:90%
You have to have them.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.620 align:middle line:90%
You just have to.

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:47.630 align:middle line:90%
You have to have them.

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:48.430 align:middle line:90%
>> You have to.

00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:50.250 align:middle line:90%
You must have the dualism.

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:52.410 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:52.410 --> 00:33:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's about the
integration of the two,

00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:56.720 align:middle line:84%
defining that sweet
point, that middle.

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.880 align:middle line:84%
>> That middle
ground of just being.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.210 align:middle line:90%
But in some ways--

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:02.980 align:middle line:84%
I might be controversial
in saying this--

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:06.940 align:middle line:84%
I think, you know, we're not
also in the biggest hurry

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:09.580 align:middle line:84%
to move back to that
completely sweet point,

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:12.458 align:middle line:84%
because then the
thrill of experience

00:34:12.458 --> 00:34:15.429 align:middle line:84%
is lessened in this
world, you know.

00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:18.909 align:middle line:84%
So it's a nice progression
that we're going through,

00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:21.730 align:middle line:84%
and people talk about, oh,
how long is it going to take?

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:24.900 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going to take
a long time, you know?

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:27.449 align:middle line:84%
Because there's so
much more to explore.

00:34:27.449 --> 00:34:31.969 align:middle line:84%
And the people that we're around
are actively exploring it.

00:34:31.969 --> 00:34:34.090 align:middle line:84%
>> On that extreme, on
that sort of oneness that--

00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Sure, but there's a whole
other part of the world--

00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:37.239 align:middle line:84%
>> That they're
exploring the op--

00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:39.406 align:middle line:84%
>> This hasn't even been a
glimmer in their eye yet.

00:34:39.406 --> 00:34:44.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And there's a lot of other
people that explore the other

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:46.850 align:middle line:90%
side, the dark, nasty stuff.

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:48.360 align:middle line:90%
Not for me.

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:49.439 align:middle line:90%
Not for you.

00:34:49.439 --> 00:34:50.239 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:51.139 align:middle line:90%
>> Valid.

00:34:51.139 --> 00:34:55.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Valid in their exploration
in that way, exactly.

00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:56.778 align:middle line:84%
It took me a while to
come to those terms.

00:34:56.778 --> 00:34:59.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and not to be afraid
of it or push against it,

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:03.420 align:middle line:84%
just to accept it
and say, OK, it's OK.

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:05.570 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean
you don't actively

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:09.620 align:middle line:84%
try to build something better,
build something more positive

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:11.720 align:middle line:84%
that people can choose
for, but you don't really

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:13.330 align:middle line:90%
have to go after the bad guy.

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:15.201 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you're just
wasting your energy.

00:35:15.201 --> 00:35:16.614 align:middle line:84%
>> They always say you're
wasting your energy.

00:35:16.614 --> 00:35:17.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:19.805 align:middle line:90%
Well, great.

00:35:19.805 --> 00:35:21.180 align:middle line:84%
Shall we get into
some channeling

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:24.310 align:middle line:90%
and bring Theos in and go there?

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:26.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, we'll go there.

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:26.870 align:middle line:90%
Great, OK.

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:27.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.830 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you.

00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:28.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And I look forward to the
Channel Panel and your work

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:31.290 align:middle line:90%
and the future.

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:32.373 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm excited about that.

00:35:32.373 --> 00:35:34.185 align:middle line:84%
It's just such an
honor to be there.

00:35:34.185 --> 00:35:36.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's like-- I don't
know-- it's the channeling

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:37.740 align:middle line:90%
Olympics or something.

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:40.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it seems like it.

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:42.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm tired just
thinking about it,

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.290 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not even channeling.

00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:46.940 align:middle line:90%
