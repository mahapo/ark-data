[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.976 --> 00:01:45.510 align:middle line:90%


00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.310 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.170 align:middle line:90%
Deete.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.430 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me here.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.760 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being here.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.830 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to get into some
channeling later today

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.090 align:middle line:84%
and talk to you about
all your experiences.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.082 align:middle line:84%
But before we do the
channeling, I just

00:01:59.082 --> 00:02:01.040 align:middle line:84%
wanted to find out a
little bit about yourself,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.164 align:middle line:84%
and your process, and
your journey, and--

00:02:05.164 --> 00:02:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>> All that jazz.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.580 align:middle line:90%
>> --all that jazz.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.949 align:middle line:84%
Where can we start, or where
would you like to start?

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:10.749 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:13.400 align:middle line:84%
So I grew up Mormon
since day one.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.870 align:middle line:90%
Born in Salt Lake City.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.030 align:middle line:84%
We did move to Phoenix,
so I didn't grow up

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.800 align:middle line:90%
in Salt Lake City.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.530 align:middle line:10%
But growing up with
that religious mindset,

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.050 align:middle line:10%
that was a big program that
I had to break free from.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.490 align:middle line:10%
And I think part of the
reason that my journey started

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.830 align:middle line:10%
was two things that
was the catalyst, which

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.060 align:middle line:10%
was my grandma passing
away and, prior to that,

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.330 align:middle line:10%
I was sort of feeling like I
had had enough of this life

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.590 align:middle line:10%
and was ready to kill myself.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I didn't know how
to break out of the religion

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.700 align:middle line:90%
and the mindsets.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like the only escape
would have been to kill myself.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And then shortly after,
my grandma passed.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And I started getting
like visitations from her.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And in the Mormon community,
and I think as well

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.390 align:middle line:84%
as other religious
communities, if you

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.832 align:middle line:84%
have a visitation from a
grandma, it's not so weird.

00:03:01.832 --> 00:03:04.040 align:middle line:84%
My grandma passed, and I
felt like she was around me.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.680 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't like an odd thing.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.790 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>> And so that really helped me
learn to communicate with her.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And then I started having
other beings come to me.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.220 align:middle line:90%
And then it was ET beings.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's when things, I think,
got kind of weird for people.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.400 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh, we're having
other-dimensional

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.790 align:middle line:90%
communication.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>> So at the time were
you still hardcore Mormon?

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I was transitioning
out by that point, yeah.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And members of your community
accepted the grandmother

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.790 align:middle line:90%
visitations?

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>> But then going beyond that,
is that when things got weird?

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.080 align:middle line:84%
>> That's when I wasn't sure
how much I should give out

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.880 align:middle line:90%
to people.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.903 align:middle line:84%
Like, when their passed
grandmothers were coming to me,

00:03:49.903 --> 00:03:51.320 align:middle line:84%
or even if their
mother had passed

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.530 align:middle line:84%
and they were
giving me messages,

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.000 align:middle line:84%
I felt like it was too
much for me to say,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.310 align:middle line:84%
hey, I can hear your
grandma as well.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.010 align:middle line:90%
This is what she's saying.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.200 align:middle line:84%
But if I get the message
from my own grandma,

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.650 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't so weird.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:05.730 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.130 align:middle line:84%
So people-- because I guess
some may feel a little intrusive

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.960 align:middle line:84%
than if they were
given those messages?

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:12.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.523 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they feel like,
well, that's my grandma.

00:04:14.523 --> 00:04:16.730 align:middle line:84%
She should be
communicating with me only.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And then that's the funny
thing that I learned with being

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.930 align:middle line:84%
a channeler and a medium,
is when you open yourself up

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.082 align:middle line:84%
to, any spirit can communicate
with you and give messages

00:04:28.082 --> 00:04:30.290 align:middle line:84%
of healing, if they feel
like you're going to listen.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And other people close
themselves off to it sometimes.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, don't you have
to get permission from--

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.490 align:middle line:84%
or do you get permission
from their family members

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:41.400 align:middle line:90%
from the other side?

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.200 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.050 align:middle line:90%


00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>> The other side really
doesn't care too much.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.380 align:middle line:84%
>> They're just like, hey,
someone here can understand me.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.240 align:middle line:84%
Let me communicate
to you, for example,

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.440 align:middle line:90%
to convey that message.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.985 align:middle line:84%
>> And I guess
when other people--

00:04:58.985 --> 00:05:04.070 align:middle line:84%
I was going to ask, is when
some of the information coming

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.240 align:middle line:84%
through is spot on or
accurate, does that sort of

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.890 align:middle line:90%
freak them out a little bit?

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's when they're
they come up with the logical

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:13.580 align:middle line:90%
excuses.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, you probably know
that because of this,

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:17.450 align:middle line:90%
or things like that.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.150 align:middle line:90%


00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.400 align:middle line:84%
I think it does make them a
little like, how would she

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.200 align:middle line:90%
know that?

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.270 align:middle line:90%
That's nerve wracking.

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.080 align:middle line:84%
So my logical mind will step
in and try to make sense of it.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.210 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I've done that
a long time ago.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.600 align:middle line:84%
That was-- part of
the series was getting

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.340 align:middle line:84%
to see-- proving for myself
whether all of this other side

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.000 align:middle line:84%
stuff is real or not, or
if it's just, you know,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.100 align:middle line:84%
are all these people just
going on the internet

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.620 align:middle line:84%
and finding things out about
me, and then conveying it?

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.970 align:middle line:90%
But then I'm like, no.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:50.600 align:middle line:90%
That's not what's happening.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.470 align:middle line:90%
>> You're like, I don't know.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.760 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think that's why a
spirit just doesn't care,

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.540 align:middle line:84%
is because they
connect to the heart.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.185 align:middle line:84%
And they know that even if
the logical mind steps in,

00:05:59.185 --> 00:06:01.560 align:middle line:84%
that heart space can eventually
come through and be like,

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.360 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.070 align:middle line:90%
I feel like this is real.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.050 align:middle line:84%
>> So you started
channeling ETs.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.400 align:middle line:90%
Or communication, I guess.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.050 align:middle line:84%
What was your
first communication

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.180 align:middle line:90%
from the ET realm, or that?

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.180 align:middle line:84%
>> So I would set a daily
practice of meditation aside.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.995 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I started
channeling other beings

00:06:19.995 --> 00:06:20.870 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.817 align:middle line:84%
Or I guess spirit beings
that I knew as people.

00:06:23.817 --> 00:06:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And then that's when
I started getting

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.440 align:middle line:90%
visuals of other beings.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.895 align:middle line:84%
I had a Reptilian that
came that I didn't even

00:06:29.895 --> 00:06:32.270 align:middle line:84%
know anything about Reptilians
or anything at that point.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And it kind of was
like, that was weird.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Did my imagination create
a giant lizard guy?

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, it
was just a weird--

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.170 align:middle line:84%
and then I just saw
things that I didn't think

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.330 align:middle line:90%
that I could create in my mind.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.650 align:middle line:90%
Like the Lyran beings--

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.570 align:middle line:90%
cats and things.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to look
it up on the internet,

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.790 align:middle line:84%
and there were other people that
had had similar experiences,

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.800 align:middle line:84%
or had visions of the
same type of being.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.100 align:middle line:84%
So I'm like, maybe
this is a real contact.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I opened myself
up more, and I got more of it.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So the first being
was a Reptilian.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.140 align:middle line:90%
What did he say?

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, he had-- it was
interesting because he had this

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:10.800 align:middle line:90%
cape on.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And it looked like he could
have put a hood kind of thing.

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And so I was meditating,
and he came through.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.500 align:middle line:90%
And I was kind of like, whoa.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And then he faded away,
and then a Gray came in.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.290 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if he
shapeshifted to make it

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.287 align:middle line:90%
more something that I felt--

00:07:27.287 --> 00:07:28.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Like, "I'm an
alien" kind of thing?

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:29.995 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I'm just an alien.

00:07:29.995 --> 00:07:32.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.550 align:middle line:84%
But he's told me that he's
my guide and protector.

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And so he's kind of
always been there.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:42.370 align:middle line:84%
But initially it was
a weird thing for me.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:43.292 align:middle line:90%
And then I got--

00:07:43.292 --> 00:07:44.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Does he have a name?

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:45.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Does have a name?

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.780 align:middle line:84%
>> As far as I can
hear, he calls himself--

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:54.450 align:middle line:84%
he says "Balthazar,"
is how he says it.

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:56.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you know what
realm of Reptilians?

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.380 align:middle line:90%
Because there's so many.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, he says he's
with the Alpha Draconis.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.890 align:middle line:84%
But he often works
with the council

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:08.730 align:middle line:84%
of beings, which can be Pleiade
or from all over, basically.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:10.010 align:middle line:90%
To help humanity.

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:11.190 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:12.780 align:middle line:84%
So for those who
are watching, there

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:16.350 align:middle line:84%
are Alpha Draconians
that are actually having,

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:18.380 align:middle line:90%
as opposed to being all--

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:21.900 align:middle line:84%
because a common
misconception, I

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:25.650 align:middle line:84%
guess, would be that all
the Reptilians are bad.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:28.420 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people who
subscribe to this information

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.040 align:middle line:84%
are like, oh,
Reptilian, stay back.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And with that, I'll Alpha
Draconis is mainly just a star

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:34.330 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:35.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's like
Pleiades star system.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
have benevolent beings,

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.960 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to have
those that are in favor

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.250 align:middle line:90%
of humanity's evolution.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's the same
with the Draconis.

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:45.450 align:middle line:84%
They have a lot
of evolved beings

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:47.940 align:middle line:84%
that are in service
of humanity now,

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.330 align:middle line:84%
even though maybe at one
point they hadn't been.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And there are still those
break-offs in that star system

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:55.110 align:middle line:90%
that are heavily domineering.

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
also the species

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:03.450 align:middle line:84%
that stay within Earth that
are lower realms of Reptilian

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.610 align:middle line:84%
that I would say are
more of the dangerous

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.560 align:middle line:90%
because they're not evolved.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And they wish to stay
in Fourth Density.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So all this information
that you just described,

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.020 align:middle line:84%
this is all just coming through
these different interactions

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.430 align:middle line:90%
with these different beings?

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, or just through
channelings that I've done

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.570 align:middle line:84%
for individuals and,
I guess, more public.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:26.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:29.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I first
discovered your work,

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.580 align:middle line:84%
I was blown away
on how correlating

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.910 align:middle line:84%
it was with all the other
stuff I've been doing,

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:37.020 align:middle line:90%
interviewing others.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And you haven't been doing
this that long, right?

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.200 align:middle line:84%
It's only been this
past year or two?

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Maybe a year and a half.

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.530 align:middle line:90%
>> A year and a half.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:44.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Maybe, yeah.

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:44.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:51.225 align:middle line:84%
And I was blown away by
the in-depthness of some

00:09:51.225 --> 00:09:53.100 align:middle line:84%
of the channelings and
the information coming

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:56.920 align:middle line:84%
through that, again,
just correlates

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.295 align:middle line:84%
with everything I've been
studying for the past 10 years.

00:09:59.295 --> 00:10:00.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Good, I'm glad
I'm not way off.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:01.840 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:06.315 align:middle line:84%
You're right on track,
which is why I'm here,

00:10:06.315 --> 00:10:08.020 align:middle line:90%
and we're doing this.

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:11.740 align:middle line:84%
So after the
Reptilian encounter,

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:16.680 align:middle line:84%
shapeshifting into a Gray,
what other sort of being

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.120 align:middle line:90%
came through?

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:23.910 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a Gray and a Mantis
that came through after I was

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:26.770 align:middle line:84%
resisting a while on
my path and things.

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if the Gray
was the Reptilian in disguise.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:32.730 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:37.380 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of language that
sounded like ancient Egyptian,

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:40.140 align:middle line:84%
and spoke of like
choosing me to be

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.480 align:middle line:84%
the channeler for information,
and things like that.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And so that's when
I basically started

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.300 align:middle line:90%
taking things more seriously.

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And there was another very vivid
contact where I was actually

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:55.200 align:middle line:90%
on the couch here.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.520 align:middle line:90%
I had fallen asleep one night.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:59.850 align:middle line:90%
And a Draconis being came.

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:02.040 align:middle line:90%
And he looked like a giant bat.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.230 align:middle line:90%
It was so intense.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:05.340 align:middle line:90%
He had the wings.

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:06.360 align:middle line:90%
It was dark.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And I had-- it felt like
a lower dimensional being

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:12.840 align:middle line:90%
standing to the side of me.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.270 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't get a glimpse
of what it looked like.

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:18.330 align:middle line:90%
But it was cursing me out.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And the Draconis
was like, basically,

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:23.400 align:middle line:90%
surrender to your path.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.980 align:middle line:84%
Let go of the old ideas,
because at the time

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:30.270 align:middle line:84%
I was having a hard
time transitioning.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:32.876 align:middle line:90%
But he did it in such a--

00:11:32.876 --> 00:11:34.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to say
dark way, because it

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:36.960 align:middle line:84%
benefited me to understand
that I need to get serious.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.210 align:middle line:90%
But it was dark energy.

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.080 align:middle line:90%
It was just a very intense--

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.840 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he was basically like--

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.120 align:middle line:84%
the way he stood, his
presence, everything

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.257 align:middle line:90%
was just very interesting.

00:11:47.257 --> 00:11:48.340 align:middle line:90%
>> This was the bat being?

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:48.940 align:middle line:90%
The bat?

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:51.460 align:middle line:84%
>> But you said there was
another lower being at the same

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:52.840 align:middle line:90%
time that was yelling at you?

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And he was yelling
at you as well?

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:57.010 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:58.480 align:middle line:90%
The bat being--

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.000 align:middle line:84%
I actually woke up
and was like, why

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.470 align:middle line:90%
is there a bat man in my room?

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Because it felt so-- or not
in my room, but next to me,

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.900 align:middle line:84%
because it felt so
much like a bat man.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:11.830 align:middle line:84%
>> But then the lower
dimensional being was the one

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:13.580 align:middle line:90%
that's cursing me out.

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:14.380 align:middle line:90%
The other one--

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:15.838 align:middle line:84%
>> So the other
one was just there.

00:12:15.838 --> 00:12:18.880 align:middle line:84%
>> He was there, and he
basically communicated

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.870 align:middle line:90%
in a very dignified way.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.593 align:middle line:90%
But it was a very powerful way.

00:12:23.593 --> 00:12:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Like, to the point where
you'd want to listen.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:30.040 align:middle line:84%
But everything just
felt very intense.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you made
sense of that since?

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:34.007 align:middle line:90%
Why the two beings--

00:12:34.007 --> 00:12:36.223 align:middle line:84%
two different beings,
and at the same time.

00:12:36.223 --> 00:12:37.390 align:middle line:90%
One is doing the-- you know.

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Basically, from
what I understand--

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:41.290 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if this is 100%.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:45.460 align:middle line:84%
But because my vibration had
to rise so much to communicate

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.650 align:middle line:90%
to this other Draconis being--

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:49.540 align:middle line:90%
because I could almost see him.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:53.380 align:middle line:84%
There was no third
dimension, where I was that.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.730 align:middle line:84%
I had to slip through
the fourth dimension.

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I was able to interact
with fourth-dimensional beings

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:03.100 align:middle line:84%
that we're trying to, I guess,
take me down or communicate

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:04.630 align:middle line:90%
negative emotions to me.

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:05.990 align:middle line:90%
Things like that.

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you open
yourself up as a channel,

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:11.200 align:middle line:84%
then it can be
negative, positive?

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.840 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's trying to
get to you in a way.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:14.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:17.930 align:middle line:84%
>> To communicate
through, or to--

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:21.730 align:middle line:84%
what do you think
the purposes are?

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't think they like when
there's light being brought

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:27.010 align:middle line:90%
into the soul.

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:28.780 align:middle line:84%
I feel like there's
a lot of emotions

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:31.680 align:middle line:84%
that they can gain when
things stay in low dimensions.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.280 align:middle line:90%
Low density.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And during the time when
I was starting channeling,

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:41.330 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how to block
myself, or how to set the tone,

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:42.130 align:middle line:90%
I guess.

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:43.280 align:middle line:90%
My intention.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And I got a lot of low
dimensions coming in.

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And I just don't
think they like it.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.800 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they like
you shedding light and love

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.620 align:middle line:84%
to people and letting
them know their power.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And I guess if you are
going to, and they can see you

00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.520 align:middle line:84%
as being a conduit, then, well,
maybe they can use that energy.

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.050 align:middle line:84%
Or use you as the conduit
for their energy instead.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:03.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:08.590 align:middle line:84%
>> So having both
channelings of--

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:13.400 align:middle line:84%
I try to guide more to the
positive, and empowering

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.200 align:middle line:90%
messages.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.450 align:middle line:84%
But I guess in
the same sense you

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:19.540 align:middle line:84%
can have people
channeling the bad stuff.

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.385 align:middle line:84%
Negative energy and
disempowering information.

00:14:22.385 --> 00:14:25.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and it's kind of like
where our world is at today.

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:28.180 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of powerful people
that know ancient knowledge.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.950 align:middle line:90%
They know about those things.

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And instead of using it for
good, they've used it for evil.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's like if I
can tap into that,

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:38.500 align:middle line:84%
can they get me to use
it for evil purposes

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.820 align:middle line:84%
or whatever the case is, like
they've always been able to do?

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.590 align:middle line:84%
Or can we transmute
that and use it

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:47.810 align:middle line:84%
for collective of
humanity's evolution?

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:48.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:52.360 align:middle line:90%


00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.240 align:middle line:84%
When did you go public
with all of this?

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:59.840 align:middle line:84%
When did you decide
to share this gift?

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:00.850 align:middle line:90%
>> To share the gift.

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:06.610 align:middle line:84%
So I woke up one morning, and
I had this burning sensation--

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:10.840 align:middle line:84%
yearning or whatever-- to
channel Princess Diana publicly

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.880 align:middle line:90%
and post it on YouTube.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.303 align:middle line:84%
And it was just something
that I just knew I had to do.

00:15:15.303 --> 00:15:16.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Was she already
coming through?

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:20.200 align:middle line:90%
>> She had been coming through.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.970 align:middle line:84%
Not quite like I
did on the video.

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.560 align:middle line:84%
That was pretty
long and intense.

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.360 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.693 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't think I saw that one.

00:15:26.693 --> 00:15:28.390 align:middle line:84%
Can you just give
us a little sneak?

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:29.480 align:middle line:90%
>> It was very emotional.

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.105 align:middle line:84%
It was the first time
I ever really did

00:15:31.105 --> 00:15:34.360 align:middle line:90%
a long period of channeling.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And she basically got
into some deep issues.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, that's basically
how I started on the YouTube

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.340 align:middle line:84%
and decided whoever
comes, I will

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:44.180 align:middle line:90%
channel you and make it public.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.280 align:middle line:90%
And that's kind of how it went.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:50.532 align:middle line:84%
>> And what was the reaction
when you put that up?

00:15:50.532 --> 00:15:51.490 align:middle line:90%
How did people respond?

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:52.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Actually, fairly well.

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:54.470 align:middle line:90%
People really enjoyed it.

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:57.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And then that propelled
you to keep doing this?

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
getting more and more

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:02.820 align:middle line:84%
people's deceased loved
ones coming to me.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I decided to do
private channeling on my own.

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And so it just kind of
took off from there.

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:10.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Did you do that here?

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:11.480 align:middle line:90%
People like--

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.310 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:13.210 align:middle line:90%
>> More online stuff?

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:13.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:14.666 align:middle line:90%
Online.

00:16:14.666 --> 00:16:16.600 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.600 align:middle line:84%
Being in Salt Lake and
in this energy, what's--

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.050 align:middle line:90%


00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:23.550 align:middle line:84%
because you mentioned
earlier people

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:25.300 align:middle line:84%
were OK with the
grandmother stuff.

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.400 align:middle line:84%
But beyond your
personal grandmother,

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:31.590 align:middle line:84%
when you started going to other
grandmothers or other spirits,

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:34.310 align:middle line:84%
have you gotten much of a
blowback from the community?

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:37.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So I am not very verbal
with all of that now.

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.030 align:middle line:84%
I just feel like if
people are ready,

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Spirit will help them find
me through the internet

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.280 align:middle line:90%
or whatever that way.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.650 align:middle line:84%
I've just had too many
just put up walls,

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:50.020 align:middle line:84%
and they just don't know
how to deal with it.

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:53.170 align:middle line:84%
I do find that women that
have their children out

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:56.410 align:middle line:84%
of the house, and they're
trying to rediscover themselves,

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:58.277 align:middle line:84%
they are starting
to dabble with this,

00:16:58.277 --> 00:16:59.860 align:middle line:84%
even if they are in
the Mormon church.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:03.700 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of my clients that
I have had from Salt Lake

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.630 align:middle line:90%
are older women.

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:07.630 align:middle line:84%
>> When you say children
out of the house, like,

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:08.829 align:middle line:90%
grown up and out?

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:09.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:09.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that what you mean?

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:10.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And they kind of are just like,
I've gone to church for years.

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:14.970 align:middle line:84%
Had the same lessons
over and over.

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:15.770 align:middle line:90%
What else is there?

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:17.020 align:middle line:90%
The kids are out of the house.

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.359 align:middle line:84%
So they'll start to
explore these things,

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:20.720 align:middle line:90%
and they're more open to it.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.819 align:middle line:84%
And it's the ones that are
having their little kids,

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:26.650 align:middle line:84%
their kids that they're trying
to get into church zone.

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And there's still
a little bit unsure

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:32.900 align:middle line:84%
what to bring into their family
life, and even themselves.

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:33.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And probably being conditioned
since birth, right?

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:41.800 align:middle line:84%
So they're probably
still a little

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.280 align:middle line:84%
scared to go outside
of what they know.

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>> So, well, hopefully
that'll be changing.

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:49.023 align:middle line:90%
It seems like it is.

00:17:49.023 --> 00:17:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I'm really hoping.

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:54.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I've done a little research
on the Mormon religion.

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:58.480 align:middle line:84%
But for those who
aren't too familiar,

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:04.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm guessing it's a pretty
rigid set of rules in its belief

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:05.010 align:middle line:90%
system?

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:05.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:07.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not
just a religion.

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:10.240 align:middle line:84%
It's like you change your
whole life and culture.

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.100 align:middle line:90%
Almost like Islamic.

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:16.150 align:middle line:84%
You change everything about
how you live, your interactions

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:17.630 align:middle line:90%
with people--

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:19.740 align:middle line:84%
>> In what ways
could you go into?

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:22.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, so you don't drink.

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:24.795 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
regulations with--

00:18:24.795 --> 00:18:27.910 align:middle line:90%


00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:30.262 align:middle line:84%
I guess just how
you live your life.

00:18:30.262 --> 00:18:32.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, not drinking, that
could be a positive thing.

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.170 align:middle line:84%
>> It is a positive thing,
yeah, because it can--

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:36.072 align:middle line:90%
it's fun.

00:18:36.072 --> 00:18:38.030 align:middle line:84%
It's really fun to drink
every once in a while.

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:40.543 align:middle line:84%
But it can bring your
vibration to a low state.

00:18:40.543 --> 00:18:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And they can't
think very clearly.

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.810 align:middle line:90%
So there's something to that.

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:46.728 align:middle line:84%
>> I was recently in
Kuwait, and it's illegal--

00:18:46.728 --> 00:18:47.770 align:middle line:90%
alcohol is illegal there.

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:48.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, really?

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.898 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, they don't
have it at all.

00:18:49.898 --> 00:18:54.097 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, oh, that's
actually good to know.

00:18:54.097 --> 00:18:55.430 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:56.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.930 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, though, I
think with kids being told,

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:00.520 align:middle line:90%
like, we don't do that.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:01.470 align:middle line:90%
It's a rule.

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:03.467 align:middle line:84%
Then they get more
intrigued, and then they

00:19:03.467 --> 00:19:04.820 align:middle line:90%
take it to a whole other level.

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:08.510 align:middle line:84%
Overcompensation
because of the--

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:09.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>> --suppression.

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:11.380 align:middle line:90%
>> I think sexual--

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:12.880 align:middle line:84%
one thing when you
said suppression,

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:17.080 align:middle line:84%
I think the sexual side of
how we are in our culture

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:20.570 align:middle line:84%
is also another lifestyle
that is unhealthy.

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:23.940 align:middle line:90%
And just the way that we live.

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:24.790 align:middle line:90%
>> And is that--

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:29.140 align:middle line:84%
because I know the multiple
wives thing, that's sort of--

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:30.110 align:middle line:90%
how does that work?

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:33.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So that is a break-off
from the Mormon church.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.080 align:middle line:90%
So we were--

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:37.520 align:middle line:84%
I say we because I've been
a part of it for so long.

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.670 align:middle line:84%
But I don't go to
the church anymore.

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:41.830 align:middle line:84%
But the Mormon church
was polygamist.

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:43.460 align:middle line:84%
The government was
getting at them.

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:44.800 align:middle line:90%
And so they said, OK, we're not.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.930 align:middle line:84%
But another sect said,
well, we still want to be.

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:49.120 align:middle line:84%
So they broke off,
and they still do.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And they call the FLDS,
or a fundamentalist.

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:56.140 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so there's different
divisions within the Mormon--

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:56.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:57.100 align:middle line:90%
>> See, I didn't even know that.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:57.520 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:58.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:05.740 align:middle line:84%
>> And so overall, basically,
the polygamy is not so much?

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:09.160 align:middle line:84%
>> No, not in the main
Mormon church, no.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I've seen
some TV shows of--

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:16.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, like--

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Where they go
into the lives of--

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:18.918 align:middle line:90%
>> "Sister Wives" and-- yeah.

00:20:18.918 --> 00:20:21.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, and just glimpses.

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, oh,
that's interesting.

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:25.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they believe pretty
much a lot of the same stuff.

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:27.943 align:middle line:84%
It's just the polygamy
that's been altered

00:20:27.943 --> 00:20:29.860 align:middle line:84%
that we have taken out
because we were getting

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.027 align:middle line:90%
so much from the government.

00:20:31.027 --> 00:20:32.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.720 align:middle line:84%
I've only been in Salt
Lake one time before,

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.900 align:middle line:84%
and that was mostly in
Park City for Sundance

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.580 align:middle line:90%
and popping over here.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.150 align:middle line:90%
But it seems like a great town.

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:41.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>> It's beautiful, driving over
the mountains and the green.

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:50.140 align:middle line:90%
And the view is--

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure the winters are
a little harsh, but--

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Winters are not the funnest
for me because I don't like

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:56.110 align:middle line:90%
to be cold.

00:20:56.110 --> 00:21:01.570 align:middle line:84%
But because of the community
of family and service,

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:03.460 align:middle line:84%
you often will get
a lot of people

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:06.075 align:middle line:84%
that are willing to help
you if you ever need.

00:21:06.075 --> 00:21:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And they'll be
like, hey, my kids

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:09.730 align:middle line:84%
can help, too, because
they're very family

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:11.380 align:middle line:90%
and service oriented.

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:13.730 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's good--
it's not all rigid stuff.

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:16.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So getting back
to the ET stuff,

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:23.920 align:middle line:84%
you mentioned channeling a
Zeta and-- was it channeling,

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:27.070 align:middle line:84%
or connecting with
a Zeta and a Mantis?

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I guess it would
be more of like a contact

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:31.810 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:33.700 align:middle line:84%
They came to me and
just talked to me.

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And my vibration had to be
raised so much that I didn't

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:39.530 align:middle line:90%
feel like I could even move.

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:42.640 align:middle line:84%
I was basically thrown down--
not thrown down by them.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.700 align:middle line:84%
But my energy felt
so transitioned

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:47.590 align:middle line:90%
that I laid down on the couch.

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:51.080 align:middle line:90%
And then they came over me.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And it just took a while for
me to even gain my energy back.

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:59.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I've been exploring
my own personal connections

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:03.700 align:middle line:84%
with both Zeta and Mantis,
could I ask what it felt like?

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:05.290 align:middle line:90%
What did you--

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:07.528 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt like I was
in a dizzy tunnel.

00:22:07.528 --> 00:22:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Were they coming
at the same time?

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>> They came at the
same time, together.

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:15.190 align:middle line:84%
They came together, and kind of
came toward me and spoke to me.

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:18.850 align:middle line:84%
I felt like the Mantis was
doing something with my energy

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:21.490 align:middle line:84%
to raise it enough where
I would understand, almost

00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:24.213 align:middle line:84%
like they were speaking
directly to me, like we are.

00:22:24.213 --> 00:22:25.630 align:middle line:84%
But obviously there
were no words.

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:28.650 align:middle line:90%


00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:29.670 align:middle line:90%
>> The Gray was?

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:33.613 align:middle line:84%
The Gray was speaking, and I
could understand it, almost

00:22:33.613 --> 00:22:34.780 align:middle line:90%
like you and I were talking.

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>> So the Mantis was
more of a facilitator.

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:37.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:37.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Just sort of being there.

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:40.210 align:middle line:84%
>> It felt like it was doing
something with my energy

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:44.040 align:middle line:84%
to raise it to a certain degree
where I could understand that.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.640 align:middle line:90%
>> And what did they say?

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:46.440 align:middle line:90%
>> It was--

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.607 align:middle line:90%
>> Or what did the Zeta say?

00:22:47.607 --> 00:22:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so it said, basically,
you need to do your path.

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:54.910 align:middle line:90%
You've been chosen for this.

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And then they said all
this stuff in, like,

00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:00.045 align:middle line:90%
Egyptian that I--

00:23:00.045 --> 00:23:03.640 align:middle line:84%
I think they thought that maybe
it would click or something.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.030 align:middle line:90%
But I just didn't--

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:06.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, what did it feel like?

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.550 align:middle line:84%
>> It felt like ancient
information that you need

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:15.520 align:middle line:84%
to reintroduce back into
the human consciousness.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you have an
idea of what that is?

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:18.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:22.330 align:middle line:84%
So since then, I've done
meditations and clarified it,

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:26.390 align:middle line:84%
and it always goes back
to the Egyptian times.

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:28.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is-- what are
those messages, generally?

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.090 align:middle line:90%
>> So there's a lot.

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:31.520 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Just the short version.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:37.210 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the biggest thing for
that time period was there were

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:39.548 align:middle line:90%
beings on the planet.

00:23:39.548 --> 00:23:41.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Already interacting
with humanity.

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:42.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And when I go back
into my meditations,

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.170 align:middle line:84%
they show me that there
are extraterrestrials

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:51.610 align:middle line:84%
all over the place that are in
control of different paradigms

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:53.470 align:middle line:90%
of the social structures.

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And somewhere along the lines,
most particularly probably

00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:59.800 align:middle line:84%
the Roman times when
the Romans took over,

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:03.140 align:middle line:84%
they transitioned it to be more
of a three-dimensional world.

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And they sort of faded
in the background--

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:09.680 align:middle line:84%
with control still, but we
are not able to see them.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, we
have become unconscious.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where all the
transitions have happened.

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And so they just basically
want to reintroduce the idea

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:20.990 align:middle line:90%
that they've always been here.

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:23.530 align:middle line:90%
But the fact that--

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:25.960 align:middle line:84%
they kind of say that
the cycles of the planet

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.120 align:middle line:84%
have taken us into
a lower dimension,

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.980 align:middle line:84%
and other beings took
advantage of that.

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And so we stayed in three
dimension for a while.

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:35.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Are you familiar with
the density terms?

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Density levels
correlating with chakras?

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:41.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:44.620 align:middle line:84%
So isn't it the
lower is your third,

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:47.540 align:middle line:84%
and then it goes up higher
to the higher dimension?

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:52.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Or density dimensions-- this
is sort of creating a thesaurus

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:57.620 align:middle line:84%
of words to describe
these experiences.

00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And I like to use
the dimensional--

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:02.980 align:middle line:84%
when I use the
term "dimensions,"

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.290 align:middle line:84%
I correlate it with
actual scientific--

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:08.050 align:middle line:84%
how the scientific community
says we're actually

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:11.960 align:middle line:84%
in the fourth dimension with
X,Y, Z, or up, down, left,

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:16.000 align:middle line:84%
right, and spacetime being the
fourth dimension for measuring

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.220 align:middle line:90%
dimensional space and time.

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And then fifth dimensional
concepts and ideas

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:27.010 align:middle line:84%
would be getting out
of the linear concept.

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:31.720 align:middle line:84%
So from A to B, no longer
going in that linear sense,

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.850 align:middle line:84%
but jumping around
the spacetime.

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:36.190 align:middle line:84%
And that gives a
fifth-dimensional perspective

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:39.010 align:middle line:90%
on our reality.

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:41.830 align:middle line:84%
Where I've noticed with some
of the other interviews,

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:45.790 align:middle line:84%
and Bashar Lyssa
Royal and others

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:48.820 align:middle line:84%
used the term
"densities" to describe

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:51.820 align:middle line:90%
the actual consciousness.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.380 align:middle line:90%
And we're sort of--

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:59.040 align:middle line:84%
they say we're moving from
Third to Fourth Density.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And I notice these terms kind
of get confusing sometimes,

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:05.770 align:middle line:90%
as people say 3D, 4D.

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:13.090 align:middle line:84%
So would you say more
of the Third Density,

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:14.660 align:middle line:90%
the heaviness of the energy?

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:15.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:18.140 align:middle line:84%
>> And then we're moving
into Fourth Density?

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:18.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:21.610 align:middle line:84%
So what I understand
with that is we

00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:27.940 align:middle line:84%
were a Fourth Density or a fifth
dimensional-type being before.

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And then I guess it was the way
that the cycles of the Earth

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.980 align:middle line:84%
rotated, or however
it worked, beings

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:39.310 align:middle line:84%
knew this, and came down,
and used these paradigms

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:43.420 align:middle line:84%
to take and control
our fear and structure.

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:46.500 align:middle line:90%
And we went down into density.

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And some of us have
stayed here for a while.

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And now that the earth has
done its cycle rotation,

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.980 align:middle line:90%
we're able to come out of it.

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:56.985 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:56.985 --> 00:26:58.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Does that seem like it--

00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:01.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Matches right
with everything, yes.

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:02.040 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:07.410 align:middle line:84%
So the planet itself is its
own higher dimensional density

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:08.340 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:12.120 align:middle line:90%
And we as densities-- beings--

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.830 align:middle line:90%
on it have to evolve with her.

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:15.658 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:27:15.658 --> 00:27:17.700 align:middle line:84%
That's the perfect way,
because people get upset.

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:20.520 align:middle line:84%
Like, how could the
beings come and do that

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:21.470 align:middle line:90%
to our consciousness?

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:23.550 align:middle line:84%
But it's like, we're
all doing this together.

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, in almost every
single one of my channelings,

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:29.760 align:middle line:84%
it was basically
humanity's choice.

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.740 align:middle line:90%
We let the fear overcome us.

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.600 align:middle line:84%
We let that maintain
our consciousness.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And we just didn't
break out of it in time,

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:38.280 align:middle line:84%
I guess, for
everything to evolve.

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And we stayed with
it for a while.

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:44.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I was hoping later
today, in the channeling,

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:48.110 align:middle line:84%
we can get into some of the
history a little bit more.

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:53.130 align:middle line:84%
Fall of Atlantis, and these
cycles, and stuff like that.

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:56.190 align:middle line:90%
And the human evolution.

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:57.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:00.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that was going
to be the main focus.

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:01.050 align:middle line:90%
>> That's good.

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:03.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Sounds like you've gotten
a lot of information on other

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:04.280 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:08.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that's the
biggest scope of my path

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:10.500 align:middle line:90%
as a channeler, because it can--

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:14.650 align:middle line:84%
each channeler has their
things that they focus on.

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like right now that's
what they want me to focus on,

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:20.520 align:middle line:84%
because this is what
was needed, I guess,

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:22.030 align:middle line:90%
for this evolution process.

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:22.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:26.717 align:middle line:84%
And we can always
learn from our past.

00:28:26.717 --> 00:28:28.800 align:middle line:84%
Even though we're recreating
it in the moment now.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.200 align:middle line:90%
>> I know, I know.

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:37.530 align:middle line:84%
So you've connected with
all these different beings.

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Do you have one being that
you normally connect with?

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.810 align:middle line:90%
Or is it just always random?

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:48.690 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of times it is
like the Council of Light,

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:50.340 align:middle line:90%
if it's to do with healing.

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:53.100 align:middle line:84%
If there's something
to do with healing.

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:56.040 align:middle line:84%
It's just depending on the
question and things like that.

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.648 align:middle line:90%
If it's something with origins.

00:28:57.648 --> 00:28:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And they call themselves--
is it a collective,

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:00.550 align:middle line:90%
the Council of Light?

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:00.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:02.227 align:middle line:84%
But they'll visually
show me who's

00:29:02.227 --> 00:29:03.700 align:middle line:90%
stepping forward, usually.

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:04.770 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:11.100 align:middle line:84%
So within the council,
one person of the council

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.840 align:middle line:84%
will step forward and say,
OK, on behalf of the council?

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:14.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:15.440 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, cool.

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:18.418 align:middle line:84%
>> Especially if they
know that individual,

00:29:18.418 --> 00:29:20.460 align:middle line:84%
and that individual has
a specific question about

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:24.970 align:middle line:84%
healing, with whatever reason,
they know how to answer that

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:25.770 align:middle line:90%
question.

00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:28.410 align:middle line:84%
Namely more than somebody
else or whatever.

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:29.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>> But I do feel like, as far
as the origins in humanity,

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:39.610 align:middle line:84%
it is more like ET and the
Draconis that I connect with.

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:40.880 align:middle line:90%
Reptilian type stuff.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.550 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:45.890 align:middle line:84%
When you say the ET, so the
Draconis part of the ET stuff?

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:53.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but also just other ET
beings that maybe are not fully

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:54.740 align:middle line:84%
part of the council
with healing.

00:29:54.740 --> 00:30:00.170 align:middle line:84%
They just know about humanity,
and how things have fit in.

00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:02.720 align:middle line:84%
Such as Lyran beings
or things like that.

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:05.607 align:middle line:84%
They have a lot of wisdom that
came with this time period,

00:30:05.607 --> 00:30:07.440 align:middle line:84%
and so they'll help
with that kind of thing,

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.790 align:middle line:90%
if you're gaining knowledge.

00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:10.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Very cool.

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:12.210 align:middle line:90%
Do you have a favorite?

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:13.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I like doing
the Reptilians and--

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:14.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah?

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, their energy
is just so direct.

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:18.350 align:middle line:90%
And I like that.

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:20.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't like the
fluff of everything.

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:23.680 align:middle line:84%
Let's just get to the reason
why we're here, and let's do it.

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.980 align:middle line:90%
And that's how they are.

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:26.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice, nice.

00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:27.620 align:middle line:90%
Very cool.

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:29.953 align:middle line:84%
Do you think maybe later we
can talk to some Reptilians?

00:30:29.953 --> 00:30:31.245 align:middle line:90%
Let's see if they come through.

00:30:31.245 --> 00:30:32.172 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:32.172 --> 00:30:34.550 align:middle line:90%
>> That'd be cool.

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, my process over
this, doing this series,

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:44.298 align:middle line:84%
has been learning and
categorizing, and learning

00:30:44.298 --> 00:30:45.590 align:middle line:90%
about these different energies.

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And the Reptilians-- we had
one super happy-go-lucky Treb

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:56.570 align:middle line:84%
come through Rob
Gauthier, a Reptilian.

00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:58.490 align:middle line:84%
But other than that,
I really haven't

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:00.470 align:middle line:90%
tapped into too many other--

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:03.460 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I've sort of seeked
out and seen and connected

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:04.260 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.050 align:middle line:84%
But I think that would
be nice, to introduce--

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:07.140 align:middle line:90%
>> So have you seen any?

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:09.810 align:middle line:90%
Like, in your meditations?

00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:10.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Reptilians?

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:13.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:14.390 align:middle line:90%
>> No, actually.

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:17.270 align:middle line:90%
Well, I-- kind of.

00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:23.210 align:middle line:84%
But not in a
communicative sense,

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:27.350 align:middle line:84%
where they're creating
a rapport of question,

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:28.310 align:middle line:90%
answers kind of thing.

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:32.270 align:middle line:90%
Just images and feelings.

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:34.670 align:middle line:84%
>> They just kind of flew
by your line of vision.

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:36.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, sort of Reptilians.

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And I sort of got one one
time during a meditation.

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:49.100 align:middle line:90%
I saw this really nasty, dark--

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:52.610 align:middle line:84%
claws and teeth and snouts
and all that stuff coming in.

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And then for a second,
for a split second,

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:57.690 align:middle line:90%
I was really afraid.

00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:00.620 align:middle line:84%
But then immediately I was like,
well, no, that's super cool.

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:02.720 align:middle line:84%
Look at how cool that
is, looking at it

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:06.470 align:middle line:84%
from the little
boy's perspective.

00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Like a "Jurassic Park"
or something like--

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:13.800 align:middle line:84%
kids love dinosaurs, and
playing with that stuff.

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:15.350 align:middle line:90%
It's a cool factor.

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I did
that, it shifted,

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:20.030 align:middle line:90%
and it turned into a cartoon.

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:21.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, really?

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.360 align:middle line:84%
>> And it was kind
of like Shrek.

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:24.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>> You know how he tries to
be the mean giant in front

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:29.840 align:middle line:84%
of everybody, but he's
just a cuddly Shrek guy.

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:31.540 align:middle line:90%
>> That's funny.

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:32.540 align:middle line:90%
>> That was the analogy.

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:34.373 align:middle line:84%
I was like, it's just
about your perspective

00:32:34.373 --> 00:32:37.100 align:middle line:84%
and how you look
at these things.

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:40.940 align:middle line:90%
Which creates them, right?

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:47.490 align:middle line:84%
So in reality, it was just a
lovable cartoon puffy dragon

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:48.290 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:49.090 align:middle line:90%
>> That is cool.

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:51.560 align:middle line:84%
I've heard that
you can transmute

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:54.560 align:middle line:84%
what you're seeing into
something more lovable

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:55.950 align:middle line:90%
or in the light kind of thing.

00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:56.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:58.910 align:middle line:84%
So that was-- and I think
that was the lesson,

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:02.840 align:middle line:84%
that it was coming
through and saying, hey,

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:05.270 align:middle line:90%
we're not all scary, nasty--

00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:06.260 align:middle line:90%
we can be cool.

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:10.420 align:middle line:84%
It's just you guys are
so used to perception.

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:13.478 align:middle line:84%
You're so trained, oh,
this is bad, this is good.

00:33:13.478 --> 00:33:15.020 align:middle line:84%
So if you let go of
all that, there's

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:16.770 align:middle line:84%
actually something
really cool to be seen.

00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And even lovable and happy and
good with the Reptilian stuff.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:27.770 align:middle line:84%
But conditioning-- even
in the New Age community,

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:33.230 align:middle line:84%
the conditioning of Reptilians
has not been the greatest.

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:35.360 align:middle line:84%
They've sort of had,
you know, stay away

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.790 align:middle line:84%
from the reptilians, or the
evil Reptilian government,

00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:39.770 align:middle line:90%
the Illuminati, and all that.

00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Of course, that
faction and those--

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:42.740 align:middle line:90%
they do exist.

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:45.750 align:middle line:90%
But for us to--

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:49.730 align:middle line:84%
I think it's time for us to
embrace all of that side of us.

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:51.290 align:middle line:84%
Because we all have
Reptilian in us.

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:52.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, as far as I know, there
are the ancient Reptilians.

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And then, like I
said, there's more

00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:00.940 align:middle line:84%
the lower dimensional that just
want to be in Fourth Density.

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want
to evolve right now.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.762 align:middle line:84%
And those are the ones
that are kind of like, OK.

00:34:04.762 --> 00:34:06.850 align:middle line:84%
But the other ones,
they're very wise,

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:08.392 align:middle line:84%
and they have a lot
of intelligence.

00:34:08.392 --> 00:34:10.100 align:middle line:84%
>> That dragon's been
around a long time.

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:12.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, he has.

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:14.494 align:middle line:90%
>> And there's a reason.

00:34:14.494 --> 00:34:15.294 align:middle line:90%
It's funny.

00:34:15.294 --> 00:34:20.510 align:middle line:84%
I actually had-- and I was
in an ayahuasca journey.

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:23.750 align:middle line:90%
And this was right--

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:27.909 align:middle line:84%
literally days after
the election of Trump.

00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And I saw Trump as this wise
dragon, flying around the room.

00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And it was something-- because
there's so much fear around

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:42.650 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:44.683 align:middle line:84%
And there was other people
in the ceremony that

00:34:44.683 --> 00:34:47.100 align:middle line:84%
thought we were all going to
be put in concentration camps

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:51.460 align:middle line:90%
and taken away.

00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:56.679 align:middle line:84%
I saw the energy of
what Trump is here.

00:34:56.679 --> 00:34:58.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm not-- whoever's
watching this,

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.955 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a big Trump supporter.

00:35:00.955 --> 00:35:02.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying that's--

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:04.877 align:middle line:84%
>> It was just maybe
what you needed to see.

00:35:04.877 --> 00:35:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>> It's just what I
need to see to say, hey,

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:09.680 align:middle line:84%
let's not be afraid of this Yeah
don't be afraid of the energy.

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:14.440 align:middle line:84%
Instead, maybe there is
some wisdom behind it.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.900 align:middle line:84%
Not saying that he's conscious
of any kind of wisdom.

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:19.300 align:middle line:90%
But there should be--

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:21.700 align:middle line:84%
whatever energy is coming
through there for the planet

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:24.070 align:middle line:84%
and for the lessons that we
need to learn at this time,

00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:29.470 align:middle line:84%
it could be this ancient
Reptilian wise energy

00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:31.940 align:middle line:84%
to help move us
through our evolution.

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:33.422 align:middle line:90%
It's all here to serve.

00:35:33.422 --> 00:35:34.880 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise it wouldn't
be happening.

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:35.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:36.520 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:38.145 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, actually,
I wanted to ask you.

00:35:38.145 --> 00:35:42.320 align:middle line:84%
So your process, I've noticed,
online, from the videos

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.120 align:middle line:90%
I've seen.

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.578 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of a
little bit different

00:35:44.578 --> 00:35:46.780 align:middle line:90%
than your traditional channel.

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:50.590 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like you're
translating in real time.

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I've seen you
go full talking as the being.

00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:57.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I think most people who are
familiar with this show are

00:35:57.610 --> 00:36:06.370 align:middle line:84%
used to people sort of embracing
the energy of that being.

00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:08.988 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sort of having a
conversation with that being.

00:36:08.988 --> 00:36:10.030 align:middle line:90%
How does it work for you?

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So initially I did let
myself completely go into more

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:17.560 align:middle line:84%
of a deeper trance, and I took
on the energy of the being.

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:21.100 align:middle line:84%
I have trained myself to
hold back a little bit

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:24.370 align:middle line:84%
to be a little bit more present
and use my own personality

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:25.410 align:middle line:90%
in communicating.

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:27.340 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Just because I feel like
there are some information

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:32.515 align:middle line:90%
in advance--

00:36:32.515 --> 00:36:34.390 align:middle line:84%
not advance, but there's
a lot of information

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:35.980 align:middle line:84%
that people are
just still trying

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:39.460 align:middle line:84%
to get a grip on that I feel
like I need to explain it

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:44.610 align:middle line:84%
in my own terms, versus using
the personality of the being.

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:48.280 align:middle line:84%
But it just depends
on what is needed.

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:50.200 align:middle line:90%
And the deep trance--

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:54.838 align:middle line:84%
I definitely initially got
into the deeper trance.

00:36:54.838 --> 00:36:56.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you go
into deeper trance,

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:59.740 align:middle line:84%
are you still able to
hear the information?

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:02.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I'm just not able
to communicate with you

00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:04.060 align:middle line:90%
as clearly.

00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:06.922 align:middle line:90%
I'm just totally replaced.

00:37:06.922 --> 00:37:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>> But the information that's
coming through is clear

00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:09.640 align:middle line:90%
information?

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:15.070 align:middle line:84%
So that would be good for--
like right now, you and I--

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:19.570 align:middle line:84%
or even maybe doing something
over interview on YouTube.

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:22.810 align:middle line:84%
But as far as personal
channeling, it's easier for me

00:37:22.810 --> 00:37:23.780 align:middle line:90%
to stay more present.

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I've trained
myself to kind of go.

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:27.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So you can be present
to ask the questions.

00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:28.940 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:32.200 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise you don't know
what's coming through.

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:33.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.350 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you're by
yourself, it's more of that--

00:37:35.350 --> 00:37:37.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm having a conversation
with this being.

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:37.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:41.770 align:middle line:84%
>> But in this case, would
you just go full trance then?

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:44.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I think full trance
would probably--

00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:46.480 align:middle line:84%
maybe even a little bit
more toward my personality.

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:50.450 align:middle line:84%
But more into trance than a
private channeling session.

00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:51.250 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:54.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Because sometimes the
client will stop you and ask

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:54.860 align:middle line:90%
questions.

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to
come back out of it,

00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:57.628 align:middle line:84%
and then you have
to go back in it.

00:37:57.628 --> 00:37:59.461 align:middle line:84%
So it's better just to
keep a middle ground.

00:37:59.461 --> 00:38:00.261 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:38:00.261 --> 00:38:01.330 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:04.870 align:middle line:84%
I noticed one channeling
where you were bringing in--

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:07.600 align:middle line:84%
I think it was a
Reptilian energy.

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.040 align:middle line:90%
Or no, it was--

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:10.250 align:middle line:90%
was it a Reptilian?

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:14.665 align:middle line:84%
One of these ancient
bearded guys.

00:38:14.665 --> 00:38:16.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Ancient bearded guys?

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And he was one of these
bigger tall beings that lived

00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:20.650 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, the red-haired giant.

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:23.310 align:middle line:90%
>> The red-haired giants.

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:24.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that was a weird--

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:24.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:27.482 align:middle line:84%
You were saying just physically
how it felt. And you're like,

00:38:27.482 --> 00:38:28.550 align:middle line:90%
this is just weird.

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:29.850 align:middle line:90%
>> It was weird.

00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:33.122 align:middle line:84%
>> So was it just weird because
it wasn't like anything else

00:38:33.122 --> 00:38:33.955 align:middle line:90%
that you've against?

00:38:33.955 --> 00:38:34.755 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:34.755 --> 00:38:36.960 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly-- it wasn't
like anything I had felt.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:39.490 align:middle line:84%
It was like I was
talking to somebody

00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:43.010 align:middle line:84%
that looked like a human,
but it felt like an animal.

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:44.710 align:middle line:90%
Right, right.

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:45.613 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:45.613 --> 00:38:46.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Animalistic energy.

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:48.735 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:38:48.735 --> 00:38:52.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and I remember watching
that and sort of feeling that

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:53.570 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:55.720 align:middle line:84%
Any other strange,
weird energies

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:59.920 align:middle line:90%
that you want to mention?

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:03.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I will mention channeling
Brigham Young is quite

00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:04.660 align:middle line:90%
interesting.

00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And he was the one
who found the skeletons?

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:07.600 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:10.520 align:middle line:84%
>> He was the one that
took the Mormons--

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>> --from the region in
Illinois over to establish what

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:16.630 align:middle line:90%
the church is today.

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:18.770 align:middle line:84%
So built up pretty much
all of Salt Lake City.

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:19.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:20.710 align:middle line:90%
So you channeled that--

00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:22.060 align:middle line:90%
you channeled him?

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:23.590 align:middle line:90%
>> He actually came to me.

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:26.440 align:middle line:90%
And it was very intense.

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
because Utah

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:32.840 align:middle line:84%
is named after a raptor,
which is a Reptilian.

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And he's got a lot of
Reptilian-type energy.

00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:40.380 align:middle line:90%
And he has just a lot--

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:41.180 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:43.230 align:middle line:84%
It was just a very
weird energy, I

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:45.260 align:middle line:90%
felt like, when he came to me.

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:46.600 align:middle line:90%
>> In that interview?

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:48.690 align:middle line:90%
That energy on your website?

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:50.980 align:middle line:84%
>> So when I was
like, all right,

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:52.950 align:middle line:84%
let's make a YouTube
of the channeling,

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:57.780 align:middle line:84%
he actually switched and made it
a little bit more light-hearted

00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:58.860 align:middle line:90%
and loving.

00:39:58.860 --> 00:39:59.863 align:middle line:90%
Because I felt like--

00:39:59.863 --> 00:40:01.530 align:middle line:84%
maybe he did that
because the collective

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:03.738 align:middle line:84%
wasn't ready to hear what
he was actually telling me.

00:40:03.738 --> 00:40:06.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:09.047 align:middle line:84%
>> Because there is a lot
of reasons why religion was

00:40:09.047 --> 00:40:10.380 align:middle line:90%
brought here in the first place.

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And some of them aren't
so good, because it

00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:14.910 align:middle line:90%
can capture our consciousness.

00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:17.310 align:middle line:90%
And he was part of that.

00:40:17.310 --> 00:40:19.620 align:middle line:90%
>> He was part of the--

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:20.880 align:middle line:90%
bringing it here, right?

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:23.910 align:middle line:84%
>> He was part of making
it into what it is today.

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Sort of capturing
that consciousness

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:31.365 align:middle line:84%
to keep it into a childlike
state, versus expanding.

00:40:31.365 --> 00:40:33.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you go into depth
a little about that?

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:38.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So basically, what I
understand is Joseph Smith was

00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:41.130 align:middle line:84%
here to bring in
information from the past,

00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:46.500 align:middle line:84%
and to help others
understand where we were.

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:49.800 align:middle line:84%
Then created a
religion because of it.

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:55.860 align:middle line:84%
Brigham Young actually,
after Joseph had passed over,

00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:58.650 align:middle line:84%
took all of the saints
over to this region

00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:00.570 align:middle line:90%
and established the church.

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And I guess used that
information against the people.

00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:11.990 align:middle line:84%
So it was good initially,
but it was transformed--

00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.960 align:middle line:90%
>> As old religions.

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:13.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:14.630 align:middle line:90%
And he really does--

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:17.335 align:middle line:84%
Brigham Young really does
have a very dark energy.

00:41:17.335 --> 00:41:18.710 align:middle line:84%
I feel like there
was a lot going

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:20.720 align:middle line:90%
on at that time that really--

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:21.520 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:26.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, how long ago was
this, when he came through?

00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know,
maybe a year ago?

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:28.660 align:middle line:90%
Maybe?

00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:29.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I could see that
definitely would be some

00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:33.260 align:middle line:90%
blowback.

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:35.030 align:middle line:84%
You could definitely get a
blowback from the community.

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:37.165 align:middle line:84%
They were kind of
like, that's not safe

00:41:37.165 --> 00:41:38.750 align:middle line:90%
for you to do that right now.

00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:39.550 align:middle line:90%
>> To put that out.

00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:41.967 align:middle line:84%
>> But individually, if they
come to you and ask questions

00:41:41.967 --> 00:41:43.860 align:middle line:84%
in a private channel,
we can do that.

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So if people came to you
individually and asked about

00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:50.760 align:middle line:84%
that particularly, so should we
not go into detail about that

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:51.560 align:middle line:90%
right now?

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:53.183 align:middle line:90%
I guess too much.

00:41:53.183 --> 00:41:54.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, maybe not too much.

00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:55.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, OK.

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>> It feels weird,
going into it.

00:41:58.010 --> 00:42:02.086 align:middle line:84%
>> Again--
collectively, though--

00:42:02.086 --> 00:42:04.670 align:middle line:84%
we all choose to
have this experience.

00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:08.850 align:middle line:84%
So he's just a facilitator
for that collective desire--

00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:11.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:15.790 align:middle line:84%
>> --to experience this
religious constraints,

00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:22.420 align:middle line:84%
or disempowerment,
or whatever it is.

00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:25.030 align:middle line:90%
So again, another perspective.

00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:27.430 align:middle line:84%
Not to look at him
as this bad guy, or--

00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:28.490 align:middle line:90%
>> That's really good.

00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:29.290 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:31.578 align:middle line:84%
Especially because,
at the time, Joseph

00:42:31.578 --> 00:42:32.870 align:middle line:90%
channeled a lot of information.

It was beneficial.

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:36.970 align:middle line:84%

00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:42.030 align:middle line:90%
Should I do this?

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:44.350 align:middle line:84%

you're giving your power away

00:42:44.350 --> 00:42:47.890 align:middle line:84%
to somebody else, when you're
able to tap into that yourself.

00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:50.500 align:middle line:84%

of your problems,

00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:57.080 align:middle line:90%
