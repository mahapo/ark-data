00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to
another interesting,

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.220 align:middle line:84%
fun episode of
"Interview with E.D."

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.050 align:middle line:90%
Today we have Ana.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And first, before we get
into some channeling,

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.825 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to hear a little bit
about yourself and tell us--

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:17.450 align:middle line:84%
you mentioned before
you went to India.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.908 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of
interesting things.

00:01:18.908 --> 00:01:21.980 align:middle line:90%
So who are you?

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Who am I?

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.800 align:middle line:90%
Well, my journey kind of--

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.830 align:middle line:84%
I started my life very
scientific, very logical,

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.070 align:middle line:84%
not very in touch
with spirituality.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And when I was in
college, I really

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.060 align:middle line:84%
started opening up
to Eastern religion.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.082 align:middle line:84%
And I was on track to
become a psychiatrist

00:01:43.082 --> 00:01:44.540 align:middle line:84%
and go to medical
school, so I also

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.800 align:middle line:90%
had a background in science.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.330 align:middle line:84%
I started getting
really interested

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.700 align:middle line:84%
in meditation research and
involved with meditation

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.050 align:middle line:90%
research studies.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.960 align:middle line:84%
But slowly, or actually
pretty quickly,

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.390 align:middle line:84%
I started to veer away from
the path of Western medicine.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.040 align:middle line:90%
And I was really drawn to India.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And I went there to
study Tibetan studies,

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.770 align:middle line:84%
so learning about Buddhism,
Tibetan language, history,

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.050 align:middle line:84%
culture, as well as Tibetan
medicine for a month.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And just when I was there, that
was the first time in India

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.268 align:middle line:84%
where I started to have
experiences where--

00:02:27.268 --> 00:02:29.060 align:middle line:84%
it was a time where my
mind was opening up.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.180 align:middle line:84%
I was studying things
intellectually,

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.960 align:middle line:84%
but I had a few
experiences there

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.890 align:middle line:84%
that were really things that
I couldn't explain logically,

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.720 align:middle line:84%
where I really
viscerally felt openings.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.922 align:middle line:84%
And for example, being in the
presence of the Dalai Lama

00:02:45.922 --> 00:02:48.380 align:middle line:84%
for the first time and just
crying, and crying, and crying,

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.990 align:middle line:84%
and not knowing why,
and just having a sense

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.940 align:middle line:84%
that there's something
so much greater than I

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.500 align:middle line:90%
could understand happening.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>> So you met the
Dalai Lama in person?

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>> We got to ask him a few
questions on the various trips

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.190 align:middle line:90%
that I did.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.565 align:middle line:84%
And then when I
was living there,

00:03:02.565 --> 00:03:04.430 align:middle line:84%
he would also have
public teachings,

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.410 align:middle line:84%
where everyone in the town
of Dharamshala, McLeod Ganj--

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.010 align:middle line:84%
the little mountaintop town of
three roads in the Himalayas--

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.970 align:middle line:84%
everyone would kind of
gather in the temple.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And that was also the
first time I really

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.390 align:middle line:84%
felt that sense of community
and just of everyone

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.240 align:middle line:84%
coming together and
honoring like compassion,

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.240 align:middle line:90%
which just really struck me.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And I actually found it hard to
come back to Western countries,

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.180 align:middle line:84%
like I had reverse culture
shock, whereas India

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.940 align:middle line:90%
felt so normal to me.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.615 align:middle line:84%
But at that time
I wasn't really--

00:03:36.615 --> 00:03:39.620 align:middle line:90%


00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.290 align:middle line:84%
it was more of a mental
opening, like my mind was making

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.780 align:middle line:90%
space for spiritual concepts.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And I found it
really easy to relax

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.500 align:middle line:84%
into the idea of
compassion and all that.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.520 align:middle line:84%
But things like
karma, past lives

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.110 align:middle line:84%
were a little harder for
me to be on board with.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And looking back
now, I really value

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.060 align:middle line:84%
that, because I see that
so much of our society

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.240 align:middle line:84%
is in that place where we really
value science, value logic.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And I see that
compassion is something

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.380 align:middle line:84%
that we all have in common
that we can all open into,

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.600 align:middle line:84%
wherever we are in terms
of our experiences.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.310 align:middle line:84%
But it was really
once I came back to LA

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.840 align:middle line:84%
that I started to
really practice,

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.220 align:middle line:84%
like do spiritual
practice, and really start

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.140 align:middle line:84%
to have experiences that
were blowing my mind away,

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.440 align:middle line:84%
and where I felt like
I was going crazy.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.230 align:middle line:90%
>> What's a spiritual practice?

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.530 align:middle line:90%
And can you describe it?

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:40.370 align:middle line:90%
>> For a while--

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've always been
so resonant and interested

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.050 align:middle line:90%
in every spiritual tradition.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.810 align:middle line:84%
So actually, a friend
and I were kind

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.590 align:middle line:84%
of making a documentary
about just all

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.840 align:middle line:84%
the different spiritual
practices that we were trying.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.670 align:middle line:90%
We were so open.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And we were going to start
in LA and travel the world.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:56.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Like meditation?

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:57.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.457 align:middle line:90%
>> Or Omming?

00:05:01.457 --> 00:05:02.540 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't do Omming yet.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:03.340 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.320 align:middle line:90%
>> But--

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.653 align:middle line:90%
>> What is a spiritual practice?

00:05:05.653 --> 00:05:06.453 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:06.453 --> 00:05:08.390 align:middle line:84%
So many different
types of meditation,

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.980 align:middle line:90%
types of gatherings.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.090 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.080 align:middle line:90%
Fire ceremonies.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, fire ceremonies.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.910 align:middle line:90%
We did Arigato Zen meditation.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.180 align:middle line:90%
All different types of things.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.820 align:middle line:90%
But really, my practice has--

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.710 align:middle line:84%
and I've done
Vipassana retreats.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And that was very,
very powerful.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.960 align:middle line:84%
So doing long periods of
just very simple meditation.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.040 align:middle line:90%
That's Buddhist.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.332 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's where you don't
speak at all for a while?

00:05:33.332 --> 00:05:34.670 align:middle line:90%
>> You don't speak for 10 days.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.550 align:middle line:84%
It's really a practice
of kind of turning

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.400 align:middle line:84%
your mind into a laser,
and then scanning

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.460 align:middle line:90%
through your physical body.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of designed to
take you out of your body.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:52.730 align:middle line:84%
But what you're practicing
is neutral observation.

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.090 align:middle line:84%
So you're really just
observing whatever sensations

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:02.580 align:middle line:84%
are present in your body and not
judging them, which is really

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.270 align:middle line:84%
challenging often for
humans, because we tend

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.790 align:middle line:84%
to react to whatever
is occurring

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:13.200 align:middle line:84%
with either a positive reaction
or negative, like a judgment.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's a practice that
requires a lot of discipline.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And those experiences were
incredibly opening for me.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.290 align:middle line:84%
The first time I did a Vipassana
retreat, a 10-day retreat,

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.050 align:middle line:84%
I was floating for
three weeks afterwards.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.420 align:middle line:84%
I was just in a
trance state where

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.740 align:middle line:84%
I was doing things intuitively,
and my mind had no--

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.530 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea why I was doing
anything that I was doing,

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.990 align:middle line:84%
but I was just in
a magical flow.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Like driving a
car and kind of not--

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.310 align:middle line:90%
sometimes we go into our--

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.080 align:middle line:84%
we're listening to the
radio or something,

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.130 align:middle line:84%
and you just kind of forget
that you're driving sometimes.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:49.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:52.430 align:middle line:84%
Where your mind's kind
of just to the side.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And then 30 minutes to an
hour goes by, and you're like,

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:56.980 align:middle line:90%
whoa, where did that time go?

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And also, I felt like
there was a sense of--

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:07.220 align:middle line:84%
that really opened me up in
terms of my intuitive senses

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.750 align:middle line:90%
about ritual.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.935 align:middle line:84%
I was never someone who
resonated much with ritual

00:07:11.935 --> 00:07:14.060 align:middle line:84%
before, because my mind
would get in the way of it,

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.390 align:middle line:90%
and be like, this is pointless.

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:16.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:18.620 align:middle line:84%
>> But I just started to
notice that when my mind

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.840 align:middle line:84%
wasn't involved, I would do
things in kind of a ritualistic

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:22.640 align:middle line:90%
way.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.430 align:middle line:84%
I'd feel attracted to certain
things, like crystals.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:30.500 align:middle line:84%
My life became more
ritualistic in a sense,

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:34.460 align:middle line:84%
but where it just
flowed that way.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>> So you sort of found
purpose in the ritual then,

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.830 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to
before not having--

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.690 align:middle line:90%
not seeing the purpose in it?

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:44.470 align:middle line:84%
>> It wasn't-- it didn't even
really feel like it was finding

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:45.270 align:middle line:90%
a purpose.

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:49.270 align:middle line:84%
It was just like, there
was no analysis of it.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.310 align:middle line:84%
It's just like, yep, this
is what I'm doing now.

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:52.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's see what happens.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:53.690 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And then just
incredible things would

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.733 align:middle line:84%
happen, like I'd be put
together with people

00:07:58.733 --> 00:07:59.900 align:middle line:90%
that I was supposed to meet.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And it was my first
experience of really

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:07.160 align:middle line:90%
being in a flow of surrender.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And being so mental
for much of my life,

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:13.100 align:middle line:84%
it was really beautiful
to experience that.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And then my real, I
would say, shifting

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:24.230 align:middle line:84%
was facilitated by
the deep inner work

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:29.480 align:middle line:84%
that I began to do as I started
to study spiritual psychology

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.400 align:middle line:84%
and have that
really be something

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:36.440 align:middle line:84%
that I apply in my life in
every moment, which was a very

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.990 align:middle line:90%
intense journey to begin.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.870 align:middle line:84%
So that started
when I was in LA.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>> In inner work, is that sort
of like finding out stuff about

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:49.400 align:middle line:84%
yourself and programs, and
kind of undoing things?

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, like really being
present in my consciousness

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.210 align:middle line:84%
with whatever is occurring,
whatever I'm experiencing

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:59.840 align:middle line:84%
in each moment, and actually
allowing any subconscious

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.840 align:middle line:84%
material to surface, which
can be really uncomfortable.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.530 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:10.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So sometimes that's called
the hero's journey, you know?

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:16.780 align:middle line:84%
In really addressing what's
there under the surface,

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:20.020 align:middle line:84%
because really, the way
that I operate and I

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:25.160 align:middle line:84%
see things is that we
do hold certain things

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:29.600 align:middle line:84%
that are unconscious,
oftentimes, in our field,

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.270 align:middle line:84%
in our consciousness,
and we kind of

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:38.300 align:middle line:84%
attract experiences that are
designed divinely, designed

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.490 align:middle line:84%
to bring those things
to our awareness.

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And when we set the intention
to really become aware

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.650 align:middle line:84%
of those things,
a lot of them can

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:49.710 align:middle line:84%
be triggered quickly and
in very intense ways.

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:52.100 align:middle line:84%
So I started to experience
that, where it was like,

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.080 align:middle line:84%
everything's coming
up to the surface.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, really
with that intention opening

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.680 align:middle line:84%
up to so much
assistance and so much--

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.540 align:middle line:90%


00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.960 align:middle line:84%
such a presence of
love within myself

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:12.630 align:middle line:84%
and reflected through various
presences, spiritual presences,

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:20.190 align:middle line:84%
and really began to realize
my innate sense of devotion

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:23.220 align:middle line:84%
spiritually, which felt like
it had been cut off for so much

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.630 align:middle line:90%
of my early life.

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:28.980 align:middle line:84%
So it was a really
beautiful process.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think through that, it
was really setting the intention

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.630 align:middle line:90%
to experience truth.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.510 align:middle line:84%
I would say that is
what opened that up,

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:42.440 align:middle line:84%
and holding that intention
in each moment, which

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.280 align:middle line:90%
is not always easy.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:49.290 align:middle line:84%
But I guess, I would say
that's been my journey.

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And then learning to
integrate everything that's

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:54.630 align:middle line:84%
happened through that, and
learning to be comfortable

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:58.110 align:middle line:84%
going into the unknown,
comfortable going into

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:02.280 align:middle line:84%
places that the mind
can't maybe understand.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And sort of doing this
inner work is when you said you

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:06.420 align:middle line:84%
opened yourself
up to assistance.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Is that when the Octorians
and other beings started

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:12.150 align:middle line:90%
making themselves known?

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:16.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I had heard
about "aliens,"

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:20.020 align:middle line:84%
as many people call them, and
which doesn't resonate for me

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:21.990 align:middle line:90%
as the term, and you neither.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:26.490 align:middle line:84%
>> I had heard about
it, and my mind--

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:27.950 align:middle line:90%
I have a very skeptical mind.

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:31.380 align:middle line:84%
So I'm always someone who
wants to experience everything

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:32.880 align:middle line:90%
directly for myself.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And until I do,
it's not real to me.

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:35.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Which I see as a
challenge oftentimes,

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:41.550 align:middle line:84%
and also a great gift, because
I think a lot of people resonate

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:42.350 align:middle line:90%
with that.

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:43.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:49.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And so I had heard about
beings and things like that,

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.980 align:middle line:84%
but I wasn't really
on board with it.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:57.040 align:middle line:84%
I was like, this seems like
people are just making this up.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.393 align:middle line:90%
So I was mentally--

00:11:58.393 --> 00:12:00.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Checked out of the
whole alien thing?

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.477 align:middle line:84%
>> Checked out of
the alien thing.

00:12:01.477 --> 00:12:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And then I had a
friend who was--

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:08.350 align:middle line:84%
but from the experiences that
I've had, I was like, well.

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:09.930 align:middle line:84%
My mind was also
like, it's possible.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:11.830 align:middle line:90%
>> What kind of experiences?

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Experiences of angelic
presences and just divine

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:19.590 align:middle line:84%
intervention, and miracles,
and sensing that there were--

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:22.250 align:middle line:90%


00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:23.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Other forces.

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:24.215 align:middle line:90%
>> Other forces and beings.

00:12:24.215 --> 00:12:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Greater than what our
eyes and what people say.

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:27.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:28.850 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>> And so then--

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:36.080 align:middle line:84%
>> So you sort of got
contacted by angels first?

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:36.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:37.750 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:38.885 align:middle line:90%
>> I experienced angels.

00:12:38.885 --> 00:12:42.370 align:middle line:90%


00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And it was cool when I
first kind of realized

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:49.930 align:middle line:84%
that angels were assisting
me, because I could look back

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:55.510 align:middle line:84%
at previous experiences where
even before I really believed

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:59.650 align:middle line:84%
that there was a
divine presence,

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:04.600 align:middle line:84%
situations where I experienced
a part of me ask for help,

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.600 align:middle line:84%
like out loud, or maybe I was
experiencing a really intense

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.340 align:middle line:84%
emotional state,
and I experienced

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.923 align:middle line:84%
like a part of me asking
for help out loud, which

00:13:11.923 --> 00:13:13.840 align:middle line:84%
didn't make sense to my
mind, because who am I

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.120 align:middle line:90%
asking for help?

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:19.155 align:middle line:84%
>> And then so one example
is coming back to me,

00:13:19.155 --> 00:13:21.280 align:middle line:84%
where I was in that kind
of state, and just crying,

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.390 align:middle line:90%
and crying, and crying.

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:23.320 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know why.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.240 align:middle line:84%
It was like so much
was coming out.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like I
couldn't handle it.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And I felt a part
of me ask for help.

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And then I was kind of laying
in a bed, and I was looking up.

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And I just experienced
just like there

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.760 align:middle line:90%
was some presence above me.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And I was transfixed,
like I kind of

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:49.880 align:middle line:90%
went into a trance state.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And I was just transfixed
by this energy that

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:56.840 align:middle line:84%
felt like it was pulsating
peace through me,

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.780 align:middle line:90%
and just like washed through.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:03.360 align:middle line:84%
>> And I didn't really know
what to make of that experience.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:07.940 align:middle line:84%
But then as I started
to have experiences

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:14.670 align:middle line:84%
that I guess became clearer to
me that they were angels, then

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:16.920 align:middle line:84%
I could look back at things
like that and say, oh, OK.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:21.130 align:middle line:90%


00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:26.170 align:middle line:84%
So the extraterrestrials
beings, I was very resistant to.

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And I had a friend who actually
kept saying, I want to know,

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:32.620 align:middle line:90%
where am from?

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:33.760 align:middle line:90%
Where am I from?

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.680 align:middle line:90%
I feel like I'm not from here.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And I remember going on a
hike one night up in Topanga,

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:41.000 align:middle line:90%
actually close by.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.050 align:middle line:90%
It was a full moon.

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:43.300 align:middle line:90%
And we were sitting on a rock.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And we were practicing
sending each other messages

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:47.680 align:middle line:90%
without speaking.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.800 align:middle line:84%
So I would imagine
a tree, and then I

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.030 align:middle line:90%
would send her that message.

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And she would see what
was coming to her.

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:54.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:57.410 align:middle line:90%
>> And we're pretty good at it.

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:00.160 align:middle line:84%
I was actually better at
receiving than transmitting.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.690 align:middle line:90%
So that was interesting.

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:06.590 align:middle line:84%
But she was saying, I really
want to know where I'm from.

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:07.840 align:middle line:90%
I want to know where I'm from.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.535 align:middle line:84%
And then at some point, she
was just like, you know what?

00:15:10.535 --> 00:15:12.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
completely let go of it.

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.190 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:17.260 align:middle line:84%
Whatever information
is meant to come to me

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:18.880 align:middle line:84%
will come when
it's meant to come.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:22.640 align:middle line:90%


00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.400 align:middle line:84%
We were getting up to leave
at the end of that experience.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, wait,
there's something.

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:28.750 align:middle line:90%
We have to stay for a minute.

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And I got out my
journal and pen.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.910 align:middle line:90%
And this poem just came through.

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And it was a poem to her
about being on Earth.

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:40.090 align:middle line:90%
And it was incredibly beautiful.

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:42.820 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember exactly, but it
was something about her being--

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:46.870 align:middle line:84%
like kind of using the metaphor
of her as like a fire on Earth

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:49.780 align:middle line:84%
and spreading this
energy, and knowing

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:54.370 align:middle line:84%
that home was where she
was, and that she did

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:58.000 align:middle line:90%
carry energy from another place.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.160 align:middle line:90%
And it was really beautiful.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.730 align:middle line:84%
We both just felt
the truth of it.

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And I just knew
it was Pleiadian.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:11.170 align:middle line:84%
That was the first time that I
experienced channeling energy

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:13.590 align:middle line:90%
from another place.

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:14.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:15.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:20.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So Pleiadian's energies, or
at least the guidance to talk

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.705 align:middle line:84%
about the Pleiadians
came through first.

00:16:22.705 --> 00:16:25.300 align:middle line:90%


00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And today we plan to channel
in some Octorian energies.

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:30.760 align:middle line:90%
When did that start?

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:34.420 align:middle line:90%
>> So that started on--

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:38.170 align:middle line:90%


00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:40.810 align:middle line:84%
I started to feel Sedona,
and I didn't know anything

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:44.020 align:middle line:90%
about Sedona.

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:46.300 align:middle line:84%
I just started to get
visions of the desert.

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.760 align:middle line:90%
And I went there.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And while there, I was
still kind of like,

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:55.480 align:middle line:84%
all the alien stuff
is interesting,

00:16:55.480 --> 00:17:05.819 align:middle line:84%
but I wasn't expecting to have
any kind of experience of that.

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:08.430 align:middle line:84%
I really wasn't having
any expectation.

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:10.380 align:middle line:90%
I just was surrendered.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And I was there with
a couple of friends.

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And we were just in a really
blissful, beautiful state,

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:28.630 align:middle line:84%
where we were just
in so much gratitude.

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And we were actually with
another group of people.

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to go somewhere
called Devil's Bridge.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.050 align:middle line:90%
And so we went there.

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:39.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And you went
to Devil's Bridge.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:41.110 align:middle line:90%
You went to Devil's Bridge.

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:42.778 align:middle line:84%
>> Went to the
parking lot of it.

00:17:42.778 --> 00:17:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And we were waiting
for everyone to gather.

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:45.690 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a bit of a hike.

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:46.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And we were waiting for
everyone to gather there.

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And we started to-- we had
heard the name Angel Valley,

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:56.620 align:middle line:84%
but we thought that Angel
Valley was just like a valley

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:59.980 align:middle line:90%
where you go hiking.

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:02.810 align:middle line:84%
But we didn't know
anything about it either.

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And so we're waiting for people
to gather at Devil's Bridge.

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
I just had this feeling

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.140 align:middle line:90%
like, we have to go.

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:13.390 align:middle line:90%
We have to go to Angel Valley.

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:14.473 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at my friend.

00:18:14.473 --> 00:18:16.720 align:middle line:84%
I was like, we have
to go to Angel Valley.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.270 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know why, but we
were just jumping up and down,

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:20.200 align:middle line:90%
like ecstatically.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we have to go
to Angel Valley.

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:23.680 align:middle line:90%
It was just so true.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.000 align:middle line:90%
And we both felt it.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, we looked up.

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:29.860 align:middle line:90%
And we start to see this cloud.

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's like this
angelic presence that

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:36.190 align:middle line:90%
was like manifest as a cloud.

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:37.750 align:middle line:90%
That's what it truly felt like.

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
kind of doing this,

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:46.180 align:middle line:84%
and kind of really
transfixing our attention.

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:51.975 align:middle line:84%
And then it after a
while just dissipated.

00:18:51.975 --> 00:18:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And I continued to look
up where this cloud was.

00:18:56.630 --> 00:19:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And my primary intuitive
sense, especially at the time,

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:05.210 align:middle line:90%
was not visual.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't done psychedelics
and things like that.

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:12.890 align:middle line:90%
So I was looking at this spot.

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And there was this energy moving
into the center like this.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.010 align:middle line:90%
And it was just like pulling me.

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:22.310 align:middle line:84%
It felt like it was pulling
me into another space.

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And I was just going,
I am tripping out.

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.500 align:middle line:90%
What is happening?

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.510 align:middle line:90%
Are you guys experiencing this?

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:30.407 align:middle line:90%
They're like, no.

00:19:30.407 --> 00:19:31.490 align:middle line:90%
>> They weren't seeing it.

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:33.510 align:middle line:90%
>> They weren't seeing it.

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:35.065 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm like, OK.

00:19:35.065 --> 00:19:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And they're kind of like,
all right, we have to go.

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.880 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:38.910 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to Angel Valley.

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:39.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, OK.

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:41.220 align:middle line:90%
So we get in the car.

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:42.020 align:middle line:90%
>> More visitors.

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.770 align:middle line:84%
>> They're like, yeah,
we like this story.

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:44.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:46.640 align:middle line:90%
>> And we get in the car.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.022 align:middle line:84%
And I actually tried
to start driving,

00:19:49.022 --> 00:19:51.230 align:middle line:90%
which is not a good idea.

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:55.520 align:middle line:84%
But I just started to feel
this ecstatic energy coming in.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:20:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And after a minute,
my friend Michael's

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:02.720 align:middle line:90%
like, I need to drive.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.440 align:middle line:90%
You get in the passenger side.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.290 align:middle line:90%
So I get in the passenger side.

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And I just start to
feel it more and more,

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:12.350 align:middle line:84%
like an asymptote in
math, where it's just

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:16.640 align:middle line:84%
like going up, and up, and up
more and more rapidly and more

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:22.117 align:middle line:84%
intensely of just this feeling
of ecstatic energy coming in.

00:20:22.117 --> 00:20:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Something you've
never felt before.

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:27.060 align:middle line:84%
>> I had never felt something
like that, that intense.

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:32.375 align:middle line:84%
And I just started
screaming out the window.

00:20:32.375 --> 00:20:33.750 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
was happening.

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:35.417 align:middle line:84%
I just started screaming
out the window.

00:20:35.417 --> 00:20:37.100 align:middle line:90%
It's real!

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:38.270 align:middle line:90%
It's real!

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt some part of me just
really acknowledged that it was

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:45.918 align:middle line:90%
real.

00:20:45.918 --> 00:20:47.210 align:middle line:90%
>> You didn't know what it was.

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:48.680 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't know what it was.

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:52.430 align:middle line:84%
But I do have to mention
that the night before that--

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:55.950 align:middle line:84%
I had literally only heard
of the Octorians once,

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:57.950 align:middle line:84%
but the night before that,
I went to a gong bath

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:01.950 align:middle line:84%
and I kept hearing inside
of myself, "You're Octorian.

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:02.750 align:middle line:90%
You're Octorian.

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:03.740 align:middle line:90%
You're Octorian."

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:07.910 align:middle line:90%
And I was going, no.

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:09.920 align:middle line:90%
My mind was saying no.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And so when this happened, I had
a flash of a memory from this

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.130 align:middle line:84%
bottle that I had seen
the day before that said,

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:21.950 align:middle line:84%
dear activated one,
blah-blah-blah-blah.

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:27.300 align:middle line:10%
And it was like I got an image
of that phrase, dear activated

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:28.100 align:middle line:10%
one.

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I read
the word activated,

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:35.210 align:middle line:84%
this energy just like
came through my body,

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:38.540 align:middle line:84%
and came shooting
out of my hands.

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And I was just experiencing
that, which was very new to me.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And also, words
started to come out

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:51.110 align:middle line:90%
of my mouth about what to do.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:53.587 align:middle line:90%


00:21:53.587 --> 00:21:55.670 align:middle line:84%
For example, Michael saying,
should we go in here?

00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:58.852 align:middle line:84%
You have to pay or
something to go in?

00:21:58.852 --> 00:22:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And I was like-- it was
like, keep going, keep going.

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:02.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, to go into Angel Valley?

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:02.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:03.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:05.500 align:middle line:84%
>> There was just
guidance coming through.

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:09.920 align:middle line:84%
But again, at that point, I
couldn't even open my eyes.

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.040 align:middle line:90%
I was in a trance.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
what I was saying,

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:17.160 align:middle line:84%
but there was guidance about
the moon and various things.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.060 align:middle line:90%
And so we arrive.

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:21.935 align:middle line:84%
And my friend is pulling
me through the snow.

00:22:21.935 --> 00:22:23.060 align:middle line:90%
There was snow at the time.

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, there was snow.

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:25.400 align:middle line:90%
>> In Sedona.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.020 align:middle line:90%
And we get to this cabin.

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And I sit outside
on the ground, and I

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:35.090 align:middle line:90%
feel them kind of let go of me.

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying, you
can just be here now.

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And I just-- the
first thing I hear

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.910 align:middle line:84%
is my friend coming out
of his cabin saying,

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:49.290 align:middle line:84%
there's a woman who wants to
tell us about the Octorians.

00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:53.190 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just-- we're
all just laughing,

00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:56.940 align:middle line:84%
and can't believe
what's happening.

00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:00.390 align:middle line:84%
And she just basically
tells us that, yes,

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:04.230 align:middle line:84%
that we're in a place
where many of these beings

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:08.040 align:middle line:84%
interact and land, and starts
telling us how the clouds often

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:09.070 align:middle line:90%
bring people there.

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:11.790 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, all right.

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And that was really the point
where, first of all, my mind--

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:18.340 align:middle line:90%


00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:24.040 align:middle line:84%
it was like the tipping point,
where, OK, now this is real.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.090 align:middle line:90%
Now I've experienced it.

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>> You've had the
full 3D experience.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:29.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Had the experience.

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>> The trippy visionary
thing going on.

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:36.070 align:middle line:90%
The clouds.

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, direct experience
of, OK, there's no doubt now.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's not to say that the
mind didn't kick in after that

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:45.250 align:middle line:90%
at times and doubt it.

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:47.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:55.540 align:middle line:84%
>> But that really opened a
whole other level of things

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:59.440 align:middle line:84%
for me, where I started to
experience everything from that

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:03.010 align:middle line:84%
point, where there was
another perspective available,

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:05.710 align:middle line:84%
and another energy
that would come in.

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And shortly
afterwards, I was asked

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:12.260 align:middle line:84%
to do an activation
in Los Angeles.

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And I was actually shown that
Los Angeles is a place that

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:18.340 align:middle line:84%
is being activated,
and that there's

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:22.700 align:middle line:84%
a lot of galactic
activity occurring.

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:27.500 align:middle line:84%
So I started to experience
myself being part of that.

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.190 align:middle line:90%
So it's really been--

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:32.875 align:middle line:84%
that was the opening to
kind of a whole other--

00:24:32.875 --> 00:24:35.115 align:middle line:90%


00:24:35.115 --> 00:24:36.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
the word is for that.

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Operating system.

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:39.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:40.730 align:middle line:90%
>> A way of doing things.

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:47.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Way of doing things,
and realizing that, oh,

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.040 align:middle line:90%
that's part of what I'm--

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.200 align:middle line:84%
that's part of how I'm
being of service here,

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:56.210 align:middle line:84%
is working with these
energies, and that I--

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:59.390 align:middle line:84%
really realizing, having
awareness about myself,

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:03.560 align:middle line:84%
and about why I've felt
certain things about being

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:10.980 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, and how, as you
know, carrying these energies

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.913 align:middle line:90%
and having--

00:25:12.913 --> 00:25:14.580 align:middle line:84%
however you want to
say it, whether it's

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:16.890 align:middle line:84%
past experiences
as these beings,

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:22.500 align:middle line:84%
or simultaneous experiences of
these beings residing there--

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:30.230 align:middle line:84%
that it's a beautiful thing
to reawaken and reactivate

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:35.070 align:middle line:84%
in terms of knowing ourselves
and knowing what exists

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:37.350 align:middle line:90%
within our consciousness.

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:40.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Reconnecting the networks.

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:41.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:46.250 align:middle line:84%
>> So after that, and doing
the activation that you said,

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:48.690 align:middle line:84%
so the Octorians have sort
of been a regular thing

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:49.860 align:middle line:90%
in your life now?

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:50.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it will
be more intensified.

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:56.400 align:middle line:90%
It'll kind of turn on more.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And then sometimes
it will back off.

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:10.730 align:middle line:84%
But what I experience
is often that it's

00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:15.050 align:middle line:84%
almost like serving as an
antenna for this energy

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:17.850 align:middle line:84%
and helping to bring
it to the planet.

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:25.010 align:middle line:84%
So actually like seeding
the energy on the planet

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:25.820 align:middle line:90%
in a sense.

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:28.610 align:middle line:90%
For example, I've found myself--

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:31.975 align:middle line:84%
often, I'm magnetized
to certain places.

00:26:31.975 --> 00:26:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And then I recognize
that there's

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:37.460 align:middle line:84%
like a seeding of energy
happening in that place,

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:45.680 align:middle line:84%
as well as assisting with
others who kind of, in a sense,

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:48.080 align:middle line:84%
have the resonance
with this energy

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:51.110 align:middle line:90%
to reactivate it within them.

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:52.710 align:middle line:90%
>> So yeah.

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:54.445 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what we're
doing here today.

00:26:54.445 --> 00:26:55.245 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:55.245 --> 00:26:57.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Activating and
connecting to that energy.

00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:58.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:00.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Can we start doing
some of that now?

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:01.870 align:middle line:90%
Do you feel pretty good?

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:02.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:03.260 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:04.310 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:27.019 align:middle line:90%
