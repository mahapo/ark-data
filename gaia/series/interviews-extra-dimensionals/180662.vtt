00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:34.610 align:middle line:90%


00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:35.410 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.210 align:middle line:90%
Well, here we are.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.020 align:middle line:90%
We're with Rob Gauthier.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And you channel a couple
of amazing beings.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.830 align:middle line:84%
More than a couple,
I should say.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.330 align:middle line:84%
How about you tell
us about yourself

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.690 align:middle line:84%
and how did you get into this
whole channeling process?

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's a bit of a story.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.630 align:middle line:90%
I always love explaining it.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.760 align:middle line:84%
But first, I was
a kid growing up

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.620 align:middle line:84%
in a family that was
really Christian.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And Christianity was a big,
big part of my life as a child,

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.960 align:middle line:84%
growing up into a
younger teenager.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.600 align:middle line:84%
At about 13, which is the
natural time of rebellion

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.600 align:middle line:84%
for most, I kind of went
through this experience

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.240 align:middle line:84%
where I separated
myself from it.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Growing up, I had
all these questions.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And every time I would ask the
preacher or a person esteemed

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.210 align:middle line:84%
on the board of the
church directors,

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.530 align:middle line:84%
or whoever, just someone
who is knowledgeable,

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.430 align:middle line:84%
they never could really give an
answer that was complete to me.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.490 align:middle line:84%
It always seemed like
it just went back to,

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.390 align:middle line:84%
because the Bible says so, or
because the church says so.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And I had a friend
who would go with me.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And we were both pretty
critical of the whole thing.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.450 align:middle line:84%
So after exploring that, I
kind of did my own thing.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.810 align:middle line:84%
I let science be
a big part of what

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.210 align:middle line:90%
my reality was at that point.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.925 align:middle line:84%
In school, I did pretty
well with science.

00:01:54.925 --> 00:01:55.725 align:middle line:90%
I enjoyed it.

00:01:55.725 --> 00:01:57.670 align:middle line:90%
Earth science, especially.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And going through
that time period,

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.220 align:middle line:84%
I distanced myself more
and more from the church.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.490 align:middle line:84%
After a few years,
I just quit going.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.949 align:middle line:84%
And not to my mother's
liking either.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.290 align:middle line:90%
But we just kept going through.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And after a few years of
just being off and about,

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.700 align:middle line:84%
I started going through a
real, real rebellious stage.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And that was a very
disconnected time in my life.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.720 align:middle line:84%
I hung out with a
lot of people who--

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.640 align:middle line:84%
they did the gang
things in the '90s.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.870 align:middle line:90%
So violence was part of that.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:30.670 align:middle line:90%
Drugs.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.040 align:middle line:84%
All of those things
were a big part.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.760 align:middle line:90%
I started smoking a lot of pot.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.100 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't an expansive things.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.712 align:middle line:90%
It was fun.

00:02:38.712 --> 00:02:39.920 align:middle line:90%
So it was in my destructive--

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.600 align:middle line:90%
>> It was a party thing.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it was.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.070 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.910 align:middle line:84%
Not Native American going
into the woods and--

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:46.960 align:middle line:90%
>> No drumming circle.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.660 align:middle line:84%
>> No drumming circle, calling
in the great spirit bear.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.610 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.560 align:middle line:84%
But there were a lot of bears
there, just the wrong kind.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.240 align:middle line:90%
>> And it was fun.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.800 align:middle line:90%
And it was violent, destructive.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And it was a big
part of my life.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And I went that way until
right around the time

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.140 align:middle line:84%
before I found out my son
was going to be on his way.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And I just kind of quit hanging
out with people a few months

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.640 align:middle line:90%
before then.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.520 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was intuition,
looking back.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.000 align:middle line:90%
>> A big responsibility coming.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Huge.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.160 align:middle line:84%
>> As much as you
had to change your--

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it was the first
time in my life I looked

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.400 align:middle line:84%
at an aspect of something
that wasn't myself.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.140 align:middle line:84%
Everything was
centered around myself.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.060 align:middle line:84%
Even though I had
people who I loved

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.990 align:middle line:84%
and were a part of my life,
up until then, it was just me.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.683 align:middle line:84%
And knowing this
responsibility--

00:03:40.683 --> 00:03:42.100 align:middle line:84%
the moment of
change really didn't

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.960 align:middle line:90%
come till the day he was born.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.650 align:middle line:84%
He was born with a lot
of physical problems.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:48.730 align:middle line:90%
Cerebral palsy.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you know that right
away, right when he was born?

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Not to the extent.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.810 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.340 align:middle line:84%
They told us that
he had problems.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.440 align:middle line:84%
So when he came out, he did
not have any breath on his own.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.940 align:middle line:84%
They had to hook
him up to machines.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.460 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that
there was an issue.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.360 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know the
extent of the issue.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.320 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>> They basically sent us home
and said, here's some medicine.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.000 align:middle line:84%
There's a possibility
he might have seizures.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.710 align:middle line:84%
We've seen some brain
waves that weren't normal.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.420 align:middle line:90%
So they sent me back.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.250 align:middle line:90%
And I took care of him.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't really
know the extent

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.140 align:middle line:84%
of how bad it was
until he started

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.540 align:middle line:84%
missing all the physical
marks, like they'll say,

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.460 align:middle line:84%
at six months, he's
supposed to lift his head,

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.777 align:middle line:90%
and at three months, to do this.

00:04:29.777 --> 00:04:30.860 align:middle line:90%
And he missed all of them.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:31.672 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:04:31.672 --> 00:04:33.130 align:middle line:84%
>> When he was
about two years old,

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.570 align:middle line:90%
we took him back to the doctor.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:35.820 align:middle line:90%
And that's when I really knew.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the depression
in myself really started.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.170 align:middle line:84%
That's when the true
disconnection that I have

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.810 align:middle line:90%
experienced actually happened.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.570 align:middle line:84%
>> You were disconnected--
just the whole experience,

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:52.590 align:middle line:84%
having a son in this state,
it was just hard to cope with?

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:53.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.300 align:middle line:90%
It's the thought of knowing.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.102 align:middle line:84%
And when they tell me,
they don't tell me, hey,

00:04:58.102 --> 00:04:59.060 align:middle line:90%
your son has a problem.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.870 align:middle line:84%
They're like, he
has severe problems.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.100 align:middle line:90%
He'll never walk.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.062 align:middle line:90%
He'll never talk.

00:05:05.062 --> 00:05:06.520 align:middle line:84%
He'll probably be
like a vegetable.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's pretty much how
the doctor explained that.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:09.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Man.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:10.520 align:middle line:90%
Doctors.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.988 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:05:12.988 --> 00:05:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And then I guess,
they always say, well,

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.020 align:middle line:84%
we're trained to tell
you the worst in case.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.260 align:middle line:90%
And that's not a good training.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.183 align:middle line:84%
Well, knowing what we know now
and what we thought, it's bad.

00:05:25.183 --> 00:05:26.600 align:middle line:84%
So it hit me like
a ton of bricks.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:27.780 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>> It was something that I
made myself try to cope with,

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.160 align:middle line:90%
but I could not on my own.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.490 align:middle line:84%
>> I didn't have any
spiritual things in my life.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.150 align:middle line:84%
Before all I could
depend on was pot.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's what helped take the
edge off throughout my whole

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.000 align:middle line:90%
teens and young 20's.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.430 align:middle line:84%
So from the time I found
out that my son's mother was

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.940 align:middle line:84%
pregnant to the time he was
two, I had really pulled away

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.020 align:middle line:90%
from my old lifestyle.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.470 align:middle line:84%
But now I immersed
back in it triplefold.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.140 align:middle line:84%
So it was more disconnection
than I ever experienced.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.550 align:middle line:84%
More-- my mind's going
crazy all the time.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.960 align:middle line:90%
No mental focus whatsoever.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.780 align:middle line:90%
So I go through that.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And it got real bad into the
depths of all sorts of things.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.230 align:middle line:84%
I even got into severe
drug use and pain--

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.180 align:middle line:84%
I started with pain management
for a car crash I got into,

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.170 align:middle line:84%
and it spiraled downhill
to the worst case scenario.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And after that, I spent many
years just kind of existing.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.700 align:middle line:84%
If I didn't get medicine,
I would be sick.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And my life really did
a tilt-a-whirl on me.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was the
worst time of my life.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And about seven
years into it, maybe

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:46.680 align:middle line:84%
less than that, of really bad,
bad disconnection depression,

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.240 align:middle line:84%
I finally started
coming out of it.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And I went through a lot
of steps to get there.

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.070 align:middle line:84%
But the last step
included me actually

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.520 align:middle line:84%
starting to see life again,
and starting to see--

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.590 align:middle line:84%
and this is when I really
honed in on nature,

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.720 align:middle line:90%
and I honed in on the animals.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.180 align:middle line:84%
Before I had pets, but
I never had an animal

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.800 align:middle line:90%
that was connected to me.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.980 align:middle line:84%
I'd never seen it as an equal,
I'd seen it as property.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.950 align:middle line:84%
Those little changes
suddenly creeped in.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.350 align:middle line:84%
And overnight it was just
an amazing difference

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.920 align:middle line:84%
in perception, an amazing
difference in the way I felt.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's when my true
spiritual journey began.

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.590 align:middle line:84%
That's when I really
started diving in.

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:27.270 align:middle line:84%
One thing I always believed--
and science could not quench

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:30.840 align:middle line:84%
my hunger for the desire
of how things started--

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.460 align:middle line:90%
chemically, yes.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.710 align:middle line:84%
Engineering of the
universe, sure.

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.730 align:middle line:84%
But never that god
that I knew was there.

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:38.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.072 align:middle line:84%
>> So that was the one thing I
took into my beginning of this

00:07:41.072 --> 00:07:42.640 align:middle line:90%
spiritual journey, god.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And one thing too--
a lot of the times

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:50.190 align:middle line:84%
during my whole life, UFOs,
ghosts, those two things

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.570 align:middle line:84%
were really something
that my friend and I

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:54.413 align:middle line:90%
had talked about all the time.

00:07:54.413 --> 00:07:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And there was never
an explanation

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.560 align:middle line:84%
from the church or
science for either one.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And the afterlife
thing was always

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.520 align:middle line:90%
something that amazed me.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.070 align:middle line:84%
I'd seen these
psychics on TV who

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:07.750 align:middle line:84%
said I can talk to
spirits in the afterlife.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And I was very, very
skeptical, to say the least.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.740 align:middle line:84%
But some of the things they
would say would be profound.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, that's
a starting point.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.000 align:middle line:90%
Let's look into that.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.450 align:middle line:84%
I found a church that
integrated their desire

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:24.120 align:middle line:84%
to look on the
other side of death,

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.600 align:middle line:84%
so that they could bring
answers from the other side.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.160 align:middle line:90%
And they believe in God.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And they follow a
bit of the Bible

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:33.150 align:middle line:84%
too, which was a comfort
zone, I guess, for me

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:34.809 align:middle line:90%
from my childhood belief.

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:36.150 align:middle line:90%
So I jumped in.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:39.179 align:middle line:84%
And when I went there,
they taught me meditation.

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:40.740 align:middle line:84%
Right off the bat,
I got a reading

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:43.470 align:middle line:84%
from the person, the
deacon, or the pastor,

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:45.670 align:middle line:90%
whatever title he had.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.020 align:middle line:90%
And it was spot on.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:47.820 align:middle line:90%
He didn't know me.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.680 align:middle line:90%
No one from the church knew me.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.200 align:middle line:84%
No one had my social
media profile.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.540 align:middle line:84%
But yet, they told me
things about my son.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And they told me
things about relatives

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.710 align:middle line:90%
that, at first, I had no clue.

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:01.560 align:middle line:84%
But when I went to my
dad, who follows genealogy

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.820 align:middle line:84%
and our family
tree, he said, wow,

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:08.190 align:middle line:84%
this person from six generations
ago had this and this.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:09.430 align:middle line:90%
So it was perfect.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:10.600 align:middle line:90%
>> So it matched up.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Synchronicity.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And it hit me so
hard that he could

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.210 align:middle line:90%
have that kind of information.

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:17.400 align:middle line:84%
That drew a level
of reality to me.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.300 align:middle line:90%
It drew some realness to it.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:20.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, just to back up.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.940 align:middle line:84%
When you said you started
noticing the animals

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.240 align:middle line:84%
or I guess your perspective
on animals had changed,

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.370 align:middle line:84%
was there a specific
event or something

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:30.900 align:middle line:90%
that made that happen?

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:31.920 align:middle line:90%
Or did it just happen?

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>> It was a lot
of little things.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:37.650 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the way my dogs
would come to me, instead

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:38.820 align:middle line:90%
of just kind of--

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.260 align:middle line:84%
they would always come
to get pet or something,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.052 align:middle line:84%
but they would come
and spend time with me.

00:09:42.052 --> 00:09:43.080 align:middle line:90%
Little things like that.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:43.880 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Going out in the woods.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.580 align:middle line:90%
As a younger person, I hunted.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:48.555 align:middle line:90%
It's Michigan culture.

00:09:48.555 --> 00:09:48.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.900 align:middle line:90%
>> I was raised here

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:50.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.380 align:middle line:90%
>> So I hunted all the time.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And the last time I went hunting
was right around that time.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.630 align:middle line:90%
I had a deer right in my sights.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.700 align:middle line:84%
I actually fell
asleep in the woods.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And I woke up, and this
deer is five foot for me.

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:04.663 align:middle line:84%
And I had my gun,
unlocked the trigger,

00:10:04.663 --> 00:10:07.080 align:middle line:84%
put it right on the deer, and
I couldn't pull the trigger.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And after that, I never
went back out in the woods.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:11.340 align:middle line:90%
Those types of things.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.290 align:middle line:90%
Very hard, very big.

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:14.970 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of little
things that led up

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:18.870 align:middle line:84%
to it that really made me
understand what that connection

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:22.950 align:middle line:84%
was a bit more than just
the animal-human perspective

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:26.160 align:middle line:84%
that Christianity, and just
humans in general, believe in.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.150 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.070 align:middle line:84%
I remember you mentioned
before that you

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:34.180 align:middle line:84%
had gotten involved with some
recordings from the Monroe

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:35.020 align:middle line:90%
Institute.

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:39.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Was that before or after
the church experience?

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:42.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, at first,
dealing with the church,

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:47.020 align:middle line:84%
I seen a lot of dogma play
out, a lot of old reminiscence

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.780 align:middle line:84%
of the old church life
that I used to deal with.

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And it reminded me in a bad
way of all the dogma that

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:56.080 align:middle line:84%
comes along with a lot
of organized religion.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.760 align:middle line:90%
So I backed out of it.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.740 align:middle line:90%
And I backed out kind of quick.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.890 align:middle line:84%
One of the big focal
points for the church

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:06.370 align:middle line:84%
was reincarnation versus
not-reincarnating.

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And to me, I thought as
a organized religion,

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.130 align:middle line:84%
it should be very clear on
where the church stands on this.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.260 align:middle line:84%
But there was a lot of
free thinkers, open minds.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.897 align:middle line:84%
It just-- there was too much
strife there, so I backed out.

00:11:17.897 --> 00:11:19.090 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>> After backing out, I actually
started finding a plateau

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:25.480 align:middle line:90%
coming through my meditation.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.310 align:middle line:90%
I would meditate all the time.

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And I kept gaining
more experiences.

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And I finally just kind
of pooped out on it,

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.400 align:middle line:90%
and it just stopped.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.100 align:middle line:84%
After that, I started
looking online.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I found
the Monroe Institute.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.480 align:middle line:90%
I found some binaural stuff.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And then I found
Hemi-Sync, which was

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.235 align:middle line:90%
the biggest and best out there.

00:11:45.235 --> 00:11:46.550 align:middle line:90%
It's what was claimed.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:47.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>> I started the Gateway
Experience course,

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:51.850 align:middle line:90%
which was a six course--

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:56.560 align:middle line:84%
six part per course, and then
six courses of meditation,

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.730 align:middle line:84%
which increased my meditation
ability tremendously.

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.550 align:middle line:84%
This is where all of the astral
projection states come in.

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:06.190 align:middle line:84%
This is where all of the
out of body experiences--

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:10.270 align:middle line:84%
it took my meditation to
such a level beyond anything

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:12.440 align:middle line:84%
I thought was possible
at that point.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.650 align:middle line:84%
I had only used
meditation before to try

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:18.610 align:middle line:84%
to open myself for communication
with spirits, dead humans.

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:19.780 align:middle line:90%
That's all I cared about.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:20.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, you did.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.680 align:middle line:84%
>> That was my intent
in my meditation.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.880 align:middle line:84%
>> When you were in church,
still with the church?

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:25.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:25.570 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:26.620 align:middle line:90%
>> And even after.

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Because they-- is that
something that they said they

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:31.120 align:middle line:84%
were able to contact
with these spirits,

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.787 align:middle line:84%
and that's how they
found out about you?

00:12:32.787 --> 00:12:35.440 align:middle line:84%
Is that what-- what
made the dead spirit?

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.702 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the spirits was what
their church was involved with.

00:12:38.702 --> 00:12:40.660 align:middle line:84%
That was the whole focal
point of their church,

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.450 align:middle line:84%
was to communicate with
people who had died to give

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:45.050 align:middle line:90%
proof of afterlife.

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:47.400 align:middle line:90%
>> And that was important to me.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that wasn't the
only intent for meditation.

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:51.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>> My meditation came because,
like drugs helped pull me out

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:59.500 align:middle line:84%
of pain and suffering, this new
excitement I found whenever I

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.830 align:middle line:84%
would start to go down and
start to feel a little cruddy

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:05.590 align:middle line:84%
or start getting back in
those low points again,

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:07.220 align:middle line:90%
I would use meditation.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And it brought me to a new level
of feeling good, and excited,

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:11.620 align:middle line:90%
and clear.

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And I used it like I used to
use drugs; several times a day,

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.770 align:middle line:90%
as much as I could.

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.570 align:middle line:84%
The quantity, the quality
was important to me.

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:23.050 align:middle line:84%
So I kept using
meditation as a tool

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:26.200 align:middle line:84%
to help alleviate all
that stress and stuff.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:30.550 align:middle line:84%
So that coupled with
the contact of people

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:31.660 align:middle line:90%
who had passed on that.

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Those were the real focus
points of my meditation.

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And the Hemi-Sync took
me above and beyond that.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.877 align:middle line:84%
>> And can you describe
how it did that?

00:13:38.877 --> 00:13:40.960 align:middle line:84%
Or is that something you
have to buy the Hemi-Sync

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:41.760 align:middle line:90%
and go through?

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:42.880 align:middle line:90%
Is there--

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.710 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a several step process.

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:48.850 align:middle line:84%
So the teachings are
just tools to use.

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And the vibration sounds,
basically, they sync up

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:54.680 align:middle line:90%
your hemispheres of the brain.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:55.480 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because binaural
beats and Hemi-Sync,

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:00.910 align:middle line:84%
it's based on the same
concept of different tones

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:01.810 align:middle line:90%
in different ears.

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:02.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:03.030 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And some of them,
and not Hemi-Sync.

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:07.090 align:middle line:90%
I used other ones.

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:09.220 align:middle line:84%
But Hemi-Sync was the one
that gave me technique.

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:10.730 align:middle line:90%
Those teach you techniques.

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:12.700 align:middle line:84%
>> They teach you
healing, out-of-body,

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:15.130 align:middle line:84%
communication with
spirit, all of those.

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And with those, I was
able to jump through.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, the experiences themselves
were so vast, and different

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:24.940 align:middle line:90%
kinds of experiences.

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:27.460 align:middle line:84%
The first day I started, there
was a vibration in my body

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:29.210 align:middle line:90%
I never felt before.

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:30.940 align:middle line:90%
It made my whole body [BUZZING].

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And the chakras were
just high vibrational.

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And those types of
experiences were

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:36.888 align:middle line:90%
what hooked me in right away.

00:14:36.888 --> 00:14:37.688 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:14:37.688 --> 00:14:39.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I was skeptical,
to say the least.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.342 align:middle line:84%
So I started with
my first one saying,

00:14:41.342 --> 00:14:42.550 align:middle line:90%
well, we'll see what it does.

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:43.717 align:middle line:90%
And the first one was a hit.

00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:44.800 align:middle line:90%
So I just kept going.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.778 align:middle line:90%
>> And I went through the--

00:14:46.778 --> 00:14:48.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Money back guarantee
you if you don't like it.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:50.180 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no.

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:52.010 align:middle line:90%
They are just come as you are.

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:55.070 align:middle line:90%
But the experience itself--

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:57.790 align:middle line:84%
normally, I suggest to people,
if you do the Hemi-Sync,

00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:59.840 align:middle line:90%
go through it at your own pace.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.320 align:middle line:84%
But I would suggest no
less than six months,

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.185 align:middle line:84%
no less than a year
to go through all six.

00:15:05.185 --> 00:15:07.060 align:middle line:84%
For me, I jumped through
them in four months.

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:07.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And I thought it
was way too quick.

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:11.610 align:middle line:84%
But everything
happens for a reason.

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:12.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:14.870 align:middle line:90%
>> And it worked out well.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:18.100 align:middle line:10%
>> So that led you into
the channeling state?

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.320 align:middle line:10%
Or did you get to talk
to spirits, I should say?

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.450 align:middle line:10%
>> I never got real contact with
spirits in the way I wanted to.

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>> But my belief system then
was I should be hearing them

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:30.160 align:middle line:84%
in my ears, like
audioclairancy or something.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And that should
be the experience.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:35.420 align:middle line:84%
But I had gotten
pictures or ideas.

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And that really never happened
in the Gateway Experience.

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:40.220 align:middle line:84%
There were times
where I was able--

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:41.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Gateway is the church, or no?

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>> No, Gateway
was the Hemi-Sync.

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:44.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:48.320 align:middle line:84%
>> That part really never gave
me any kind of spirit contact.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.630 align:middle line:84%
Although, I do know
that I was connecting

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:51.920 align:middle line:90%
to different energies.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:55.632 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not aware in the
moment, questioning that.

00:15:55.632 --> 00:15:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And that was something
the church had helped me

00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:00.170 align:middle line:84%
with before, to stop
questioning myself,

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:03.310 align:middle line:84%
because that's a big, big part
of tapping into your intuition.

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:05.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.080 align:middle line:90%
>> So I go through these.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And I get all sorts
of experiences,

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:10.890 align:middle line:84%
out-of-body experiences,
not controlled.

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And I still-- to this
day, I can astral project,

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:15.670 align:middle line:84%
but I can't tell
myself where to go.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:17.540 align:middle line:84%
I can't say, I want
to go down the street

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.760 align:middle line:84%
and hang out in the
bar in spirit form.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:20.770 align:middle line:90%
I can't do that.

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:21.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see.

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:23.370 align:middle line:84%
But you can shoot
out of your body.

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:24.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:25.130 align:middle line:90%
>> And then it just kind of--

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Every time I
connect in channeling,

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:27.960 align:middle line:90%
that's what I'm doing.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.835 align:middle line:84%
>> And then you just--
it just floats around,

00:16:29.835 --> 00:16:32.240 align:middle line:84%
and you're just kind of
observing whatever appears

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:32.510 align:middle line:90%
to you?

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:33.310 align:middle line:90%
Or how does that--

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:35.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I've had
experiences like that.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:38.720 align:middle line:84%
But most of time, it's like
an experience going out

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.440 align:middle line:84%
into a different
environment altogether.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.780 align:middle line:90%
I've experienced other planets.

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:46.460 align:middle line:84%
I've experienced other parts of
reality here, different times.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:49.430 align:middle line:84%
But how I connected
to TReb was different.

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:51.560 align:middle line:84%
I had not had an
out-of-body that

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:57.470 align:middle line:84%
was severely powerful or very,
very deep in meaning to me.

00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And I had a real messed
up night that night.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.320 align:middle line:84%
I watched the Hubble
Deep space thing

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.910 align:middle line:84%
for the first time, the 3D
one that they had on YouTube.

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:06.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:09.859 align:middle line:84%
>> And it touched my heart, but
it kind of made me feel empty,

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:11.530 align:middle line:90%
like I can't go out there.

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.410 align:middle line:90%
I can't be a part of that.

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And it really kind of made
me depressed a little.

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:18.420 align:middle line:90%
So I used a meditation.

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:21.930 align:middle line:84%
In the Hemi-Sync, they go
through steps 1 through 21.

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And I decided one night, well,
why don't I just go past 21.

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And that was that
night of depression.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:28.460 align:middle line:90%
And that's when I met TReb.

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:30.770 align:middle line:90%
And when I met TReb, it was--

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:34.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Steps 1 through 21, and what
do you mean by going past 21?

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:36.890 align:middle line:84%
Do they have actually
steps after 21?

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:37.160 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:37.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:38.880 align:middle line:90%
>> They do 1 through 21.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And basically, when you're
meditating, you're counting.

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:42.620 align:middle line:90%
It's a self-hypnosis.

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:44.090 align:middle line:90%
That's what meditation is.

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:45.530 align:middle line:90%
It's a self-hypnosis.

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And each step that you
take, you go deeper in.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:53.300 align:middle line:84%
So step 1, you're starting
to feel less your body,

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.510 align:middle line:90%
and then it goes on.

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:56.180 align:middle line:90%
So I went past the 21.

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's the maximum of
the Gateway Experience,

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.450 align:middle line:90%
is the 21st--

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:01.830 align:middle line:90%
They call it the 21 state.

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:02.630 align:middle line:90%
>> What's at 21?

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:03.797 align:middle line:90%
Can you reveal what's at 21?

00:18:03.797 --> 00:18:06.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, a 21 state is
basically a full-blown conscious

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:07.640 align:middle line:90%
integration.

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:09.223 align:middle line:84%
You can connect with
your higher self.

00:18:09.223 --> 00:18:10.550 align:middle line:90%
You can leave your body.

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:13.070 align:middle line:84%
At that point, you're at the
deepest level of consciousness

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:13.922 align:middle line:90%
available.

00:18:13.922 --> 00:18:16.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And did you kind of in
your own mind, and say, OK,

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:17.290 align:middle line:90%
we're going 22.

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:18.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And I just-- and it
wasn't even a number.

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:21.350 align:middle line:90%
I didn't go 22, 23.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:22.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:23.890 align:middle line:90%
>> I just went beyond.

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:25.400 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's time to go beyond.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.720 align:middle line:90%
And I did it in the moment--

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.553 align:middle line:90%
>> Through the veil.

00:18:27.553 --> 00:18:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Not deciding
before, in the moment.

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
connected to TReb.

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:31.590 align:middle line:90%
Right then.

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:32.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Now when I'm connecting to
TReb, this is very surreal.

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.252 align:middle line:90%
It's very realistic.

00:18:38.252 --> 00:18:40.460 align:middle line:84%
It's just like me and you
sitting here talking today.

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:41.877 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
first time I'd ever

00:18:41.877 --> 00:18:43.470 align:middle line:90%
left my body in such a fashion.

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:47.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Before when I left my body,
there would be tracers or sound

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:51.000 align:middle line:84%
would be gone, or the images
were blurry, or vibrating.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.860 align:middle line:84%
It was always different,
but never this clear.

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:55.880 align:middle line:90%
I was on a ship.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.610 align:middle line:84%
I know that much now, because
I've been back to those ships

00:18:58.610 --> 00:18:59.410 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:02.150 align:middle line:84%
It was one of the Yit ships,
which is TReb's people.

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And I was sitting there
in a room by myself.

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, through
the door comes TReb.

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And this, it scared
the shit out of me.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:15.260 align:middle line:84%
It was a horribly
menacing being that was--

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.390 align:middle line:84%
you're looking up
to, 7 and 1/2 foot.

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:19.398 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting in this
chair, and I'm instantly

00:19:19.398 --> 00:19:20.690 align:middle line:90%
transported sitting in a chair.

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:24.603 align:middle line:84%
I always joke, it's like a
futuristic space doctor waiting

00:19:24.603 --> 00:19:26.270 align:middle line:84%
room, because you're
just sitting there.

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And there is a sign that
has this writing over here

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.450 align:middle line:90%
to the right.

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:30.920 align:middle line:90%
And it's not written in English.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.260 align:middle line:84%
But after looking at it
long enough, I could tell.

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And it basically says something
to the effect, just sit here

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:38.760 align:middle line:84%
and someone will be with
you soon type thing.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.870 align:middle line:90%
And I laughed about that.

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:41.720 align:middle line:84%
I still-- I don't
know if I made--

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>> You interpreted it.

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:44.860 align:middle line:90%
You interpreted it as sit here.

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:45.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:46.510 align:middle line:90%
>> And I wait.

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And this big gigantic
reptilian, blue green,

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:54.260 align:middle line:84%
gigantic teeth, huge purple
eyes, just comes through.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I'll jump ahead
just for a second.

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:01.620 align:middle line:84%
When I come back, I
think I am insane.

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:03.640 align:middle line:84%
I think something's
wrong with me.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:07.440 align:middle line:84%
I think the Hemi-Sync gave me
a brain aneurysm, or something,

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.045 align:middle line:90%
because this is not real.

00:20:09.045 --> 00:20:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a crazy
psychedelic experience.

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:11.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:11.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Beyond psychedelic

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Beyond anything you
could ingest, entheogens,

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:15.140 align:middle line:90%
any of that.

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:20.210 align:middle line:84%
>> The silver suit, he even wore
a silver robe and gold boots.

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking to
myself, if I were trying

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:26.340 align:middle line:84%
to pull out the cheesiest
space futuristic suit,

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:27.140 align:middle line:90%
what would it be?

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:28.230 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:29.180 align:middle line:90%
And that's what he was wearing.

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:29.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:30.340 align:middle line:90%
>> He comes to me.

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:31.610 align:middle line:90%
And it's this gigantic thing.

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:32.840 align:middle line:90%
And I'm scared.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And I felt my energy
tighten up like a ball.

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And it was very scary for
only a couple of seconds.

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:39.870 align:middle line:90%
And after that, it dissipated.

00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:42.210 align:middle line:90%
I felt this huge sense of love.

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:43.470 align:middle line:90%
I was able to relax.

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:49.230 align:middle line:90%
It was almost like--

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:51.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm trying to think--

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.460 align:middle line:84%
OK, it was almost
like a sedative

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:56.610 align:middle line:84%
at the doctor, that just
relaxed the body and the mind.

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:57.690 align:middle line:90%
And then he came in.

00:20:57.690 --> 00:20:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And he said that
he was connected

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:03.395 align:middle line:84%
to me, that me and him were
connected and supposed to be.

00:21:03.395 --> 00:21:04.770 align:middle line:84%
He told me a lot
of things that I

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:08.190 align:middle line:84%
think I know about reality
aren't necessarily the way.

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:09.570 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot more to it.

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:11.770 align:middle line:84%
He explained different
levels of consciousness.

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:13.350 align:middle line:84%
He explained
different dimensions.

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:13.620 align:middle line:90%
He explained--

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.260 align:middle line:90%
>> All this in this one meeting?

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>> In the first meeting, and
the first time I ever talked

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:18.060 align:middle line:90%
to him.

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:18.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.560 align:middle line:90%
>> And he didn't go detailed.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.345 align:middle line:84%
Now, I didn't have the
terminology either.

00:21:21.345 --> 00:21:22.145 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:22.145 --> 00:21:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>> And the way telepathy
works is that when--

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:28.650 align:middle line:84%
they're using your words
to try to convey a message.

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And you don't necessarily
get words per se.

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.300 align:middle line:84%
It's just kind of
a group thought.

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:34.860 align:middle line:84%
All of this coming
to me at once.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And it was so overwhelming
and so powerful

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:40.410 align:middle line:84%
that it was hard to
remember a lot of the things

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:42.780 align:middle line:84%
that we talked about the
first couple of times.

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:45.460 align:middle line:84%
But the first time, I remember
it like it was yesterday.

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:46.920 align:middle line:90%
It was so clear.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And he explains, it's
not what you think.

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:50.880 align:middle line:90%
All these levels.

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.810 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I'm here.

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:53.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm here for you.

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:55.810 align:middle line:84%
If you want to connect
to me, I'm here.

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:56.610 align:middle line:90%
And I left.

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And now, at this time, when
I started the Hemi-Sync,

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:00.250 align:middle line:90%
I was full-blast.

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:05.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm three times a day meditation
for an hour, an hour 25 each.

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:09.210 align:middle line:84%
Plus using closed-eye technique,
where I'm just turning sounds

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:12.270 align:middle line:84%
into vibrations and energy,
and understanding that.

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:16.250 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a self-taught
technique that I taught myself.

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:18.717 align:middle line:84%
>> It sounds something
like something what I do.

00:22:18.717 --> 00:22:19.800 align:middle line:90%
We'll talk about it later.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:24.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Basically, after learning
these meditations I would

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:26.700 align:middle line:84%
utilize, I was
hooked on meditation.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:30.525 align:middle line:84%
And in my mind, to miss
a day of meditation

00:22:30.525 --> 00:22:33.060 align:middle line:84%
is like missing
breathing oxygen.

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:37.080 align:middle line:84%
But after that, it was
so intense and so odd,

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.622 align:middle line:84%
I skipped meditating for over
four days before I reconnected.

00:22:40.622 --> 00:22:41.830 align:middle line:90%
>> After the TReb experience.

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:42.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And after that point, I
was hesitant to go back.

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:49.887 align:middle line:84%
And I questioned myself
more than I did just

00:22:49.887 --> 00:22:50.970 align:middle line:90%
about any time in my life.

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:52.290 align:middle line:90%
Even more than the--

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:53.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Questioning your sanity.

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:57.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, my sanity, everything.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.730 align:middle line:90%
I had talked to my ex-wife--

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:01.540 align:middle line:90%
she was my wife then-- about it.

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And she said, this meditation
is doing something to you,

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:05.460 align:middle line:90%
probably.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.980 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't worry
too much about it.

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:08.880 align:middle line:90%
You seem lucid.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.350 align:middle line:90%
You seem OK.

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:11.427 align:middle line:90%
So finally--

00:23:11.427 --> 00:23:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And the rest of your life was
getting better at this point,

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:15.270 align:middle line:90%
because of the meditations.

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:16.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes, yes.

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:19.050 align:middle line:84%
By this time, I had already
spent several months

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:22.110 align:middle line:84%
with the church, several months
after the church, meditating.

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:24.060 align:middle line:84%
So my life was really
getting smooth again.

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:28.307 align:middle line:84%
>> And relationships, and
your son, and your viewpoint,

00:23:28.307 --> 00:23:29.640 align:middle line:90%
and all that was getting better.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:30.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:31.330 align:middle line:84%
It was getting a lot
better at that point.

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:31.825 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:23:31.825 --> 00:23:34.720 align:middle line:84%
So you knew the meditations were
working, not in a negative way,

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.940 align:middle line:90%
but in a positive way.

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:36.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:37.230 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And it became so
much a part of me.

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:42.840 align:middle line:84%
I hated to miss those four
days, but I was just so,

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:47.850 align:middle line:84%
so questioning myself, and if
I should keep going with this.

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And it was a big question
mark at that point.

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:52.920 align:middle line:90%
But the question remained.

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.053 align:middle line:90%
Can I do this again?

00:23:54.053 --> 00:23:54.970 align:middle line:90%
Can I meet this being?

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:56.430 align:middle line:90%
Can I ask him questions?

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:59.130 align:middle line:84%
Because I really didn't get a
lot of chance to talk and ask

00:23:59.130 --> 00:23:59.930 align:middle line:90%
questions.

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:02.440 align:middle line:84%
It was more of him saying,
hey, this, this, and this.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Are your ears open?

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:07.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they are open now.

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:10.320 align:middle line:10%
So I go back, and I meditate.

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.820 align:middle line:10%
>> You go through the 21 cycle.

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:11.924 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:24:11.924 --> 00:24:12.232 align:middle line:10%
And I go past them.

00:24:12.232 --> 00:24:13.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Now the 22 cycles.

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:13.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.600 align:middle line:10%
>> So now you know how to
get there through this--

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:16.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Easily now.

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:19.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Through this process.

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:19.930 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:23.550 align:middle line:10%
And the part of me
that was hesitant

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:24.870 align:middle line:10%
said, I'm just going to do it.

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:26.430 align:middle line:10%
And I went past.

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:28.920 align:middle line:10%
I reconnected to him two
or three times after that.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.550 align:middle line:10%
Just basic conversations.

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:31.980 align:middle line:10%
Who are you?

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:34.060 align:middle line:10%
>> And it was just as
visceral as the first one?

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:34.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:35.660 align:middle line:10%
>> Each time?

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:38.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Each one just as vividly
as the last, just as real,

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.770 align:middle line:90%
just as strong.

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Each time it got
a little easier.

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:43.890 align:middle line:84%
But about the fourth
or fifth time--

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:46.890 align:middle line:84%
>> It got easier to get there,
or just the whole experience?

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:49.827 align:middle line:84%
>> On my own sanity, on
my questioning myself,

00:24:49.827 --> 00:24:50.785 align:middle line:90%
it got a little easier.

00:24:50.785 --> 00:24:50.947 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:24:50.947 --> 00:24:51.980 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:53.310 align:middle line:90%
>> It wasn't so jolting.

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:54.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:55.110 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:58.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And it was jolting the
first time, the second, third.

00:24:58.590 --> 00:24:59.760 align:middle line:90%
I go, and I--

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:02.380 align:middle line:84%
the fourth, fifth time
I go, and I ask him,

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.690 align:middle line:90%
how do I know you're real?

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:06.130 align:middle line:84%
How do I know I'm
not going crazy?

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:09.030 align:middle line:84%
How do I know something's
not wrong with my mind?

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:10.942 align:middle line:84%
And he said, talk
to your friend.

00:25:10.942 --> 00:25:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is the same
friend who I grew up with,

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.940 align:middle line:84%
the same friend, Scott,
a dear friend of mine

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:15.960 align:middle line:90%
since we were kids.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:16.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.840 align:middle line:90%
>> How do I know you're real?

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.190 align:middle line:90%
He said, go talk to Scott.

00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And when you do, don't
tell him about me,

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:24.680 align:middle line:90%
just talk to him as your friend.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And there should be something
in there that will help you.

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:29.780 align:middle line:90%
And I go, OK.

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:32.580 align:middle line:84%
No later than a day, my friend
gets a hold of me, and says,

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:35.020 align:middle line:84%
hey, I've got this really
cool UFO documentary

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:35.820 align:middle line:90%
I've been watching.

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:37.160 align:middle line:90%
It's really amazing.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.740 align:middle line:84%
He sends me the link
to it, and I watch it.

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And on that documentary,
they started

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:43.940 align:middle line:90%
talking about channeling.

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:44.835 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:25:44.835 --> 00:25:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>> So you didn't know
about channeling.

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Nothing about channeling.

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.100 align:middle line:84%
I knew about mediumship
from the church.

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:50.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:52.400 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what their
whole deal was,

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:55.550 align:middle line:84%
but I never heard
the term channeling.

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And although I had
seen it in the church--

00:25:57.650 --> 00:25:59.870 align:middle line:84%
people getting messages
directly through them--

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:01.245 align:middle line:84%
I never knew
exactly what it was.

00:26:01.245 --> 00:26:02.045 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:26:02.045 --> 00:26:04.480 align:middle line:84%
>> I just thought that was
that medium's way of bringing

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.480 align:middle line:90%
in the information.

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.100 align:middle line:90%
>> So I watch it.

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And there's-- only out of
the whole hour and a half

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:12.620 align:middle line:84%
documentary, it's like
a five-minute clip.

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And out of that, they
talk about the Law of One,

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:19.310 align:middle line:84%
which was an ET
Contact channeling

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:21.970 align:middle line:84%
from the '80s, the "Law
of One, Ra Material."

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:22.770 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Carla Rueckert and the crew.

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And during that time,
they mentioned that.

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting
there in excitement,

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.770 align:middle line:84%
but not really
knowing anything more

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:35.750 align:middle line:84%
about what I should
be listening for.

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And right at the end of it, this
guy says, this, in my opinion,

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:42.350 align:middle line:84%
is the greatest
channeling out there,

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:46.310 align:middle line:84%
second only to Jane Roberts
and the "Seth Material."

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:47.250 align:middle line:90%
One sentence.

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:49.310 align:middle line:84%
That sentence grabbed me
more than the other five

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:50.320 align:middle line:90%
minutes of talking.

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:52.010 align:middle line:90%
>> So that's what I checked out.

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And now looking
back, I know why,

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:57.440 align:middle line:84%
because the "Ra Material"
was pretty far out there.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Comparatively, the "Seth
Material" was more mainstream.

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:02.690 align:middle line:84%
It was more about
consciousness and evolution

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:05.600 align:middle line:84%
of the soul, which was what
TReb had talked to me about.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.780 align:middle line:90%
So I locked into that.

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:09.350 align:middle line:84%
I looked it up, got
all the audio clips,

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:10.940 align:middle line:90%
downloaded the PDF.

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:12.417 align:middle line:10%
All of these things online.

00:27:12.417 --> 00:27:14.250 align:middle line:10%
>> From "Seth" and "Ra,"
or just the "Seth?"

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:15.320 align:middle line:10%
>> Just the "Seth."

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:18.380 align:middle line:10%
The "Ra Material" was still
out of my scope, off my radar.

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:21.118 align:middle line:10%
>> Even though you've
seen a big purple-eyed--

00:27:21.118 --> 00:27:21.918 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:27:21.918 --> 00:27:26.230 align:middle line:10%
You would think that the
rest would be OK, right?

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:27.780 align:middle line:10%
And I never looked
at it that way.

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:29.550 align:middle line:10%
But I always know
there was a reason.

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:30.350 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:33.950 align:middle line:10%
>> And when I dug in, I
found out what it was.

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:35.840 align:middle line:84%
Seth was saying the
same thing that TReb

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:38.720 align:middle line:84%
said, just in different terms
and different terminology.

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And some of these
terms were new to me.

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And I had to really
kind of focus.

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Some of the words, I had no
idea what they even meant,

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:48.590 align:middle line:84%
but I would go
through, and I studied.

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And what it was,
I am not a reader.

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:51.920 align:middle line:90%
I don't read.

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.190 align:middle line:84%
I listen, like audio
books are my thing.

00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:54.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Same way.

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:56.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm the same way.

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:57.520 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a cognitive thing.

00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:01.163 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been audio-listening
to your book.

00:28:01.163 --> 00:28:02.212 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:28:02.212 --> 00:28:04.670 align:middle line:84%
>> I have it in the PDF format,
and I have it on my iPhone.

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:07.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a process, but
still, I can go through it

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:09.540 align:middle line:90%
much faster by listening to it.

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:11.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, nice.

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:12.620 align:middle line:90%
I need a program like that too.

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:15.660 align:middle line:90%
It's helpful, to say the least.

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:17.880 align:middle line:84%
That's how I retain
that information.

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.730 align:middle line:90%
So I find this one little clip.

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:23.960 align:middle line:84%
It's like an hour
and 50 minutes.

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's excerpts of
"Seth Speaks, the Eternal

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:27.220 align:middle line:90%
Validity of the Soul."

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:29.030 align:middle line:90%
>> It's the clip on YouTube?

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:31.760 align:middle line:84%
>> There's one on YouTube, and
there was one downloadable one

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:34.740 align:middle line:84%
that just had the excerpts
from this guy who enjoyed that.

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:35.540 align:middle line:90%
He read.

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:37.730 align:middle line:90%
And it was professionally done.

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And I listened to it, and it
changed my whole perspective

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:43.380 align:middle line:90%
on a lot of stuff.

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And it was so powerful
and so resonant

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:47.330 align:middle line:84%
with what TReb had
already said to me.

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And when I heard
that, it reconfirmed

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:53.940 align:middle line:84%
that maybe I wasn't making
this stuff up in my head.

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:54.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is something I
never have said publicly before,

00:28:58.010 --> 00:29:00.860 align:middle line:84%
but in that four-day period
where I stayed away from

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:02.780 align:middle line:84%
the meditation and
didn't go back to TReb,

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:05.510 align:middle line:84%
I actually went to the
emergency room and said,

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:07.970 align:middle line:90%
I had this experience.

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:09.440 align:middle line:90%
I might be going crazy.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.370 align:middle line:90%
>> What did they say?

00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:11.360 align:middle line:90%
>> The doctor was cool.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.620 align:middle line:84%
He's like, you're playing around
with those binaural beats.

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:17.030 align:middle line:84%
He goes, meditation,
sometimes, you

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:18.748 align:middle line:84%
go into a lot of
subconscious places.

00:29:18.748 --> 00:29:21.290 align:middle line:84%
He said, you probably just had
some kind of weird experience.

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:22.895 align:middle line:90%
He said, I wouldn't worry about.

00:29:22.895 --> 00:29:23.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:25.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Which gave me relief.

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>> But you go like open the
emergency doors, and say,

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:33.350 align:middle line:84%
I've seen a green,
seven-foot tall, blue eyes.

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:34.510 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:37.480 align:middle line:90%
Gold boots, silver robe.

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:40.012 align:middle line:90%
>> They would have locked me up.

00:29:40.012 --> 00:29:41.970 align:middle line:84%
>> So you didn't go in
that dramatic, that big.

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:43.790 align:middle line:90%
>> No, very lightly.

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>> You just signed
the documents--

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.720 align:middle line:90%
>> What are you here for?

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:51.260 align:middle line:84%
I had an experience I
need to talk to you about.

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:52.290 align:middle line:90%
It was very nice though.

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:53.090 align:middle line:90%
He was cool.

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:53.710 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:54.785 align:middle line:84%
>> If it would have been
a different doctor--

00:29:54.785 --> 00:29:57.120 align:middle line:84%
>> He didn't give you a
shot and strap you to a bed,

00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.745 align:middle line:84%
and hook you up to
a bunch of machines.

00:29:58.745 --> 00:30:00.245 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm sure if I
had another doctor.

00:30:00.245 --> 00:30:02.453 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, if you got that
wrong doctor, you probably--

00:30:02.453 --> 00:30:03.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I would have
been there, yeah.

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing to see how
the mainstream thinks about it.

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:07.490 align:middle line:90%
>> True.

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:10.650 align:middle line:90%
>> But I lucked out, really.

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:13.580 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't luck, but
you know what I mean.

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:15.080 align:middle line:90%
I get done with that.

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:17.210 align:middle line:90%
And I have those experiences.

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And from there, it
just kept going.

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:25.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, most people who have heard
TReb or Aridif on the radio

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:29.210 align:middle line:84%
or on YouTube, they might not
know the whole story about it.

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:32.030 align:middle line:84%
I worked with TReb for two
years in meditative state

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:33.410 align:middle line:90%
before I ever channeled.

00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:36.050 align:middle line:84%
I really had no
interest to channel.

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:37.970 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the two
years, I felt like I

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:39.560 align:middle line:90%
had learned all I could learn.

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:42.830 align:middle line:84%
Of course, being the
human ego, I was like,

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:43.912 align:middle line:90%
I know everything now.

00:30:43.912 --> 00:30:44.870 align:middle line:90%
>> I know the universe.

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:45.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:47.920 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like Keanu
Reeves in the Matrix.

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.003 align:middle line:90%
He's like, I know Kung Fu.

00:30:49.003 --> 00:30:49.803 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:49.803 --> 00:30:50.610 align:middle line:90%
Instantly.

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:51.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that was beautiful.

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:56.180 align:middle line:84%
>> But so after two years,
though, you're like, yeah.

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:57.560 align:middle line:90%
>> I know what I can know.

00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to find out
how to teach it to people.

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:00.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:03.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I thought I was ready
to teach people, and I was.

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:07.580 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that it was
possible to channel.

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:09.740 align:middle line:90%
I'd seen Jane Roberts do it.

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And by that point, I had
looked up Darryl Anka.

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:14.630 align:middle line:84%
I had heard of Kryon,
even though I never

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:18.100 align:middle line:84%
checked out a lot of
that work at that point.

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:20.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'd seen just
a very few others.

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.340 align:middle line:90%
Back when I started doing this--

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Esther Hicks
and Abraham Hicks.

00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:26.502 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd never even heard
of her until I met Kalina.

00:31:26.502 --> 00:31:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Kalina is the one who's like,
have you ever heard of-- who?

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, you
really are a channeler.

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.570 align:middle line:84%
Because so many
channelers are so

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:34.700 align:middle line:84%
oblivious of other
spiritual teachers,

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:36.408 align:middle line:84%
just because they're
in their own groove.

00:31:36.408 --> 00:31:38.250 align:middle line:90%
>> I just did another interview.

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And they-- she was saying
the exact same thing.

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:42.325 align:middle line:84%
I was like bringing
up all these names.

00:31:42.325 --> 00:31:43.790 align:middle line:90%
She was like, ah, I don't know.

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:46.220 align:middle line:84%
The name sounds
familiar, but purposely,

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:48.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't go and see
that stuff, because I

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:51.320 align:middle line:84%
don't want to plagiarize
or say anything that--

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:53.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't want anybody
to think that I'm

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:54.500 align:middle line:90%
copying their material.

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that was a
concern of mine, too.

00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:58.670 align:middle line:84%
When I started to
jump ahead a little,

00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:01.190 align:middle line:84%
when I started channeling,
I cut myself off

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:03.140 align:middle line:90%
from all other channel material.

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:04.150 align:middle line:90%
I said, I want--

00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:06.140 align:middle line:84%
and this was for me,
not for anyone else--

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:08.780 align:middle line:84%
I want to know what's coming
through is legitimate.

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:12.040 align:middle line:84%
I had huge filter
issues in the beginning.

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.980 align:middle line:84%
But to jump back,
I work with TReb.

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:15.230 align:middle line:90%
I told him, I want to channel.

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:16.320 align:middle line:90%
I want to share this.

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.650 align:middle line:84%
But I want you to be
there for the answers,

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:23.000 align:middle line:84%
because there's still stuff
I'm probably not sure of.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And if there is, you
need to be there.

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:28.550 align:middle line:84%
The channeling idea was cool
to me, and we worked with it.

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:32.180 align:middle line:90%
>> So when you said you want--

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:36.320 align:middle line:84%
you asked him to be there, but
in essence, channeling, you're

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:37.550 align:middle line:90%
asking him to come through.

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:38.920 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:41.810 align:middle line:84%
You had that conversation with
him in this meditative state,

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:45.690 align:middle line:84%
which, again, I'm assuming
is still as visceral as ever.

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:46.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:47.323 align:middle line:90%
>> It's still like--

00:32:47.323 --> 00:32:49.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Never a time was dull.

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.330 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:54.200 align:middle line:84%
So it all felt just like we're
having a conversation just now.

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.910 align:middle line:84%
Only you're on a
ship always, or--

00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:56.710 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:58.130 align:middle line:84%
We were everywhere
at that point.

00:32:58.130 --> 00:32:59.300 align:middle line:90%
The first time was a ship.

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And after that, most, like
I'd say probably 75% or more

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:04.940 align:middle line:84%
of the time, I'm with
him on his planet,

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:06.860 align:middle line:84%
just different
parts of the planet.

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:09.640 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I've been
everywhere with him.

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:12.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I know I don't want
to get out of order here,

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:13.760 align:middle line:90%
but what's his planet like?

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:14.130 align:middle line:90%
What is that like?

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:15.047 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it's beautiful.

00:33:15.047 --> 00:33:16.160 align:middle line:90%
It's gorgeous.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.290 align:middle line:84%
When you're looking
up at the sky,

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:20.100 align:middle line:84%
it's a beautiful,
beautiful purple sky.

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:20.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Purple sky?

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:23.600 align:middle line:84%
>> It's hard to explain, too,
because the shade of purple it

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:26.210 align:middle line:84%
is, there really isn't a shade
of purple I found to show

00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:28.710 align:middle line:90%
people, like this is the purple.

00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:30.230 align:middle line:84%
But they have tons
of red plants.

00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:31.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Red plants?

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:32.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Very beautiful green water.

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:33.290 align:middle line:90%
It's gorgeous.

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:34.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Green water?

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:34.556 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:34.556 --> 00:33:35.356 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:35.356 --> 00:33:36.890 align:middle line:90%
So we're talking.

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:38.090 align:middle line:90%
Are all the plants red?

00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:39.770 align:middle line:90%
Do they have green plants?

00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:40.608 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, no, no.

00:33:40.608 --> 00:33:42.400 align:middle line:84%
It's all red, just
different shades of red.

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.390 align:middle line:84%
There are a couple ones
that are different,

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:46.790 align:middle line:84%
like so different in red,
they're almost not red,

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:48.140 align:middle line:90%
like yellows.

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And a couple of them
are purple, but not--

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:52.220 align:middle line:90%
it's like a red-purple.

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:53.150 align:middle line:90%
It's all shaded red.

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:55.275 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if that
has to do with their star,

00:33:55.275 --> 00:33:57.287 align:middle line:84%
or if it has to do
with the actual plants

00:33:57.287 --> 00:33:58.370 align:middle line:90%
the way I can perceive it.

00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>> What about their
dirt and the ground?

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.000 align:middle line:90%
What is that like?

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:01.980 align:middle line:90%
>> I've never seen it.

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:03.200 align:middle line:90%
It's all covered with stuff.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.250 align:middle line:90%
>> It's covered with red leaves.

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:06.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:07.543 align:middle line:90%
Well, just like grass.

00:34:07.543 --> 00:34:08.960 align:middle line:84%
There's a different
kind of grass.

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:10.370 align:middle line:90%
It's more fluffy.

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:11.600 align:middle line:90%
It's like--

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:13.159 align:middle line:90%
>> Moss.

00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:15.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Not like moss, more--

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:17.870 align:middle line:84%
it's-- I can't think
of the plant's name.

00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:21.050 align:middle line:90%
It's stuff that people eat.

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:25.389 align:middle line:84%
It's like a mix of kale
and a dandelion, I think.

00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:27.100 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to explain.

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:28.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Kale and a dandelion.

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:30.120 align:middle line:90%
>> It's fluffy, and it's leafy.

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:30.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Not wheatgrass.

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>> It might be.

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:33.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm not versed on the--

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:35.839 align:middle line:84%
>> On the whole
health food stuff.

00:34:35.839 --> 00:34:36.639 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:37.439 align:middle line:90%
Not yet.

00:34:37.439 --> 00:34:38.449 align:middle line:90%
I'm working on that.

00:34:38.449 --> 00:34:39.260 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:40.060 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:41.540 align:middle line:90%
>> But it's all over the ground.

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:43.820 align:middle line:90%
So you don't see exposed ground.

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:44.989 align:middle line:90%
And I never went digging.

00:34:44.989 --> 00:34:45.980 align:middle line:90%
Every time I'm there--

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:47.179 align:middle line:90%
>> Sprouts.

00:34:47.179 --> 00:34:48.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, sprouts.

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:49.070 align:middle line:90%
That's a good one.

00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:49.639 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:49.639 --> 00:34:50.210 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:51.168 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like that.

00:34:51.168 --> 00:34:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but leafy,
a little leafier.

00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:52.949 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:34:52.949 --> 00:34:53.749 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:53.749 --> 00:34:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:56.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:57.980 align:middle line:84%
It's fascinating,
because I've never

00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:02.960 align:middle line:84%
heard like this, like
you were in that world,

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:07.130 align:middle line:90%
so visceral, and so real.

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:09.140 align:middle line:90%
I didn't understand that's--

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:11.820 align:middle line:84%
I think before we were joking
at the seminar you went fishing

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:12.620 align:middle line:90%
with TReb.

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:15.587 align:middle line:84%
But I'd never thought it
was actually going fishing,

00:35:15.587 --> 00:35:16.670 align:middle line:90%
like we're here at a lake.

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:17.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:18.782 align:middle line:84%
>> It's that real
that you could go--

00:35:18.782 --> 00:35:20.430 align:middle line:90%
>> That real.

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:21.680 align:middle line:90%
>> I wonder what kind of fish?

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:22.790 align:middle line:90%
Did you ever see any fish?

00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:23.590 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:25.310 align:middle line:84%
They do have
underwater life there.

00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:28.010 align:middle line:90%
They have big, big lizards, too.

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:29.920 align:middle line:90%
Go figure.

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:32.190 align:middle line:90%
There are these gigantic--

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:34.040 align:middle line:84%
I'd say probably
about six-foot long.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Like iguanas?

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:38.430 align:middle line:84%
>> They're more-- they're
actually very similar,

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:41.440 align:middle line:84%
TReb said, to their third
den-- or the second density,

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:45.030 align:middle line:84%
their second density life,
which is they kind of look like

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Komodo dragons,
but more upright.

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:50.430 align:middle line:84%
They're really long, really
big, very thick scaling.

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:53.460 align:middle line:84%
They have the same color
skin as TReb's race,

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:55.140 align:middle line:90%
different shades darker though.

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:56.790 align:middle line:84%
More towards like a
forest green-blue,

00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:57.868 align:middle line:90%
if that makes sense.

00:35:57.868 --> 00:35:58.910 align:middle line:90%
>> And you've seen these?

00:35:58.910 --> 00:35:59.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:00.390 align:middle line:90%
I've seen those.

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:03.930 align:middle line:84%
Those are-- the major life
on their planet are those.

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:04.962 align:middle line:90%
>> Birds at all?

00:36:04.962 --> 00:36:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, they've
got flying things.

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:08.562 align:middle line:84%
They've got little
flying things that--

00:36:08.562 --> 00:36:10.020 align:middle line:84%
they don't look
like birds, though.

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.670 align:middle line:90%
They look almost like--

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:12.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Dinosaurish?

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:13.370 align:middle line:90%
Pterodactyls?

00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:15.565 align:middle line:84%
>> No, they're actually
very mammal-looking.

00:36:15.565 --> 00:36:16.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, mammal-looking?

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:17.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:18.830 align:middle line:90%
They're the only things on the--

00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:19.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Bats?

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:20.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Not like a bat, either.

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:21.840 align:middle line:90%
They have wings.

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:24.460 align:middle line:90%
They fly, but they're real boxy.

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:25.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Boxy.

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:26.120 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by boxy?

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:26.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Squared.

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:29.200 align:middle line:84%
They're very squared
in their features.

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:30.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Interesting.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:30.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:30.780 align:middle line:10%
>> Wow.

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:31.480 align:middle line:10%
>> It's different.

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.190 align:middle line:10%
>> This is fascinating.

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:33.940 align:middle line:10%
I feel like we don't
even need to channel.

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:37.470 align:middle line:10%
We can just talk all
day about this world.

00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:40.520 align:middle line:10%
>> There have been some worlds
that I've seen too before.

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:44.050 align:middle line:10%
I have talked to people,
like CGI artists, and said,

00:36:44.050 --> 00:36:46.180 align:middle line:10%
I want to describe this
to you and make it,

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:47.430 align:middle line:10%
but it's such a process.

00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:49.470 align:middle line:10%
And nobody has an
interest in doing it,

00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:53.010 align:middle line:10%
unless there's money
involved with it.

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:55.470 align:middle line:10%
The few people who've
done artwork for us

00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:59.290 align:middle line:10%
usually do the entities that I
channel, like TReb or Aridif.

00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:01.590 align:middle line:10%
Vashta does those, and Eduardo.

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:04.440 align:middle line:10%
But nobody will
do the background.

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:06.970 align:middle line:10%
I've seen some amazing
stuff that way.

00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:10.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think then
when CGI artists--

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:12.090 align:middle line:84%
I used to run a visual
effects company,

00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:15.330 align:middle line:84%
so I know some of these
model makers come out

00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:16.968 align:middle line:90%
with these fascinating designs--

00:37:16.968 --> 00:37:18.510 align:middle line:84%
do you think they're
actually tapping

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:22.620 align:middle line:84%
into some alternate planetary
consciousness out there

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:25.440 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to it being
originally created,

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:30.630 align:middle line:84%
or maybe pieces of different
planetary consciousnesses?

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:33.490 align:middle line:84%
>> I guarantee they're
channeling 90% or more of it.

00:37:33.490 --> 00:37:34.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:38.940 align:middle line:84%
>> They're even-- and it's
something like it's a conundrum

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:42.060 align:middle line:84%
where is it that
everything exists,

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:43.950 align:middle line:84%
or is it that this
universe is so big,

00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:45.810 align:middle line:90%
that it has to exist somewhere?

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:48.653 align:middle line:84%
Or is it just whatever
you think, you create?

00:37:48.653 --> 00:37:50.820 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't really matter,
because what they're doing

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:51.620 align:middle line:90%
is real.

00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:53.662 align:middle line:84%
I've seen some of the
special effects stuff

00:37:53.662 --> 00:37:55.620 align:middle line:84%
that people have done in
movies or video games.

00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:57.037 align:middle line:84%
And it's like,
I've seen something

00:37:57.037 --> 00:38:00.060 align:middle line:84%
almost exactly like that,
or something very similar.

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Enough where you couldn't
notice the difference to someone

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:03.880 align:middle line:90%
who doesn't live there.

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:04.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:04.900 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:07.000 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's truly inspiration.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.940 align:middle line:84%
That imagination part of
us is us tapping into that.

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:10.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:12.210 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:15.930 align:middle line:84%
So you spend two years
going to this world,

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:17.850 align:middle line:90%
having these conversations.

00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's your idea then
to finally talk to TReb

00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:24.880 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, why don't we try
this whole channeling thing?

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:25.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:26.160 align:middle line:90%
>> And what does he say?

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.120 align:middle line:90%
Of course, I'm sure.

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:27.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:28.560 align:middle line:90%
He said, yeah.

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:31.080 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
paths we can take.

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:33.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And did he give you
tips on how to do it?

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:40.015 align:middle line:84%
Or were you, by this time,
versed enough to say,

00:38:40.015 --> 00:38:41.640 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is what
we've got to do, TReb.

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:42.480 align:middle line:90%
How did that work?

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:45.820 align:middle line:84%
>> No, it's actually a
combination of the two.

00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And it was never me going,
hey, I think this will work.

00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:51.150 align:middle line:90%
I went out on the internet.

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:52.830 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, the
internet was great.

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:54.330 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't a lot
of stuff there.

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:57.570 align:middle line:84%
So I searched out
psychic mediums.

00:38:57.570 --> 00:39:01.650 align:middle line:84%
I knew a guy who worked with
the team of "The Law of One

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:05.550 align:middle line:84%
Material," that after "The Law
Of One Material" was written,

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:08.060 align:middle line:84%
he worked closely with
the main channeler there,

00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:09.330 align:middle line:90%
Carla Rueckert.

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:11.160 align:middle line:84%
So I worked with him
and talked to him.

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And he gave me a lot of
really great information.

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:16.920 align:middle line:84%
I had looked up online a
couple of channeling books.

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And now I realize,
probably, some

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:21.810 align:middle line:84%
of the same people
that I'm aware of today

00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:23.560 align:middle line:84%
and just didn't know
was them back then.

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:24.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:25.380 align:middle line:90%
>> And worked with TReb.

00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And TReb helped
me out with a lot.

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And then I just kind of borrowed
a little from everything

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:31.750 align:middle line:90%
until it was perfect.

00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:33.570 align:middle line:90%
And then I found my own mix.

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:37.160 align:middle line:84%
It was a garden variety of
a little bit of everything.

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:38.160 align:middle line:90%
>> What got you through?

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:40.570 align:middle line:84%
What was the catalyst
to bring TReb through?

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:42.810 align:middle line:84%
What was your first channeling
experience, I guess?

00:39:42.810 --> 00:39:47.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, my first channeling
experience, I set up a camera.

00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:51.930 align:middle line:84%
My then wife was there to
kind of monitor me and make

00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:53.910 align:middle line:90%
sure nothing went too crazy.

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:55.620 align:middle line:90%
That was a concern of mine.

00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:57.680 align:middle line:84%
I got this entity
coming in my body.

00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:00.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
loose control or--

00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:02.840 align:middle line:84%
you know, the Christian
part of my mind--

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Hulk out.

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:07.110 align:middle line:84%
You have this big green
alien coming through you.

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:11.190 align:middle line:84%
You might-- did that
ever go through you mind?

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:12.550 align:middle line:10%
>> A little bit of that.

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>> At that point,
I trusted TReb.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.240 align:middle line:84%
I'd come to love him
like a dear friend.

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:20.210 align:middle line:90%
But there's still the unknown.

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Why would this entity come and
choose me out of everybody?

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:25.500 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:28.200 align:middle line:84%
My Christian beliefs tapped
on my shoulder a few times.

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.840 align:middle line:90%
So I wanted to be careful.

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:30.790 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to be good.

00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:34.856 align:middle line:84%
I recorded myself, and it
was amazingly horrible.

00:40:34.856 --> 00:40:36.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazingly horrible.

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:37.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:39.680 align:middle line:84%
Can you describe
amazingly horrible?

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:40.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:42.740 align:middle line:84%
The voice that
people hear TReb now,

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:46.260 align:middle line:84%
even if they go back four
years, it's not the same.

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:47.450 align:middle line:90%
It's a little different.

00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And the accent's the same, the
type of talking that he uses.

00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:56.780 align:middle line:84%
But the inflections
are different.

00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And the yeses are
much more vibrant.

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:01.833 align:middle line:84%
And like when he says,
yes-- that "ye-e-e-s",

00:41:01.833 --> 00:41:03.500 align:middle line:84%
really excited-- that
wasn't there then.

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:08.930 align:middle line:84%
It was very flat and monotone,
and kind of filtery too.

00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:10.100 align:middle line:90%
There was just--

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:12.440 align:middle line:84%
I could tell all of
TReb wasn't getting in.

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:15.540 align:middle line:90%
So I practiced a few more times.

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:18.620 align:middle line:84%
But when you get to know
me, you know about me,

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:20.025 align:middle line:90%
I don't wait for anything.

00:41:20.025 --> 00:41:21.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't wait till
everything's perfect.

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:25.350 align:middle line:84%
I just jump headfirst, fly
by the seat of my pants.

00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:28.640 align:middle line:84%
So I immediately went
to the YouTube waves.

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:30.200 align:middle line:90%
I want to share this.

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And my first channeling
was actually a lot better.

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.290 align:middle line:84%
In the couple of times I
had tried between then,

00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:39.050 align:middle line:84%
I probably only did
maybe 6 to 10 channelings

00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:42.470 align:middle line:84%
between the first one and
the one I put on YouTube.

00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>> And when you describe
6 to 10 channelings,

00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:50.240 align:middle line:84%
or six channelings
or so before you--

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:53.345 align:middle line:84%
and you're recording yourself,
are you asking questions?

00:41:53.345 --> 00:41:54.470 align:middle line:90%
Is it just you in the room?

00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:56.140 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how do you--

00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:57.700 align:middle line:90%
is there somebody else?

00:41:57.700 --> 00:42:00.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, you said your wife-- is
she there to help facilitate?

00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:01.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:03.590 align:middle line:84%
At that point, the
first couple ones

00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:06.080 align:middle line:90%
was just letting TReb talk.

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:07.760 align:middle line:84%
I told him, you
just come through

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:09.260 align:middle line:90%
and say what you want to say.

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:10.520 align:middle line:90%
I'll share something.

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:12.470 align:middle line:10%
If it's usable, we
can put it on YouTube.

00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:13.848 align:middle line:90%
So address people.

00:42:13.848 --> 00:42:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's the first
couple of times.

00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And then after that, my then
wife would ask a few questions.

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.340 align:middle line:90%
I let one of my friends try.

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:24.410 align:middle line:10%
So it was basically trial
and error, just playing

00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:27.020 align:middle line:10%
around the first time.

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:34.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So I guess the
information was still good.

00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:37.005 align:middle line:84%
It was just-- you say
when it was horrible,

00:42:37.005 --> 00:42:38.630 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't the
information was horrible.

00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:39.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:40.370 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:43.670 align:middle line:84%
>> And some of the information
came through a little odd,

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:47.000 align:middle line:84%
just the verbiage
on it was weird.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.790 align:middle line:84%
You could tell it
was like having

00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:52.770 align:middle line:84%
someone who first learned how to
speak English be able to talk.

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:53.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:54.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:54.370 --> 00:42:56.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what
I was wondering.

00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:58.980 align:middle line:84%
And maybe this is a
question for TReb later.

00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:00.230 align:middle line:90%
Does he have to learn English?

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:05.810 align:middle line:84%
Or is it all translated by you
via vibrational translations,

00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:07.280 align:middle line:90%
vibrational frequencies?

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:11.030 align:middle line:84%
>> My best understanding
is that, basically--

00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:14.540 align:middle line:84%
like when I go to channel,
I'm using the same techniques

00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:16.550 align:middle line:84%
in a quicker way
than I used to when

00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:18.870 align:middle line:90%
I would leave my physical body.

00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:21.270 align:middle line:84%
So I'm leaving, and
part of TReb comes in.

00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:24.080 align:middle line:84%
So when he's in, he's
mixing his energy with mine.

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:27.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's running through
my chakra systems,

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:29.510 align:middle line:84%
but also accessing
the brain part.

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And in that brain part is
the whole English language,

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:35.940 align:middle line:84%
my experiences, all
of my personality.

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:38.240 align:middle line:84%
So he has the opportunity
to access that.

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:41.540 align:middle line:84%
So English, it wasn't
that the English was bad,

00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:43.790 align:middle line:84%
because he knew English
by knowing my mind.

00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:45.890 align:middle line:84%
It was the way of
trying to express it.

00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Like Aridif and TReb,
still to this day,

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:50.830 align:middle line:84%
sometimes they might get hung
up on a word, so they'll stop.

00:43:50.830 --> 00:43:51.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:54.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And they'll search
for the word or find one

00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:55.970 align:middle line:84%
that's as compatible
as they can.

00:43:55.970 --> 00:44:01.430 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes when-- like the one
that's most known, Aridif, when

00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:03.830 align:middle line:84%
he says, you must do
this, he's not saying,

00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:05.190 align:middle line:90%
you have to do this.

00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:07.790 align:middle line:84%
He's saying, if you want
what you're desiring,

00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:08.665 align:middle line:90%
this is the best way.

00:44:08.665 --> 00:44:09.465 align:middle line:90%
>> Right

00:44:09.465 --> 00:44:10.730 align:middle line:90%
>> So little things like that.

00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:15.150 align:middle line:84%
But then it was much more
disproportional than it is now.

00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:15.950 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:18.390 align:middle line:84%
So it was more of a
translation glitch--

00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:19.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:23.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Than an actual understanding
of the language or knowing

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:24.020 align:middle line:90%
the language.

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:26.060 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily
what's happening.

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:30.110 align:middle line:84%
It's not like he went and had
to take a course in English 101.

00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>> That would be rough.

00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:32.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.520 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, absolutely.

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:39.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a translational
vibrational thing.

00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:43.790 align:middle line:84%
My vibration at the time,
it wasn't what it is now.

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:45.380 align:middle line:84%
I was learning all
this cool stuff,

00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:47.600 align:middle line:84%
but I hadn't applied
very much of it.

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:50.300 align:middle line:84%
What I did learn
and applied helped.

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:52.875 align:middle line:90%
And it was really six months--

00:44:52.875 --> 00:44:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>> In some way, you're
translating too.

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:56.210 align:middle line:90%
You have to raise your level.

00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:58.010 align:middle line:90%
He has to bring his level down.

00:44:58.010 --> 00:45:01.070 align:middle line:84%
So there has to
be this kind of--

00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:03.830 align:middle line:84%
and then there's a growth,
I'm assuming, since then.

00:45:03.830 --> 00:45:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Like you said,
it's gotten better.

00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:09.993 align:middle line:84%
So you're able to meet
each other's frequencies.

00:45:09.993 --> 00:45:10.910 align:middle line:90%
You're going up there.

00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:12.810 align:middle line:90%
Him coming down here.

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:14.840 align:middle line:84%
So that's evolved
over the years.

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:15.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, absolutely.

00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:18.270 align:middle line:84%
That's the perfect way,
too, to explain that.

00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:22.370 align:middle line:84%
It's something where
it's amalgamation

00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:24.170 align:middle line:90%
of two consciousnesses.

00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's a concerted
effort on both

00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:28.160 align:middle line:90%
of our parts to co-create that.

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:29.408 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't get up to him.

00:45:29.408 --> 00:45:31.200 align:middle line:84%
He could always come
down to me, but I just

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:32.158 align:middle line:90%
couldn't get up to him.

00:45:32.158 --> 00:45:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And the more I channeled,
the more I felt his energy.

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And the more I felt
his energy, the easier

00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:41.730 align:middle line:84%
it was for me to integrate
certain parts of the teachings.

00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And in the teachings, a lot of
the stuff about self-creation,

00:45:46.290 --> 00:45:49.320 align:middle line:84%
relaxing, the way
to perceive reality

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:50.940 align:middle line:90%
started clicking easier.

00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:53.760 align:middle line:84%
So after the first six
months of channeling,

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:55.800 align:middle line:84%
I was 10 times better
than the first one.

00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And in the first
year of channeling,

00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:59.070 align:middle line:90%
I was 10 times better than that.

00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:00.180 align:middle line:90%
And it kept going.

00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's like any
job that any person

00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:05.910 align:middle line:90%
does with their motor skills.

00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:07.720 align:middle line:90%
Muscle memory comes into play.

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is energetic
muscle memory.

00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:11.130 align:middle line:90%
And that's how it's applied.

00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:15.000 align:middle line:84%
It's the more you do and repeat,
the better you are at it.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's why even to this
day, I get better at channeling.

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:18.390 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:21.840 align:middle line:84%
>> This time last year,
channeling was great.

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:22.860 align:middle line:90%
It was smooth.

00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:26.010 align:middle line:84%
People resonated with it, but
now it's a whole new level.

00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And this is why you
see the veterans

00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:30.340 align:middle line:84%
out there who've channeled
their entire life;

00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:32.640 align:middle line:84%
Darryl Anka, and
Nora, and Wendy.

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.740 align:middle line:84%
All those great
channelers, they've

00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:35.775 align:middle line:90%
been doing that forever.

00:46:35.775 --> 00:46:37.647 align:middle line:90%
It's their connection.

00:46:37.647 --> 00:46:39.480 align:middle line:84%
TReb and Aridif actually
have a term for it.

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.340 align:middle line:90%
It's called building a bridge.

00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And each time you
channel, you're

00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:46.740 align:middle line:84%
putting a new peg in, or a new
screw, or a new plate of metal.

00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And the bigger the
piece comes, it's

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:51.060 align:middle line:84%
the bigger realizations
you have in yourself.

00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:54.000 align:middle line:84%
I had points in my channeling
where I didn't learn anything.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I'd listen back
to a session, I was like,

00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:58.860 align:middle line:90%
I already knew that.

00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:02.190 align:middle line:84%
But when I started
really learning things

00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:03.783 align:middle line:84%
about my own life
on my own terms,

00:47:03.783 --> 00:47:05.700 align:middle line:84%
then it would shine
through on the channeling.

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And then it would open
up more synchronicities.

00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't that the
information wasn't new.

00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:13.600 align:middle line:84%
It's just the way I
perceived it was old.

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:17.400 align:middle line:84%
So when I changed my
perceptions and my energy grew,

00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:19.860 align:middle line:84%
that allowed that energy
to come in a lot better

00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:22.560 align:middle line:84%
with understandings
and synchronicities

00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:23.820 align:middle line:90%
to apply itself.

00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:26.760 align:middle line:84%
>> So would that make the
channeling then better, better,

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:29.210 align:middle line:90%
more defined, or in a better--

00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:32.680 align:middle line:90%


00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:33.570 align:middle line:90%
more terminology?

00:47:33.570 --> 00:47:36.212 align:middle line:84%
Or because you were able to
have that perspective on it,

00:47:36.212 --> 00:47:37.920 align:middle line:84%
did you think that
helped the channeling?

00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:39.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:40.470 align:middle line:90%
And that was another thing.

00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:44.760 align:middle line:90%
My English skills have zero.

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:47.040 align:middle line:84%
When I went through
school, I sucked at it.

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:48.570 align:middle line:90%
I could speak English.

00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:49.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Just like me.

00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:50.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's not something
that I was great at.

00:47:52.610 --> 00:47:53.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>> But the more I cared
about how I talked,

00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:58.310 align:middle line:90%
because I realized--

00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:01.230 align:middle line:84%
and Kalina has been my
number one helper in that.

00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:04.073 align:middle line:84%
Every time I throw a
word that doesn't exist

00:48:04.073 --> 00:48:06.240 align:middle line:84%
or one that's mispronounced,
she helps me with that,

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:09.450 align:middle line:84%
because she knows, they need
that too to reflect back on.

00:48:09.450 --> 00:48:10.362 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:48:10.362 --> 00:48:11.820 align:middle line:84%
>> But the more
energy I opened up,

00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:14.490 align:middle line:84%
the more clarity came with
it, the easier it was for them

00:48:14.490 --> 00:48:18.770 align:middle line:84%
to find the translation, not
only of energy, but words.

00:48:18.770 --> 00:48:19.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:24.440 align:middle line:90%
So TReb started coming in.

00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:25.470 align:middle line:90%
And you're checking in.

00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:29.070 align:middle line:84%
Are you still going and doing
your meditations with him

00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:31.230 align:middle line:84%
at the same time
during this process?

00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:33.810 align:middle line:84%
Or is the process of
channeling, is it the same

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:35.820 align:middle line:90%
as going into the meditations?

00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:38.760 align:middle line:84%
Are you trans-channeling,
I guess,

00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:41.070 align:middle line:84%
in a sense where you're--
are you conscious

00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:43.450 align:middle line:84%
of what's happening
during the channel?

00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:45.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, it depends.

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:49.560 align:middle line:84%
There are three types of
channel states that I do.

00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:51.960 align:middle line:84%
All of them are
trans-channeling.

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:54.240 align:middle line:84%
The first and most
common occurrence

00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:56.910 align:middle line:84%
is just like when
I visited TReb.

00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:58.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to visit him.

00:48:58.140 --> 00:48:59.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm there with him astrally.

00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:04.500 align:middle line:84%
I perceive him in real-time,
just as real as we are.

00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:06.420 align:middle line:90%
And that happens the most.

00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And while I'm
channeling down here,

00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:10.778 align:middle line:84%
not conscious of anything
that's being said,

00:49:10.778 --> 00:49:11.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm hanging out with him.

00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:13.295 align:middle line:90%
Going fishing with TReb.

00:49:13.295 --> 00:49:13.507 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:49:13.507 --> 00:49:14.307 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:49:14.307 --> 00:49:16.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And the second level
is the same thing.

00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:17.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm out of my body.

00:49:17.850 --> 00:49:19.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm experiencing something.

00:49:19.410 --> 00:49:22.460 align:middle line:84%
But usually, it's something
that needs to be seen by me.

00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And this can be a lot
of different things.

00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:26.447 align:middle line:90%
TReb showed me time periods.

00:49:26.447 --> 00:49:28.530 align:middle line:84%
He showed me different
planets, different animals,

00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:31.560 align:middle line:84%
different vegetation,
just all sorts of stuff

00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:36.180 align:middle line:84%
that at a later time comes in
for referencing that I need.

00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:38.880 align:middle line:90%
So that happens very seldomly.

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:41.413 align:middle line:84%
>> When you say, come in for
reference, in what sense?

00:49:41.413 --> 00:49:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Like the conversation
we're having here,

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:44.710 align:middle line:84%
and you can
reference that stuff?

00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:45.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:48.240 align:middle line:84%
Like sometimes,
people are like, yeah,

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:50.660 align:middle line:84%
I met this reptilian
being that was so and so.

00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And so I was like, oh,
that's the same one

00:49:52.410 --> 00:49:53.670 align:middle line:90%
that TReb showed me.

00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:56.382 align:middle line:84%
Or I wonder what happened
in this timeline.

00:49:56.382 --> 00:49:57.840 align:middle line:84%
It gives me a better
understanding.

00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:00.390 align:middle line:84%
And I don't understand
what it is in the moment,

00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:03.460 align:middle line:84%
but in reflecting later, I
always get what's going on.

00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:04.260 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:06.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's the second
most common occurrence.

00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And then the last one is where
I'm like in a deep meditative

00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:11.970 align:middle line:84%
state, where everything's
just kind of blacked out,

00:50:11.970 --> 00:50:14.140 align:middle line:84%
sometimes colors,
sometimes things like that.

00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm able to hear what's
going on in the session.

00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:21.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I channel 100 times,
probably 85 to 90 of them

00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:24.060 align:middle line:90%
are me and TReb hanging out.

00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:28.290 align:middle line:84%
All of them, but one of them
would be the deep meditation

00:50:28.290 --> 00:50:30.223 align:middle line:90%
where I'm hearing the session.

00:50:30.223 --> 00:50:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And this only
occurs when there is

00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:34.520 align:middle line:84%
something I really need to hear
in that moment in the session.

00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:36.003 align:middle line:90%
So it very rarely occurs.

00:50:36.003 --> 00:50:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you ever go in and out,
like you're hanging out with

00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:39.980 align:middle line:84%
him, and all of a sudden you
get sucked back into the room?

00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:41.240 align:middle line:90%
>> No, never.

00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:43.100 align:middle line:84%
It's always with
TReb all the time,

00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:45.440 align:middle line:84%
or he's showing me
something, or then.

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And the second most common
one where he's showing me

00:50:48.410 --> 00:50:49.940 align:middle line:90%
something, it's not with him.

00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:52.940 align:middle line:84%
It's me separately by
myself seeing these things.

00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:55.130 align:middle line:90%
So that rarely ever occurs.

00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:58.643 align:middle line:84%
Out of 100 times, maybe 14
times I'll be doing that.

00:50:58.643 --> 00:51:00.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's not very-- and it's
probably less than that,

00:51:00.810 --> 00:51:04.940 align:middle line:84%
but I'm trying to give a scale
for people to understand that.

00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:07.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, do you--

00:51:07.550 --> 00:51:09.400 align:middle line:84%
since starting the
channeling, since having

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:12.440 align:middle line:84%
these conversations with
TReb, the meditations,

00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:15.955 align:middle line:90%
have you become more--

00:51:15.955 --> 00:51:18.080 align:middle line:84%
instead of just applying
these things to your life,

00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:20.330 align:middle line:84%
have you noticed your
own intuitiveness

00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:25.460 align:middle line:84%
or psychic abilities, or
anything else happening

00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:27.420 align:middle line:90%
in these past few years?

00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:28.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:30.240 align:middle line:90%
The integration process.

00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that's fairly new to me.

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:38.480 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing channeling in
the sense of public channeling

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:42.470 align:middle line:90%
since about 2010, late 2010.

00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And in that time,
I was always aware

00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:47.600 align:middle line:84%
that TReb's energy
was around me,

00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:50.120 align:middle line:90%
but it never went past that.

00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:52.790 align:middle line:84%
My life, my intuition
was good, but it

00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:56.450 align:middle line:84%
was no better than where I was
when I first started meditating

00:51:56.450 --> 00:51:58.970 align:middle line:90%
and learning to receive.

00:51:58.970 --> 00:52:00.920 align:middle line:84%
In the last year, year
and a half-- well,

00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:02.630 align:middle line:84%
it's probably closer
to two years now--

00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:05.240 align:middle line:84%
I've actually been more
conscious of TReb and Aridif

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:07.100 align:middle line:90%
as they come through.

00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:11.300 align:middle line:84%
I can hear TReb give me messages
while I'm in the wakened state.

00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:13.160 align:middle line:84%
I feel more of
his consciousness.

00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:18.190 align:middle line:84%
My personality even is more
the style of TReb, where--

00:52:18.190 --> 00:52:21.200 align:middle line:90%
like TReb, he loves everything.

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:22.670 align:middle line:84%
He wants to
experience everything.

00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:24.983 align:middle line:84%
And I find more of
that energy in me.

00:52:24.983 --> 00:52:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And there's always been
a part of that for me.

00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:29.180 align:middle line:84%
I've always enjoyed
enjoying things,

00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:30.590 align:middle line:90%
but to a different extent.

00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:33.620 align:middle line:84%
I could feel that combining
with TReb's energy.

00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:34.970 align:middle line:90%
So it's like an amalgamation.

00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And this goes with
psychic ability.

00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:38.430 align:middle line:90%
It goes with everything.

00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:41.130 align:middle line:84%
There's times where I grab
something and walk it over

00:52:41.130 --> 00:52:41.930 align:middle line:90%
to Kalina.

00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:44.138 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, I was just
going to ask you for that.

00:52:44.138 --> 00:52:46.718 align:middle line:84%
Or things simple like
that, like picking

00:52:46.718 --> 00:52:48.260 align:middle line:84%
a movie that she
had wanted to watch,

00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:50.270 align:middle line:84%
or a song that she
was dying to hear.

00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:51.350 align:middle line:90%
So those things.

00:52:51.350 --> 00:52:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And that shows a great deal
about both of our connection

00:52:53.890 --> 00:52:54.690 align:middle line:90%
too as well.

00:52:54.690 --> 00:53:00.650 align:middle line:10%
But meeting Kalina was probably
one of the energetic shifting

00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:02.750 align:middle line:10%
points on a lot of things.

00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:06.470 align:middle line:84%
When I met Kalina, it's just
the energy shifted so much.

00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:09.110 align:middle line:84%
I finally found a partner
who was on the same journey

00:53:09.110 --> 00:53:10.310 align:middle line:90%
that I was.

00:53:10.310 --> 00:53:12.140 align:middle line:90%
The same excitements.

00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:14.160 align:middle line:84%
She met me through
the work I was doing.

00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:16.790 align:middle line:84%
She was helping me
edit videos and stuff

00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:19.200 align:middle line:84%
as we developed a friendship
for a couple of years.

00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And then as my divorce
happened with my ex-wife, then

00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:24.230 align:middle line:90%
me and her got together.

00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:26.330 align:middle line:90%
And we started a relationship.

00:53:26.330 --> 00:53:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And her excitements
and my excitements,

00:53:28.370 --> 00:53:31.110 align:middle line:84%
because they're on the same
level, we reflect that.

00:53:31.110 --> 00:53:34.370 align:middle line:90%
So our psychic ability helps.

00:53:34.370 --> 00:53:36.480 align:middle line:84%
The efforts of the
work has helped.

00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:38.990 align:middle line:84%
I was just-- when I
first started channeling,

00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:40.400 align:middle line:90%
I was doing it for fun.

00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:43.590 align:middle line:84%
I was doing it for the benefit
of other people, which I still

00:53:43.590 --> 00:53:44.390 align:middle line:90%
am.

00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:46.550 align:middle line:90%
But I had a daytime job.

00:53:46.550 --> 00:53:48.650 align:middle line:84%
I worked that job
10 hours a day.

00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I was going to say, how in
the world could you meditate

00:53:52.310 --> 00:53:55.220 align:middle line:84%
for as long as you did
for the first two years,

00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:58.250 align:middle line:84%
and still maintain a
job, and have a son?

00:53:58.250 --> 00:54:00.360 align:middle line:90%
And that's crazy.

00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:01.430 align:middle line:90%
Did you sleep?

00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the first hour and 25
minutes, that was pretty easy.

00:54:05.090 --> 00:54:07.217 align:middle line:84%
The first one in the
morning before all the kids.

00:54:07.217 --> 00:54:09.050 align:middle line:84%
Because I used to
babysit, so I was at home.

00:54:09.050 --> 00:54:09.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:11.020 align:middle line:90%
>> I could work from home.

00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:13.702 align:middle line:84%
And when these four to
six kids would come over,

00:54:13.702 --> 00:54:16.160 align:middle line:84%
I would be able to meditate
before they got there, and then

00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:18.830 align:middle line:84%
once at lunch time when
I put them all for a nap,

00:54:18.830 --> 00:54:21.110 align:middle line:90%
and once after Jeremy.

00:54:21.110 --> 00:54:24.830 align:middle line:84%
He would get home from school
after the kids would leave.

00:54:24.830 --> 00:54:27.295 align:middle line:84%
And then I would be able to
put him to bed, and then do it.

00:54:27.295 --> 00:54:28.670 align:middle line:84%
>> So you figured
it out somehow.

00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:29.470 align:middle line:90%
>> I did.

00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:33.140 align:middle line:10%
>> You managed to
get those several--

00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:35.060 align:middle line:10%
two to four hours a day?

00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:37.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, three of the
meditations were an hour

00:54:37.610 --> 00:54:38.600 align:middle line:90%
to an hour and 25.

00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:41.713 align:middle line:84%
My closed-eye technique didn't
require me to be anywhere.

00:54:41.713 --> 00:54:43.130 align:middle line:84%
I could still be
present with you.

00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:44.810 align:middle line:84%
Like right now, I'm
closing my eyes.

00:54:44.810 --> 00:54:46.040 align:middle line:90%
I can hear you.

00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:47.680 align:middle line:90%
I can hear Kalina, so I'm OK.

00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And if I didn't need my
eyes, I could literally up

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:54.440 align:middle line:84%
to six to eight hours a day
do the closed-eye technique.

00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:57.350 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I didn't need my eyes,
they were shut all the time.

00:54:57.350 --> 00:54:58.220 align:middle line:90%
I was dedicated.

00:54:58.220 --> 00:54:58.730 align:middle line:90%
I was like--

00:54:58.730 --> 00:54:59.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:54:59.330 --> 00:55:00.160 align:middle line:90%
That's awesome.

00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:00.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:01.000 align:middle line:90%
I was like--

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:01.940 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm taking notes.

00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:03.530 align:middle line:90%
>> An addict for meditation.

00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:03.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>> It was.

00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:06.350 align:middle line:90%
I was addicted to it.

00:55:06.350 --> 00:55:07.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you still meditate then?

00:55:07.810 --> 00:55:10.310 align:middle line:84%
>> The only meditation I need
now is when I connect to TReb.

00:55:10.310 --> 00:55:13.340 align:middle line:84%
I do it so frequently, that
that is my meditation now.

00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:14.330 align:middle line:90%
>> I was going to say--

00:55:14.330 --> 00:55:15.830 align:middle line:84%
because it sounds
like a meditation.

00:55:15.830 --> 00:55:19.244 align:middle line:84%
You're going to this deep--
you're going to another planet.

00:55:19.244 --> 00:55:20.340 align:middle line:90%
Jeez.

00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:21.140 align:middle line:90%
That's awesome.

00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:25.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in all honesty, though,
it's something that I found

00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:26.950 align:middle line:84%
about people in their
spiritual journey.

00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And something that just
recently was brought up

00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:32.540 align:middle line:90%
in a conversation.

00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:34.850 align:middle line:84%
When you reach a certain
point of integrating

00:55:34.850 --> 00:55:38.390 align:middle line:84%
with these beings or integrating
with your higher self, whatever

00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:41.250 align:middle line:84%
it is, when you feel
good about your life

00:55:41.250 --> 00:55:42.740 align:middle line:84%
when you're living
that vibration,

00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:46.110 align:middle line:84%
there's not always as
much need for meditation.

00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:49.460 align:middle line:84%
So when I meditate and connect
my TReb, I'm integrating.

00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:51.780 align:middle line:84%
But during the day now,
I'm integrating, too,

00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:56.000 align:middle line:84%
because I used that meditation
to pull myself out of suffering

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.210 align:middle line:90%
and pain to start with.

00:55:57.210 --> 00:56:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And then I used it
to hone my skills.

00:56:00.350 --> 00:56:01.340 align:middle line:90%
My skills are here.

00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:02.510 align:middle line:90%
They're strong.

00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:04.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't have very much
suffering anymore.

00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:08.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm still human, so a
little bit here and there.

00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:10.520 align:middle line:84%
So now there's not
as much a need.

00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And the time I spend with TReb,
I'm doing this now as a living.

00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:18.150 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm doing it once,
twice, three times a day,

00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:19.760 align:middle line:90%
that's my meditation.

00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:20.780 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:22.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome, awesome, awesome.

00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:26.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, in addition to
TReb, you channel Aridif.

00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:27.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:30.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And recently
I heard Metatron.

00:56:30.110 --> 00:56:32.310 align:middle line:90%
Who else do you channel?

00:56:32.310 --> 00:56:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe we can
get into a little bit

00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:36.720 align:middle line:84%
of what led up to bringing
in these other entities.

00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:37.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's start with Aridif
before we get into anybody

00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:39.480 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:40.280 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Because he's the
other most known.

00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:44.840 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like--
lately, have you

00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:46.660 align:middle line:84%
been channeling
Aridif more than TReb?

00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:47.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Much more.

00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Much more than TReb
even at this point.

00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:53.000 align:middle line:84%
There is a high
resonance for him.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.780 align:middle line:84%
One of my friends
who makes videos,

00:56:56.780 --> 00:57:00.500 align:middle line:84%
he knows that I'm kind of a
modest person in a lot of ways.

00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And he puts up this
thing, "Greatest Channeler

00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:03.462 align:middle line:90%
In The World on YouTube."

00:57:03.462 --> 00:57:06.003 align:middle line:84%
And I said, dude, well,
you didn't even tell me.

00:57:06.003 --> 00:57:07.670 align:middle line:84%
You would have asked
me to take it down.

00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:08.837 align:middle line:90%
I said, no, I wouldn't have.

00:57:08.837 --> 00:57:10.580 align:middle line:90%
But still.

00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:14.960 align:middle line:84%
He said something that
really clicked with me.

00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:18.092 align:middle line:84%
He said the wisdom
and essence of Bashar,

00:57:18.092 --> 00:57:19.550 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of
people know Bashar

00:57:19.550 --> 00:57:24.210 align:middle line:84%
as a very wise high energy
being, and the heart

00:57:24.210 --> 00:57:27.680 align:middle line:84%
center of TReb, which
TReb's a huge love bucket.

00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:28.820 align:middle line:90%
Everybody loves that.

00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And he said, that's
what Aridif encompasses.

00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's why Aridif is his
favorite channeled being.

00:57:34.310 --> 00:57:36.410 align:middle line:84%
So people are dying
for Aridif right now.

00:57:36.410 --> 00:57:38.750 align:middle line:90%
They want to have time with him.

00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:40.640 align:middle line:84%
They want to hear
what he has to say.

00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:42.200 align:middle line:90%
Brilliant, brilliant being.

00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:46.050 align:middle line:84%
He is to TReb what
TReb is to me.

00:57:46.050 --> 00:57:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:57:46.850 --> 00:57:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So like when you look at
me, TReb is like maybe a future

00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:51.242 align:middle line:90%
version of myself.

00:57:51.242 --> 00:57:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And it could be looked at
in a lot of different ways.

00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:54.950 align:middle line:90%
But he's like a guide to me.

00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:57.260 align:middle line:84%
He's a higher density,
higher knowledge

00:57:57.260 --> 00:57:58.350 align:middle line:90%
being that I pull from.

00:57:58.350 --> 00:57:59.150 align:middle line:90%
>> TReb is to you.

00:57:59.150 --> 00:57:59.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:57:59.950 --> 00:58:02.150 align:middle line:84%
TReb, for my
information and energy.

00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:04.150 align:middle line:90%
And TReb does that with Aridif.

00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:05.930 align:middle line:90%
TReb's a fifth density being.

00:58:05.930 --> 00:58:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And Aridif's a
sixth density being.

00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:11.180 align:middle line:84%
So energetically,
it's a higher energy.

00:58:11.180 --> 00:58:12.390 align:middle line:90%
>> And do TReb and Aridif--

00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:13.775 align:middle line:90%
I assume, they do communicate?

00:58:13.775 --> 00:58:14.650 align:middle line:90%
They know each other?

00:58:14.650 --> 00:58:16.283 align:middle line:90%
>> They know each other well.

00:58:16.283 --> 00:58:18.200 align:middle line:84%
I had heard stories about
Aridif before I ever

00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:19.820 align:middle line:90%
connected with him.

00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:22.190 align:middle line:84%
Back when I heard it--
because most of these entities

00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:24.720 align:middle line:84%
don't have names of their
own, they just have energy.

00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:25.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And they give us names,
because we're humans,

00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:29.030 align:middle line:90%
and we need names to identify.

00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:33.860 align:middle line:84%
So TReb would talk about a
being called Deneb Cygnus.

00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's the Deneb,
like the star Deneb,

00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:39.050 align:middle line:84%
and Cygnus, the
constellation of the Swan.

00:58:39.050 --> 00:58:42.382 align:middle line:84%
And he said, this entity
named Deneb Cygnus,

00:58:42.382 --> 00:58:44.090 align:middle line:84%
and then he would tell
a story about him,

00:58:44.090 --> 00:58:46.930 align:middle line:84%
or tell a story about
information that Deneb Cygnus

00:58:46.930 --> 00:58:48.050 align:middle line:90%
had shared with him.

00:58:48.050 --> 00:58:50.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, eventually, I found
out through the book

00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:53.870 align:middle line:84%
that I did about TReb and his
people, that that was Aridif.

00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:55.310 align:middle line:90%
And Aridif gives us that name.

00:58:55.310 --> 00:58:59.242 align:middle line:84%
Aridif used that name with
humans a long time ago.

00:58:59.242 --> 00:59:01.200 align:middle line:84%
Let me-- yeah, and I'm
jumping ahead of myself.

00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:03.240 align:middle line:84%
So let me give a little
introduction to Aridif.

00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:06.897 align:middle line:84%
Aridif is an Ancient
Pleiadian entity,

00:59:06.897 --> 00:59:08.480 align:middle line:84%
but he lives in the
star called Deneb.

00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:11.660 align:middle line:84%
His race moved out
of the Pleiades star

00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:15.480 align:middle line:84%
system, which tens of
thousands of races live there.

00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:18.350 align:middle line:84%
They pulled their race out,
because energetically, they

00:59:18.350 --> 00:59:21.320 align:middle line:84%
needed a different--
he explained it

00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:23.180 align:middle line:90%
as, we needed room to grow.

00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:28.790 align:middle line:84%
But what I think is the
collective consciousness

00:59:28.790 --> 00:59:32.570 align:middle line:84%
of a race is very
similar to a star.

00:59:32.570 --> 00:59:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, that's why they
incorporate so much energy.

00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:38.180 align:middle line:84%
If it's a smaller
collective, it only

00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:39.890 align:middle line:90%
needs a little space to grow.

00:59:39.890 --> 00:59:42.170 align:middle line:84%
But when you have these
huge consciousnesses

00:59:42.170 --> 00:59:45.170 align:middle line:84%
and you have a lot of them,
they need energetic space.

00:59:45.170 --> 00:59:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And that is shown by the
star that they travel around.

00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:51.870 align:middle line:84%
And Deneb is this gigantic,
huge, supermassive,

00:59:51.870 --> 00:59:55.370 align:middle line:84%
like 150 times the
size of our sun.

00:59:55.370 --> 00:59:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's where his
race needed to go,

00:59:57.770 --> 00:59:59.830 align:middle line:90%
because they grew into that.

00:59:59.830 --> 01:00:01.663 align:middle line:10%
They sprung into a huge--

01:00:01.663 --> 01:00:03.080 align:middle line:10%
and when you listen
to Aridif, you

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:08.570 align:middle line:10%
can tell more than just
his sentient energy, more

01:00:08.570 --> 01:00:11.558 align:middle line:10%
than his wisdom, he's
just huge expanded.

01:00:11.558 --> 01:00:13.100 align:middle line:84%
They're at the level
right before you

01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:14.710 align:middle line:84%
leave physical
reality altogether

01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:17.380 align:middle line:84%
and join the
oversoul energy back

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:18.780 align:middle line:90%
in the planetary collective.

01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:20.990 align:middle line:90%
So I mean he's this huge being.

01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:22.670 align:middle line:90%
And now they inhabit this star.

01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:25.212 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of people ask about--

01:00:25.212 --> 01:00:26.670 align:middle line:84%
they don't know
what he looks like.

01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And there's some art out there
of him, and it's beautiful.

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:30.650 align:middle line:90%
Kalina did art too.

01:00:30.650 --> 01:00:32.750 align:middle line:84%
She's been able to see
him too in her mind's eye.

01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:34.970 align:middle line:90%
Never TReb, but Aridif.

01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:38.030 align:middle line:84%
They had a past life where
she had met Aridif when

01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:39.197 align:middle line:90%
he physically came to Earth.

01:00:39.197 --> 01:00:40.072 align:middle line:90%
>> When he was Deneb.

01:00:40.072 --> 01:00:41.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Back in ancient Egypt.

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:42.990 align:middle line:10%
>> When he was known as Deneb?

01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:43.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, no.

01:00:43.790 --> 01:00:46.790 align:middle line:84%
The Aridif name was one
that was known to Earth,

01:00:46.790 --> 01:00:50.370 align:middle line:84%
but TReb never gave me
that identity until later.

01:00:50.370 --> 01:00:53.660 align:middle line:84%
So he was still known as Aridif
when I first heard of him,

01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:58.560 align:middle line:84%
but TReb, for whatever reason,
gave me the Deneb Cygnus name.

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:02.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So back in the Egyptian days,
he was known as Aridif as well?

01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:05.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, he said the name came
from the era and how they knew

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:06.440 align:middle line:90%
him.

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:08.720 align:middle line:84%
So maybe they knew
what star he came from,

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:11.510 align:middle line:84%
and back then they might
have called it Aridif.

01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:12.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see.

01:01:12.350 --> 01:01:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>> I still don't
know the specifics,

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:14.530 align:middle line:90%
but I think that's what it is.

01:01:14.530 --> 01:01:17.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So maybe in Egyptian times,
that's what they called them.

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:17.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:01:17.610 --> 01:01:18.050 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:01:18.050 --> 01:01:19.650 align:middle line:84%
>> And he hung out
with Egyptians.

01:01:19.650 --> 01:01:21.860 align:middle line:84%
He just recently
alluded to the fact

01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:24.770 align:middle line:84%
that he had hung out with
South African tribes,

01:01:24.770 --> 01:01:28.220 align:middle line:84%
that he hung out with
Egyptians, that he hung out

01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:32.050 align:middle line:84%
with Indians, and some
Southern American tribes.

01:01:32.050 --> 01:01:35.930 align:middle line:84%
So he has been on the Earth
manifested as a physical being

01:01:35.930 --> 01:01:39.568 align:middle line:84%
in order to co-create
with Earth before,

01:01:39.568 --> 01:01:41.360 align:middle line:84%
kind of like an energetic
quarantine, where

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:44.090 align:middle line:90%
it was kind of interference.

01:01:44.090 --> 01:01:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's a difficult,
long subject to get into.

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:49.860 align:middle line:84%
But he has co-created
with humans.

01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think that him
understanding humanity

01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:55.100 align:middle line:84%
before he came here, even though
it was a much older version,

01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:59.195 align:middle line:84%
gave him a great opportunity
when he teaches to have

01:01:59.195 --> 01:02:00.770 align:middle line:90%
it really resonate with people.

01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:03.920 align:middle line:84%
Plus the amount of wisdom that
comes out of him is ungodly.

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:05.550 align:middle line:90%
It's just beautiful.

01:02:05.550 --> 01:02:09.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So Aridif used to interact
with the human race back

01:02:09.410 --> 01:02:13.520 align:middle line:84%
in the day; South Africans,
Egyptians, probably more.

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:14.930 align:middle line:90%
But has it been a while then?

01:02:14.930 --> 01:02:17.390 align:middle line:90%
Is this like his--

01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:18.860 align:middle line:84%
he took a break,
and now he's back.

01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And humanity is like, oh,
wow, look at humanity.

01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:22.610 align:middle line:84%
Or has he been
constantly monitoring?

01:02:22.610 --> 01:02:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And do other people
channel Aridif?

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:28.280 align:middle line:84%
>> From what I know,
no one else has.

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Some people said that
his energy is familiar.

01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:33.810 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

01:02:33.810 --> 01:02:36.920 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that
he's been interacting

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:38.870 align:middle line:90%
with humans for a long time.

01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:42.560 align:middle line:84%
It's been thousands of years, he
said, before he's reconnected.

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And even now he's not
physically connecting.

01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:45.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Right now, it's an important
growth time for humans.

01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
hands-on interactions

01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:55.970 align:middle line:84%
are not appreciated
by some of the ETs.

01:02:55.970 --> 01:02:58.070 align:middle line:84%
For instance, type
1 and type 2, this

01:02:58.070 --> 01:03:00.770 align:middle line:84%
is the definition Aridif
and TReb have given.

01:03:00.770 --> 01:03:04.110 align:middle line:84%
Type 1, they'll do it in the
way that TReb and Aridif are.

01:03:04.110 --> 01:03:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Type 1 civilization
or type 1 ET?

01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Type 1 extraterrestrial
kind, energetic kind.

01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:11.970 align:middle line:90%
>> And what is--

01:03:11.970 --> 01:03:16.730 align:middle line:84%
>> A type 1 defined is an entity
who respects the free will

01:03:16.730 --> 01:03:18.510 align:middle line:84%
of all things,
will not interfere.

01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:19.310 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:03:19.310 --> 01:03:22.790 align:middle line:84%
>> And looks above and below
them, energetically speaking.

01:03:22.790 --> 01:03:25.880 align:middle line:84%
They look above them
for inspiration, wisdom,

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:26.870 align:middle line:90%
to incorporate.

01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And then below them to
redistribute that information.

01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:30.962 align:middle line:84%
They see themselves
as a part of one.

01:03:30.962 --> 01:03:31.762 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

01:03:31.762 --> 01:03:33.160 align:middle line:90%
>> A type 2 sees division.

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:37.220 align:middle line:84%
A type 2 being only
looks below them

01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:41.750 align:middle line:84%
for what they can
overpower or oversee.

01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:42.950 align:middle line:90%
They never look above them.

01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:46.430 align:middle line:84%
They look equal or below to
them, energetically speaking.

01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:50.030 align:middle line:84%
They also are not afraid
to interject themselves

01:03:50.030 --> 01:03:53.250 align:middle line:84%
on the behalf of
themselves or others.

01:03:53.250 --> 01:03:56.510 align:middle line:84%
For instance, a lot of
these channeled entities

01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:58.160 align:middle line:84%
that have come out
are talking about,

01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.400 align:middle line:90%
we are going to help you.

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:00.692 align:middle line:90%
We're going to do this for you.

01:04:00.692 --> 01:04:02.240 align:middle line:90%
We're going to do that for you.

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:04.280 align:middle line:90%
They're doing that, because--

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:05.810 align:middle line:90%
some of them with great intent.

01:04:05.810 --> 01:04:07.020 align:middle line:90%
They are like, we love you.

01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:07.820 align:middle line:90%
You're messing up.

01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:08.990 align:middle line:90%
We want to help you.

01:04:08.990 --> 01:04:11.360 align:middle line:84%
But in their mind, they
know better than we do.

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And Aridif and TReb
come from a place

01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:15.980 align:middle line:84%
that you guys manifest what
you want as a collective,

01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:18.260 align:middle line:90%
because that is what you want.

01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And we will respect
your journey.

01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Even if you nuke yourself to
oblivion, we will respect it.

01:04:22.550 --> 01:04:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And we will never
step in the way.

01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Because they know
it's a soul's journey.

01:04:26.650 --> 01:04:29.720 align:middle line:84%
The other entities look at it
as a physical thing, or even

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:33.400 align:middle line:84%
a soul level, just at
a different interval.

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:35.930 align:middle line:84%
So these are the
fundamental differences.

01:04:35.930 --> 01:04:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And back when Aridif did
interact with humans,

01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:41.930 align:middle line:84%
he did it from his
incarnation now,

01:04:41.930 --> 01:04:45.080 align:middle line:84%
but he also has done it
from previous incarnations

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:47.010 align:middle line:90%
of his Denebian race.

01:04:47.010 --> 01:04:48.060 align:middle line:90%
So in that way--

01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Denebian race.

01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:49.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And Ancient Pleiadians
is what we call it,

01:04:51.410 --> 01:04:53.480 align:middle line:84%
because that's how he
introduced themselves.

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:57.020 align:middle line:84%
But Denebian, that's
another term for their race.

01:04:57.020 --> 01:04:58.280 align:middle line:90%
They're from the star Deneb.

01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:01.640 align:middle line:84%
So Denebians are
another term for them.

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:07.310 align:middle line:84%
But they have interacted
from previous incarnations.

01:05:07.310 --> 01:05:09.770 align:middle line:84%
So he dealt with humans
not just in this life,

01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:11.030 align:middle line:90%
but his past lives too.

01:05:11.030 --> 01:05:11.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

01:05:11.850 --> 01:05:12.650 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:05:12.650 --> 01:05:14.870 align:middle line:90%
And the overall message--

01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:18.170 align:middle line:90%
so they're obviously type 1 ETs.

01:05:18.170 --> 01:05:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And their overall message,
if you could sum it up

01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:24.650 align:middle line:90%
in a brief sentence, paragraph.

01:05:24.650 --> 01:05:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>> If I could sum it
up in one sentence,

01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:29.120 align:middle line:90%
it's you create everything.

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And If I could sum it
up in a small paragraph,

01:05:33.490 --> 01:05:36.430 align:middle line:84%
we create that physical
reality around us,

01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:38.390 align:middle line:90%
and every aspect of it.

01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And when we do, we
bring the reflections

01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:46.630 align:middle line:84%
of what's inside of ourselves
to be outside of ourselves

01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:47.590 align:middle line:90%
and to co-create.

01:05:47.590 --> 01:05:50.140 align:middle line:90%
So a lot of people look at it.

01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:53.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, how is Reuben
a projection of Rob?

01:05:53.530 --> 01:05:55.340 align:middle line:90%
Well, it has to be.

01:05:55.340 --> 01:05:57.790 align:middle line:84%
There's you there,
and there's me there.

01:05:57.790 --> 01:06:00.340 align:middle line:84%
But I'm bringing you into
my reality for a reason,

01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:01.360 align:middle line:90%
as you are me.

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:03.850 align:middle line:90%
We're co-creating a reflection.

01:06:03.850 --> 01:06:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And literally, you're
a version that I

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:09.100 align:middle line:90%
projected into my universe.

01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:10.763 align:middle line:84%
But it's very literal
in those terms.

01:06:10.763 --> 01:06:12.430 align:middle line:84%
And people don't look
at it in that way.

01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:14.110 align:middle line:84%
They're like,
figuratively, you create.

01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:15.760 align:middle line:90%
No, literally.

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:17.560 align:middle line:90%
And figuratively.

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:18.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:20.150 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the message.

01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And they explore
all parts of it.

01:06:22.690 --> 01:06:25.900 align:middle line:84%
They give answers for
extraterrestrial things.

01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:28.330 align:middle line:90%
What's going on in our galaxy?

01:06:28.330 --> 01:06:31.600 align:middle line:84%
I've always termed it universal,
or galactic knowledge,

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:33.940 align:middle line:84%
universal knowledge,
what's going on out there.

01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:36.940 align:middle line:90%
And that's an important part.

01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:40.180 align:middle line:84%
The other entities, too,
that I've channeled,

01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:42.760 align:middle line:90%
Nihal, Metatron.

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Metatron would say that
the universal and galactic

01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:48.470 align:middle line:90%
knowledge is not so important.

01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:51.890 align:middle line:84%
What's important is you
growing into who you are.

01:06:51.890 --> 01:06:54.725 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes he talks about
humans distract themselves

01:06:54.725 --> 01:06:57.100 align:middle line:84%
with what's going on out there
when they can't figure out

01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:58.110 align:middle line:90%
what's going on down here.

01:06:58.110 --> 01:06:58.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:00.462 align:middle line:84%
>> A different point of
view, and I respect that.

01:07:00.462 --> 01:07:02.170 align:middle line:90%
And I understand.

01:07:02.170 --> 01:07:07.330 align:middle line:84%
But TReb and Aridif bring us a
perspective that's universal.

01:07:07.330 --> 01:07:10.030 align:middle line:10%
And it gives us our
opportunity to say

01:07:10.030 --> 01:07:13.870 align:middle line:10%
how humans fit in this universal
complex, which is something

01:07:13.870 --> 01:07:15.910 align:middle line:10%
that a lot of
people have strived

01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:17.620 align:middle line:10%
to know their whole lives.

01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:22.010 align:middle line:10%
And it's very easy to see the
human race as a part of it,

01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:24.872 align:middle line:10%
but not how each individual
is a part of first the Earth

01:07:24.872 --> 01:07:26.330 align:middle line:10%
collective, then
the universalness.

01:07:26.330 --> 01:07:27.850 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

01:07:27.850 --> 01:07:30.940 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
Aridif sums up very well.

01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And just you
mentioned the Nihal.

01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:34.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that a collective
consciousness?

01:07:36.610 --> 01:07:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:07:37.410 --> 01:07:39.220 align:middle line:84%
That is a collective
consciousness.

01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:41.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Nihal, a very
interesting story.

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:43.285 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you a bit about them.

01:07:43.285 --> 01:07:46.270 align:middle line:90%
The Nihal are future humans.

01:07:46.270 --> 01:07:50.120 align:middle line:84%
They exist as one of our
timelines in the future.

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:54.700 align:middle line:84%
So it's a probable reality
where we leave Earth.

01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:56.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, not all of us,
but a chunk of us

01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:58.630 align:middle line:84%
leave Earth and
become the Nihal.

01:07:58.630 --> 01:08:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And we evolve into very
short beings, about--

01:08:03.070 --> 01:08:05.940 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember-- three to
four foot, somewhere in there.

01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:08.740 align:middle line:90%
Orange-ish skin, highly psychic.

01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:10.540 align:middle line:90%
And we evolve into that.

01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:13.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, the fun part, the
part where it ties back in,

01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:18.670 align:middle line:84%
the Nihal are the race
who seeded TReb's race.

01:08:18.670 --> 01:08:23.950 align:middle line:84%
So TReb's race was a
byproduct, or a direct product,

01:08:23.950 --> 01:08:28.450 align:middle line:84%
of engineering DNA
from a human being DNA

01:08:28.450 --> 01:08:32.723 align:middle line:84%
and from a second density lizard
being who lived in, I believe,

01:08:32.723 --> 01:08:34.890 align:middle line:84%
the Capellan region, which
is where TReb comes from.

01:08:34.890 --> 01:08:37.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Human or Nihal DNA,
but Nihal being human.

01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:08:38.790 --> 01:08:39.040 align:middle line:90%
Nihal.

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.779 align:middle line:84%
But it is different
than human DNA.

01:08:40.779 --> 01:08:42.575 align:middle line:84%
And that's a good
point you bring up.

01:08:42.575 --> 01:08:43.375 align:middle line:90%
When a race--

01:08:43.375 --> 01:08:45.880 align:middle line:90%
>> It's evolved into what it is.

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:50.590 align:middle line:84%
It's like I've been hearing
of late, that the human DNA

01:08:50.590 --> 01:08:54.490 align:middle line:84%
strand is evolving into
three strands of DNA instead

01:08:54.490 --> 01:08:56.590 align:middle line:90%
of a double helix.

01:08:56.590 --> 01:08:58.479 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
you've heard this.

01:08:58.479 --> 01:09:02.380 align:middle line:84%
But I'm assuming way,
way in the future,

01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:05.810 align:middle line:84%
they might have four
strands, or even--

01:09:05.810 --> 01:09:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, some races are
said to have 12-strand DNA.

01:09:08.830 --> 01:09:12.819 align:middle line:84%
And genetically and
energetically, humans do too.

01:09:12.819 --> 01:09:16.720 align:middle line:84%
We have 12-strand, but only
two are visible and activated

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:18.500 align:middle line:90%
because of our energy.

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:22.479 align:middle line:84%
But even more than that,
the changing of the DNA

01:09:22.479 --> 01:09:26.170 align:middle line:84%
also occurs when one race
leaves their home planet

01:09:26.170 --> 01:09:27.790 align:middle line:90%
and goes to another.

01:09:27.790 --> 01:09:30.359 align:middle line:90%
The planet itself is a being.

01:09:30.359 --> 01:09:32.820 align:middle line:84%
It's a seventh density
collective being.

01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:33.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:36.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And then this race that
comes is also a collective

01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:39.220 align:middle line:84%
of the seventh density with
all the oversouls at the lower

01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:40.600 align:middle line:90%
seventh density.

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:41.620 align:middle line:90%
And then they meet.

01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:43.450 align:middle line:84%
They co-create a
brand new energy.

01:09:43.450 --> 01:09:46.930 align:middle line:84%
So both collectives merge
into one, and the DNA changes.

01:09:46.930 --> 01:09:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's why when the human
race leaves the other planets,

01:09:50.350 --> 01:09:52.779 align:middle line:84%
they change their physical
appearance, because their DNA

01:09:52.779 --> 01:09:53.680 align:middle line:90%
changes.

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Their physical body
adapts to the new merging

01:09:56.620 --> 01:09:58.810 align:middle line:84%
of the collective
planet consciousness

01:09:58.810 --> 01:10:00.580 align:middle line:90%
and their race's consciousness.

01:10:00.580 --> 01:10:02.910 align:middle line:90%
So that's a part of it too.

01:10:02.910 --> 01:10:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we're
getting into the Nihal,

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:09.100 align:middle line:84%
the reason for doing TReb's
race, a lot of people

01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:11.080 align:middle line:84%
are like, well, if we're
evolved, why would we

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:12.007 align:middle line:90%
be messing with DNA?

01:10:12.007 --> 01:10:13.090 align:middle line:90%
We've had that done to us.

01:10:13.090 --> 01:10:15.200 align:middle line:90%
It's not very nice.

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:18.250 align:middle line:84%
There's such a stigma around
negative reptilian energy.

01:10:18.250 --> 01:10:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And it was hinted, not
ever directly said,

01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:22.450 align:middle line:90%
yes, this is the 100% reason.

01:10:22.450 --> 01:10:26.770 align:middle line:84%
But TReb, Aridif, but more so
than that, another entity who

01:10:26.770 --> 01:10:31.642 align:middle line:84%
I channeled in the book about
TReb's race, one of their--

01:10:31.642 --> 01:10:33.350 align:middle line:84%
I think it was the
military, ex-military.

01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>> The woman?

01:10:34.330 --> 01:10:35.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, the woman.

01:10:35.450 --> 01:10:39.800 align:middle line:84%
She said that the reason
that they did that

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:42.980 align:middle line:84%
was so that they could show
the entire galaxy that not

01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:44.450 align:middle line:90%
all reptilians are bad.

01:10:44.450 --> 01:10:47.900 align:middle line:84%
The stigma of Earth,
especially Earth,

01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:50.180 align:middle line:84%
was that reptilians
are negative.

01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:51.770 align:middle line:90%
They will eat your children.

01:10:51.770 --> 01:10:52.580 align:middle line:90%
They'll drug you.

01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:55.383 align:middle line:84%
They'll throw you in a cave,
and put you in their pie.

01:10:55.383 --> 01:10:57.020 align:middle line:90%
>> What is it the--

01:10:57.020 --> 01:11:00.200 align:middle line:84%
David Icke, the queen, and all
of our government officials

01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:01.280 align:middle line:90%
evolved.

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:03.610 align:middle line:84%
Evil reptilians taking
over the planet.

01:11:03.610 --> 01:11:04.750 align:middle line:90%
>> And I get it.

01:11:04.750 --> 01:11:07.630 align:middle line:84%
>> That could--
that's probably true.

01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>> But not every
reptilian has that.

01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:11.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:14.323 align:middle line:84%
>> And TReb-- this is
something I commend TReb for.

01:11:14.323 --> 01:11:16.490 align:middle line:84%
He is one of the very few
channels who have come out

01:11:16.490 --> 01:11:19.615 align:middle line:84%
and said, listen, the
evil reptilians are there.

01:11:19.615 --> 01:11:20.990 align:middle line:84%
This is what
they've done to you.

01:11:20.990 --> 01:11:24.020 align:middle line:84%
This is how they're still
doing things to you.

01:11:24.020 --> 01:11:26.660 align:middle line:84%
But you're focusing on it, and
it's going to keep going on.

01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:29.900 align:middle line:84%
When you pull your focus from it
and start focusing on the power

01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:33.290 align:middle line:84%
you have, then it doesn't-- then
even if they're standing next

01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:37.010 align:middle line:84%
to you slapping people with
whips, they can't touch you.

01:11:37.010 --> 01:11:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Just like Jesus
and the cross.

01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:45.390 align:middle line:84%
It was much-- the
story's go as much

01:11:45.390 --> 01:11:47.570 align:middle line:84%
they were whipping
him and torturing him,

01:11:47.570 --> 01:11:48.720 align:middle line:90%
he didn't feel a thing.

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:49.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
beauty part of it.

01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:53.720 align:middle line:84%
That's something that
TReb brings to us.

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And the Nihal wanted
to show us that.

01:11:55.490 --> 01:11:57.620 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to show us--

01:11:57.620 --> 01:12:00.860 align:middle line:84%
I think it was targeted for
humans, but around the galaxy,

01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:02.660 align:middle line:84%
there's still a stigma
that most reptilians

01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:04.160 align:middle line:84%
are neg-- even if
they've interacted

01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:06.440 align:middle line:90%
with a good reptilian.

01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Humanoids, I think, because
of the damage they've

01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:12.700 align:middle line:84%
had through slavery, the
Anunnaki was half-reptilian,

01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:15.170 align:middle line:84%
the ancient reptilians,
the Earth reptilians.

01:12:15.170 --> 01:12:17.450 align:middle line:84%
Those are all bad
stories for humans.

01:12:17.450 --> 01:12:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of built
in our DNA to fear them.

01:12:21.410 --> 01:12:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And people, like David Icke,
who've research just that part

01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:27.560 align:middle line:84%
of it and shared it, it
scares the crap out of people.

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:31.490 align:middle line:84%
>> It continues
to feed into that.

01:12:31.490 --> 01:12:33.918 align:middle line:84%
Well, over the next
couple of days,

01:12:33.918 --> 01:12:35.210 align:middle line:90%
let's get into some channeling.

01:12:35.210 --> 01:12:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And I'd love to talk to TReb and
Aridif and explore their world

01:12:39.190 --> 01:12:39.990 align:middle line:90%
some more.

01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:43.070 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for sharing
your adventures.

01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:44.285 align:middle line:90%
>> You're absolutely welcome.

01:12:44.285 --> 01:12:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And we'll see
some more of you.

01:12:45.870 --> 01:12:46.670 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

01:12:46.670 --> 01:12:47.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks, Rob.

01:12:47.470 --> 01:12:49.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:51.940 align:middle line:84%
- (SINGING) The other
cells taking over.

01:12:51.940 --> 01:13:02.955 align:middle line:90%
