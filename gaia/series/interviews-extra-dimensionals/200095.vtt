00:00:02.934 --> 00:00:05.379 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:21.503 align:middle line:90%


00:00:21.503 --> 00:00:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Why is this a
picture language?

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.880 align:middle line:84%
Why is it all, in a
way, just painted space?

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.650 align:middle line:10%
It really is trying to say,
I want you to walk the mind.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.450 align:middle line:10%
Do you know?

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.740 align:middle line:10%
And this is when we see
ancient sites, the labyrinth,

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.970 align:middle line:10%
it was to say, this
isn't for you personally.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.980 align:middle line:10%
It's for you humanly.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.960 align:middle line:10%
Because this is your
deeper patterned nature.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.430 align:middle line:10%
That's why what is astounding
in terms of the patterned nature

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.330 align:middle line:10%
here is this painting of mine,
which I created as a card--

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.250 align:middle line:10%
we can see this-- as
a card for my book--

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.220 align:middle line:10%
I'll pull this up--

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.870 align:middle line:10%
on the Tarot.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.080 align:middle line:84%
We look up and
see Phoenix arise.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And I completed this in
1997 after about four years,

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.830 align:middle line:90%
and was very happy with it.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.560 align:middle line:84%
Had no idea it had
any other properties,

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.580 align:middle line:84%
but it's going to
help us understand,

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.070 align:middle line:84%
really the mathematical,
symbolical structure

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.150 align:middle line:90%
of the nature of our story.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.685 align:middle line:84%
And like life, I don't think
one could ever figure out this.

00:01:23.685 --> 00:01:25.440 align:middle line:90%
This is the outcome.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.540 align:middle line:84%
You'd say from going
like this to this,

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.510 align:middle line:84%
from the bud to the blossom, is
incomprehensible for the bud.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:31.810 align:middle line:90%
But this is what happened.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.675 align:middle line:84%
We begin with this
question of, who am I?

00:01:34.675 --> 00:01:36.495 align:middle line:84%
But to do this, we're
going to journey,

00:01:36.495 --> 00:01:39.600 align:middle line:84%
do you see, through the
time of the ancestors.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.310 align:middle line:84%
We're going to slow
down the question of,

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.560 align:middle line:90%
what does it mean to be human?

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to ask it
in all of its traditions,

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.280 align:middle line:84%
because we are going
to blossom finally

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.210 align:middle line:84%
through the mother, a unique
womb, a unique identity.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.220 align:middle line:84%
That's why this is
painted on linoleum,

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.470 align:middle line:90%
meaning through the ordinary.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.240 align:middle line:84%
But the fascinating
thing is, well, this

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.910 align:middle line:84%
is a nine-inch grid pattern
the tile are created by.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.920 align:middle line:84%
So we have a perfect
mathematical matrix supporting

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.170 align:middle line:90%
this journey of the phoenix.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.759 align:middle line:84%
This will show us
these blossoms.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.120 align:middle line:84%
But we will also begin to
journey on this bridge,

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.660 align:middle line:84%
do you see,
reconnecting us back.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And as we'll look
here, do you see Gaia?

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.520 align:middle line:90%
She is quite beautiful.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>> But you think of, again, this
willingness to be born to Gaia,

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.800 align:middle line:84%
to be children of the Earth
that came from the stars,

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.460 align:middle line:84%
to finally be home as human,
no longer seeking to leave

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.880 align:middle line:84%
or return, but to finally,
do you see, be here.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we'll
look down onto the floor.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And we'll see even
how this story begins

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.990 align:middle line:84%
to show us this double womb of
the eye of Ra and of the child,

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.740 align:middle line:90%
the mother and child.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Because we think of this
as the maternal womb

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.480 align:middle line:90%
and the eternal womb.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Again, the knowledge
of the eternal,

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.670 align:middle line:84%
the heron, the
mother, the unique.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.945 align:middle line:90%
And all of this is trying to--

00:03:00.945 --> 00:03:04.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm convinced-- bring us
back into the picture.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.840 align:middle line:84%
Like if you come here
and put your hand here,

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.452 align:middle line:84%
you start to see this story
of the human hand, not just

00:03:11.452 --> 00:03:12.550 align:middle line:90%
your hand.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.900 align:middle line:84%
You see the story of the
gift of life, the apple,

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.290 align:middle line:84%
and of the serpent,
and of the chalice,

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.320 align:middle line:84%
and actually who
visited as well.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.040 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.130 align:middle line:90%
Do you see it?

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.710 align:middle line:84%
They're going to say we
bring all of these stories

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.500 align:middle line:84%
together, all of
them, so that when

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.850 align:middle line:84%
you put your human
hand here, note that it

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.050 align:middle line:90%
is the gift of all humanity.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.850 align:middle line:90%
It's not personal.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:35.750 align:middle line:90%
It's that quality.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:36.667 align:middle line:90%
And look what happens.

00:03:36.667 --> 00:03:40.820 align:middle line:84%
As we raise this, we
raise up through her.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.992 align:middle line:90%
Into the phoenix arise.

00:03:42.992 --> 00:03:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And we see that we are
born of all of this,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.574 align:middle line:84%
and that's the gift
of the phoenix.

00:03:48.574 --> 00:04:17.769 align:middle line:90%


00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So with this series that
was my investigation into these

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.010 align:middle line:84%
different races, and trying to
interview all these different

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.020 align:middle line:84%
people having these experiences
was to pick as many of these

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.460 align:middle line:84%
flavors, these different
races, get them on camera,

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.920 align:middle line:90%
ask the questions.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.210 align:middle line:84%
I try to be neutral
in my presentation.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.330 align:middle line:90%
>> That's wise.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.472 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the
archetypal underpinning.

00:04:45.472 --> 00:04:46.550 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.050 align:middle line:84%
You never know how someone's
filtering what you're saying.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.510 align:middle line:84%
So of course, this whole entire
series is through my lens,

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.730 align:middle line:84%
through my experiences
and my exploration

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.000 align:middle line:90%
into this wacky world of ETs.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.600 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.052 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:05:01.052 --> 00:05:02.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Which has led me here now.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.723 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:02.723 --> 00:05:03.650 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:04.223 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:04.223 --> 00:05:05.070 align:middle line:90%
Lighten up.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.028 align:middle line:90%
It's not enlightenment.

00:05:06.028 --> 00:05:08.640 align:middle line:90%
It's lighten up.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And personally, I'm noticing
I resonate with this zeta

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.810 align:middle line:90%
serious--

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.750 align:middle line:84%
the Pleiadian message
as well, but I'm

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.380 align:middle line:84%
finding my personal connection
to what I resonate with,

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.810 align:middle line:84%
I love logic, I
love science, and I

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.290 align:middle line:84%
love to analyze
in this masculine,

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.313 align:middle line:84%
sort of let's categorize
it, and put it into this,

00:05:34.313 --> 00:05:35.730 align:middle line:84%
and make it as
simple as possible,

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.350 align:middle line:90%
and get straight to the point.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And emotions are great, but
let's get to the juice here.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>> That's my personal
direction and path.

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.620 align:middle line:84%
But I'm also finding
now, well, wait a minute.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.780 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole
other audience here

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:59.445 align:middle line:84%
that really loves the softer
stuff, the not so refined, not

00:05:59.445 --> 00:06:00.245 align:middle line:90%
so direct--

00:06:00.245 --> 00:06:03.520 align:middle line:90%


00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to offend any of
my audience, but the airy fairy.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.660 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.170 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And so with that said, I
guess where I'm trying to go

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:21.240 align:middle line:84%
is, you seem to have this
vast knowledge of all these

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.530 align:middle line:90%
different archetypes.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.530 align:middle line:84%
Is there a personal preference
or a personal leaning

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.500 align:middle line:84%
towards a specific teaching,
or a specific idea,

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.530 align:middle line:90%
a specific archetype?

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.610 align:middle line:90%
Which archetypes in the deck?

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.460 align:middle line:84%
>> What is intriguing was that,
not expecting to do the Tarot--

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.990 align:middle line:84%
and as I said, it became
a 17-year journey, saga,

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.300 align:middle line:84%
and it mentored me-- was I
encountered archetypes that

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.430 align:middle line:84%
actually said, what
are you doing here?

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.440 align:middle line:84%
Essentially that they
were very surprised

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.390 align:middle line:90%
that I had knocked on that door.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:49.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And I rather feel that that's
what a lot of this was about,

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.650 align:middle line:84%
the unexpected
knocking on the door,

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.770 align:middle line:84%
meaning the question
not asked finally asked,

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.622 align:middle line:84%
and then the quality saying,
now we can come forward.

00:07:01.622 --> 00:07:03.330 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
things that I realized

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:08.100 align:middle line:84%
the initiating of the agreement
was, ah, you're curious.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.480 align:middle line:90%
Let us have a relationship.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.605 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a walk together.

00:07:11.605 --> 00:07:12.605 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I mean?

00:07:12.605 --> 00:07:14.640 align:middle line:84%
If you think more of
developing a character,

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.460 align:middle line:84%
an embodiment rather, to
actually feel how this feels,

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.328 align:middle line:84%
not to have it an optical like
an audience looking at a film.

00:07:20.328 --> 00:07:21.870 align:middle line:84%
That's why I think
a lot of this work

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.300 align:middle line:84%
is so essential, because
it is about embodiment.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.660 align:middle line:84%
It's not about looking at
the optics, and discussing.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.240 align:middle line:84%
It's understanding that
these registers exist

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.970 align:middle line:84%
in us simultaneously in
the same way the bass notes

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.840 align:middle line:84%
and the treble notes
on the piano exist.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.690 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
archetypes are teaching.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think the more
we can make overlays

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.620 align:middle line:84%
the more we can see,
because esotericism,

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:46.320 align:middle line:84%
occultism is all based in
the laws of correspondence

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.120 align:middle line:90%
and analogy.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:47.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:52.070 align:middle line:84%
>> And so you think about
everything as how are we doing

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.870 align:middle line:90%
what we're doing?

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:53.787 align:middle line:90%
We're finding analogy.

00:07:53.787 --> 00:07:55.310 align:middle line:90%
We're finding context.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And that allows
these other qualities

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.030 align:middle line:90%
to reconstitute themselves.

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:02.220 align:middle line:84%
In a way we've been
studying notes.

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And the notes are
saying, but we're music.

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think many
of us are starting

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:10.390 align:middle line:84%
to understand that people
prefer different musical styles,

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:11.190 align:middle line:90%
in a way.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:12.648 align:middle line:84%
Some of them will
be rock and roll.

00:08:12.648 --> 00:08:13.910 align:middle line:90%
Some of it will be classical.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that's what
these other consciousness,

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:18.810 align:middle line:84%
this other quality wants,
to finally free us.

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:20.820 align:middle line:90%
That in a sense it's not.

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:24.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think that's the
humor of why I inadvertently

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:26.850 align:middle line:84%
created a painting
called "Mothership

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Revelations in Pink," as
if to say that we've always

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.299 align:middle line:84%
been in the black
and white of things.

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:34.679 align:middle line:84%
It's always what
side are you on?

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:36.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm the hero and
you're the villain.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.270 align:middle line:84%
But that sense of, no,
we're rising into a time

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:41.159 align:middle line:90%
where you can't be angry.

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:43.559 align:middle line:84%
We're moving back
into a place where we

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:45.950 align:middle line:90%
are residing with one another.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is about
star knowledge as well.

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.400 align:middle line:84%
If you use one system
against another,

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.200 align:middle line:84%
you miss the point
of all of them.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:52.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:53.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Think of them as elders that
show up and say, listen,

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.990 align:middle line:90%
I gave you my books.

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:00.070 align:middle line:90%
They gave you their books.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:01.470 align:middle line:90%
What a generous gift.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:05.370 align:middle line:84%
Cause we couldn't, in a way,
escape, like the clones,

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.110 align:middle line:90%
our own context.

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:09.810 align:middle line:84%
So we all came
together to create

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:14.190 align:middle line:84%
a vehicle that finally could
include us, but be free of us

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:15.450 align:middle line:90%
to find itself.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:16.640 align:middle line:90%
Now, that is a great gift.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.440 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:17.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:19.268 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's a great
responsibility,

00:09:19.268 --> 00:09:21.548 align:middle line:84%
because it becomes a
parent really with a child,

00:09:21.548 --> 00:09:23.090 align:middle line:84%
and the child growing
up and saying--

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:26.210 align:middle line:84%
and the parent having backed
off a long time ago going,

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:30.410 align:middle line:84%
the course of having no
course has been, in a way,

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:34.040 align:middle line:84%
this journey to finally lead you
to this moment that does teach

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.670 align:middle line:84%
you that a flower doesn't
destroy its infrastructure when

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:39.590 align:middle line:90%
it's blossoming.

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:42.320 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, a birth
is a very aggressive,

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.801 align:middle line:84%
a very difficult thing,
a very messy thing.

00:09:44.801 --> 00:09:45.601 align:middle line:90%
>> Can be.

00:09:45.601 --> 00:09:45.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.028 align:middle line:84%
>> And I feel like that's
what this is trying to say,

00:09:48.028 --> 00:09:50.010 align:middle line:84%
that birth is also
involved with--

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:52.010 align:middle line:84%
that we don't leave the
womb because we want to.

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:53.610 align:middle line:90%
It becomes toxic.

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.030 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, we're
expelled from one condition.

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:58.370 align:middle line:84%
But in the birth,
we take a breath

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:01.640 align:middle line:90%
and realize, oh, I can't return.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.930 align:middle line:90%
But I will set in motion.

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
think a lot of this

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.200 align:middle line:84%
is about a seed time,
of finally bringing

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.660 align:middle line:84%
that force back into
the center of oneself,

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.330 align:middle line:84%
to not convince those
who aren't interested,

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:17.832 align:middle line:84%
but to refocus the
power of those that are.

00:10:17.832 --> 00:10:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I think
that with your audience,

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:21.800 align:middle line:84%
it's not to say who's
right or who has the best.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.080 align:middle line:84%
It's more a storyteller
saying, listen,

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.470 align:middle line:90%
the mystery is a love affair.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:31.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's who's going to tell
it in a way for that group

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.150 align:middle line:84%
makes them go, oh, that makes
me feel a sense of wonder.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:34.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:35.162 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you know?

00:10:35.162 --> 00:10:36.710 align:middle line:90%
And it frees them to breathe.

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And then others go, but
I need the gravitas.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.900 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that scares the
begeebers out of me.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.135 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like we're taking
on like actors in a play

00:10:45.135 --> 00:10:47.510 align:middle line:84%
these different qualities of
a greater consciousness that

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:50.330 align:middle line:84%
says, honor that each of you
are holding a different part

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.400 align:middle line:90%
of these star qualities.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's not one
against the other,

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.720 align:middle line:84%
but going back to our
roots, which was the greater

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.360 align:middle line:90%
generosity of all of them.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:05.072 align:middle line:84%
>> So going with that, so this
was during this journey when I

00:11:05.072 --> 00:11:07.160 align:middle line:90%
was exploring these races.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:13.010 align:middle line:84%
One of my difficult times was
to explore this reptilian race.

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:17.440 align:middle line:84%
We had this projection that
the reptilians, the Draconians

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:21.890 align:middle line:90%
are evil, and they're going to--

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.015 align:middle line:90%
>> We like to say decisive.

00:11:23.015 --> 00:11:23.815 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:23.815 --> 00:11:24.730 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:27.697 align:middle line:84%
Suck your blood,
and they're going

00:11:27.697 --> 00:11:29.030 align:middle line:90%
to take over and all this stuff.

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:30.363 align:middle line:84%
>> And one like reaches
up and goes, ooh.

00:11:30.363 --> 00:11:31.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:38.390 align:middle line:84%
So my exploration into that,
I had some personal growth

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:42.240 align:middle line:84%
I had to go through to sort
of get rid of that projection.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.040 align:middle line:90%
Not get rid of it.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:48.530 align:middle line:84%
Transmute that projection into
knowing that these dark forces

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:49.330 align:middle line:90%
have the purpose.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:50.130 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:51.680 align:middle line:84%
The evil character
has the purpose.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:51.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:52.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And they acknowledged these
higher level versions of these

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:59.750 align:middle line:84%
that are coming through
people and channeling,

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.770 align:middle line:90%
and having that conversation.

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.980 align:middle line:84%
They're very firm, and
they're very warrior like.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:10.290 align:middle line:90%
But there's a respect level.

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is moving into our next
phase of what is the reptilian?

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:16.640 align:middle line:90%
What is the alpha Draconian?

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.120 align:middle line:84%
What is this idea
of consciousness

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.510 align:middle line:90%
that those beings?

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:25.700 align:middle line:84%
And this sort of ties into
the serpent a little bit,

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.070 align:middle line:90%
the dragon, and these things.

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:33.610 align:middle line:84%
But if you're afraid, they're
going to come after you.

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:41.320 align:middle line:84%
But if you are in inquisitive,
or you treat them with respect

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:45.430 align:middle line:84%
and understand that their
purpose is for our evolution,

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:47.940 align:middle line:84%
then they can look
back at you and say,

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:50.052 align:middle line:90%
yeah, you're opening that door.

00:12:50.052 --> 00:12:52.260 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like what you
were doing with this Tarot

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.968 align:middle line:84%
and knocking on those
doors, that maybe--

00:12:53.968 --> 00:12:54.768 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:54.768 --> 00:12:55.840 align:middle line:90%
You're paying attention.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:56.990 align:middle line:90%
>> You're honoring.

00:12:56.990 --> 00:13:01.570 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you were knocking
on those Tarot doors,

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:02.950 align:middle line:90%
how was that?

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:06.140 align:middle line:84%
How did they treat you
when you started inquiring?

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>> They were extraordinary
journeys, all of them.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And I really would
come full circle

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:14.000 align:middle line:84%
back to when I finished it that
the devil archetype came to me.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:14.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And the devil is the
master of manifest reality,

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.530 align:middle line:84%
and also the tempter
and the redeemer.

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:23.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's about Saturn,
about structure.

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And we had an inner conversation
that on the 17 year journey

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.210 align:middle line:84%
that I'd been on, that
all of the doors I opened

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:33.010 align:middle line:90%
flowed through me.

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:34.510 align:middle line:84%
They flowed through
my pen, through my--

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:35.885 align:middle line:84%
it was sketch upon
sketch, trying

00:13:35.885 --> 00:13:39.940 align:middle line:84%
to find that right moment where
the two things came together,

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:41.480 align:middle line:90%
and it became self revealing.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, that
was a lot of hard work,

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:43.960 align:middle line:90%
like finding a character.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:44.760 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.270 align:middle line:90%
Or finding the soul of a song.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And I really think
that a lot of this

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:53.890 align:middle line:84%
is this journey that
finally brings us back

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:59.800 align:middle line:84%
into a condition where we
can look and see ourselves

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:05.530 align:middle line:84%
as both separate qualities, and
yet a unifying wheel or whole.

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to think of how
that really helps us understand

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:16.150 align:middle line:84%
also the relationship
of why the families,

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:20.750 align:middle line:84%
the universal families are our
interpretation of these greater

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:21.550 align:middle line:90%
forces.

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And you went back to Ireland,
the Celtic, all these.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Is that once we understand
the rich tapestry

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.740 align:middle line:84%
of the human imagination,
trying to always translate

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.380 align:middle line:84%
these qualities into that which
makes sense or has relevance

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:34.180 align:middle line:90%
to us.

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:34.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And so much of
our star knowledge,

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:40.840 align:middle line:84%
in a way Einstein said that man
sees himself in relationship

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.790 align:middle line:84%
to how he views himself
in terms of the stars.

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.920 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:43.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.760 align:middle line:84%
>> So you start seeing
all of these qualities,

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.820 align:middle line:84%
going back to Whitley
Strieber's "Communion"

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:51.130 align:middle line:84%
and his book
"Supernatural" recently,

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:54.700 align:middle line:84%
this story that we're always
trying to find how do you make

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:58.650 align:middle line:84%
sense of that which doesn't
have a rational place,

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:02.630 align:middle line:84%
and yet is the very stimulation
that informs the life?

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:03.430 align:middle line:90%
Do you know?

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And to me, this is the
invisible presence,

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.800 align:middle line:84%
that the archetypes
are trying to say

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:12.400 align:middle line:84%
that once you see that there
is a structure you can trust,

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.220 align:middle line:84%
that you can
navigate the ordeal,

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:20.210 align:middle line:84%
you'll start to no longer
need these things to be true.

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:21.940 align:middle line:84%
They'll be more
important than that.

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:27.360 align:middle line:84%
They'll be what you finally
reabsorb into your own story

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:31.600 align:middle line:84%
that for a long time might have
been, I want this to be true,

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.310 align:middle line:84%
to finally dissolve
into you to say,

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:35.860 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm the one that
allows this to be true.

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:44.590 align:middle line:84%
Which those Draconian forces
as the reptilian forces,

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:48.210 align:middle line:84%
I feel that was my
biggest lesson was that--

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:50.920 align:middle line:84%
so I had an Ayahuasca
journey, where

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.310 align:middle line:90%
I was having these visions.

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden this
really nasty, dripping mouth

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:02.650 align:middle line:90%
dragon with the fangs, and the--

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:03.650 align:middle line:90%
>> One of the guardians.

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:04.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:05.760 align:middle line:84%
"The Lord of the
Rings" type situation.

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:06.180 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:06.980 align:middle line:90%
And it's, rawr.

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:07.940 align:middle line:90%
And it's breathing.

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And when it first appeared,
I had this, oh, my god.

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:13.490 align:middle line:90%
Why is this dragon here?

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:15.190 align:middle line:90%
And it's really angry at me.

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:16.630 align:middle line:90%
And what's going on?

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And then it got
closer and closer.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And then I sort of shifted
my perspective of it.

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And I started looking at the
detail in the mouth, in the jaw

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:32.440 align:middle line:84%
line, and all of these
little intricate details.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And then I said,
wow, that's cool.

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:34.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And as soon as I said
that, it turned into a cartoon

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:39.070 align:middle line:90%
character.

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:40.420 align:middle line:90%
It turned into Shrek.

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:40.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:40.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:41.660 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.535 align:middle line:84%
It's a guardian at the
threshold, absolutely.

00:16:43.535 --> 00:16:49.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And the message I got was,
it's just your perspective

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:53.190 align:middle line:84%
of this fear, that
it's going to get you.

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And all you have to do is
think of it as being cool.

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And now, all of a
sudden, it's your ally.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.840 align:middle line:84%
It's a cartoon character that
in your journey, in your dream,

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:06.160 align:middle line:84%
that you're projecting the fear
onto this, when in reality it's

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.170 align:middle line:90%
there to help you grow.

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's very interesting
because of the serpent.

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is a
reoccurring motif here.

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:17.680 align:middle line:84%
The relationship in
this story is that--

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:18.920 align:middle line:90%
William Blake said it best.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.240 align:middle line:84%
He called it
reptiles of the mind,

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.670 align:middle line:84%
creating reptiles of the
mind about what fear does.

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:25.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:28.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And on one way you look
at it and you see a mother

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.190 align:middle line:90%
and a child within a chalice.

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And then the other way, you
see the head of a serpent.

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And one way you say this
is trusting our energies,

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:38.660 align:middle line:84%
and this is fearing
our energies.

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.800 align:middle line:84%
So the reptilian
becomes, in a way,

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.820 align:middle line:84%
the teacher of
the instantaneous.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:46.080 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be
in this condition.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:46.880 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Of the question of thought,
which does separate,

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:56.110 align:middle line:84%
creates fear and then love, the
condition that binds, right?

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:58.000 align:middle line:84%
But we're not either
one or the other.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.860 align:middle line:84%
That's this two wings
of the butterfly,

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:03.370 align:middle line:84%
that we need to create a
system that understands

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:06.070 align:middle line:84%
the pulse of perception
so we're not siding

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:07.460 align:middle line:90%
with one thing or another.

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's an important
key about where we're at.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:11.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:12.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.005 align:middle line:84%
That's I think one of
the bigger teachings

00:18:15.005 --> 00:18:16.630 align:middle line:84%
especially facing
the planet right now.

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:19.980 align:middle line:84%
We have this these polarities
that we're dealing with,

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:20.980 align:middle line:90%
and sort of going into--

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:21.430 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's the limbic.

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:22.230 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:23.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:27.970 align:middle line:84%
>> And the story here is that,
with Sofia, the reptilian,

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:29.260 align:middle line:90%
the limbic is one.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:34.810 align:middle line:84%
So energy, force, and beauty,
or manifestation are together.

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:36.610 align:middle line:84%
But when the serpent
is separated-- now,

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:39.235 align:middle line:84%
think of the serpent as
even the umbilical cord,

00:18:39.235 --> 00:18:42.460 align:middle line:84%
that as we are separated, we
go into a fight or flight.

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.290 align:middle line:84%
We begin the
development of what we

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:45.980 align:middle line:90%
think of as the reptilian mind.

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:46.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:48.910 align:middle line:84%
>> But also think
of this not as, oh,

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:50.140 align:middle line:90%
it's just a reptilian mind.

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:50.940 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:58.390 align:middle line:84%
It is this deeper, fundamental,
black and white knowledge

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:00.650 align:middle line:90%
that leads to survival.

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And I do feel like
that's why many

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:05.268 align:middle line:84%
of these different
qualities are trying

00:19:05.268 --> 00:19:07.060 align:middle line:84%
to say that when you
put it like your brain

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:09.250 align:middle line:84%
together that were
different functions,

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:11.630 align:middle line:90%
then we can work one to another.

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, think of how quickly
your instincts react.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:14.480 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.110 align:middle line:84%
How when there's
a time of danger,

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:19.170 align:middle line:90%
that something else takes over.

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:19.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And to me this is where
the star systems say, look,

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:24.760 align:middle line:90%
this is actually not you.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:28.150 align:middle line:84%
These are components of these
qualities that you see now.

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:29.560 align:middle line:90%
And what you said is very true.

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:30.880 align:middle line:90%
It's like the watchers.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.950 align:middle line:84%
Because this goes back
to the "Book of Enoch."

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:35.170 align:middle line:84%
We are both malevolent
and benevolent,

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:38.050 align:middle line:84%
meaning whatever you
feed us with becomes

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:40.870 align:middle line:90%
the story of who you are.

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:44.500 align:middle line:84%
If your story is of
disrespect, the waters

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:47.620 align:middle line:84%
will begin to drown you, because
you've not built something

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.240 align:middle line:90%
that honors the living waters.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.410 align:middle line:90%
This is not personal.

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:53.360 align:middle line:84%
This is a human story
told over and over again.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.535 align:middle line:84%
>> And I do feel
like that's why.

00:19:55.535 --> 00:19:58.690 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing universal patterns,
mythic structure being really

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:00.880 align:middle line:90%
revealed in where we are now.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And recognizing those
patterns can really help us

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:04.860 align:middle line:90%
in our evolution.

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:06.375 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we're
having this conversation.

00:20:06.375 --> 00:20:07.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Because of this
transformation.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:16.990 align:middle line:84%
Just my personal growth from
recognizing these energies,

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:22.360 align:middle line:84%
I feel so much empowerment
in the sense of not being

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:25.660 align:middle line:84%
above anything else,
but just centered,

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:28.180 align:middle line:84%
and able to navigate
this reality,

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:30.640 align:middle line:84%
and see things for
what they are, as

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.080 align:middle line:90%
opposed to knee jerk reaction.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:34.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Being afraid.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And you change
the permission field.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:41.610 align:middle line:84%
You literally change, on a
quantum level, the outcome.

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:44.700 align:middle line:84%
Because you've invested
in a probability,

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:45.560 align:middle line:90%
not in a certainty.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:46.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:48.060 align:middle line:84%
>> This is very important,
because this is where we start

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:49.740 align:middle line:84%
to see the tools
that do help us.

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:50.700 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:53.820 align:middle line:84%
You're open to,
you're adding to.

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.212 align:middle line:90%
You're not in a subtraction.

00:20:55.212 --> 00:20:56.012 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:56.012 --> 00:20:56.100 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>> You're dealing
in an inclusion.

00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>> That allows for these
greater probabilities to just be

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:00.720 align:middle line:90%
of assistance.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:05.460 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think your journey of
the more you started to include

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:09.630 align:middle line:84%
these other conversations, the
more they were able to grow you

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:13.112 align:middle line:84%
into a more, in a way,
multiverse being that could

00:21:13.112 --> 00:21:15.070 align:middle line:84%
stand at the center of
the cardinal directions.

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:16.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And say really, I need
north and south, east and west.

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:20.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm the center of the compass.

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:21.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>> So if I like going
east better than west,

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:25.350 align:middle line:90%
that's just me.

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:26.690 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And north and south,
it still exists.

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:30.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:31.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I just don't have to go
there if I don't want to.

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:32.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:36.360 align:middle line:84%
>> And one of the
great realizations is

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:41.970 align:middle line:84%
because I've shifted my belief
systems to allow a Mayan belief

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:45.450 align:middle line:84%
system, to allow this
cosmic belief system,

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:48.840 align:middle line:84%
to allow even the
idea of voodoo magic,

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:52.710 align:middle line:84%
which a lot of people say, I
don't believe in that stuff.

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:55.470 align:middle line:84%
That's negative
thinking, and that's--

00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:57.095 align:middle line:84%
but I'm like, it's
so exciting, though.

00:21:57.095 --> 00:21:57.895 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:57.895 --> 00:21:58.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>> You don't have to go there.

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:03.460 align:middle line:84%
>> You don't have to listen
to the channel, but whoa.

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:04.260 align:middle line:90%
Honor it.

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:08.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Honor it as a truth,
as someone else's truth.

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:09.914 align:middle line:84%
And Bashar says
this all the time.

00:22:09.914 --> 00:22:11.370 align:middle line:90%
All the truths are true.

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And I use that in my
daily affirmations.

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:15.390 align:middle line:90%
All the truths are true.

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And honoring every
truth that exists.

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:18.368 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:22:18.368 --> 00:22:20.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And when you can do
that, your tapestry,

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:26.730 align:middle line:84%
your canvas of what is
possible in your experiential,

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:30.090 align:middle line:90%
day to day life just broadens.

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:31.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's where I think
the magic starts to happen.

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of
us have lost the magic,

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:39.810 align:middle line:84%
because we've shut ourselves
off to these realities.

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:42.240 align:middle line:90%
We've listened to the news.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:46.890 align:middle line:84%
We've listened to the
indoctrinations in our schools.

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And we've shut ourselves
down to only believe

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:54.078 align:middle line:84%
in one specific religious
belief system or whatever it is.

00:22:54.078 --> 00:22:56.370 align:middle line:84%
>> But also if you think,
though, of what you're doing,

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:59.100 align:middle line:84%
and others are doing, which is
gathering around those things

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:02.930 align:middle line:84%
that inspire, really,
understanding like with rock

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:04.680 align:middle line:84%
and roll, it didn't
come from the outside.

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.430 align:middle line:84%
It was musicians
going, I like this.

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:07.230 align:middle line:90%
And you like this.

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:08.100 align:middle line:90%
Let's play, man.

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:10.170 align:middle line:84%
Let's get rid of the
conceit that we're

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:11.420 align:middle line:90%
supposed to come from on high.

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:12.860 align:middle line:90%
Nobody needs our wisdom.

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:13.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:13.390 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:14.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you know?

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:16.095 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, it needs
our sense of enthusiasm.

00:23:16.095 --> 00:23:16.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:17.850 align:middle line:90%
>> So how can we do that?

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:18.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:18.950 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:21.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I think enthusiasm
frees people to, a sense,

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:24.300 align:middle line:84%
be less concerned about
the things that makes them

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:27.750 align:middle line:84%
so anxious, which is, what do
people think of me if I let

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:29.110 align:middle line:90%
myself out, if I'm vulnerable?

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:32.080 align:middle line:84%
My joke is, if you think
of that we live in a liver,

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:32.880 align:middle line:90%
what does it do?

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:33.900 align:middle line:90%
It detoxifies.

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:35.350 align:middle line:90%
So maybe we're the livers.

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:36.570 align:middle line:90%
We live these things.

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:39.310 align:middle line:84%
We detoxify them by
not dismissing them.

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:40.110 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:40.405 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:23:40.405 --> 00:23:41.238 align:middle line:90%
>> We're the livers.

00:23:41.238 --> 00:23:42.825 align:middle line:84%
>> But not separating
from the system.

00:23:42.825 --> 00:23:43.281 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:43.281 --> 00:23:43.509 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:43.509 --> 00:23:44.309 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:44.309 --> 00:23:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>> But saying, maybe
it wasn't too--

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:52.070 align:middle line:84%
maybe for a long time we
always would see the toxicity,

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:55.630 align:middle line:84%
and not realize what
it was actually doing,

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:59.100 align:middle line:84%
which was saying, since
you cannot solve this,

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:00.410 align:middle line:90%
where are you then?

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's why
even if you go back

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:04.530 align:middle line:84%
about 30 or 40 years, it
started with individuation.

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:06.870 align:middle line:90%
Who am I in my soul, my journey?

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And much more since
the 9/11, there's

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:12.810 align:middle line:84%
been much more of a
having to find community.

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And I have found,
like you and I,

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:18.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that-- like what
I feel is I don't have anything

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.920 align:middle line:84%
to teach, in the sense
that I don't feel

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.450 align:middle line:90%
people don't know these things.

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:23.908 align:middle line:84%
It's more like a director with
actors going, wait a minute.

00:24:23.908 --> 00:24:25.950 align:middle line:84%
All we're asking
is, can we begin,

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:28.660 align:middle line:84%
at least amongst ourselves,
to give ourselves permission?

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>> To allow these
things to be relevant,

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:33.000 align:middle line:84%
not because they're
either true or not,

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.597 align:middle line:84%
and since Mozart isn't
true and isn't false.

00:24:35.597 --> 00:24:36.930 align:middle line:90%
It's more interesting than that.

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:37.920 align:middle line:90%
It's Mozart.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of feel, if you
think about these qualities

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:42.670 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, right, they're
more interesting than which

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:43.850 align:middle line:90%
is which.

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:46.860 align:middle line:84%
It's like they're the music
of the soul made manifest

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:49.920 align:middle line:90%
in a sense in the imagination.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.830 align:middle line:84%
So we dream outward
into the stars.

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:54.050 align:middle line:90%
But we don't stay outward.

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:56.970 align:middle line:84%
We start to bring and integrate
those back into ourselves.

00:24:56.970 --> 00:25:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe that that's
why this period has been about.

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:04.470 align:middle line:84%
The fires burning to
the coast, the anger,

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:09.570 align:middle line:84%
the uncontrolled ire
and anger of humankind,

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:12.570 align:middle line:84%
one against the other,
forgetting that what we love

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:15.120 align:middle line:84%
is more important
than what we hate,

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.270 align:middle line:90%
but this anger of the ages.

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:17.070 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Running away, being
always I need more.

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:20.860 align:middle line:90%
It's not me.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:21.780 align:middle line:90%
I need that.

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And this truth now
that, as trees,

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.000 align:middle line:90%
we're standing our ground.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.080 align:middle line:10%
We're saying, if we
stand in our roots,

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.740 align:middle line:10%
but begin to honor that we
have roots in the stars,

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:33.330 align:middle line:10%
and then great
roots in the Earth,

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:37.020 align:middle line:10%
meaning all of our ancestors
that were willing to live

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:41.540 align:middle line:10%
this question, that honor the
fact that to finally stand

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:44.210 align:middle line:10%
in a way, as Nassim
Haraman the physicist says,

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:45.350 align:middle line:10%
as the event horizon.

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.650 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:46.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:49.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Your bellybutton
going, ah, you see now.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:50.960 align:middle line:10%
Your legs, your
black and white world

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.970 align:middle line:10%
keeps you in Kansas, Dorothy.

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:55.740 align:middle line:84%
Because your love doesn't
want to leave Auntie Em.

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:57.860 align:middle line:84%
But your imagination
does want to go to Oz,

00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:59.580 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't want
to get stuck there.

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:00.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>> You see, it wants to
recycle from the library not

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.050 align:middle line:84%
the stories that sweep us
into madness, but, in a way,

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:08.210 align:middle line:90%
in our greater divine madness.

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:10.310 align:middle line:84%
We're free to realize
that we don't get out

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:12.740 align:middle line:84%
of the struggles,
that we literally

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:15.890 align:middle line:84%
do make and create
from the struggle

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:18.480 align:middle line:84%
a story we find
worthy of one another.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
think that this is

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.580 align:middle line:90%
when the star systems show up.

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:25.945 align:middle line:84%
They say, we don't show up
because you're entitled to us.

00:26:25.945 --> 00:26:27.320 align:middle line:84%
You're not smart
enough for that.

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.090 align:middle line:90%
You're not that interesting.

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:32.420 align:middle line:84%
We show up because you've
created worthy residents,

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:33.800 align:middle line:90%
like a garden.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.485 align:middle line:84%
You've stopped saying, I
need you to be this for me.

00:26:36.485 --> 00:26:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And you start asking, well,
maybe what can I be to you?

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:40.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:46.412 align:middle line:84%
And during my meditations
and journeys I've come sort

00:26:46.412 --> 00:26:48.620 align:middle line:84%
of to the conclusion-- and
this is sort of the flavor

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:50.960 align:middle line:90%
of the moment--

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:53.330 align:middle line:90%
that our purpose here--

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:56.210 align:middle line:84%
we always hear our purpose
here is to experience.

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:58.500 align:middle line:90%
But take it to the next level.

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:01.700 align:middle line:84%
Our purpose in this
reality is to integrate,

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.965 align:middle line:84%
to integrate the
experiences of all,

00:27:03.965 --> 00:27:05.090 align:middle line:90%
the collective experiences.

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:05.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:06.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And to integrate
all the archetypes.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.730 align:middle line:84%
To integrate them
into the story.

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:12.020 align:middle line:90%
>> To bring them home.

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And to bring them home, and
to tell that story in a way

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:20.180 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't leave
one of them out.

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:20.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And that is why,
here, the return

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:26.390 align:middle line:84%
of the knowledge of
the mother, of mater,

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:29.060 align:middle line:84%
matyr, mother, of
Sofia, phyllo Sofia,

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:33.162 align:middle line:84%
the love of all of her stories,
all of her books, her weave.

00:27:33.162 --> 00:27:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And she says, I am the
knowledge of your atoms.

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.120 align:middle line:90%
There are no evil atoms.

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.510 align:middle line:84%
If you don't like your
stories, tell better stories.

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:40.040 align:middle line:90%
I love all of my atoms.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.600 align:middle line:90%
I love all of my books.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And you might reject this
book and hate that thread,

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:47.090 align:middle line:84%
but it is all part of
the greater weave of love

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:49.760 align:middle line:84%
and struggle that
will reveal finally

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.550 align:middle line:84%
to you that you are not the
outcome of having avoided

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:53.550 align:middle line:90%
any of this.

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:54.350 align:middle line:90%
Do you see?

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:55.520 align:middle line:84%
The same thing with
the star system.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:55.770 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:56.062 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:27:56.062 --> 00:27:56.210 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>> You've actually honored
and integrated the reptilian,

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:02.090 align:middle line:90%
the mammalian, the hominid.

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:04.880 align:middle line:84%
You've integrated the
invisible and the visible,

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:08.390 align:middle line:84%
finally to offload with that
which is invisible in a way

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:11.870 align:middle line:84%
that you can
creatively reconnect

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:15.530 align:middle line:84%
with the last question,
which is, how do I live this?

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:19.160 align:middle line:84%
How do I not use myth as an
escape from the disaster I look

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.420 align:middle line:90%
and see around me?

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:22.250 align:middle line:84%
But do what you're
talking about.

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:23.870 align:middle line:90%
Reintegrate.

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:25.370 align:middle line:90%
Begin to re-assimilate.

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And go back to what the
alchemists called themselves,

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:31.610 align:middle line:84%
celestial gardeners,
and that we didn't write

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:33.510 align:middle line:90%
to impress the inquisition.

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:35.970 align:middle line:90%
It was not a good thing to do.

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:39.200 align:middle line:84%
But to one another, to say
that we're, in a sense,

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:43.010 align:middle line:84%
all miners in a great
vein, a motherload.

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:45.800 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to find
things I can't find.

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to find
things you can't find.

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:47.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:49.768 align:middle line:84%
>> But the greater alchemy
will be the sharing.

00:28:49.768 --> 00:28:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I feel that if
you think of this as an arc,

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:56.600 align:middle line:84%
meaning that the final arc is
not about movement and water,

00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:00.620 align:middle line:84%
but about fire, about what
do we do with this energy--

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:04.610 align:middle line:84%
and history and the books all
say, there are always wars.

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:05.970 align:middle line:90%
There is always conflict.

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:07.790 align:middle line:90%
There's always hatred and greed.

00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:08.880 align:middle line:90%
These are archetypal.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:09.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:12.110 align:middle line:84%
>> But you don't need to be
identified with them anymore

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:14.760 align:middle line:84%
than a sea captain says, that
sea squall is against me.

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:15.590 align:middle line:90%
It's like, no.

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:17.960 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to do
with you personally.

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.610 align:middle line:84%
These are qualities
that surround you,

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:22.730 align:middle line:84%
that begin to say, what do
I need to identify with?

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And how do I bring myself
back on board into my vessel?

00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:28.280 align:middle line:84%
I've been reacting to
everything in the water.

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that
this is also where

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:31.490 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have
direct communion

00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:33.770 align:middle line:84%
with these other qualities
of consciousness.

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:36.470 align:middle line:84%
They'll say that when you bring
yourself back whole and holy,

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:39.830 align:middle line:84%
holographically, you're able
to hold a communion that

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:44.180 align:middle line:84%
doesn't draw you away or
confuse you even more,

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:47.600 align:middle line:84%
but finally realizes and brings
to heart, quite literally--

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:51.020 align:middle line:84%
do you see that Nexus
point, that event horizon--

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:53.900 align:middle line:84%
that which finally,
in human terms,

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:57.480 align:middle line:84%
holds the greater theater
of human existence,

00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:00.710 align:middle line:84%
but not as an excuse to leave
it or get out of anything,

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:03.268 align:middle line:84%
but to be inspired by it,
to willingly then go back

00:30:03.268 --> 00:30:04.310 align:middle line:90%
into the black and white.

00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:05.110 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:07.160 align:middle line:84%
The difficulty going,
I can deal with Kansas.

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.725 align:middle line:84%
I can even deal with the
old witch on the bicycle.

00:30:09.725 --> 00:30:11.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:12.540 align:middle line:90%
>> I'll get my dog back.

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:13.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:14.250 align:middle line:90%
Or the fire's coming.

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:15.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:17.490 align:middle line:84%
The fire's coming
here, the unexpected.

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:19.750 align:middle line:90%
The archetypes are showing up.

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:20.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:23.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And I do feel like that's
why the myth for us now is that

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:27.380 align:middle line:84%
the arc that arises from the
fire is not to go somewhere,

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:29.620 align:middle line:90%
but to stabilize this energy.

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Not to be against, but think of
a rocket, finally underneath.

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:36.770 align:middle line:84%
Finally let that
be that we honor,

00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:38.630 align:middle line:90%
like you, with storytelling.

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And all of us that
are trying to say,

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:42.950 align:middle line:84%
at least amongst ourselves,
let's turn to one another

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:47.060 align:middle line:84%
and stop saying they don't
care, because we do care.

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:48.388 align:middle line:90%
And that is also an embrace.

00:30:48.388 --> 00:30:49.680 align:middle line:90%
And that's why I would go back.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:53.093 align:middle line:84%
Anybody seeking communion
to trust their hands,

00:30:53.093 --> 00:30:54.260 align:middle line:90%
because it's not their hand.

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:55.730 align:middle line:90%
It's the human hand.

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:57.740 align:middle line:84%
To trust their
breath, their sense

00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:00.200 align:middle line:90%
of improvisation and wonder.

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
created beautiful art,

00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:05.450 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted it to be
beautiful before it became

00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:06.950 align:middle line:90%
symbolical and meaningful.

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:09.080 align:middle line:84%
That was if people
wanted to go more deeply.

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I do
feel that everything now

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:16.550 align:middle line:84%
is to say, almost like a
lot of Tibetan teaching,

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:18.800 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing personal
in where you're at.

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.160 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful.

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:23.240 align:middle line:84%
So if it's too much, don't
try to take it all in.

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:24.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:26.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Just enjoy it, what
makes sense to you.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:26.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>> But if you want to
go deeper, go deeper.

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:31.050 align:middle line:84%
But begin to honor
this sense of--

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:33.480 align:middle line:84%
and this is what the
fires really taught me.

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's so important,
because it was about miracles.

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And that miracles are
not parting the Red Sea.

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.230 align:middle line:84%
They're not the
separating of space.

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:44.720 align:middle line:84%
The miracle is
realizing that all of us

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:46.790 align:middle line:90%
are in a larger matrix.

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And with the fire,
people were holding us

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:51.950 align:middle line:84%
in their prayers, and all
[INAUDIBLE],, and this.

00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:53.600 align:middle line:90%
And I felt the prayers palpably.

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, literally,
like my father's death.

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.130 align:middle line:90%
It was not poetic.

00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And in that, there was this
realization that the greatest

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:06.020 align:middle line:84%
truths of who and what we are
cannot be known optically.

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:07.850 align:middle line:84%
They are revealed
in a moment where

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:10.340 align:middle line:90%
you feel angels at your back.

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:12.890 align:middle line:84%
You realize that
what is meaningful

00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:15.710 align:middle line:84%
is not meaningful
for oneself alone,

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:17.630 align:middle line:90%
but meaningful for community.

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:19.040 align:middle line:90%
And that's worth defending.

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:22.160 align:middle line:84%
But then you realize, that's
what the community's doing.

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:24.440 align:middle line:84%
They're not here, but
boy, are they here.

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:25.370 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that beautiful?

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:28.175 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is why
Carl and I-- you

00:32:28.175 --> 00:32:31.168 align:middle line:84%
talk about the dark knight,
this journey, this difficulty.

00:32:31.168 --> 00:32:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And I know you know
what I'm talking about.

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.010 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:36.095 align:middle line:84%
>> You become incredibly
humbled and grateful.

00:32:36.095 --> 00:32:37.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:38.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And I really feel like that's
when we're ready to listen

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:42.293 align:middle line:90%
finally.

00:32:42.293 --> 00:32:43.710 align:middle line:84%
I've been trying
to slow you down.

00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:45.830 align:middle line:84%
You're going at the
rate of a bullet.

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:47.000 align:middle line:90%
So maybe I'll use a bullet.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.060 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:51.300 align:middle line:90%
Just stop and appreciate.

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And just really like even
today, to begin to say,

00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:56.790 align:middle line:84%
let's honor the fact that
we show up in a magical life

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:57.590 align:middle line:90%
here together.

00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:00.090 align:middle line:90%


00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:02.690 align:middle line:84%
Cause I always wanted
to know what genius was.

00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:06.635 align:middle line:10%
Genius is oops, and
the capacity to follow

00:33:06.635 --> 00:33:09.770 align:middle line:10%
the oops with some intention.

00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:11.090 align:middle line:10%
Cause I dropped these cards.

00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:13.850 align:middle line:10%
And when I dropped
them, the amazing thing

00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:19.040 align:middle line:10%
is they created this, which is
a holographic, double helix DNA

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:23.360 align:middle line:10%
weave, coming from
a painting mirroring

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:26.420 align:middle line:10%
a painting, or a fractal,
holographic, mathematical,

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:29.210 align:middle line:10%
geometrical model
of a holographic DNA

00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:32.013 align:middle line:10%
weave coming from a painting.

00:33:32.013 --> 00:33:33.680 align:middle line:84%
When people wonder
where the science is,

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:36.860 align:middle line:84%
this is pure science, because
this is essentially not being

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:39.380 align:middle line:90%
imposed on by a Western artist.

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:41.990 align:middle line:10%
This is actually the
revelation of sacred geometry,

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:47.300 align:middle line:10%
because all of the
iteration is the phoenix,

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:50.510 align:middle line:10%
meaning that all qualities
are an iteration of wholeness.

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:55.280 align:middle line:84%
This is a holographic,
mathematical, geometrical model

00:33:55.280 --> 00:34:00.890 align:middle line:84%
of the DNA that shows us the
egg, the fire, and the weave.

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:02.450 align:middle line:90%
It also shows us this direction.

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Do you see the slit eyes and
the slit mouth of the alien

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:09.409 align:middle line:90%
that we see over and over again?

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:11.360 align:middle line:84%
That's very important,
because these slit eyes

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:15.739 align:middle line:84%
and this slit mouth repeats
over and over again,

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:18.725 align:middle line:84%
as if to tell us that the face
of the alien, or the ancestors,

00:34:18.725 --> 00:34:20.600 align:middle line:84%
are actually a
misunderstanding in the nature

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:23.030 align:middle line:90%
of the holographic DNA.

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And what we think of as alien
is actually this deeper root

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:29.929 align:middle line:84%
system that is
trying to say, you

00:34:29.929 --> 00:34:34.730 align:middle line:84%
must understand now that
all aspects of the one

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:36.285 align:middle line:90%
are contained in the all.

00:34:36.285 --> 00:34:40.969 align:middle line:84%
The is pure Pythagoras, because
we would not teach fractions,

00:34:40.969 --> 00:34:44.239 align:middle line:84%
because 2/3 of a
dog is a dead dog.

00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:48.465 align:middle line:84%
Everything that is of life is
of holistic or whole numbers.

00:34:48.465 --> 00:34:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
very interesting here

00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:53.900 align:middle line:84%
that this is actually the
relationship of the iteration

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:57.767 align:middle line:84%
of the one over and over again
that establishes the DNA.

00:34:57.767 --> 00:34:59.600 align:middle line:84%
It's also good news,
because it's telling us

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:00.740 align:middle line:90%
we're not born into time.

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:03.140 align:middle line:84%
We're born into creation,
and that our DNA is

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.810 align:middle line:90%
a holographic model.

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:07.850 align:middle line:84%
This also became very
telling, because I

00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:08.850 align:middle line:90%
showed you the mandalas.

00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:11.210 align:middle line:84%
But let me show you
how they're created.

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
once I saw that what

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:18.440 align:middle line:84%
was going to reveal itself
was not random qualities,

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:21.440 align:middle line:84%
but actually just as in the
story of the phoenix, bird

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.780 align:middle line:84%
of immortality
and rebirth, is it

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:25.220 align:middle line:90%
returns home and builds a nest.

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:28.130 align:middle line:10%
And we can see that
this mandala, this

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:33.120 align:middle line:10%
is a nest and feathers,
just as in this story.

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:35.450 align:middle line:84%
But once the nest was built,
it erupted into flames.

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:40.900 align:middle line:84%
I pulled out the cards, you
see, and it erupts into flames.

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And I can't figure out
how you would figure out

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:49.340 align:middle line:84%
how to figure this out,
because it blossoms.

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're being
told in the language

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:52.790 align:middle line:90%
we saw in the film "E.T."

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:56.870 align:middle line:84%
in a mathematical, fractal,
geometrical model of creation

00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:58.670 align:middle line:90%
that is told through what?

00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:00.260 align:middle line:90%
The act of creation.

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:01.350 align:middle line:90%
This is a painting.

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:02.840 align:middle line:90%
A painting is an act of love.

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:04.840 align:middle line:84%
It's an act of
devotion, of discovery.

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:06.890 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
that's illustrated.

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:10.260 align:middle line:84%
It's something that is
quite literally drawn forth.

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:12.440 align:middle line:84%
So how is this not
telling us that you

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:16.430 align:middle line:84%
are born as creation,
whole and wholly, composed

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:19.160 align:middle line:84%
of this archetypal
structure, that finally,

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:21.500 align:middle line:90%
is going to hold the blossom?

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And why this becomes
so imperative

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:26.790 align:middle line:84%
is that we can tilt up
and see the blossom there.

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And when we look
around the environment,

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:33.050 align:middle line:84%
if you look into
that room as well,

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:36.830 align:middle line:84%
you'll see that these
mandalas and the DNA show us.

00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:39.420 align:middle line:90%
Do you see this relationship?

00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:41.610 align:middle line:90%
This is created.

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:45.150 align:middle line:84%
This is created from this,
is created from this.

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:50.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is the one
creation, creating iteration,

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:53.160 align:middle line:84%
not in completion, that
holds the structure that

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:57.210 align:middle line:84%
finally blossoms with the
Hopi Indian [INAUDIBLE]..

00:36:57.210 --> 00:36:58.980 align:middle line:84%
Our basket weave
and our headdresses

00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:02.110 align:middle line:84%
hold the knowledge
of our sacred DNA.

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at this, these
look like Indian baskets.

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:06.270 align:middle line:84%
They look like
Indian headdresses.

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is Chumash
ceremonial ground.

00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'm convinced that
what is blossoming here

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:18.040 align:middle line:84%
is the story that each of us
enter, not time, but creation,

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:20.880 align:middle line:84%
and that you will unfold
with unique geometry,

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:23.320 align:middle line:84%
and unique beauty, a
unique name in the library,

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.650 align:middle line:90%
unique self reflection.

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:29.425 align:middle line:84%
But when we understand that
each of us are woven of the one,

00:37:29.425 --> 00:37:30.925 align:middle line:84%
then it's not how
are you incomplete

00:37:30.925 --> 00:37:34.950 align:middle line:84%
and I complete, as
much as your geometry.

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:39.102 align:middle line:84%
Show me a universe I cannot
see through the lens of mine.

00:37:39.102 --> 00:37:40.560 align:middle line:84%
But together-- and
I really do feel

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:44.610 align:middle line:84%
like this is why this is the
blossoming of the painted cave,

00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:48.240 align:middle line:84%
the ancient technology of
the imagination that says,

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:50.640 align:middle line:84%
we didn't want
things done for us.

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:54.750 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to take the journey
of the DNA, this willingness

00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:57.900 align:middle line:84%
to hold a structure that
would finally blossom,

00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:03.480 align:middle line:84%
but as the painting shows us,
not to blossom as one type,

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:05.310 align:middle line:84%
but to blossom as
infinite types.

00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:09.620 align:middle line:90%


00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Here we are in
the magical library.

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to ask about
a couple more E.T. races.

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:18.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:19.230 align:middle line:90%
Please.

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:20.532 align:middle line:90%
It fascinates me.

00:38:20.532 --> 00:38:22.490 align:middle line:84%
With the librarian going,
oh, interesting book.

00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:23.330 align:middle line:90%
I'll be right back.

00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:28.550 align:middle line:84%
>> So we've been touching
on the serious energy,

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:32.030 align:middle line:84%
and the seriousness associated
with the snake energy.

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:33.915 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:33.915 --> 00:38:34.715 align:middle line:90%
>> The Kundalini.

00:38:34.715 --> 00:38:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>> These wise serpents.

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:36.620 align:middle line:90%
>> The serpents.

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:36.800 align:middle line:90%
The Kundalini.

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.520 align:middle line:84%
>> This is all about
Kundalini as well,

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:41.400 align:middle line:90%
which is the goddess Kundalini.

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:42.200 align:middle line:90%
>> But yeah.

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
there's Anubis, the dog.

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:47.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, Sirius, the
dog's star, but yet,

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:50.510 align:middle line:84%
talking to some
of the channelers,

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:52.640 align:middle line:84%
and sort of asking
them, what would

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:57.110 align:middle line:84%
they truly feel is the best
animal archetype, or the animal

00:38:57.110 --> 00:39:01.040 align:middle line:84%
symbol of the
Sirius star system?

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And they say the
serpent, the snake.

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:06.730 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what comes
up on the pharaoh.

00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:07.530 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:09.440 align:middle line:84%
This is the center
of the serpent.

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And there's different
interpretations.

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:14.460 align:middle line:84%
There's the Western
interpretation of the dragon.

00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:15.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:19.792 align:middle line:84%
>> That is more destructive
in breathing fire,

00:39:19.792 --> 00:39:20.750 align:middle line:90%
and this sort of thing.

00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:22.292 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
the eastern version

00:39:22.292 --> 00:39:27.470 align:middle line:84%
of this that is more a wisdom
keeper, and all powerful.

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Still very destructive,
but different

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:32.680 align:middle line:90%
takes on this serpent idea.

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:35.420 align:middle line:84%
But yet, you see this
in our mythologies,

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:37.380 align:middle line:84%
and indigenous cultures,
and the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:43.160 align:middle line:84%
>> It's everywhere in
our archetypal language

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:44.180 align:middle line:90%
of our reality.

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:44.720 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE] as well.

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:45.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:47.390 align:middle line:84%
This is in my
strength archetype.

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:51.350 align:middle line:84%
You'll see it in my wheel
of fortune archetype, which

00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:54.110 align:middle line:84%
is the Nagas, the serpents,
the seven headed serpent.

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:55.010 align:middle line:90%
Actually 14-headed.

00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:57.290 align:middle line:84%
It's the quality
of the septinary--

00:39:57.290 --> 00:40:00.690 align:middle line:90%
do you see-- this energetic.

00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:03.920 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the bas
relief in Angkor Wat,

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:06.380 align:middle line:84%
you'll see this great
churning in the sea

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:10.550 align:middle line:84%
of milk of the Nagas, of
this reptilian quality, which

00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:12.670 align:middle line:90%
is the sacred reptilian.

00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:15.320 align:middle line:84%
It's not what we think of,
in a sense the translation

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.403 align:middle line:90%
in a rather limited sense.

00:40:16.403 --> 00:40:17.203 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:40:17.203 --> 00:40:18.080 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:21.320 align:middle line:90%
It's the human experience.

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:22.875 align:middle line:90%
You can't skip a step.

00:40:22.875 --> 00:40:24.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Like all of this has to
happen in a specific manner.

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:31.070 align:middle line:84%
Like I said-- I think
I said this off camera,

00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:38.250 align:middle line:84%
but I came here in 2011
blown away by your work.

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:40.370 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it was 2010, '11ish.

00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:43.700 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of it was
whoosh, over my head.

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:44.660 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't grasp.

00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:45.810 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a lot to take in.

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:46.808 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:40:46.808 --> 00:40:47.608 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a lot.

00:40:47.608 --> 00:40:49.090 align:middle line:10%
>> I understand that.

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:51.910 align:middle line:10%
>> And I was fascinated.

00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:52.820 align:middle line:90%
And I was intrigued.

00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:54.620 align:middle line:90%
And I would come to the events.

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And I would come
up for the tours,

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:59.740 align:middle line:90%
and every time just get nuggets.

00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:02.500 align:middle line:90%
You know, the story of Lilith.

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:06.200 align:middle line:84%
I have a unique
relationship with that story

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.700 align:middle line:84%
that I'll tell you
off camera later.

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:09.410 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:12.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Do tell.

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>> You can't make this stuff up.

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:14.880 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.130 align:middle line:90%
It's better than making it up.

00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:20.090 align:middle line:84%
>> But you have to go through
these steps to really embrace

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:21.880 align:middle line:90%
it, to understand it.

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:23.140 align:middle line:90%
And there is no skipping.

00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:25.070 align:middle line:90%
There are no shortcuts.

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really finding
that through this journey,

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:33.460 align:middle line:90%
and then acknowledging.

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And when you can sort
of settle into that,

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:38.360 align:middle line:84%
you can settle into this is all
the way it's supposed to be.

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:41.800 align:middle line:84%
This is all unfolding
just perfectly.

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:43.250 align:middle line:90%
And then you can laugh at it.

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:45.650 align:middle line:84%
You can laugh at getting shot
five minutes after getting

00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:46.240 align:middle line:90%
shot.

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:46.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:47.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:48.400 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:52.740 align:middle line:84%
You prepared the ground for
that not to be the definition,

00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:55.280 align:middle line:84%
but for the trigger
of a new evolution.

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's interesting,
because you reminded me.

00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:01.640 align:middle line:10%
I created a grail seal
for my book on the Tarot,

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:03.200 align:middle line:10%
meaning everything is sealed.

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:08.300 align:middle line:10%
But quoting Gerta, who
says [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:12.500 align:middle line:10%
which in Latin means, nature
does not grow in leaps.

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And so going back to really
the 1700s, this realization

00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:20.930 align:middle line:84%
that in nature, in
the seed, in the plant

00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:24.320 align:middle line:84%
is this repeating quality
that finally reveals

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:27.920 align:middle line:84%
how the quality
of evolution leads

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:31.010 align:middle line:84%
to the blossoming
of the organism.

00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:31.970 align:middle line:90%
Do you know?

00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's what
we're getting at, is that there

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:36.860 align:middle line:90%
is this seasonal shift now.

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of this
seasonal shift,

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:40.970 align:middle line:84%
if you think of it
being this nature

00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:44.240 align:middle line:84%
doesn't grow in leaps
that there is a time that

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:45.862 align:middle line:90%
prepares us to finally open.

00:42:45.862 --> 00:42:47.570 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
things that I realized

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:50.058 align:middle line:84%
what is really wonderful
here is I can finally say,

00:42:50.058 --> 00:42:52.100 align:middle line:84%
do you realize none of
these drawings-- they were

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:54.680 align:middle line:84%
all one after another, and the
same thing with the paintings.

00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:56.900 align:middle line:84%
There was no way
to put it together

00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:00.200 align:middle line:84%
until it had all been drawn
forth, until finally all

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:03.680 align:middle line:84%
of its component parts said,
ah, now that we're here,

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:05.600 align:middle line:84%
let's have a
conversation, because we

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.440 align:middle line:84%
needed to show up in
parts so, finally, you

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:12.000 align:middle line:84%
could put it together in
a larger, coherent state.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think everything is
this question of an operating

00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:18.500 align:middle line:84%
system that says, can
I create a pattern?

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I think is very
intriguing about the archetypes

00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:26.080 align:middle line:84%
and my work below in
my father's studio

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:27.940 align:middle line:84%
is that in the black
and white structure,

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:29.320 align:middle line:90%
we've created a piano.

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:31.940 align:middle line:84%
We've created the
truth like Shakespeare,

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:34.060 align:middle line:84%
that this is always
the archetypal theater

00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:35.170 align:middle line:90%
of the psyche.

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:37.460 align:middle line:84%
We are composed of all
of these characters,

00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:38.650 align:middle line:90%
whether we like them or not.

00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:41.470 align:middle line:84%
They're still part of
who and what we are.

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:45.640 align:middle line:84%
But that wheel then holds,
as I say, this ascension that

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.620 align:middle line:84%
holds the domestic,
meaning I have

00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:52.720 align:middle line:84%
to love this to stand in the
center of it, to find myself.

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:56.920 align:middle line:84%
Then I use my, essentially
this deeper foundation

00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:01.130 align:middle line:84%
to hold my imagination in
honor of serving those I love.

00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:01.930 align:middle line:90%
Do you see?

00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:06.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's not using it to escape,
but to finally really return.

00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that might
be the truth of the etiquette

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:10.870 align:middle line:90%
of all of these qualities.

00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And you were going to
bring up two other races.

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:13.660 align:middle line:90%
So what were those?

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:14.440 align:middle line:90%
>> We did Pleiadian.

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:15.280 align:middle line:90%
We did Zeta.

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:19.520 align:middle line:84%
We sort of touched a little
bit on the Vega and Lyran,

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:24.690 align:middle line:84%
coming from the serpent,
and the lion energy.

00:44:24.690 --> 00:44:30.850 align:middle line:84%
So now, the Orion energy, and
sort of the idea behind that

00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:34.270 align:middle line:84%
keeps coming up over
and over from all

00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:37.180 align:middle line:84%
of these conversations,
and maybe you've even

00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:39.820 align:middle line:90%
heard this, the Orion wars.

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:43.060 align:middle line:84%
So Orion is sort of
the "Star Wars" Story,

00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:47.710 align:middle line:84%
from Joseph Campbell, but
also from George Lucas, who

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:49.690 align:middle line:84%
borrowed from
Joseph Campbell, and

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:53.230 align:middle line:84%
this great galactic,
intergalactic millennias

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:56.178 align:middle line:84%
of wars, fighting, and
all these different races.

00:44:56.178 --> 00:44:57.720 align:middle line:84%
>> We came through
Mars in our chart.

00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:58.000 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:58.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And all these-- and supposedly
from the channelings,

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:10.900 align:middle line:84%
we're still processing
remnants of this Orion

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:15.700 align:middle line:84%
conflict that they all say
through the channelings

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:18.920 align:middle line:84%
that that conflict
is over in there.

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:22.150 align:middle line:84%
So if we were to go into that
space-time continuum right now,

00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:23.980 align:middle line:90%
that's no longer happening.

00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:26.530 align:middle line:84%
But karmically,
we're still dealing

00:45:26.530 --> 00:45:31.290 align:middle line:84%
with some of the remnants of
these warring civilizations.

00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of
our sort of makeup.

00:45:34.570 --> 00:45:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And well, if you break
time into the holographic,

00:45:40.090 --> 00:45:41.090 align:middle line:90%
and there is no time.

00:45:41.090 --> 00:45:42.962 align:middle line:90%
So there is still some--

00:45:42.962 --> 00:45:44.170 align:middle line:90%
that's a part of our history.

00:45:44.170 --> 00:45:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Sooner or later [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:45.340 align:middle line:90%
>> That has happened.

00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:46.140 align:middle line:90%
It happened.

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:47.770 align:middle line:90%
It's happening, however.

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:53.710 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of these remnants
of our own conflicts

00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:57.565 align:middle line:90%
here come from this Orion story.

00:45:57.565 --> 00:45:58.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:45:58.630 --> 00:46:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>> If you think of in the
king's chamber in the pyramid,

00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:03.100 align:middle line:84%
that the king's chamber
aligns with Orion.

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:03.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:05.192 align:middle line:90%
>> And the queen's with Sirius.

00:46:05.192 --> 00:46:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's very intriguing to
think that the king and queen.

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:09.190 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:09.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:12.040 align:middle line:90%
>> And this story of Mars.

00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:15.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is why it's very
interesting that the Trump

00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:19.510 align:middle line:84%
Tower was elected, and the
fire reaches here two years

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:20.440 align:middle line:90%
from the election.

00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:21.240 align:middle line:90%
Do you know?

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:23.050 align:middle line:84%
In a way, it's this
story of the war

00:46:23.050 --> 00:46:25.510 align:middle line:84%
within the self, the war of
neighbor against neighbor,

00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:29.540 align:middle line:84%
planet against planet that it
starts in a large cosmic sense.

00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's very true
that if we start

00:46:31.930 --> 00:46:35.800 align:middle line:84%
to realize that like our body,
that all of these qualities

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:39.388 align:middle line:84%
are co-eternal, meaning
that some are warlike,

00:46:39.388 --> 00:46:40.930 align:middle line:84%
and that was the
point of putting all

00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:43.300 align:middle line:84%
these conditions
into us to find,

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:48.260 align:middle line:84%
in a way, a deeper resolution
that wasn't one or the other.

00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I do think that
if you think of the pyramid

00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:54.130 align:middle line:84%
as being that great initiation
of the mother, which

00:46:54.130 --> 00:46:57.490 align:middle line:84%
is the unfinished, meaning
growing from the roots,

00:46:57.490 --> 00:47:00.250 align:middle line:84%
to the father, this
connection to Orion.

00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:02.900 align:middle line:90%
And it's Isis and Osiris.

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:06.580 align:middle line:84%
So it's Osiris which
is, in the myth,

00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:10.780 align:middle line:84%
the relationship to
the God consciousness.

00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And if you think of
being and knowing,

00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:18.790 align:middle line:84%
that the question would be,
well, how do you dissolve that?

00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Like spermanovum, how do you
dissolve this Osirian knowing?

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:28.270 align:middle line:84%
How do you take this quality of
Orion, do you see, and turn it?

00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:30.860 align:middle line:84%
Doing it in a way,
dissolve the conflict.

00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's intriguing,
to think that even the phallus

00:47:33.690 --> 00:47:40.420 align:middle line:84%
that Isis can't find once
Osiris is cut into parts,

00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:41.650 align:middle line:90%
she can't find it's phallus.

00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And that always intrigued
me, because it was this truth

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:50.410 align:middle line:84%
that the fertility quality
of this once god like knowing

00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:53.650 align:middle line:84%
would destroy the fabric
and agreement of time-space.

00:47:53.650 --> 00:47:55.210 align:middle line:90%
It knows too much.

00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:57.820 align:middle line:84%
So it has to dissolve itself
into the fabric of time

00:47:57.820 --> 00:47:59.680 align:middle line:84%
and space, to
become, in a sense,

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:02.500 align:middle line:84%
the sap of that quality
of time and space.

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And what intrigues me now is
to think about Orion and Sirius

00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:09.800 align:middle line:84%
as this great magus
and high priestess,

00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:11.630 align:middle line:84%
meaning this
greater mystery that

00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:15.680 align:middle line:84%
does reveal, as Mars
is revealing to us now,

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:20.450 align:middle line:84%
that, yes, as Rudolf Steiner
pointed out in his book

00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:25.510 align:middle line:84%
on cosmic origins, that Mars,
that all of the planets--

00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:28.300 align:middle line:84%
and you think of layering the
psyche, right, the limbic, all

00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:31.310 align:middle line:84%
that-- that literally,
the planets incarnate.

00:48:31.310 --> 00:48:34.880 align:middle line:84%
They awaken, holding different
qualities and conditions.

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:37.790 align:middle line:84%
Theosophy talks about the lunar
petries and the solar petries,

00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:41.120 align:middle line:84%
meaning these qualities
of rounds and races,

00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:43.800 align:middle line:84%
that our body is actually
what the Egyptians would

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:44.600 align:middle line:90%
call the ka.

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:48.380 align:middle line:84%
It's in a sheathing
process that finally holds

00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:51.650 align:middle line:84%
all of these conditions,
and recognizes itself

00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:54.470 align:middle line:84%
as the aggregate of
them, and therefore,

00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:57.980 align:middle line:84%
is able to find its center,
no longer, in a way, looking

00:48:57.980 --> 00:48:59.840 align:middle line:84%
for something that
it thinks it's not.

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:00.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:05.180 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's why much of this
I think is a type of, again,

00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:06.150 align:middle line:90%
pulling us back.

00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>> To stand, as
in ancient Egypt.

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Because the point of pharaoh
and the upper and lower

00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:15.950 align:middle line:90%
Nile was why the four wives?

00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:16.880 align:middle line:90%
The four directions?

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:19.340 align:middle line:84%
As we grow from the
mother of the wind,

00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:21.230 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth, and
the sea, do you

00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:23.990 align:middle line:84%
know that we have to honor
her in all of her conditions,

00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:26.270 align:middle line:90%
because this is mother, Gaia.

00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:27.490 align:middle line:90%
And she is our body.

00:49:27.490 --> 00:49:29.390 align:middle line:90%
She is matter, mater, mother.

00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:32.360 align:middle line:84%
So as pharaoh grows, he doesn't
grow from the top down, right?

00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:35.360 align:middle line:84%
He finally stands
erect, continually going

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:38.450 align:middle line:84%
from these roots of
honor, to realize

00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:40.910 align:middle line:84%
that this greater
opening, in a sense,

00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:45.170 align:middle line:84%
into this other knowledge
is not to take him away,

00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:48.020 align:middle line:84%
but to actually fill with
a sense of, do you see?

00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:53.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, you translate as
Egypt greater wisdom,

00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:56.990 align:middle line:84%
which allows that which
cannot be here with you,

00:49:56.990 --> 00:50:00.700 align:middle line:84%
but where your brethren to
create a symbolical structure

00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:04.220 align:middle line:84%
that allows for what we
called celestial [INAUDIBLE]..

00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:05.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Celestial?

00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Celestial [INAUDIBLE],,
meaning the magic of the stars.

00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And all of our
ancient sites-- this

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:13.780 align:middle line:84%
is why you see Orion
and the pyramids--

00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:17.860 align:middle line:84%
why they're all connected is
that those were amplifiers.

00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And they are a different
quality of consciousness,

00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:23.290 align:middle line:84%
which was about
alignment, which was

00:50:23.290 --> 00:50:26.470 align:middle line:84%
about this pyramidal
consciousness rising up

00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:28.990 align:middle line:90%
to see itself as all of this.

00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:31.160 align:middle line:84%
But then you think of the
collapse of the pharaonic.

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:32.170 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:33.410 align:middle line:90%
Going with Moses.

00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:34.600 align:middle line:90%
We're going away from Egypt.

00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:36.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a very fascinating
thing to think

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:39.220 align:middle line:84%
that there's going to be a
collapse of this knowledge,

00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:41.710 align:middle line:84%
to finally put it
back into the soil

00:50:41.710 --> 00:50:45.340 align:middle line:84%
so that we go on a very long
quest to rebuild ourselves,

00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:48.040 align:middle line:84%
because we can't remember
this old alignment.

00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:49.900 align:middle line:84%
In a way, we've changed
our head, as I say.

00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:52.320 align:middle line:84%
We've literally
created a smaller form.

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think this is what we
have to really see is that what

00:50:56.530 --> 00:50:59.790 align:middle line:84%
we are is this a remarkable
challenge of, well,

00:50:59.790 --> 00:51:06.310 align:middle line:84%
what if Osiris really does have
to recombine is this greater

00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Orion knowledge that
if you're based in war,

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:11.270 align:middle line:84%
what are you going
to be dealing with?

00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:13.220 align:middle line:84%
Until finally,
peace is resolved.

00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:17.500 align:middle line:84%
So maybe, as we try to resolve
the peace within ourselves,

00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:19.210 align:middle line:84%
on a holographic
level, we're also

00:51:19.210 --> 00:51:22.540 align:middle line:84%
creating a greater
peace in Orion.

00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:23.340 align:middle line:90%
Do you know?

00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:28.540 align:middle line:84%
As if the perturbation that
we feel is a type of harmonic

00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:29.440 align:middle line:90%
harp.

00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:29.770 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:51:29.770 --> 00:51:30.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:51:30.570 --> 00:51:33.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the ETs have said
this in the interviews,

00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:38.620 align:middle line:84%
that what we're doing here on
this planet as far as honoring

00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:40.840 align:middle line:84%
their neighbor-- if we're
fighting with our neighbor,

00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:43.895 align:middle line:84%
that reflects the ripples
of the space-time continuum.

00:51:43.895 --> 00:51:44.695 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:51:44.695 --> 00:51:45.653 align:middle line:90%
It shows our character.

00:51:45.653 --> 00:51:47.990 align:middle line:84%
>> That's wars in the
Orion star system.

00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:54.940 align:middle line:84%
>> If we can resolve that, then
literally it's not that these

00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:56.650 align:middle line:84%
wars stop on these
higher levels.

00:51:56.650 --> 00:51:59.900 align:middle line:84%
They still are happening
to a certain extent.

00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:04.960 align:middle line:84%
But then they can recognize,
look at this microcosm.

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:06.520 align:middle line:90%
They figured it out.

00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's what part of
this holographic simulation

00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:13.010 align:middle line:90%
is for, created by us, them.

00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:13.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:52:13.810 --> 00:52:16.610 align:middle line:84%
>> And then they can see,
oh, they did it that way.

00:52:16.610 --> 00:52:17.410 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:52:17.410 --> 00:52:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And then now, we can learn
from these micro beings

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:27.563 align:middle line:84%
in this small reality
called planet Earth.

00:52:27.563 --> 00:52:29.230 align:middle line:84%
If they figured it
out that way, then we

00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:33.790 align:middle line:84%
can incorporate that into
our intergalactic wars,

00:52:33.790 --> 00:52:37.030 align:middle line:84%
and then sort of
use that energy,

00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:39.220 align:middle line:84%
use whatever it was
that we were able to hug

00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:41.740 align:middle line:84%
our neighbor in that
time of conflict

00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:46.645 align:middle line:84%
and become closer, which then
dissipates and transmutes

00:52:46.645 --> 00:52:49.310 align:middle line:84%
to that war that's happening on
the other side of the galaxy.

00:52:49.310 --> 00:52:50.110 align:middle line:90%
>> I really do.

00:52:50.110 --> 00:52:53.860 align:middle line:84%
I feel like that's, if
you think of ourselves,

00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:58.540 align:middle line:84%
even what we think of as God as
the overlooked artist, meaning

00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:01.000 align:middle line:84%
all I'm asking is for you
to pay a little attention,

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.200 align:middle line:90%
that this isn't personal.

00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:05.970 align:middle line:84%
It's the quality of, you are
given this remarkable creation.

00:53:05.970 --> 00:53:09.550 align:middle line:84%
It is filled with the conflicts
of that which is unresolved.

00:53:09.550 --> 00:53:12.850 align:middle line:84%
You're filled with universes
that have succeeded and failed.

00:53:12.850 --> 00:53:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And they are going
on simultaneously.

00:53:14.830 --> 00:53:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And like rings in a
tree, you can't go back

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:18.400 align:middle line:90%
to the 16th century ring.

00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:19.200 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:19.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:21.610 align:middle line:84%
>> But you can see you're
part of a living tree,

00:53:21.610 --> 00:53:24.310 align:middle line:84%
that as you create context,
is no longer keeping the tree

00:53:24.310 --> 00:53:26.260 align:middle line:84%
in conflict with
its environment,

00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:27.850 align:middle line:84%
thinking it has an
old war to fight.

00:53:27.850 --> 00:53:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:28.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you know?

00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like that's
when the aura goes, yeah,

00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:31.107 align:middle line:90%
now you're getting it.

00:53:31.107 --> 00:53:36.415 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're starting
to let go of these old,

00:53:36.415 --> 00:53:41.590 align:middle line:84%
in a way, tools of
self-deception that

00:53:41.590 --> 00:53:47.700 align:middle line:84%
kept you alone long enough
to reclaim as a human,

00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:49.380 align:middle line:90%
I no longer need this.

00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:50.672 align:middle line:90%
I will use my fire differently.

00:53:50.672 --> 00:53:51.472 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:51.472 --> 00:53:52.650 align:middle line:90%
>> I choose.

00:53:52.650 --> 00:53:55.440 align:middle line:84%
No longer a cosmology of high
priests saying you must choose.

00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:57.090 align:middle line:84%
No longer a religion
saying if you don't, you're

00:53:57.090 --> 00:53:57.990 align:middle line:90%
going to hell.

00:53:57.990 --> 00:53:58.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:53:58.790 --> 00:54:00.900 align:middle line:84%
>> But finally, this sense
of the humans saying,

00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:02.880 align:middle line:84%
I can honor all
of those beliefs.

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:05.100 align:middle line:84%
But I don't need
to believe them.

00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:06.090 align:middle line:90%
I need to honor them.

00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:06.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:54:06.490 --> 00:54:08.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Therefore, I'll honor
them in the library.

00:54:08.310 --> 00:54:09.935 align:middle line:84%
And I'll find them
inspiring, because I

00:54:09.935 --> 00:54:11.190 align:middle line:90%
don't have to defend them.

00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:11.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:13.645 align:middle line:84%
>> Then I can look at this
way of seeing the world,

00:54:13.645 --> 00:54:14.567 align:middle line:90%
like is it voodoo?

00:54:14.567 --> 00:54:17.025 align:middle line:84%
Not to say, well, that's wrong,
but to say how interesting?

00:54:17.025 --> 00:54:18.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:54:18.130 --> 00:54:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>> That to be human is
to see through this lens,

00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:23.140 align:middle line:90%
this too opens universes.

00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:25.482 align:middle line:84%
>> Not the ones I
like or don't like.

00:54:25.482 --> 00:54:28.020 align:middle line:84%
This is what I found
about art is that we

00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:30.340 align:middle line:90%
have to transcend our opinion.

00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:31.890 align:middle line:90%
We have to transcend our tastes.

00:54:31.890 --> 00:54:32.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:54:32.850 --> 00:54:36.450 align:middle line:84%
>> And to see that the great
emancipation is not in what we

00:54:36.450 --> 00:54:40.470 align:middle line:84%
like, but in the larger vision
of all of these things are

00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:42.060 align:middle line:90%
possible.

00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that's
when the body comes

00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:46.470 align:middle line:84%
back together as a generous
atomic force going, yeah.

00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:50.560 align:middle line:10%
You're not rejecting these atoms
thinking they're the bad ones.

00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:51.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:53.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And that brings us
back to universal Adam.

00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And going back to an earlier
part of our conversation,

00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:58.740 align:middle line:84%
in my third book, "Adam Reborn
and Eve Restored," which

00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:03.750 align:middle line:84%
came from painting Eve on a
pillar, universal Adam says,

00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:07.770 align:middle line:84%
"I called you children forth
from vistas of vast knowing

00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:10.122 align:middle line:90%
to heal my ailing worlds."

00:55:10.122 --> 00:55:11.580 align:middle line:84%
Do you see that
sense of that there

00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:16.123 align:middle line:84%
is this drawing forth of a very
different vista of perception.

00:55:16.123 --> 00:55:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's probably a
lot of what's happening here

00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:21.450 align:middle line:84%
with the ones that are
interested in these things is

00:55:21.450 --> 00:55:26.040 align:middle line:84%
it's to create new contexts, but
also a new agreement about how

00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:29.040 align:middle line:90%
we access, not like scientists.

00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:30.270 align:middle line:90%
Because that's the people.

00:55:30.270 --> 00:55:32.510 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, it's good,
because you build the piano.

00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:34.540 align:middle line:84%
But almost like musicians
coming together and going,

00:55:34.540 --> 00:55:36.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad the instruments have
been constructed, because yours

00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:38.028 align:middle line:84%
are different from
mine, but you're

00:55:38.028 --> 00:55:39.370 align:middle line:90%
on the same page with me.

00:55:39.370 --> 00:55:43.620 align:middle line:84%
So if we trust that difference,
I believe in the mid ground,

00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:47.050 align:middle line:84%
the greater relevance of all
these things has a place to be.

00:55:47.050 --> 00:55:51.090 align:middle line:84%
So long as we're actors in a
monologue saying I'm alone,

00:55:51.090 --> 00:55:53.850 align:middle line:84%
rather than family
members saying, let's

00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:57.900 align:middle line:84%
leave the politics and hatred,
the fighting over religion

00:55:57.900 --> 00:56:01.610 align:middle line:84%
outside, and say what's
going to heal us tonight?

00:56:01.610 --> 00:56:03.720 align:middle line:84%
Because if we're
inspired, then, in a way,

00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:08.660 align:middle line:84%
we dissolve our anger, and
not by being more angry,

00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:10.320 align:middle line:84%
but by beginning to
draw attention to,

00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:12.240 align:middle line:90%
I like this conversation better.

00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that's
a quantum agreement.

00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:15.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
in the outer world.

00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:16.080 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's the heart
saying, you know what?

00:56:17.370 --> 00:56:18.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm exhausted.

00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:19.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>> If you need to fight
me, go out and fight.

00:56:21.570 --> 00:56:22.545 align:middle line:90%
I'm too old.

00:56:22.545 --> 00:56:24.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I mean that
on a lot of levels.

00:56:24.170 --> 00:56:24.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:56:24.450 --> 00:56:25.690 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't do this.

00:56:25.690 --> 00:56:29.430 align:middle line:84%
I can't entertain
the notion that there

00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:32.580 align:middle line:84%
is some smarter person,
some better way.

00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:33.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's what
the library does.

00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:37.130 align:middle line:84%
I think that all of this,
the ancestors, the Chumash,

00:56:37.130 --> 00:56:40.250 align:middle line:84%
the mother, the father
rise up and say, yeah.

00:56:40.250 --> 00:56:42.300 align:middle line:90%
You are remarkable.

00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And you're woven of
the unimaginable.

00:56:45.350 --> 00:56:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Stop thinking you're
this when you're this.

00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:51.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that was just
coming from Guatemala,

00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:54.860 align:middle line:84%
and interviewing
Tata, the Mayan elder.

00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:59.420 align:middle line:84%
That's sort of his main message
is, we're all one people.

00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:00.680 align:middle line:90%
Unity through diversity.

00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:03.400 align:middle line:84%
We all can have
our unique beliefs.

00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:04.490 align:middle line:90%
And we need to honor that.

00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And by honoring that, that's
where we come together.

00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:07.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:10.857 align:middle line:84%
>> And that is also the same
ET message that keeps coming

00:57:10.857 --> 00:57:13.065 align:middle line:84%
through these channelings
is unity through diversity.

00:57:13.065 --> 00:57:13.865 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:57:13.865 --> 00:57:17.240 align:middle line:84%
>> By honoring every
religion, every belief system,

00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:21.420 align:middle line:84%
every archetype, that that is
the glue that will bring us

00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:22.220 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:24.050 align:middle line:84%
That's sort of the
unconditional love

00:57:24.050 --> 00:57:29.180 align:middle line:84%
of non judgment
of the mother love

00:57:29.180 --> 00:57:32.040 align:middle line:84%
that embraces this
entire reality.

00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:32.840 align:middle line:90%
She doesn't judge.

00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:36.800 align:middle line:84%
She allows all things
to seed and to grow.

00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And whatever our judgments
are, it doesn't matter.

00:57:40.550 --> 00:57:41.350 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:57:41.350 --> 00:57:41.930 align:middle line:90%
It exists.

00:57:41.930 --> 00:57:42.980 align:middle line:90%
How can you deny that?

00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:50.150 align:middle line:84%
So to unconditionally
love, to honor all creation

00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:52.430 align:middle line:84%
is the glue that will
bring us all together.

00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:53.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And that is what
will bring us home,

00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:59.150 align:middle line:84%
because the mother of creation
is the mother of all of us.

00:57:59.150 --> 00:58:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's that relevance
that finally says,

00:58:01.730 --> 00:58:04.010 align:middle line:84%
I include all of this,
not to contain it,

00:58:04.010 --> 00:58:08.050 align:middle line:84%
but to finally embrace it with
that which can't be contained,

00:58:08.050 --> 00:58:10.400 align:middle line:84%
but finally, shared
in the sense that I

00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:13.490 align:middle line:84%
honor the wholeness of your
story, and you honor mine.

00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And together, that's how
we change everything.

00:58:16.310 --> 00:58:17.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:58:17.970 --> 00:58:18.910 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:20.745 align:middle line:84%
In the Egyptian temple,
you said there's--

00:58:20.745 --> 00:58:21.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:22.070 align:middle line:90%
The Orion.

00:58:22.070 --> 00:58:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Orion stands
for the masculine?

00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:25.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:58:25.050 --> 00:58:25.380 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:25.640 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And then Sirius
is the feminine.

00:58:27.030 --> 00:58:27.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:58:27.350 --> 00:58:28.150 align:middle line:90%
And the feminine.

00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
serpent, that went through

00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:33.760 align:middle line:84%
with Apollo and Alexander was
transformed from the mother

00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:34.560 align:middle line:90%
serpent.

00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:35.360 align:middle line:90%
Do you see?

00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And even you'd say the
serpent falling on its belly

00:58:38.060 --> 00:58:40.440 align:middle line:84%
is when it moves from being
the mother serpent to being

00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:41.520 align:middle line:90%
the father serpent.

00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:42.960 align:middle line:90%
It's taken over.

00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:46.235 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of this
shift in, in a sense,

00:58:46.235 --> 00:58:48.690 align:middle line:84%
our self perception and our
perception of our relationship

00:58:48.690 --> 00:58:50.620 align:middle line:90%
to the stars.

00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's fascinating, cause
I'm getting from the ETs that

00:58:54.660 --> 00:58:58.940 align:middle line:84%
humanity was this sort of
funneling from the Lyran,

00:58:58.940 --> 00:59:03.465 align:middle line:84%
Vegan lineage into Orion,
Sirius, with the Pleiadians,

00:59:03.465 --> 00:59:06.930 align:middle line:84%
Zetan, and coming down,
funneling into Mars,

00:59:06.930 --> 00:59:11.430 align:middle line:84%
and then Mars then
coming into the Earth.

00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's even said in
some conversations I've

00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:17.920 align:middle line:84%
had that after
Mars was destroyed,

00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:20.250 align:middle line:84%
the civilization
of Mars, then we

00:59:20.250 --> 00:59:26.100 align:middle line:84%
started reincarnating
on Earth to finish out

00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:27.810 align:middle line:90%
those karmic cycles.

00:59:27.810 --> 00:59:28.620 align:middle line:90%
And Atlantis.

00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we
had the destruction

00:59:30.450 --> 00:59:36.030 align:middle line:84%
and fall of Atlantis was still
in that energy of Orion, Mars,

00:59:36.030 --> 00:59:37.910 align:middle line:90%
over masculine energy.

00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:38.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:40.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, and this is
very important,

00:59:40.350 --> 00:59:42.810 align:middle line:84%
because the study
of esoteric doctrine

00:59:42.810 --> 00:59:45.810 align:middle line:84%
teaches that that's
exactly what happens.

00:59:45.810 --> 00:59:48.000 align:middle line:84%
In other words, that we
have bodies within bodies,

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.280 align:middle line:84%
within bodies, and
that they really

00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:53.220 align:middle line:84%
are the outcome and the
orchestration of all

00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:54.990 align:middle line:84%
of these different--
it's like in Egypt

00:59:54.990 --> 00:59:57.840 align:middle line:84%
where when there
was a burial, we saw

00:59:57.840 --> 00:59:59.550 align:middle line:84%
that there wasn't
just one sarcophagus.

00:59:59.550 --> 01:00:02.580 align:middle line:84%
There were sarcophagi
inside of one another,

01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:04.350 align:middle line:84%
because these were
about the truth

01:00:04.350 --> 01:00:08.730 align:middle line:84%
that the body that we exist
in in the material, outer form

01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:12.030 align:middle line:84%
is actually all these different
rings in a tree, qualities

01:00:12.030 --> 01:00:15.210 align:middle line:84%
or conditions of a
greater energetic body.

01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:17.460 align:middle line:84%
So you'd say in this
outer ring, there's

01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:19.570 align:middle line:90%
a certain form of communication.

01:00:19.570 --> 01:00:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And we are connected
to a certain dynamic.

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:25.140 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is that as we
merge into the deeper and deeper

01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:28.380 align:middle line:84%
energetic states, we
begin to realize that,

01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:32.400 align:middle line:84%
oh, in this energetic body
is where this communion

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:34.470 align:middle line:90%
or communication takes place.

01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:36.120 align:middle line:84%
But it's taking
place in reference

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:37.950 align:middle line:90%
to all of these bodies.

01:00:37.950 --> 01:00:40.590 align:middle line:84%
In a way, it's going to be
translated to the outer bark.

01:00:40.590 --> 01:00:43.860 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be translated
into that which interfaces

01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:45.850 align:middle line:90%
with the outer world.

01:00:45.850 --> 01:00:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And much of the inner bodies,
so to speak, aren't in time.

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:51.420 align:middle line:90%
They are in imagination.

01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:52.890 align:middle line:84%
They're not existing
in the way we

01:00:52.890 --> 01:00:55.900 align:middle line:90%
think things exist in duration.

01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And if you think of our
lens more alchemically,

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:01.230 align:middle line:84%
we'll begin to realize
that it's never that we

01:01:01.230 --> 01:01:02.945 align:middle line:90%
change these properties.

01:01:02.945 --> 01:01:04.320 align:middle line:84%
We begin to, over
and over again,

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:07.320 align:middle line:90%
realize that there are layers.

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:11.130 align:middle line:84%
There are qualities, and
that part of our knowledge

01:01:11.130 --> 01:01:13.530 align:middle line:84%
now is to understand,
as with Sirius--

01:01:13.530 --> 01:01:18.530 align:middle line:84%
let's say Newt, the sky
goddess, and Geb, her consort--

01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:24.450 align:middle line:84%
this story that the vault of
heaven, the oneness, the stars,

01:01:24.450 --> 01:01:26.910 align:middle line:84%
the great mother who
is the mother of all

01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:28.380 align:middle line:90%
creates the vault. Do you see?

01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:29.760 align:middle line:90%
The womb.

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And Geb we see falling
backward, squaring the circle.

01:01:33.170 --> 01:01:35.580 align:middle line:90%
He's creating the right angle.

01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:38.590 align:middle line:90%
Because Geb has his arm up.

01:01:38.590 --> 01:01:39.390 align:middle line:90%
Do you see?

01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:41.970 align:middle line:90%
A right angle to her fullness.

01:01:41.970 --> 01:01:44.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's this truth,
as Pythagoras

01:01:44.070 --> 01:01:46.030 align:middle line:90%
said, god geometrizes.

01:01:46.030 --> 01:01:47.220 align:middle line:90%
But we forgot to ask.

01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And Pythagoras,
who was an initiate

01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:51.300 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient Egyptians
would have said,

01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:53.850 align:middle line:84%
you have to ask what
God geometrizes.

01:01:53.850 --> 01:01:54.850 align:middle line:90%
Why the right angle?

01:01:54.850 --> 01:01:55.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:01:55.650 --> 01:01:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>> God geometrizes the
fullness of absolute oneness,

01:01:59.550 --> 01:02:01.230 align:middle line:90%
of universality.

01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:03.120 align:middle line:90%
The falling backward of Geb--

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:06.900 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, the dance of the
falling backward into time

01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:10.200 align:middle line:84%
is this turning toward
the horizon line

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:12.660 align:middle line:84%
of essentially the
event horizon, what

01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:15.030 align:middle line:90%
we are bringing our story to.

01:02:15.030 --> 01:02:17.130 align:middle line:84%
So the relationship
of these qualities

01:02:17.130 --> 01:02:20.640 align:middle line:84%
was to translate the
heavenly fullness

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.920 align:middle line:90%
through squaring the circle.

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And with that squaring of the
circle, think of a right angle.

01:02:25.830 --> 01:02:26.630 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:28.440 align:middle line:90%
>> It slows down the light.

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:31.790 align:middle line:90%
You begin to create sequence.

01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And as the mandalas
teach here, you

01:02:33.930 --> 01:02:38.010 align:middle line:84%
start to see how one
completeness creates

01:02:38.010 --> 01:02:38.985 align:middle line:90%
the next context.

01:02:38.985 --> 01:02:41.580 align:middle line:84%
So you're not ever dealing
with incompleteness.

01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:43.800 align:middle line:84%
You're dealing with a
deeper fractal mathematical,

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:44.160 align:middle line:90%
geometrical.

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:44.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:44.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:02:44.910 --> 01:02:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>> That as we square the
circle, we realize that--

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:49.230 align:middle line:84%
and there's a wonderful
alchemical image.

01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And actually, in my
empress archetype,

01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:56.220 align:middle line:84%
I quote it, which is the
square holding the circle,

01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:59.280 align:middle line:84%
holding the triangle,
holding the circle.

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:01.680 align:middle line:84%
What this is talking
about is the square,

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:03.180 align:middle line:90%
the structure, the dynamics.

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:06.720 align:middle line:90%
The matrix holds the universe.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:10.150 align:middle line:84%
In other words, that a greater
structure holds eternity.

01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And from eternity, we
have the triangulation.

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:16.060 align:middle line:84%
In the Tarot it would be we have
the magus, the high priestess,

01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:16.860 align:middle line:90%
and the empress.

01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:19.180 align:middle line:10%
And you might look at
these also as star people,

01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:22.030 align:middle line:10%
meaning that I think the
high priestess in the Tarot

01:03:22.030 --> 01:03:26.380 align:middle line:10%
has a great deal
to do with Sirius.

01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:29.020 align:middle line:84%
Because she is the dark
matter, mater, mother.

01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:33.280 align:middle line:84%
She is the pupil of the eye,
that which cannot be seen.

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:36.820 align:middle line:84%
Nor can she be betrayed, because
she is not in the optics.

01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:39.730 align:middle line:84%
This is where Lilith comes
from, Kali, these qualities

01:03:39.730 --> 01:03:44.470 align:middle line:84%
of the dark feminine that devour
narcissism, that essentially

01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:47.110 align:middle line:84%
will not, as this
vast, dark ocean,

01:03:47.110 --> 01:03:49.690 align:middle line:90%
allow a type of unnaturalness.

01:03:49.690 --> 01:03:52.360 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's very interesting
in the above, where Newt

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:54.760 align:middle line:84%
appears in this
story, at her heart

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:57.690 align:middle line:84%
is an infant, meaning that
isn't human innocence, where

01:03:57.690 --> 01:04:00.250 align:middle line:84%
we are not deciding what
we were for or against.

01:04:00.250 --> 01:04:03.230 align:middle line:84%
But when we finally hold
ourselves in context,

01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:06.560 align:middle line:84%
you see, that these greater
energies don't devour us.

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's why she's
a very powerful--

01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:10.720 align:middle line:84%
you think of the
mother of the universe.

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:11.520 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:13.600 align:middle line:90%
The dark matter, mater, mother.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:16.480 align:middle line:84%
She's not interested
in how you're feeling.

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:20.590 align:middle line:84%
It's that you will emerge
from within the context of how

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:22.000 align:middle line:90%
you honor me.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.110 align:middle line:90%
What questions do you ask?

01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And I will take you through a
journey, like being shot at,

01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:31.390 align:middle line:84%
or fire, to begin to strip
away all of your sense

01:04:31.390 --> 01:04:33.550 align:middle line:90%
that it's a type of lesson.

01:04:33.550 --> 01:04:37.120 align:middle line:84%
It's actually
encounters in our life

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:40.610 align:middle line:84%
that reach a point where
we are ready for them.

01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:45.760 align:middle line:84%
>> So finally, this funnel that
comes in from these lineages,

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:51.100 align:middle line:84%
from these cosmic
space archetypes,

01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:53.710 align:middle line:84%
as well as all of
these other archetypes,

01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:56.530 align:middle line:84%
it seems to funnel
into planet Earth.

01:04:56.530 --> 01:05:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And then what we see now
in our cosmic space lore

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:04.690 align:middle line:90%
is the hybrid children.

01:05:04.690 --> 01:05:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned this
yesterday, or earlier we

01:05:09.650 --> 01:05:11.800 align:middle line:84%
were doing a sound
bowl meditation here.

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And I felt this
tugging on my pants.

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:15.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:16.732 align:middle line:90%
>> And I was like what is that?

01:05:16.732 --> 01:05:21.490 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing that
comes to my mind, which

01:05:21.490 --> 01:05:28.113 align:middle line:84%
I like to go to as my default
for truth, hybrid children.

01:05:28.113 --> 01:05:29.530 align:middle line:84%
They were saying,
don't forget us.

01:05:29.530 --> 01:05:30.330 align:middle line:90%
Don't forget us.

01:05:30.330 --> 01:05:32.230 align:middle line:84%
Cause I was thinking
about the interview,

01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:34.540 align:middle line:90%
which races I'm going to cover.

01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And so it's the symbology of
the children in this lore that's

01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:45.040 align:middle line:90%
being set up in my series.

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:54.025 align:middle line:84%
It's mostly a race created by
the Zetas, hybrid human Zetas.

01:05:54.025 --> 01:05:56.800 align:middle line:90%


01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:59.230 align:middle line:84%
But they also say
there's Pleiadian.

01:05:59.230 --> 01:06:02.200 align:middle line:84%
There's a mix of all these
other races in there.

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:05.620 align:middle line:90%


01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And there's people
all over the planet.

01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:12.727 align:middle line:84%
Mothers seem to be the
first ones, but fathers too.

01:06:12.727 --> 01:06:14.560 align:middle line:84%
The mothers seem to be
a little more in tune

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:15.850 align:middle line:84%
and are having
these conversations.

01:06:15.850 --> 01:06:17.350 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed--
I have episodes

01:06:17.350 --> 01:06:20.260 align:middle line:84%
about mothers who
are in communication

01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:22.000 align:middle line:90%
with their hybrid children.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And all of the ETs
that I've talked

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:25.910 align:middle line:84%
to, all of the channeled
material that I've talked to,

01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:28.535 align:middle line:84%
every time I mention the hybrid
children they're like, oh, yes.

01:06:28.535 --> 01:06:32.060 align:middle line:90%
That's the reality.

01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:34.330 align:middle line:84%
Even though these people
don't know each other,

01:06:34.330 --> 01:06:40.988 align:middle line:84%
this hybrid children theme
is a big theme in all this.

01:06:40.988 --> 01:06:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And they sort of say, this
is where we're headed.

01:06:43.030 --> 01:06:46.930 align:middle line:84%
This is the next
phase in our evolution

01:06:46.930 --> 01:06:50.170 align:middle line:84%
is these children are going
to be the first ambassadors

01:06:50.170 --> 01:06:51.740 align:middle line:90%
to this new Earth.

01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:52.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:58.090 align:middle line:84%
>> And the stories
that are being told is,

01:06:58.090 --> 01:07:02.500 align:middle line:84%
why the children is because if
it was just some space being

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:06.670 align:middle line:84%
to come down here in
a ship or something--

01:07:06.670 --> 01:07:08.500 align:middle line:84%
we're sort of used
to that idea--

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:12.980 align:middle line:84%
then we would probably
blast them out of the sky,

01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:14.480 align:middle line:84%
or try to dissect
them or something.

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:16.780 align:middle line:84%
But if it's our actual
physical children,

01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:20.452 align:middle line:84%
if these children
are born from--

01:07:20.452 --> 01:07:22.660 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily born from
us, or told that they're --

01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:24.070 align:middle line:84%
they may come down
in spacecraft.

01:07:24.070 --> 01:07:26.830 align:middle line:84%
But then they're told,
this is your child.

01:07:26.830 --> 01:07:28.450 align:middle line:90%
This child has your DNA.

01:07:28.450 --> 01:07:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Take a DNA test, and this
child comes from your blood.

01:07:32.410 --> 01:07:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And the mothers are
feeling this connection.

01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:38.530 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be less
likely to give that child up

01:07:38.530 --> 01:07:39.500 align:middle line:90%
to be dissected.

01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:40.300 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:41.925 align:middle line:84%
That even goes back
to religious texts,

01:07:41.925 --> 01:07:46.890 align:middle line:84%
about, in a way, the mother
and the angelic union.

01:07:46.890 --> 01:07:48.610 align:middle line:84%
That goes back into
all of our texts.

01:07:48.610 --> 01:07:49.700 align:middle line:90%
It's not new.

01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:50.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:07:50.050 --> 01:07:50.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And the more you study
really ancient doctrine,

01:07:52.730 --> 01:07:54.580 align:middle line:84%
you realize that
this conversation

01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:58.160 align:middle line:84%
of the hybridization
of a species,

01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:01.690 align:middle line:84%
meaning that you can't just
shoot it up and change it.

01:08:01.690 --> 01:08:03.080 align:middle line:90%
You have to grow it from Gaia.

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:03.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:07.540 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the key is it's the
inseminating of, in a sense,

01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:12.130 align:middle line:84%
the egg of Gaia, that finally
she grows her children,

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:15.310 align:middle line:84%
who are the outcome of
this great evolution.

01:08:15.310 --> 01:08:17.319 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that if we
begin to understand

01:08:17.319 --> 01:08:20.620 align:middle line:84%
that the DNA that
will reveal finally

01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:22.510 align:middle line:84%
that it is the
triumph of the womb

01:08:22.510 --> 01:08:25.270 align:middle line:84%
that we're conditioned to
buy, meaning that we now,

01:08:25.270 --> 01:08:28.990 align:middle line:84%
through the womb, are able
to hold all of these systems.

01:08:28.990 --> 01:08:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, because we are,
essentially we're

01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:36.100 align:middle line:84%
able to draw forth qualities of
our own greater consciousness

01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:39.250 align:middle line:84%
that really are from
vistas of perception

01:08:39.250 --> 01:08:42.430 align:middle line:84%
and being that, in
a way, can show up,

01:08:42.430 --> 01:08:44.770 align:middle line:84%
because the transformation
of the human story

01:08:44.770 --> 01:08:48.399 align:middle line:84%
is when we're not telling
a story about leaving,

01:08:48.399 --> 01:08:49.660 align:middle line:90%
but about staying.

01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Understanding
ourselves as flowers,

01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:54.229 align:middle line:84%
no longer trying to
say this is the end.

01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:55.029 align:middle line:90%
But no.

01:08:55.029 --> 01:08:56.330 align:middle line:90%
This compression leads to this.

01:08:56.330 --> 01:08:57.130 align:middle line:90%
Do you see?

01:08:57.130 --> 01:08:59.668 align:middle line:84%
Once we start to
open, the blossoming.

01:08:59.668 --> 01:09:00.710 align:middle line:90%
Even look at Renaissance.

01:09:00.710 --> 01:09:02.890 align:middle line:84%
You'd say, what is
it that shows up

01:09:02.890 --> 01:09:06.460 align:middle line:84%
when we start to trust our
greater sense that together,

01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:10.180 align:middle line:84%
by sharing story, we animate
the possibility of such a thing?

01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:12.010 align:middle line:90%
That's why I do feel that--

01:09:12.010 --> 01:09:14.050 align:middle line:84%
my granddaughter was born
right after the fires.

01:09:14.050 --> 01:09:14.319 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:09:14.319 --> 01:09:14.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:15.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Nine days.

01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:19.069 align:middle line:84%
My daughter is in anguish
with nine months pregnant.

01:09:19.069 --> 01:09:20.439 align:middle line:90%
There's this trial by fire.

01:09:20.439 --> 01:09:24.010 align:middle line:84%
She nearly dies during giving
birth, but she is born.

01:09:24.010 --> 01:09:28.870 align:middle line:84%
Laten Phoenix, my granddaughter,
is born nine days later

01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:31.220 align:middle line:84%
when the roads open up, and
we're able to get there.

01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:32.649 align:middle line:90%
But again, a traumatic birth.

01:09:32.649 --> 01:09:35.200 align:middle line:84%
So everything is telling
us the same story,

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:38.850 align:middle line:84%
that we are in a time of
ordeal and great trauma.

01:09:38.850 --> 01:09:41.529 align:middle line:90%
But that that's not the key.

01:09:41.529 --> 01:09:44.050 align:middle line:84%
It's that through this
ordeal and trauma,

01:09:44.050 --> 01:09:46.000 align:middle line:84%
we will come out the
other side realizing,

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.740 align:middle line:90%
yes, we are on the news.

01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:50.740 align:middle line:84%
We cannot stand
against a tsunami.

01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:52.420 align:middle line:90%
We cannot challenge the stars.

01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And our opinion
doesn't matter a damn.

01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:58.150 align:middle line:84%
I really do feel like
it brings us back to,

01:09:58.150 --> 01:10:00.070 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't even care
about my opinion.

01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:00.210 align:middle line:90%
Do you know?

01:10:00.210 --> 01:10:02.950 align:middle line:84%
I should be more curious than to
have to defend a point of view.

01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:03.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:04.020 align:middle line:90%
Right.

01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is why I do
feel that the Aquarian from

01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:07.900 align:middle line:90%
the Piscian.

01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:10.780 align:middle line:84%
The Piscian model
was parental, child.

01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:13.190 align:middle line:84%
Authority will tell you
what you need to do.

01:10:13.190 --> 01:10:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And if you are obedient, and
you give back to authority,

01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:17.590 align:middle line:90%
you will be rewarded.

01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:19.660 align:middle line:84%
You'll be able to find
yourself in relationship

01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:23.110 align:middle line:84%
to how you are in relationship
to that authority.

01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:25.340 align:middle line:84%
But it will all be
outward, because this

01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:26.690 align:middle line:90%
is a parental structure.

01:10:26.690 --> 01:10:30.290 align:middle line:84%
The father always
treating you to the sense

01:10:30.290 --> 01:10:32.810 align:middle line:90%
of the law, not the empathy.

01:10:32.810 --> 01:10:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And you have to look at this
as a developmental stage that

01:10:35.930 --> 01:10:38.690 align:middle line:84%
taught us the structure,
taught us the form.

01:10:38.690 --> 01:10:40.557 align:middle line:84%
This is Hermes saying,
as above, so below.

01:10:40.557 --> 01:10:42.140 align:middle line:84%
Because the mother
goddess says, well,

01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:43.790 align:middle line:90%
why do you want to leave me?

01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And he says, we can't
develop the instrument.

01:10:46.810 --> 01:10:48.920 align:middle line:90%
We'll always be present in love.

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:50.310 align:middle line:84%
But unless we take
the adventure,

01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:51.890 align:middle line:84%
as Jung would say,
into the basement,

01:10:51.890 --> 01:10:55.253 align:middle line:84%
into the unconscious, and the
adventure of the imagination,

01:10:55.253 --> 01:10:57.170 align:middle line:84%
and understand these
things will draw us apart

01:10:57.170 --> 01:11:00.230 align:middle line:84%
for a very long time,
until we come full circle,

01:11:00.230 --> 01:11:02.300 align:middle line:84%
like the Tarot,
like the mandala,

01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:05.670 align:middle line:84%
and understand that
we are the outcome

01:11:05.670 --> 01:11:07.910 align:middle line:90%
finally to honor the children.

01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Because it's very
interesting that the infant,

01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:11.330 align:middle line:84%
the child is so
much a part of this.

01:11:11.330 --> 01:11:12.210 align:middle line:90%
The mother as well.

01:11:12.210 --> 01:11:14.110 align:middle line:90%
Because it's not me.

01:11:14.110 --> 01:11:17.480 align:middle line:84%
It's this deeper story
that we have forgotten

01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:22.100 align:middle line:84%
the greatest daring and honor
is our willingness to be born,

01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:25.010 align:middle line:84%
and that the chalice in here
is over the spines of all

01:11:25.010 --> 01:11:27.000 align:middle line:84%
the books of religion,
as if to say,

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.120 align:middle line:84%
you couldn't understand
the grail of wisdom

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:33.110 align:middle line:84%
and of the human heart until
you saw it on the spines of all

01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:34.510 align:middle line:90%
of your traditions.

01:11:34.510 --> 01:11:38.150 align:middle line:84%
So that you say, I honor
Judaism, Christianity, Islam,

01:11:38.150 --> 01:11:42.170 align:middle line:84%
ancient Egypt, because I realize
there's a wisdom to each.

01:11:42.170 --> 01:11:43.430 align:middle line:90%
None are wrong.

01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:45.005 align:middle line:84%
They're all asking
the same question.

01:11:45.005 --> 01:11:45.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:11:45.890 --> 01:11:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And we had to do it in
a way to defend ourselves,

01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:50.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm convinced, until we
could finally come back

01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:53.898 align:middle line:84%
to the library, come back
to the genetic structure,

01:11:53.898 --> 01:11:55.940 align:middle line:84%
and understand that, in
the same way the pancreas

01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:58.720 align:middle line:84%
doesn't understand the kidneys,
the kidneys, the heart,

01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:02.660 align:middle line:84%
in the deeper flow of the blood
they all recognize one another,

01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:05.900 align:middle line:84%
because they're all nourished
by the same quality.

01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And once we see
that, I really do

01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:09.560 align:middle line:84%
feel like that's when
the sap of consciousness

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:12.260 align:middle line:84%
starts coming back
into our perception,

01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:15.170 align:middle line:84%
and we start, in a
way, allowing the flow

01:12:15.170 --> 01:12:16.760 align:middle line:90%
to come back into ourself.

01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:19.270 align:middle line:84%
We've put all the
pieces together.

01:12:19.270 --> 01:12:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And now it's, how
do we connect it

01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:24.530 align:middle line:84%
so the energy can
flow through us?

01:12:24.530 --> 01:12:26.960 align:middle line:84%
Because we've built
all the parts.

01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's, I think,
our great quest now.

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>> And the children is the
reassemblage of all the parts.

01:12:34.970 --> 01:12:38.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Because children-- and this
is something very important.

01:12:38.330 --> 01:12:42.870 align:middle line:84%
We were taught the inner child,
but it is human innocence.

01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:45.050 align:middle line:90%
This is the gift of the gods.

01:12:45.050 --> 01:12:48.200 align:middle line:84%
I give you the gift
of non remembering.

01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:51.020 align:middle line:84%
You will no longer be able
to remember your story.

01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:53.120 align:middle line:84%
But I give you the
gift of innocence.

01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:55.790 align:middle line:84%
In not knowing, you
will have the foolhardy

01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:58.610 align:middle line:90%
daring to try and figure it out.

01:12:58.610 --> 01:13:01.025 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, you'll
take all of these journeys

01:13:01.025 --> 01:13:02.450 align:middle line:84%
of what does it
mean to be human?

01:13:02.450 --> 01:13:05.015 align:middle line:84%
And they'll all be warring,
and this and that, til finally

01:13:05.015 --> 01:13:08.510 align:middle line:84%
you come home as family, and
as a father, as a mother.

01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:09.740 align:middle line:90%
Say, you know what?

01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:10.650 align:middle line:90%
It's about love.

01:13:10.650 --> 01:13:13.300 align:middle line:84%
It's about what the children
are finally bringing.

01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:14.370 align:middle line:90%
They're the story.

01:13:14.370 --> 01:13:15.170 align:middle line:90%
Do you know?

01:13:15.170 --> 01:13:17.580 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, their
wonder is the story.

01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And if we celebrate by doing
this, then they start to say,

01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:22.850 align:middle line:90%
look up at the stars again.

01:13:22.850 --> 01:13:25.320 align:middle line:84%
We haven't forgotten that
they're the things of wonder

01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:26.870 align:middle line:90%
yet.

01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And think of a whole
generation coming and going,

01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:31.310 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:33.110 align:middle line:90%
You guys are exhausted.

01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:34.970 align:middle line:84%
You battled your
way to the door.

01:13:34.970 --> 01:13:38.020 align:middle line:84%
Now you're exchanging
a sword for a lantern.

01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:39.450 align:middle line:90%
And we'll show you the way.

01:13:39.450 --> 01:13:40.710 align:middle line:90%
There's light here.

01:13:40.710 --> 01:13:41.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:43.238 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

01:13:43.238 --> 01:13:44.340 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Lee.

01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:48.830 align:middle line:84%
This has been an amazing,
amazing conversation on so many

01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:49.970 align:middle line:90%
levels, beyond cosmic.

01:13:49.970 --> 01:13:50.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:13:50.770 --> 01:13:51.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:53.410 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know if
there's a word for it.

01:13:53.410 --> 01:13:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>> I kind of feel like that's--
this is the conversation,

01:13:55.850 --> 01:13:59.810 align:middle line:84%
where channeling becomes the
opening of the doors, that,

01:13:59.810 --> 01:14:02.270 align:middle line:84%
like acting, begin to
trust, yeah, of course.

01:14:02.270 --> 01:14:03.070 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:04.460 align:middle line:84%
If I threw you a
couple of characters,

01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:05.875 align:middle line:90%
you'd be able to jump into them.

01:14:05.875 --> 01:14:06.675 align:middle line:90%
Do you know?

01:14:06.675 --> 01:14:09.420 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I think that
this is the delight now.

01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:10.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:11.178 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's have more fun.

01:14:11.178 --> 01:14:12.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I love it.

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:12.880 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:13.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm laughing.

01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:15.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm laughing at getting
shot, laughing at the fire.

01:14:15.930 --> 01:14:16.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:14:16.730 --> 01:14:17.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:14:17.450 --> 01:14:19.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Bringing back the
innocence, this is it.

01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:19.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
the key is we finally

01:14:24.050 --> 01:14:26.670 align:middle line:84%
understand this is something
worthy of our protection.

01:14:26.670 --> 01:14:28.670 align:middle line:84%
That's what the grail
was, if we think about it.

01:14:28.670 --> 01:14:31.670 align:middle line:84%
The grail was that
ideal in the human heart

01:14:31.670 --> 01:14:34.220 align:middle line:84%
that we need to defend,
because it doesn't

01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:35.897 align:middle line:90%
want to prove something to us.

01:14:35.897 --> 01:14:37.730 align:middle line:84%
It wants us to prove
something to ourselves.

01:14:37.730 --> 01:14:40.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:41.050 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:14:41.050 --> 01:14:41.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:42.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Can I give you a hug?

01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:42.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

01:14:42.350 --> 01:14:43.030 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

01:14:43.030 --> 01:14:43.930 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

01:14:43.930 --> 01:14:44.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:14:44.830 --> 01:14:45.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:14:45.230 --> 01:14:46.030 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:14:46.030 --> 01:14:48.330 align:middle line:90%


01:14:48.330 --> 01:14:51.110 align:middle line:10%
In the story of the
hieroglyph of the human soul,

01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:53.210 align:middle line:10%
this journey that
across the ages

01:14:53.210 --> 01:14:55.580 align:middle line:10%
we've been asking
over and over again,

01:14:55.580 --> 01:14:57.320 align:middle line:10%
what does it mean to be human?

01:14:57.320 --> 01:15:00.290 align:middle line:10%
And we couldn't know the
answer until we had established

01:15:00.290 --> 01:15:04.820 align:middle line:10%
that question across vast
amounts of time and contexts

01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:07.220 align:middle line:10%
so that finally we would
be given the gift that

01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:10.020 align:middle line:10%
says, as you enter
this and I enter this,

01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:13.010 align:middle line:10%
as Daniel enters this, as
another person enters this,

01:15:13.010 --> 01:15:17.240 align:middle line:10%
it really is as the
function of a cosmic womb,

01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:21.050 align:middle line:10%
saying I want to remind you
that no matter what Lee says,

01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:22.140 align:middle line:10%
it's his story.

01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:22.940 align:middle line:90%
Like the Tarot.

01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:23.210 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:15:23.210 --> 01:15:24.710 align:middle line:84%
I might tell you what
this and the other thing.

01:15:24.710 --> 01:15:25.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:27.440 align:middle line:84%
>> But let that be
a jumping off point,

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:30.140 align:middle line:84%
because it wants
to talk with you.

01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:32.100 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't want
me to talk for it.

01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:34.610 align:middle line:84%
It wants, essentially,
almost you'd say,

01:15:34.610 --> 01:15:37.790 align:middle line:90%
like one who introduces.

01:15:37.790 --> 01:15:39.920 align:middle line:84%
You're much more
interesting than you think.

01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:42.830 align:middle line:84%
You're the tool to your own
creative and imaginative

01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:43.850 align:middle line:90%
awareness.

01:15:43.850 --> 01:15:44.930 align:middle line:90%
And guess what.

01:15:44.930 --> 01:15:48.680 align:middle line:84%
You came to this
planet to figure out

01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:51.620 align:middle line:84%
how to integrate it
into how you live,

01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:54.650 align:middle line:84%
not to be who you are,
but to truly become

01:15:54.650 --> 01:15:57.830 align:middle line:84%
that quality that willingly,
over and over again,

01:15:57.830 --> 01:16:01.160 align:middle line:84%
steps into the question of
life, brings a book back

01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:04.880 align:middle line:84%
to the library because it's
been lived, over and over

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:07.850 align:middle line:84%
again, to realize we're part
of an enormous conversation.

01:16:07.850 --> 01:16:12.940 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I'm glad you're
having your conversation.

01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:26.000 align:middle line:90%
