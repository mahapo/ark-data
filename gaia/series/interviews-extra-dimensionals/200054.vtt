00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.670 align:middle line:84%
>> I jumped off the
cliff and I was caught.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.830 align:middle line:84%
Each time I took that leap
and committed to trusting

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.980 align:middle line:84%
and surrendering in that way,
I was caught again and again,

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.730 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes, really,
at the last moment.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.860 align:middle line:10%
Like, I would still say, OK,
I trust, I trust, I surrender.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.190 align:middle line:10%
And now it's like I reached the
point where I really trust it.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.398 align:middle line:90%
So it's easier now.

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:34.386 align:middle line:90%

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.080 align:middle line:84%
We want you to bring more
silence and more stillness

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.880 align:middle line:90%
into your life.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:06.970 align:middle line:90%


00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And a great way to do this is by
becoming aware of your breath.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.110 align:middle line:90%


00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.823 align:middle line:84%
Let yourself become
slow and follow

00:01:17.823 --> 00:01:18.990 align:middle line:90%
the movements of the breath.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.150 align:middle line:90%


00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.980 align:middle line:90%
And let the thoughts go crazy.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Let the energy in your
body move as it wants to.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:41.930 align:middle line:90%


00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.380 align:middle line:84%
Because whether you are
still in that moment,

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.980 align:middle line:84%
or whether you are
all stressed out,

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.875 align:middle line:84%
it is not changing the
situation of that moment.

00:01:53.875 --> 00:01:57.240 align:middle line:90%


00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.920 align:middle line:84%
But what it will
change is the future

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.850 align:middle line:90%
that you are manifesting.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.870 align:middle line:84%
Because right now,
and in every moment,

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.039 align:middle line:84%
you are creating
your own future based

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:18.240 align:middle line:84%
on your level of consciousness,
your level of presence,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.580 align:middle line:90%
your vibration.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:29.680 align:middle line:90%


00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And the most effective way that
you can get yourself on track

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.530 align:middle line:84%
is to be connected within
yourself to your higher self.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And the way to connect
to your higher self

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:52.330 align:middle line:84%
is through the silence,
through the stillness,

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.830 align:middle line:84%
through the heart, through
allowing what is here.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:10.080 align:middle line:90%

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Louise, hi.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Welcome.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.780 align:middle line:84%
>> We're in LA, and this
is your first time here?

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:26.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.452 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:03:27.452 --> 00:03:29.197 align:middle line:90%
How do you like it so far?

00:03:29.197 --> 00:03:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it so far.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.790 align:middle line:84%
>> It's meeting all
my expectations.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:33.590 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.080 align:middle line:90%
What were those expectations?

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Sun.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.963 align:middle line:90%
>> Sun, yeah, we got that.

00:03:36.963 --> 00:03:38.105 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful scenery.

00:03:38.105 --> 00:03:39.980 align:middle line:84%
Like we went out this
morning, and there were

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.350 align:middle line:84%
palm trees and
then the mountains

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.150 align:middle line:84%
just kind of-- the
backdrop for the town.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>> It's just amazing.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:47.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent, excellent.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And the people are so
relaxed and open and friendly.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.640 align:middle line:84%
Just the energy here is like
really chill and laid back

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.700 align:middle line:90%
and yeah--

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>> We get a lot of
sun, so you get--

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.928 align:middle line:90%


00:03:59.928 --> 00:04:01.220 align:middle line:90%
it's like the movies, you know?

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Happy days.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.130 align:middle line:90%
Where are you from?

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm originally from
the north of England.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.830 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.450 align:middle line:90%
So is there a lot of rain there?

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.600 align:middle line:90%
>> A lot of rain.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.820 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, big difference, right?

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:11.737 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm like maxed out.

00:04:11.737 --> 00:04:12.890 align:middle line:90%
I've overdosed on rain.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Overdosed on it, OK.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I'm deprived of sun.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.210 align:middle line:84%
So every chance I get, I'm
just soaking up the rays.

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:19.010 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:20.850 align:middle line:90%
Is that where you--

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.610 align:middle line:90%
are you in the north of England?

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:23.720 align:middle line:90%
Exactly where?

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.190 align:middle line:90%
I've never been to England, so--

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.060 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a county
called Lancashire.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.860 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.600 align:middle line:84%
>> It's about 45-minute
drive north of Manchester

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.400 align:middle line:90%
and Liverpool.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Most people know
those two cities.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.148 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's just south of an
area called the Lake District,

00:04:36.148 --> 00:04:38.630 align:middle line:84%
which is a really
beautiful nature area.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:39.940 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.370 align:middle line:90%
And do you live there now still?

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.170 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.790 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.950 align:middle line:84%
I left there when I was like
18, when I went to university.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And then I kind of never really
went back-- just to visit.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't really live
anywhere right now.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.660 align:middle line:90%
Well, planet Earth.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Planet Earth.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>> You could say, yeah, I've
been traveling for like 3

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:59.960 align:middle line:90%
and 1/2 years now.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>> So I usually spend like
three to six months in one place

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.900 align:middle line:84%
and just go where
my heart calls me--

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.480 align:middle line:84%
sometimes shorter, like
one week here in LA.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.030 align:middle line:90%
You're a channel.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And any other labels
you would give

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.910 align:middle line:84%
yourself other than
channeling right now?

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.180 align:middle line:90%
Or what would you call yourself?

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I prefer not to use labels
because I think any kind

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.570 align:middle line:84%
of label is really limiting
what we really are.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And what we really
are, our true essence,

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.000 align:middle line:90%
it can't really be named.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Well said.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.290 align:middle line:90%
Very well said.

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.045 align:middle line:90%
So you are you.

00:05:41.045 --> 00:05:42.190 align:middle line:90%
>> And I'm also you.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.190 align:middle line:90%
>> And you're also me.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.780 align:middle line:90%
Exactly, exactly, exactly.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.900 align:middle line:90%


00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.790 align:middle line:90%
So what are you doing now?

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.020 align:middle line:90%
What excites you?

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.280 align:middle line:90%
What is your-- in your--

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>> What excites me is
this work that I'm doing.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.310 align:middle line:84%
Like it doesn't even feel
right to call it work in a way

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.310 align:middle line:84%
because the idea we have
of work is a little bit,

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.040 align:middle line:90%
kind of heavy or negative.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.740 align:middle line:84%
It's more like I'm
just living my passion

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.780 align:middle line:84%
and allowing this creative
expression to flow

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.300 align:middle line:90%
through me how it wants to.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm channeling mostly
a Pleiadian Collective that

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.030 align:middle line:90%
refer to themselves as Aikon.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And I work with people
one-on-one channeling,

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.660 align:middle line:90%
and I do group events.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And I also work
with people doing

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.725 align:middle line:90%
what I call Embodied Awareness.

00:06:29.725 --> 00:06:30.525 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:06:30.525 --> 00:06:31.880 align:middle line:90%
And can you explain that?

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, Embodied Awareness
is to sit together and rest

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.290 align:middle line:84%
as pure awareness and
meet from this space,

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:44.120 align:middle line:84%
which is very safe and
unconditionally loving,

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.660 align:middle line:84%
which is a space where
everything is welcome.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And in the moment,
whatever rises up

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.510 align:middle line:84%
or whatever wants
to be explored,

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.430 align:middle line:84%
we meet that from
unconditional love.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And a very deep
healing can take place

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:05.210 align:middle line:84%
because there's parts in
us that we tend to repress

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.870 align:middle line:84%
or shove down, or we
label and judge as bad.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:13.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm not spiritual if I
experience anger or sadness,

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.940 align:middle line:90%
all these negative emotions.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.210 align:middle line:84%
I invite people to look at
that differently and really

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:22.010 align:middle line:84%
explore those
aspects of ourselves

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.770 align:middle line:90%
so that they can integrate.

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And did that come through
the channeling work

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:28.460 align:middle line:90%
that you've done?

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:33.740 align:middle line:84%
Or how did you come to
do that, do this work?

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's hard to
really draw the line,

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:39.890 align:middle line:84%
like this is channeling,
and this is just kind

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:48.250 align:middle line:84%
of what's developed as a product
of my own personal experience

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:49.490 align:middle line:90%
in a spiritual journey.

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:54.380 align:middle line:84%
Because it feels sometimes
like the two merge as one.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also learning
from what I channel.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:58.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm applying that in my own
life, and I'm learning from it

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.243 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sharing it
with other people.

00:08:01.243 --> 00:08:03.410 align:middle line:84%
I think the major difference
is that when I channel,

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:06.590 align:middle line:84%
there's a distinctive energy
that comes with the channeling

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:10.970 align:middle line:84%
that people, most people,
feel it very strongly

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.920 align:middle line:90%
and it really touches them.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.440 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people cry when
they experience that.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And when you go into that
state and bring in that energy,

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:22.020 align:middle line:90%
are you aware?

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:22.710 align:middle line:90%
Are you--

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:23.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I am.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:24.300 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.570 align:middle line:84%
But you can still tell
it's another energy?

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:30.120 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, it kind of feels
like I'm in an altered state

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.170 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:31.970 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Like I'm in a
deep meditation.

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:40.200 align:middle line:10%
And when I come out of it,
it's always a bit like, yeah,

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.830 align:middle line:10%
I feel a distinct shift between
the state of consciousness

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.990 align:middle line:10%
I'm in when I'm channeling
and how I am now.

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:46.790 align:middle line:10%
>> I see.

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:47.943 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:08:47.943 --> 00:08:49.110 align:middle line:10%
>> How did this first begin?

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:52.360 align:middle line:10%
When did this come
through in this way?

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.160 align:middle line:90%
Aikon?

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.577 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it feels like there's
a lot of things that led up

00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:59.460 align:middle line:84%
to the moment when
it first happened.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:03.240 align:middle line:84%
So I can't really say
there was a definite start.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.740 align:middle line:90%
Maybe the day I was born.

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:05.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it feels
like when I look back,

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:09.540 align:middle line:84%
I see how a lot of things
kind of led up to it.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.390 align:middle line:90%


00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:16.050 align:middle line:84%
But what really played
a big part in it

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.600 align:middle line:84%
was a trip to India,
my first trip to India.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.150 align:middle line:90%
>> And I'd quit my job.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.690 align:middle line:84%
I was working as a teacher
before that, and I quit my job,

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:28.560 align:middle line:84%
and I left my apartment, and I
got a one-way ticket to India.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And I didn't know
what was going to happen.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.412 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
I was going to do.

00:09:32.412 --> 00:09:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And I went to a place
called Rishikesh,

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:37.480 align:middle line:84%
in the foothills
of the Himalaya.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.288 align:middle line:10%
>> What guided you to
that spot, particularly?

00:09:40.288 --> 00:09:43.880 align:middle line:90%


00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, first of all, I
was guided to go to India

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:52.667 align:middle line:84%
by an experience that I had
when I went to see Amma.

00:09:52.667 --> 00:09:53.750 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if you know--

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yeah, sure.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.327 align:middle line:90%
>> --Amma, the hugging saint.

00:09:55.327 --> 00:09:57.160 align:middle line:84%
I was living in the
Netherlands at the time,

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.032 align:middle line:84%
and she came there,
and I heard about her

00:10:00.032 --> 00:10:01.490 align:middle line:84%
and so I decided
to go and see her.

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And then I waited a really long
time to get the hug off her.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.520 align:middle line:84%
For people who are listening,
if they don't know who she is,

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.460 align:middle line:90%
she's called the hugging saint.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And she basically just hugs
people and some magic happens.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:15.140 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.265 align:middle line:10%
>> So I was really curious.

00:10:16.265 --> 00:10:17.300 align:middle line:10%
I waited hours.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.883 align:middle line:10%
It was like 2:00 in the morning
I finally got my hug off Amma.

00:10:19.883 --> 00:10:20.683 align:middle line:10%
>> Wow.

00:10:20.683 --> 00:10:22.700 align:middle line:10%
>> And it was a very
strong experience for me,

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:23.686 align:middle line:10%
really intense.

00:10:23.686 --> 00:10:24.486 align:middle line:10%
And I felt--

00:10:24.486 --> 00:10:25.370 align:middle line:10%
>> The hugging?

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:26.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:29.352 align:middle line:84%
It's over very fast, and
it's kind of overwhelming.

00:10:29.352 --> 00:10:30.810 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
people around you.

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:34.040 align:middle line:84%
There's loud music, and
you're kind of pushed,

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.833 align:middle line:84%
and then you get your hug, and
she shoves a piece of chocolate

00:10:37.833 --> 00:10:39.000 align:middle line:90%
in your mouth and somebody--

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:39.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Chocolate?

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:40.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Somebody pulls you out, and
you're a bit disoriented.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And there's this very strong
energy field around her

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:47.840 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.697 align:middle line:84%
And it kind of hit
me really hard.

00:10:49.697 --> 00:10:51.530 align:middle line:84%
I was like, whoa, I
need to go and lie down.

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:52.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:56.315 align:middle line:84%
>> So I went in the back
room and I lay down.

00:10:56.315 --> 00:10:58.070 align:middle line:84%
I had my eyes
closed, and I started

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:00.110 align:middle line:84%
to see this kind
of purple coming

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:08.360 align:middle line:84%
here, like a kind of purple
tunnel, like something opening.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And when it happened, this
voice said to me, go to India.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.630 align:middle line:84%
What you seek, you
shall find there.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And I've always
remembered those words

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.910 align:middle line:84%
because it touched me
so deeply in my heart.

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I decided,
OK, I'm going to India.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'd heard from people
about this place, Rishikesh.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.018 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:11:28.018 --> 00:11:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'd heard that there's
some spiritual teachers that go

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.650 align:middle line:90%
there every year.

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:34.530 align:middle line:84%
So I just felt drawn
to going there.

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:35.330 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:38.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there a specific type
of teaching from the area?

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.770 align:middle line:90%
Or a religion, I should say?

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:42.890 align:middle line:90%
Or some kind of thing or no?

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:45.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, different teachers
have their own lineage.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:51.080 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's a place in India
that's renowned for the sadhus,

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.600 align:middle line:90%
the spiritual--

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.650 align:middle line:90%
usually, they're men.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:55.940 align:middle line:90%
They leave their families.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:56.870 align:middle line:90%
They renounce life.

00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And they go to
meditate in a cave.

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:04.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, Rishikesh is the holy
place where they're drawn to.

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:04.830 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:07.820 align:middle line:84%
>> So a lot of spiritual
teachers and spiritual seekers

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:09.060 align:middle line:90%
are attracted to that place.

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's right on
the River Ganges.

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:16.150 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, so there's a very
special energy in that place,

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.650 align:middle line:10%
and it attracts a lot
of spiritual seekers.

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:21.430 align:middle line:10%
And while I was
there, there were

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:23.480 align:middle line:10%
a few really
well-known spiritual

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.540 align:middle line:10%
teachers that I
went to see, one who

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.905 align:middle line:10%
speaks very deeply to my heart.

00:12:28.905 --> 00:12:29.780 align:middle line:10%
He's very well known.

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.330 align:middle line:10%
I went to Mooji's satsang.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:32.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Mooji?

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:32.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Mooji.

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:33.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, do you know him?

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:35.210 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I'm not familiar.

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:36.590 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:39.080 align:middle line:84%
So he goes every
year to Rishikesh,

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.470 align:middle line:84%
and he does six
weeks of satsang--

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>> And what's that?

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>> --which is where he
kind of sits at the front.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And there's a big hall, maybe
1,000 people sat in there.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:49.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:53.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And the energy and his
presence is very strong.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And people can go up to the
microphone ask him a question.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.080 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:02.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And he points people towards
having a direct experience

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.520 align:middle line:90%
of their true nature.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of
the first days that I

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:09.890 align:middle line:84%
went there, I was
set in this hall,

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:14.900 align:middle line:84%
and he said, I'm going to do
a guided kind of meditation

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:19.160 align:middle line:84%
with you, which is what's
known as self-inquiry,

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.890 align:middle line:84%
to ask within
yourself, who am I?

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And I closed my eyes and I
followed all his instruction,

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:30.680 align:middle line:84%
as he guided everyone through
this step-by-step process

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.620 align:middle line:90%
of self-inquiry.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.110 align:middle line:90%
And at a certain moment--

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:38.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't even have
words to describe

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:43.250 align:middle line:84%
what happened-- but it
was something like my mind

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:46.910 align:middle line:84%
exploding, and my mind
just wasn't there.

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And there was a recognition in
that moment of absolute peace

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:59.450 align:middle line:84%
and unity and connectedness
with everything.

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And it basically just
changed my whole life.

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And how I perceive life
was differently, how I--

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.010 align:middle line:90%
>> In that moment?

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:07.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And how I interacted
with people was differently.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>> In what way after that?

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:14.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Because--

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:15.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Or before?

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.430 align:middle line:84%
>> --I recognized that there's
no separation between us

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:21.080 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.710 align:middle line:90%
And the mind creates itself.

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And all the ideas I
have about who I am

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:30.270 align:middle line:84%
is the primary
cause of suffering.

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:34.670 align:middle line:84%
So once there's a recognition
that there's this story running

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:35.640 align:middle line:90%
in the mind--

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.880 align:middle line:84%
and that's actually
not who I am.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And there's a capacity
to observe that story

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.630 align:middle line:90%
and observe the thoughts.

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:47.590 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's no longer
identification with it.

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And it felt like a
divine blessing for me

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:53.220 align:middle line:90%
to experience that.

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.692 align:middle line:90%


00:14:55.692 --> 00:14:57.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So after that, you sort
of had a different outlook

00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:58.770 align:middle line:90%
on life?

00:14:58.770 --> 00:14:59.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:03.200 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like life seemed
to be more like a dream--

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it?

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.810 align:middle line:84%
>> --and I'm kind of playing
a character in a dream.

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
intensity kind of lifted,

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:15.370 align:middle line:84%
the heaviness lifted,
and it really changed me.

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:16.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:21.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I think I experienced more
awareness of my behavior,

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:27.465 align:middle line:84%
of the energies running through
me, how I'm meeting people.

00:15:27.465 --> 00:15:30.270 align:middle line:90%


00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:32.650 align:middle line:90%
Every aspect of my life changed.

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:34.313 align:middle line:90%
>> How long ago was that?

00:15:34.313 --> 00:15:35.730 align:middle line:84%
>> That was about
three years ago.

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:36.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:37.520 align:middle line:90%
So fairly recent.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.248 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:39.248 --> 00:15:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And then it was after
that when you started

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.930 align:middle line:90%
connecting with Aikon energy?

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it was a few
months after that.

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:48.930 align:middle line:84%
It was clear to me it's
not true for me to go back

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:51.040 align:middle line:90%
to my teaching job anymore.

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:51.840 align:middle line:90%
And I--

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:52.960 align:middle line:90%
>> And what were you teaching?

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.350 align:middle line:84%
>> I taught English
as a foreign language.

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:55.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:57.967 align:middle line:84%
>> So I taught foreigners
how to speak English.

00:15:57.967 --> 00:15:58.800 align:middle line:90%
I really enjoyed it.

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.690 align:middle line:90%
Actually, it was a lot of fun.

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:02.855 align:middle line:84%
>> And you did that
in England or--

00:16:02.855 --> 00:16:04.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I did it in
England, and also,

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.220 align:middle line:90%
I taught in Italy for a while.

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.930 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:11.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I got to meet a lot of
people from all over the world.

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:12.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it was really--

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:13.290 align:middle line:90%
>> I did that.

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:14.560 align:middle line:90%
I lived in Japan for a while--

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:14.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, really?

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>> --and taught Jap-- or I
taught English to the Japanese

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:19.040 align:middle line:90%
people for a little bit, yeah.

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so I started
to question like, OK,

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.950 align:middle line:90%
so what am I going to do now?

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And I felt in my heart
this longing, that

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:33.920 align:middle line:84%
wanting to do something that was
really in alignment, which was

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.450 align:middle line:90%
my higher purpose, let's say.

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And I would have done
anything, no matter what

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:43.000 align:middle line:84%
it was, as long as it was
really aligned for me.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And this feeling was
overwhelming in a way.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:48.060 align:middle line:90%
It was so strong.

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And I made a prayer in my
heart to the greater power,

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:53.580 align:middle line:84%
the universe, God, whatever
you want to call it,

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.730 align:middle line:84%
and I said, please, please
just show me whatever

00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:58.000 align:middle line:90%
it is that you want me to do.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:58.800 align:middle line:90%
I'll do it.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And it was like a moment
of absolute surrender.

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:09.119 align:middle line:84%
And all my desires of my
ego mind or anything I

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:10.950 align:middle line:84%
thought I want, I just
surrendered it all.

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And I just really prayed
for my heart to be shown.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And the next day
I was meditating.

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And in my meditation, I
kind of went really deep

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:22.954 align:middle line:90%
to that place where--

00:17:22.954 --> 00:17:25.079 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've ever
experienced meditating.

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:27.109 align:middle line:84%
Your whole body
kind of goes numb?

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>> So it was a really
deep one like that.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, it felt like
something opened up here.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.990 align:middle line:10%
Almost like a door
opened, like this.

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:39.330 align:middle line:10%
And the channeling
just came through.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:41.170 align:middle line:10%
I just knew I was channeling.

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And it felt very natural
for me and easy and flowing.

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:52.380 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there wasn't
any doubt with it.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:55.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And then that sort
of became your purpose?

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.100 align:middle line:90%
Your purpose--

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.767 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it wasn't
clear in that moment.

00:17:57.767 --> 00:18:00.750 align:middle line:84%
It's now when I look
back, or, yeah, soon after

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:02.050 align:middle line:90%
that I realized.

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Because I made the
connection between the prayer

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:07.620 align:middle line:84%
I'd made the day before
and then the channeling

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.232 align:middle line:90%
coming the next day.

00:18:09.232 --> 00:18:11.190 align:middle line:84%
So it really felt like
that prayer was answered

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:12.870 align:middle line:90%
almost instantaneously.

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:13.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:14.720 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:19.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And when that energy came
through did they say, hi,

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:23.342 align:middle line:90%
we're Aikon, nice to meet you?

00:18:23.342 --> 00:18:24.142 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:24.142 --> 00:18:24.554 align:middle line:90%
>> Kind of like that?

00:18:24.554 --> 00:18:25.380 align:middle line:90%
>> More or less, yeah.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:26.180 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:27.630 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, interesting.

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:30.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And then they said
where they were from.

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And when I told people
about it, of course,

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:39.020 align:middle line:84%
they were interested, and
they wanted to ask questions.

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:40.215 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, my friends started--

00:18:40.215 --> 00:18:42.090 align:middle line:84%
it was just fun, and we
were playing with it.

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
I wasn't thinking,

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:46.500 align:middle line:84%
oh, this is what I
can do for my work.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:47.960 align:middle line:90%
I was just really enjoying.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:51.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And then I thought,
wow, it's so much fun.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And this information
that's coming through

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:55.050 align:middle line:90%
is really powerful, actually.

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:57.030 align:middle line:84%
I can put it on YouTube
and maybe other people

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:57.910 align:middle line:90%
can enjoy it, too.

00:18:57.910 --> 00:18:58.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:00.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And then it just started
to grow really fast,

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:03.820 align:middle line:84%
and people were messaging me
that they really loved it.

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:04.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And then I just
wanted to do it more.

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:09.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Wow, so you've been doing
that sort of as your main

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:11.840 align:middle line:84%
full-time thing
for how long now?

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:15.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, about 2
and 1/2 years maybe.

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:16.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And you do it via
phone or in person?

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:21.170 align:middle line:90%
>> I usually use--

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.840 align:middle line:84%
yeah, sometimes in
person or Skype.

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.410 align:middle line:84%
So I work with people
all over the world.

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, excellent.

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And when Aikon showed
up-- well, I should ask,

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:36.060 align:middle line:84%
were they the first
sort of voice you heard,

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:40.500 align:middle line:84%
or did you have any
other connections or--

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, they were the first.

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:44.890 align:middle line:84%
But in the beginning
when it first started,

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:46.920 align:middle line:84%
there were a lot of
other beings that

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.090 align:middle line:90%
were coming through as well.

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:48.270 align:middle line:90%
Oh, there were?

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:48.750 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:49.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:52.980 align:middle line:84%
Archangel Michael came quite
a bit and Archangel Rafael

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:55.990 align:middle line:84%
and Archangel
Metatron and Quan Yin.

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And when those energies
come through, do they--

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:00.420 align:middle line:90%
how do you know it's them?

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:02.430 align:middle line:84%
How did they-- do they
say where-- hi, I'm--

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, they say who they are.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:04.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:08.280 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's like
I recognize them.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.898 align:middle line:84%
Like the first time
I met you and you

00:20:09.898 --> 00:20:11.940 align:middle line:84%
said you're Reuben, I was
like, nice to meet you.

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:12.930 align:middle line:84%
Then the next time
I meet you, you

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:14.520 align:middle line:84%
don't need to tell me
again that you're Reuben.

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:15.860 align:middle line:90%
It's like I know you now.

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:18.360 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so the first time they
come through, do they say, hi,

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm Michael?

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, they say who they are.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And they say the
name and everything?

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:22.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:23.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, interesting.

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:25.628 align:middle line:90%
Were you raised a Christian?

00:20:25.628 --> 00:20:26.670 align:middle line:90%
>> I was raised Catholic.

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:27.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Catholic, OK.

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:29.640 align:middle line:84%
So were you able to
make that connection?

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.110 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't connect it at all.

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:34.200 align:middle line:84%
It felt like a really separate
thing from the religion

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.033 align:middle line:90%
that I grew up with.

00:20:35.033 --> 00:20:35.833 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:20:35.833 --> 00:20:37.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Although angels are
mentioned in the Bible.

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:38.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>> But I never really felt a
connection in my heart with

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.520 align:middle line:90%
that religion.

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:44.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.920 align:middle line:84%
>> It always felt kind
of off to me, you know?

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And I followed it because I
wanted to be good as a child,

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.630 align:middle line:90%
and my parents knew best.

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:55.660 align:middle line:84%
So I did all the rituals, and
I went to church with them.

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.450 align:middle line:84%
But in my heart, it
didn't feel right.

00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:58.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:03.210 align:middle line:84%
So when these angel
energies came through,

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:05.490 align:middle line:84%
you didn't really have
much of a reference point?

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:06.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Not really, no.

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:11.070 align:middle line:84%
I just heard about them,
you know, on the internet.

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:13.510 align:middle line:84%
You see people post
these angel cards?

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:14.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:15.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, some things like that.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.600 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so you had some
familiarity with those kinds

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:17.860 align:middle line:90%
of things?

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:18.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:21.780 align:middle line:84%
It was interesting because
each one that came through

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:25.590 align:middle line:84%
expressed itself with
a different energy.

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:27.780 align:middle line:84%
Like the voice
when I'm channeling

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.490 align:middle line:84%
is really different
for each one.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:31.590 align:middle line:84%
Like Archangel Metatron,
when I channel him,

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:33.390 align:middle line:90%
my voice is really low.

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And Archangel Michael
is very gentle and soft.

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.790 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting
to see the difference.

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:38.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:40.800 align:middle line:84%
So also, you've channeled
Metatron before?

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:41.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.960 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, interesting.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.750 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, from my experiences
with Metatron,

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:50.180 align:middle line:84%
he's always been
a heavier energy.

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:51.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:52.900 align:middle line:90%
And very direct.

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:54.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Very direct.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.620 align:middle line:90%
Very heavy and direct.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:57.270 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:59.100 align:middle line:90%


00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.450 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:02.460 align:middle line:84%
But now you've
built this library,

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:06.390 align:middle line:84%
these reference points for
these different energies.

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:09.523 align:middle line:84%
Other than Aikon--
you know, Aikon

00:22:09.523 --> 00:22:11.940 align:middle line:84%
is stating they're from sort
of the Pleiades star system--

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:15.090 align:middle line:84%
have you had any
other what we would

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:18.960 align:middle line:84%
label "extraterrestrial
energies" from star

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:22.170 align:middle line:90%
systems in that sense?

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:24.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Before I started channeling,
I used to have visitations from

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:25.760 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:29.744 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, from-- "them" meaning?

00:22:29.744 --> 00:22:30.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Different races--

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:31.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Different races?

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:32.537 align:middle line:90%
>> --different beings.

00:22:32.537 --> 00:22:33.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK, more than one?

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:34.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:36.310 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, can you explain
a little bit about that?

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:42.613 align:middle line:84%
So it happened at nighttime
when I was in bed sleeping.

00:22:42.613 --> 00:22:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And I would wake up in the
middle of the night and I would

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:49.140 align:middle line:90%
see beings in my bedroom and--

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:50.670 align:middle line:90%
>> What type?

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:51.730 align:middle line:90%
Can you describe them?

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:54.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, there are
lots of different ones.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Quite a lot, the ones,
the common ones known

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:58.010 align:middle line:90%
as "The Grays" would come.

00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:00.422 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:23:00.422 --> 00:23:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Did you have
conversations with them?

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:03.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, really?

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:05.760 align:middle line:90%
>> I remember one conversation.

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.843 align:middle line:84%
Because I was not happy
that they were doing that.

00:23:07.843 --> 00:23:09.900 align:middle line:90%
It was scaring me.

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:12.485 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
challenging for me, actually.

00:23:12.485 --> 00:23:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>> At what age?

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:15.480 align:middle line:90%
About?

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.610 align:middle line:84%
>> This was when I
was in my 20s, it.

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:18.410 align:middle line:90%
Started

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:19.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:20.010 align:middle line:90%
Later on then?

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:20.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:23.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, I actually
had a past life--

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:27.300 align:middle line:84%
not a past life, a regression,
a hypnotic regression

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:28.290 align:middle line:90%
when I was 13.

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:30.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm 37 now.

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And in that
regression, she took--

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:36.990 align:middle line:84%
it was a woman that
specializes with people

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:39.810 align:middle line:84%
that have been having
extraterrestrial visitation

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:42.450 align:middle line:84%
experiences, and I went to
her because I was really

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:44.100 align:middle line:90%
struggling with it, actually.

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And she regressed me back to
the first time it had happened.

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And apparently it started
when I was 10 years old.

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:55.817 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't have conscious
awareness of that.

00:23:55.817 --> 00:23:57.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Only until your 20s did you--

00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:59.960 align:middle line:84%
>> In my 20s, I was really
consciously experiencing it

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.960 align:middle line:90%
and having memories.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:02.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:07.510 align:middle line:84%
So do you think that could
have been a factor in where

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:08.760 align:middle line:90%
you are now with your journey?

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:09.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Most likely.

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.090 align:middle line:84%
I feel like they
were doing something

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:15.990 align:middle line:84%
to me, my physical
body, my energetic body.

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:18.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't really know
what, maybe changing--

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>> During the regression,
it didn't come up,

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:23.400 align:middle line:90%
a details a little bit?

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't remember
too much from that now.

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:28.300 align:middle line:90%
It was like seven years ago.

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.330 align:middle line:84%
I remember during
that regression I

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:33.360 align:middle line:90%
saw a being that looked scary.

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:41.137 align:middle line:84%
And then she asked it
to reveal its true--

00:24:41.137 --> 00:24:43.470 align:middle line:84%
how it truly was, and then
it turned into a light being,

00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:47.880 align:middle line:84%
and that took a lot of the
fear away around it, for me.

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:50.880 align:middle line:84%
Fear was a major issue
that I was dealing with.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.560 align:middle line:84%
It was really scary for me that
I was waking up in the night

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.886 align:middle line:84%
and these beings
were in my room.

00:24:55.886 --> 00:24:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And I was basically
paralyzed, and I

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:01.350 align:middle line:84%
didn't have control of my body,
and I felt very vulnerable

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:03.643 align:middle line:90%
and at their mercy kind of.

00:25:03.643 --> 00:25:05.310 align:middle line:84%
Like, they could do
what they want to me

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:09.095 align:middle line:84%
and it reached the point
where I was forcing myself

00:25:09.095 --> 00:25:11.220 align:middle line:84%
to stay awake the whole
night so that they wouldn't

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:12.200 align:middle line:90%
be able to come and get me.

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:12.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:14.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And I was working
as a teacher,

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:17.720 align:middle line:84%
so I was in the classroom, and
I couldn't function really well.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:18.840 align:middle line:90%
It was really hard.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:23.298 align:middle line:84%
>> So since then, and now
with this the channeling

00:25:23.298 --> 00:25:24.840 align:middle line:84%
and the connection
of these energies,

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.132 align:middle line:90%
have you revisited that at all?

00:25:26.132 --> 00:25:27.750 align:middle line:90%
Have you talked to those beings?

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:30.882 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one time when I woke
up and they were there, I said,

00:25:30.882 --> 00:25:32.090 align:middle line:90%
like, why are you doing this?

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:32.890 align:middle line:90%
It's scaring me.

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:34.650 align:middle line:90%
Why are you coming into my home?

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't
understand the concept

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:40.120 align:middle line:84%
of "my home," because they
just experienced everything

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:45.440 align:middle line:84%
like space, and you
can't own space.

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.310 align:middle line:84%
So I was trying to explain
the feeling of like,

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:50.210 align:middle line:84%
this is my space,
where I feel safe.

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And that was a very
foreign idea for them.

00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:54.643 align:middle line:90%
And I said, where--

00:25:54.643 --> 00:25:55.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting conversation.

00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:58.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And they communicated with me
in my mind, like telepathically.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.340 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't have to speak.

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:09.060 align:middle line:84%
I could just think something,
and then I heard the reply.

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And I said, why
are you doing this?

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:12.470 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
we're helping you.

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And you don't need to be
scared, we're helping you.

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:19.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Did you believe them?

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:19.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:20.660 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's like I knew.

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:22.510 align:middle line:90%
>> You knew?

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:23.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:24.140 align:middle line:90%
>> It was OK.

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Did they say in which way
they were helping you?

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:26.450 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:27.250 align:middle line:90%
>> No?

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:28.680 align:middle line:90%
You just said they're helping.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:29.972 align:middle line:90%
You know they were helping you?

00:26:29.972 --> 00:26:31.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:35.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you get the fact
that you were helping them?

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:40.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I feel like they had
some programs and they needed

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:42.830 align:middle line:90%
help with from humans.

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:46.376 align:middle line:84%
And I think I was
part of that program.

00:26:46.376 --> 00:26:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Your conversation when you
were explaining that it was

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:53.260 align:middle line:84%
your space, were they
listening carefully?

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:56.000 align:middle line:84%
Or were they just
kind of, whatever?

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.360 align:middle line:90%
What was there reaction to that?

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Kind of like neither.

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:01.500 align:middle line:90%
Almost like neutral.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:02.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>> It wasn't like they really
wanted to figure out what

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:05.870 align:middle line:90%
your thing was?

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:06.790 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:08.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's interesting.

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:11.050 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:14.480 align:middle line:84%
The ongoing conversation
seems to be, I'm guessing,

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.580 align:middle line:90%
is with Aikon?

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I work
primarily with them now.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.230 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time,
I channel them.

00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And do they help you
facilitate talking to other

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:29.960 align:middle line:84%
beings or other energies,
or it's just mostly them?

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:30.760 align:middle line:90%
Does Aikon--

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.302 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I haven't
had that experience.

00:27:32.302 --> 00:27:34.600 align:middle line:84%
The only kind of similar
experience I have with them

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:40.000 align:middle line:84%
is that sometimes they go to
what they call the Akashic

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Records, which is like an
energetic store of information.

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And there's another group
from their species, let's say,

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:56.840 align:middle line:84%
that works in the Akashic
Records Department.

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:57.640 align:middle line:90%
It's not like this.

00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:01.420 align:middle line:84%
They just put it in this term so
we can understand because it's

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:03.070 align:middle line:90%
easy for us to digest.

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:05.290 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes they'll go
to these other beings

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:07.990 align:middle line:84%
and ask them to get the
information for them

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:10.775 align:middle line:84%
from the library and then
bring it back and share it.

00:28:10.775 --> 00:28:11.650 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, yeah, that's--

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:12.660 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's kind of similar.

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:13.080 align:middle line:90%
>> --very similar.

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:13.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:17.280 align:middle line:84%
So in order to access
the Akashic, they--

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:20.520 align:middle line:84%
it's like going to the
librarian and saying, hey,

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:21.478 align:middle line:90%
I can't find this book.

00:28:21.478 --> 00:28:22.278 align:middle line:90%
I cannot.

00:28:22.278 --> 00:28:23.890 align:middle line:84%
You guys know this
way better than me.

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:24.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:25.170 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, interesting.

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:29.805 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's usually about the
energetic makeup of the person

00:28:29.805 --> 00:28:31.030 align:middle line:90%
that they're--

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:33.030 align:middle line:84%
and their history,
their past life history,

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:33.830 align:middle line:90%
that kind of thing.

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:35.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And depending on that
person specifically that

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:36.690 align:middle line:90%
you're working with?

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:37.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:38.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep, OK.

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:39.790 align:middle line:90%
What's next?

00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:41.080 align:middle line:90%
What's coming up, I guess?

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.880 align:middle line:84%
Where do you see yourself
going with all of this?

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>> I have no idea.

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:50.475 align:middle line:84%
I'm just-- it's forcing me
to face my fears many times.

00:28:50.475 --> 00:28:51.275 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:28:51.275 --> 00:28:53.740 align:middle line:90%
In what sense and how?

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:58.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Because there were
fears in me rising up,

00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:04.430 align:middle line:84%
like wanting to have safety
and security and familiarity.

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:09.980 align:middle line:10%
And each time that
came, something in me

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:12.220 align:middle line:10%
knew that, no, I can't go back.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:13.610 align:middle line:10%
I just have to keep going.

00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And it was a bit
like a leap of faith.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.400 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'm just going to trust.

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:22.450 align:middle line:84%
I literally have no money right
now, but I just can't go back.

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:24.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
see what happens.

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it would feel
like really the last moment,

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:32.920 align:middle line:84%
and then the universe would
just step in and catch me.

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:34.270 align:middle line:90%
And the more it happened--

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:38.140 align:middle line:84%
I was just trusting and allowing
and following my excitement--

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:40.150 align:middle line:90%
the easier it got to do it.

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:41.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely, been there.

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.810 align:middle line:84%
I know what you're
talking about.

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's exciting to
learn that you can truly

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:55.630 align:middle line:84%
follow your excitement, and
the universe will provide.

00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:56.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:58.930 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's scary at
the same time, right?

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:02.507 align:middle line:84%
Because you were conditioned to,
you know, you have to do this,

00:30:02.507 --> 00:30:04.340 align:middle line:84%
you have to work, you
have to pay the bills,

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:09.995 align:middle line:84%
you have to do all these
things, and yeah, I understand.

00:30:09.995 --> 00:30:13.760 align:middle line:84%
It's fear and excitement
wrapped into one emotion.

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's like, which
are you going to act on?

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.290 align:middle line:90%
And you always have that choice.

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:18.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's true.

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And if you act out
of fear, then you

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:21.490 align:middle line:84%
end up taking that job
that you didn't really

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:23.157 align:middle line:84%
want to do anyways,
and then you go down

00:30:23.157 --> 00:30:26.240 align:middle line:84%
this path of, oh my
god, I'm doing this,

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:29.165 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not really
having fun, you know?

00:30:29.165 --> 00:30:32.665 align:middle line:84%
>> And once I became aware
of this, this choice I have,

00:30:32.665 --> 00:30:35.530 align:middle line:84%
if I ever take the
choice of fear,

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:39.530 align:middle line:84%
then it's always every single
time reflected back to me.

00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And something happens, and
I realize, yeah, that's why.

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:46.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:49.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you for
doing what you do,

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:52.930 align:middle line:84%
and I look forward to
seeing more of your work.

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And we'll look forward
to talking to Aikon next.

00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:56.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:58.980 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:22.270 align:middle line:90%


00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:24.340 align:middle line:84%
Many people have
an idea that when

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:27.880 align:middle line:84%
we have a spiritual
awakening, that there's

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:32.260 align:middle line:84%
kind of like enlightenment or
realization, and that's it.

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:36.290 align:middle line:10%
When life is perfect,
no challenges come.

00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:37.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm happy for the
rest of my life.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:40.860 align:middle line:90%
And it's not exactly like that.

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And for most people
what happens, actually,

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:51.110 align:middle line:84%
is after their awakening,
there's a continuing process.

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:56.150 align:middle line:84%
It's really the awakening
is the beginning,

00:31:56.150 --> 00:32:00.950 align:middle line:84%
where there's a recognition
of the true self as that which

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:08.350 align:middle line:84%
lies beyond the
mental construct,

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:13.810 align:middle line:84%
or the feeling of the separate
self as an individual being,

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:22.140 align:middle line:84%
and then an egocentric
state and a transcendence

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:26.130 align:middle line:84%
of that to a recognition that
actually the essence of all

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:28.020 align:middle line:90%
of us is one and the same.

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:32.460 align:middle line:90%


00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And once that mental
construction kind of falters,

00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:42.592 align:middle line:84%
but there's a
breakthrough beyond that,

00:32:42.592 --> 00:32:44.630 align:middle line:84%
the process of
integration begins.

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's where all the trauma
from the past and our childhood

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:57.080 align:middle line:84%
bubbles up in our
system into the light

00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:00.320 align:middle line:84%
of this consciousness that's
now emanating from our being.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And it comes up
to be integrated--

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:08.110 align:middle line:84%
all the conditionings, all
the unconscious patterns, all

00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:11.740 align:middle line:84%
the beliefs, all the
pain that we felt,

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:14.440 align:middle line:84%
the agony that we
felt as a child,

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:17.440 align:middle line:84%
that maybe we're not even aware
is very deep under the surface,

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:18.702 align:middle line:90%
it all bubbles up.

00:33:18.702 --> 00:33:24.970 align:middle line:90%


00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And so we go through a
process of integration.

00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:32.420 align:middle line:90%


00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:36.240 align:middle line:90%
And a deepening into presence.

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:53.850 align:middle line:90%


00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Here we are,
Louise, in Blackburn.

00:33:57.030 --> 00:33:57.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:58.630 align:middle line:90%
>> No?

00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:00.700 align:middle line:10%
Blackburn, OK.

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:03.987 align:middle line:84%
It's been how long
since we saw each other?

00:34:03.987 --> 00:34:05.320 align:middle line:90%
>> I think it's about two years.

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:06.585 align:middle line:90%
>> Almost two years, yeah.

00:34:06.585 --> 00:34:08.652 align:middle line:90%
I think like a year and a half.

00:34:08.652 --> 00:34:09.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, almost two years.

00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Maybe like a year and nine
months or something like that.

00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:15.100 align:middle line:84%
You were in LA for
the Channel Panel,

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:17.469 align:middle line:84%
just checking it out and
hanging out with Karen.

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:20.840 align:middle line:84%
We got our great interview
with you and Aikon at the time.

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:24.699 align:middle line:84%
And now we're sort
of doing an update.

00:34:24.699 --> 00:34:26.080 align:middle line:90%
So what's been happening?

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:27.030 align:middle line:90%
Where are you at?

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:30.489 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and the big news is
I'm not channeling anymore.

00:34:30.489 --> 00:34:31.719 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, exactly.

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:34.389 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, what happened?

00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:36.699 align:middle line:84%
Could you explain and
tell the audience?

00:34:36.699 --> 00:34:42.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it was actually pretty
soon after our interview that I

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:44.300 align:middle line:90%
went back to India.

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:51.989 align:middle line:84%
And I was experiencing
a deepening

00:34:51.989 --> 00:34:57.850 align:middle line:84%
of my own spiritual journey
and a lot of integration.

00:34:57.850 --> 00:35:00.360 align:middle line:84%
So in my own journey,
as I was channeling,

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:03.930 align:middle line:84%
I was going through
this process.

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And after our last interview,
and I went back to India,

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:14.910 align:middle line:84%
I experienced a deepening
of the initial awakening

00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:18.240 align:middle line:84%
that I spoke of in
our last interview.

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And after that happened, when I
was channeling, for some time,

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:27.570 align:middle line:84%
it felt like the channeling was
kind of becoming more distant,

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:31.044 align:middle line:90%
pulling back somehow.

00:35:31.044 --> 00:35:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time, I could feel

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:35.980 align:middle line:90%
something new was being born.

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:43.550 align:middle line:84%
Something new was wanting to
express itself from my heart.

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And I started to have
an intuitive feeling

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:53.640 align:middle line:84%
like I'm going to be
stopping channeling.

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:56.890 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to be true
for me to continue with this.

00:35:56.890 --> 00:35:57.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:35:57.690 --> 00:36:00.065 align:middle line:84%
>> And around the time I was
having that feeling and this

00:36:00.065 --> 00:36:02.340 align:middle line:84%
kind of pulling
away was happening,

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:06.540 align:middle line:84%
it almost felt like I was
half-channeling and half this

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:08.850 align:middle line:90%
new expression coming through.

00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Which was different than
the channeling experience?

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:12.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:17.910 align:middle line:84%
It felt like something in me
was merging with the channeling,

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:20.430 align:middle line:90%
almost.

00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And Aikon contacted me
directly at that time.

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:27.960 align:middle line:84%
It was only the second
time that they'd ever

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.100 align:middle line:90%
contacted me directly.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:32.570 align:middle line:84%
The first time was when the
initial contact happened.

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And they just said to me that,
we'll be leaving you soon.

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And what fashion
did that happen?

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:41.820 align:middle line:84%
Like in a voice in
the head or a dream?

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:43.500 align:middle line:90%
>> In the same way that I--

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:46.170 align:middle line:90%


00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:49.520 align:middle line:90%
heard is not the right word.

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:51.960 align:middle line:84%
I received the information
when I was channeling.

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:52.760 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:56.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So I was very
familiar, this is Aikon.

00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And I know how they
communicate with me.

00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:01.950 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't a voice in the head.

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:08.340 align:middle line:84%
It's more like
something coming through

00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:11.610 align:middle line:90%
that it's clear it's not me.

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:13.525 align:middle line:90%
They told me this, and it was--

00:37:13.525 --> 00:37:14.400 align:middle line:90%
that's all they said.

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Didn't give you
a time frame or--

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:16.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, OK,
maybe there's going

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:20.550 align:middle line:90%
to be some time, six months.

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:21.510 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know really.

00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:25.350 align:middle line:84%
>> But it felt true
and it felt right,

00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:30.720 align:middle line:84%
and I had a knowing that
it was coming to an end.

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And that it happened much
faster than I expected

00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:39.240 align:middle line:84%
because I was doing group events
for the channeling in Rishikesh

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:43.440 align:middle line:84%
in India at the time, so I had
posters all around the town.

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And it was during the time I
was doing these daily events

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:52.060 align:middle line:90%
that it suddenly stopped.

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And I went to the
event because I

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.835 align:middle line:84%
knew people were going to
turn up to see me channeling.

00:37:58.835 --> 00:38:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And I explained to
everybody what happened.

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I feel
there's something new that

00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:06.950 align:middle line:90%
wants to be shared now.

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:09.590 align:middle line:90%


00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And you told
them Aikon's gone?

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:11.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:13.655 align:middle line:84%
They were quite
surprised because they

00:38:13.655 --> 00:38:15.100 align:middle line:90%
had shown up to see me channel.

00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:18.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:21.630 align:middle line:90%
My bottle's talking to me here.

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:24.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Some were a little
disappointed and the left,

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:25.490 align:middle line:90%
and that was OK.

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:28.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you refund their
money or anything like that?

00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that was
my donation anyway.

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:32.315 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:38:32.315 --> 00:38:38.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And some stayed
and they enjoyed it.

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And since then, that's
what I've been doing.

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Two years ago, the theme
of the conversation was about

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:43.820 align:middle line:90%
integrity.

00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And I had mentioned that I was
talking with Aikon about myself

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:53.850 align:middle line:84%
acting out of integrity and
sort of being set in alignment.

00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
the conversation

00:38:55.730 --> 00:39:01.603 align:middle line:84%
was about being truthful
and acting in integrity

00:39:01.603 --> 00:39:03.020 align:middle line:84%
and being as
truthful as possible.

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:03.940 align:middle line:90%
And that's sort of--

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:05.840 align:middle line:90%
those two go hand-in-hand.

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:11.180 align:middle line:84%
>> The way I understand is that
there's two levels to being

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:12.330 align:middle line:90%
in integrity.

00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And one level is
the human aspect,

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:21.500 align:middle line:84%
where we try to mold our
person or our character,

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:23.300 align:middle line:84%
and we try to be
good, and we try

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:29.690 align:middle line:84%
to develop compassion,
kindness, integrity, and all

00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:32.370 align:middle line:90%
these beautiful qualities.

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of like
the personality level.

00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:39.060 align:middle line:90%
And that's a beautiful thing.

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:41.370 align:middle line:84%
But there is a deeper
level of integrity,

00:39:41.370 --> 00:39:47.540 align:middle line:84%
which is when we totally
let go of all aspects

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:53.270 align:middle line:84%
of our personality and
recognize there's only

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:56.690 align:middle line:90%
pure awareness beyond that.

00:39:56.690 --> 00:40:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And that personality
is expressing itself

00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:03.710 align:middle line:90%
in the space of awareness.

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:05.545 align:middle line:90%
It's only beingness.

00:40:05.545 --> 00:40:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And when we open to this
beingness, this pure divinity,

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:13.640 align:middle line:84%
when we allow that to
flow through unabridged

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:16.910 align:middle line:84%
without moving through a
filter of our conditioning

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:19.910 align:middle line:84%
or unconscious patterns,
there's no question

00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:21.890 align:middle line:90%
of integrity or not integrity.

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:24.710 align:middle line:84%
Because that is pure
love, and it can only

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:26.090 align:middle line:90%
express itself as pure love.

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:30.200 align:middle line:84%
So there's no effort
to be in integrity.

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:32.870 align:middle line:84%
The opposite of effort and
trying to be a good person

00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:35.390 align:middle line:84%
or do the right thing,
there's a total letting go.

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:38.660 align:middle line:84%
It's total surrender
of everything to that

00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:41.120 align:middle line:90%
and allowing that just to be.

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:42.540 align:middle line:90%
There's no me anymore.

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:43.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:46.100 align:middle line:84%
So the paradox of
this integration,

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:49.520 align:middle line:84%
though, is there is the
self-integration of all

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.770 align:middle line:84%
of these things, and then
there's the losing the self,

00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:52.570 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:56.780 align:middle line:84%
So you sort of have to
do the two integrations

00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:58.870 align:middle line:90%
simultaneously--

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, my experience and
understanding is that once

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:08.660 align:middle line:84%
there's the transcendence of
that self, which is instant,

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:12.800 align:middle line:84%
and it can be acknowledged
and directly experienced every

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:16.583 align:middle line:84%
single moment, if there's a
total surrender and letting go,

00:41:16.583 --> 00:41:18.500 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing else to
do on the other level.

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:20.910 align:middle line:90%
It happens automatically.

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:24.490 align:middle line:84%
So it's just resting
as this being

00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:27.610 align:middle line:90%
and allowing whatever comes up.

00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:32.420 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is the past
traumas start to bubble up.

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And there's another
thing, maybe some anger

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:37.460 align:middle line:84%
towards our parents for
the way that they're

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:41.310 align:middle line:84%
relating with us that was
painful, maybe some sadness.

00:41:41.310 --> 00:41:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And there's just a recognition,
OK, anger's here, sadness here,

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:49.990 align:middle line:84%
and there's a total
opening to feeling it,

00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:52.730 align:middle line:84%
with gentleness and
with love and dropping

00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:56.690 align:middle line:84%
the tension into the
body, totally allowing it.

00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And from that space,
nothing needs to change,

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:00.260 align:middle line:90%
nothing needs to be different.

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:02.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to
integrate anything.

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:04.550 align:middle line:90%
I don't need to become anything.

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:06.620 align:middle line:90%
I don't need to get anywhere.

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:07.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm already that.

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:09.320 align:middle line:90%
Everything's already perfect.

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:11.090 align:middle line:90%
And this process is happening.

00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:12.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And I guess what I was trying to
say is that how you bring that

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:21.980 align:middle line:84%
into this daily life that
we humans have created

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:26.340 align:middle line:84%
for ourselves in this noisy
world of, to do things,

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:28.340 align:middle line:84%
and to do that, and you've
got to pay the bills,

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:31.760 align:middle line:84%
and you've got to go to
work, and you got to--

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:33.560 align:middle line:90%
those aspects are still there.

00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:37.720 align:middle line:84%
How do you completely surrender
and at the same time still

00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:38.520 align:middle line:90%
pay the bills?

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:41.040 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a great question, and
it's a question that many,

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:41.900 align:middle line:10%
many people ask.

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:45.410 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of people
feel a kind of fear

00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:49.430 align:middle line:10%
around opening to this surrender
because there's an idea, OK,

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:50.960 align:middle line:10%
how will I function
in the world?

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:51.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:55.970 align:middle line:84%
>> But actually what happens
is that it becomes easier

00:42:55.970 --> 00:43:00.670 align:middle line:84%
to relate with people and
to interact with the world.

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And there's no longer
a feeling of division

00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:11.270 align:middle line:84%
that there's the spiritual
world and the other world.

00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:13.407 align:middle line:84%
There's the higher
consciousness,

00:43:13.407 --> 00:43:15.740 align:middle line:84%
the lower consciousness, the
right, the wrong, the good,

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:16.210 align:middle line:90%
the bad.

00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:17.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:21.330 align:middle line:84%
>> That takes place within
the construct of the ego mind,

00:43:21.330 --> 00:43:24.030 align:middle line:84%
which wants to divide everything
and say this is how things

00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:24.830 align:middle line:90%
should be.

00:43:24.830 --> 00:43:27.450 align:middle line:84%
But once we transcend
that, and we

00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:33.060 align:middle line:84%
open to the peace and the
beauty that's always here,

00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:41.390 align:middle line:84%
then everything can be allowed
and experienced with love.

00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And we're able to see that
everyone we relate with is just

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:52.290 align:middle line:90%
another version of me.

00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:55.395 align:middle line:84%
And when we know
that to be true throw

00:43:55.395 --> 00:43:59.430 align:middle line:84%
our own direct experience,
we can't hurt other people.

00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:02.670 align:middle line:90%
We can't fight wars.

00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:05.340 align:middle line:84%
It only brings more peace
and love and compassion

00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:06.430 align:middle line:90%
to our society.

00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:10.920 align:middle line:84%
So the more people that
experience this, the more

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:13.080 align:middle line:84%
transformation will
happen on the outside,

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:15.390 align:middle line:84%
which will reflect the
transformation that's

00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:16.680 align:middle line:90%
happening within.

00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:19.230 align:middle line:90%


00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:23.885 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a feedback loop
that kind of keeps elevating

00:44:23.885 --> 00:44:25.880 align:middle line:90%
and elevating and elevating.

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And another beautiful thing
that happens is our unique

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:33.690 align:middle line:84%
gifts begin to
express themselves.

00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:37.890 align:middle line:84%
So we all have something
beautiful, a natural expression

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:39.100 align:middle line:90%
to share with the world.

00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And many times what happens
when we're young children

00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:45.720 align:middle line:84%
and we are indoctrinated by the
school system and conditioning

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.870 align:middle line:84%
of our society,
these gifts shut down

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:55.526 align:middle line:84%
if we're not supported for
them to blossom and flower.

00:44:55.526 --> 00:45:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And when we start
to live in presence,

00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:02.750 align:middle line:84%
these gifts begin to reveal
themselves and express

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:03.550 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:08.500 align:middle line:84%
So we're not struggling to
survive and get money and--

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:09.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:10.120 align:middle line:90%
Competition?

00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, compete with others.

00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:17.290 align:middle line:84%
We're just allowing this
divine energy, which

00:45:17.290 --> 00:45:22.510 align:middle line:84%
is the essence of all
life, to move through us

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:27.670 align:middle line:84%
and create and express
however it wants.

00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:32.020 align:middle line:84%
And in order to do that, we
have to let go of our own idea

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:35.920 align:middle line:84%
of what I should be doing
or how my life should be.

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:39.620 align:middle line:84%
That acts as an obstacle to
the natural expression flowing

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:40.420 align:middle line:90%
through.

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:41.337 align:middle line:90%
>> The surrender part?

00:45:41.337 --> 00:45:42.137 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:45:42.137 --> 00:45:43.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Surrender to what is?

00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:46.408 align:middle line:84%
>> And just like-- you know,
as you were saying that,

00:45:46.408 --> 00:45:49.660 align:middle line:84%
I was getting all this beautiful
nature that we have around us,

00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:53.730 align:middle line:90%
it's co-inhabiting, right?

00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:55.930 align:middle line:84%
The bees are coming
and pollinating,

00:45:55.930 --> 00:46:01.300 align:middle line:84%
and different species of trees
are blooming and coming out,

00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:03.140 align:middle line:84%
and the other trees
are doing their thing,

00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:07.730 align:middle line:84%
but there is maybe some sense
of competition in some areas.

00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:10.050 align:middle line:84%
But for the most
part, it's, you know--

00:46:10.050 --> 00:46:11.050 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a connectedness.

00:46:11.050 --> 00:46:14.230 align:middle line:10%
And we become part of that
field of connectedness,

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:17.770 align:middle line:10%
and we begin to flow with
life, rather than struggling

00:46:17.770 --> 00:46:20.290 align:middle line:10%
and fighting and trying
to get something for me

00:46:20.290 --> 00:46:24.160 align:middle line:10%
and try to get more
than other people,

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:25.570 align:middle line:10%
be better than other people.

00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:28.570 align:middle line:84%
We're just flowing
together as one.

00:46:28.570 --> 00:46:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's that connectedness,
that sense of being connected

00:46:33.070 --> 00:46:35.650 align:middle line:84%
to something deeper,
is what gives us

00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:37.520 align:middle line:84%
a feeling of inner
peace and harmony.

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's what most
everybody is longing for.

00:46:41.770 --> 00:46:46.130 align:middle line:84%
We're seeking to feel
happiness, to feel good inside.

00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:50.550 align:middle line:10%
And most people are seeking
it in the material world,

00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:54.850 align:middle line:10%
in getting a sense of self
through becoming successful

00:46:54.850 --> 00:46:57.730 align:middle line:10%
somehow, so that they can be
recognized by other people

00:46:57.730 --> 00:47:00.260 align:middle line:10%
and feel, I'm great.

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And it can only come when
we let go of all that

00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:06.980 align:middle line:84%
and come back to
simplicity of being

00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:09.820 align:middle line:90%
in the presence of this moment.

00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And then we notice
like, oh wow, there's

00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:17.120 align:middle line:84%
such beauty right in front
of me everywhere, all around.

00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And before, we didn't
have the eyes to see it.

00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:20.260 align:middle line:90%
We missed it all.

00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:22.510 align:middle line:84%
Because we're so busy
trying to get somewhere,

00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:23.770 align:middle line:90%
trying to get to the future.

00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And the mind thinks that, in
the future, I'll be happy.

00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:29.110 align:middle line:90%
When I get this, I'll be happy.

00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:34.060 align:middle line:84%
When I find my life partner, my
twin flame, then I'll be happy.

00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:36.760 align:middle line:84%
When the ETs come, and we
have contact with them,

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:37.900 align:middle line:90%
then everything will be OK.

00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:39.970 align:middle line:90%
And it's always in the future.

00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:44.510 align:middle line:84%
But the future doesn't
exist except as imagination,

00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:45.710 align:middle line:90%
which is part of the mind.

00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And nor does the past
exist except as memories,

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:52.062 align:middle line:90%
which is part of the mind.

00:47:52.062 --> 00:47:53.770 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
ever exists is what's

00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:55.720 align:middle line:90%
here right now in this moment.

00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's an eternal
present moment.

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
most people are

00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:06.070 align:middle line:84%
trying to escape
from this moment

00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:10.960 align:middle line:84%
is because underlying
their experience when

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:14.500 align:middle line:84%
they stop and become
still is a kind of feeling

00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:17.140 align:middle line:90%
of agitation and irritation.

00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And there is a movement
to avoid feeling that.

00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:22.192 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:48:22.192 --> 00:48:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And then everything that's
created or every action

00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:34.390 align:middle line:84%
that's taken, every word that's
spoken comes from that feeling

00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:36.380 align:middle line:90%
of agitation.

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's embedded in the
creation in the physical world.

00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:46.300 align:middle line:84%
But if we allow
ourselves to meet that,

00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:52.360 align:middle line:84%
to drop deeper, and open
to that, that energy that's

00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:55.268 align:middle line:84%
agitated starts to calm
down when we really say,

00:48:55.268 --> 00:48:56.560 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'm going to sit with that.

00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:58.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to meet it.

00:48:58.330 --> 00:49:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
a sense of peace.

00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And then a deeper wisdom can
move through us from peace.

00:49:06.850 --> 00:49:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And then we're
creating, expressing,

00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:13.270 align:middle line:90%
relating from a place of peace.

00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:16.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And we can build from there,
as opposed to building things

00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:20.410 align:middle line:84%
with this agitated energy,
which then just creates more

00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:25.310 align:middle line:84%
disharmony, and
we can actually--

00:49:25.310 --> 00:49:26.890 align:middle line:90%
again, more integration, right?

00:49:26.890 --> 00:49:29.320 align:middle line:84%
Because now we're
building structures,

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:31.030 align:middle line:84%
we're building
power grids, we're

00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:35.770 align:middle line:84%
building all of this
functional stuff

00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:38.940 align:middle line:84%
that we do in society, but
now with a new energy that

00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:42.220 align:middle line:84%
is more integrative
and supportive,

00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:45.205 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to that
competition energy you

00:49:45.205 --> 00:49:46.340 align:middle line:90%
were talking about earlier.

00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:48.460 align:middle line:84%
This, I've got to
get on top of it,

00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:51.775 align:middle line:84%
or I've got to out-beat
this person, or this-- yeah,

00:49:51.775 --> 00:49:54.220 align:middle line:90%
for sure.

00:49:54.220 --> 00:50:00.280 align:middle line:84%
In a sense this idea of just
even ETs or this channel

00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:04.150 align:middle line:84%
information or extra
dimensionals, that in itself

00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:08.860 align:middle line:84%
is just a permission slip for
us to get this information.

00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:10.565 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it already
resides in us.

00:50:10.565 --> 00:50:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And we've heard this over and
over again from the channel

00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:15.010 align:middle line:84%
messages, you know,
for me being in this

00:50:15.010 --> 00:50:19.570 align:middle line:84%
for so long, for me, it's
exciting to explore it

00:50:19.570 --> 00:50:23.170 align:middle line:84%
in this way, in this manner, but
ultimately, I feel what they're

00:50:23.170 --> 00:50:25.650 align:middle line:84%
all trying to say,
all the highest

00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:28.350 align:middle line:84%
gurus and the great
teachers of the planet

00:50:28.350 --> 00:50:32.170 align:middle line:84%
and Jesus and Buddha, and what
everybody's trying to say here,

00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:33.220 align:middle line:90%
it's all in you.

00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:38.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I feel like part of
the maturing of humanity now,

00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:42.970 align:middle line:84%
what we're ready for, is to move
from trying to understand that

00:50:42.970 --> 00:50:46.060 align:middle line:84%
information on a mental level
and the fascination with

00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:51.730 align:middle line:84%
the teachings to the individual
direct application of it

00:50:51.730 --> 00:50:55.180 align:middle line:84%
in our own lives and living
it, moment to moment.

00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, yeah, not have
a specific identity with any

00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:01.390 align:middle line:84%
of it and just access it
when you need it and allow it

00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:03.460 align:middle line:90%
to come through when it comes.

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:07.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, when we're open and
just in a state of allowing,

00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:16.270 align:middle line:84%
then we hand over the power
to the greater intelligence.

00:51:16.270 --> 00:51:18.130 align:middle line:90%
And this intelligence.

00:51:18.130 --> 00:51:22.630 align:middle line:84%
Is much greater than the little
me, the little mind, that

00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:28.600 align:middle line:84%
thinks, I know what I need to
do to be in control of my life

00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:32.260 align:middle line:84%
and to feel safe
and to feel secure.

00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:35.290 align:middle line:84%
When we let go of that,
the greater intelligence

00:51:35.290 --> 00:51:38.280 align:middle line:84%
has its own plan,
which when discovered

00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:43.900 align:middle line:84%
is often even more magical and
more synchronistic, more divine

00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:46.820 align:middle line:84%
than our mind can
even comprehend.

00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:49.000 align:middle line:84%
It's an intelligence
that can create

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:54.780 align:middle line:84%
galaxies, that can create
all this multiplicity of life

00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:55.840 align:middle line:90%
forms.

00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:58.300 align:middle line:84%
How can our mind even
comprehend what that is?

00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And to know ourselves
as that, then that's

00:52:05.550 --> 00:52:09.300 align:middle line:84%
really the essence
of spirituality,

00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:11.820 align:middle line:90%
to be one with that.

00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:14.340 align:middle line:90%
To know that I am that.

00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:19.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm not this little me that
I believe myself to be.

00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:25.200 align:middle line:84%
We have to give up wanting to
control and get things in order

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:27.942 align:middle line:90%
to access that.

00:52:27.942 --> 00:52:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:32.483 align:middle line:84%
Keep us in touch
with your journey.

00:52:32.483 --> 00:52:34.150 align:middle line:84%
How do people get in
touch with you now?

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they can visit
my website, louisekay.net.

00:52:37.570 --> 00:52:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also on Facebook
and Instagram and YouTube.

00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:42.780 align:middle line:84%
They can connect
with me on there.

00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:43.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks, again.

00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:45.538 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad we were able to
meet in your hometown.

00:52:45.538 --> 00:52:47.550 align:middle line:90%


00:52:47.550 --> 00:52:48.350 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:52:48.350 --> 00:52:49.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks, Reuben.
