[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:07.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.100 align:middle line:84%
This is Suzanne Spooner,
QHHT level-3 practitioner

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.592 align:middle line:90%
in Des Moines, Iowa.

00:00:12.592 --> 00:00:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to have a
little chat with you today.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.970 align:middle line:10%
This is a topic that I discuss
with my clients every time

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.160 align:middle line:10%
that we get ready
to do a session.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.240 align:middle line:10%
And the topic is what we've
been taught about ourselves

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.245 align:middle line:10%
versus what is real.

00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:30.600 align:middle line:90%


00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.710 align:middle line:90%
Think about this.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.840 align:middle line:90%
When you are growing up--

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.900 align:middle line:84%
and children are just awesome
for saying the first thing that

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.950 align:middle line:90%
comes to mind.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's sometimes
not what the grownups

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.750 align:middle line:90%
want them to be voicing.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.920 align:middle line:84%
It's the be seen and not
heard, and what you have to say

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.340 align:middle line:90%
isn't of value.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.510 align:middle line:90%
You know what that does?

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.820 align:middle line:90%
It diminishes what you know.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.710 align:middle line:90%
And it makes you confused.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.890 align:middle line:10%
And then when you're in a
confused state, what do you do?

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.640 align:middle line:84%
You rely on authority to
answer your questions for you

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.005 align:middle line:90%
because they know better.

00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:13.290 align:middle line:90%


00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.220 align:middle line:90%
They know, right?

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.560 align:middle line:90%
Who the heck are they?

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.245 align:middle line:84%
It's just this weird way
of giving up our power.

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:22.690 align:middle line:90%


00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.470 align:middle line:84%
In the beauty of my
work, the hypnosis,

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.240 align:middle line:84%
that shows everybody that
they hold all their answers,

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.055 align:middle line:84%
and knowledge, and
healing within them.

00:01:33.055 --> 00:01:36.610 align:middle line:90%


00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.820 align:middle line:84%
That golden tip that I give
my clients before we start

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.985 align:middle line:90%
a session is, always trust.

00:01:41.985 --> 00:01:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And say the very
first thing that

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.140 align:middle line:84%
comes to mind whenever
I ask you a question.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.110 align:middle line:84%
Now what happens when
they do that is they're

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.100 align:middle line:84%
answering from this part of them
that's the part of them that

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.630 align:middle line:90%
knows everything.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.060 align:middle line:90%
And we all have that part.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.670 align:middle line:90%
We all know everything.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.990 align:middle line:90%


00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.280 align:middle line:84%
So in that moment, which we
call an epiphany, an aha,

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.240 align:middle line:84%
a weird moment, what you
did, without even trying,

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.670 align:middle line:84%
is you quieted down
that analytical,

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.220 align:middle line:84%
left side of your
brain to freely speak

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.610 align:middle line:84%
that stream of thought from
the right that knows it all,

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.660 align:middle line:90%
knows the answers.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.570 align:middle line:90%
It's right there.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.750 align:middle line:84%
We see it every single
time we do a session.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.280 align:middle line:90%
It's right there.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And our society doesn't tell
us that we have this within us,

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.330 align:middle line:84%
that we can access this
any time we want to.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.490 align:middle line:90%
We're designed to be like that.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.470 align:middle line:84%
This creativity,
this imagination,

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.160 align:middle line:84%
it's not just creativity
and just imagination.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.310 align:middle line:84%
It's our gift from
God, from source,

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.770 align:middle line:84%
to help us get through
this life in an easy way.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.988 align:middle line:90%
It's how life is meant to be.

00:02:53.988 --> 00:02:56.090 align:middle line:90%
You can have a QHHT session.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.300 align:middle line:90%
And it can be found out easily.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.140 align:middle line:90%
And that's great.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.940 align:middle line:90%
That works.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.210 align:middle line:90%
It's such a powerful--

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.670 align:middle line:84%
it's a powerful way of
accessing this part of you that

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.410 align:middle line:84%
wants to be in
communication with you

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.170 align:middle line:84%
all the time, that knows
every single answer,

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.860 align:middle line:84%
can tell you why you have
any element within your body,

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.580 align:middle line:84%
and what needs to change in
order to maintain feeling.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.350 align:middle line:90%
It's all within us.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.500 align:middle line:84%
It is an illusion that
we have bought into,

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.860 align:middle line:84%
that we don't know
our own answers.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:28.970 align:middle line:90%
It's just not true.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.200 align:middle line:90%


00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.760 align:middle line:84%
Listen to the thought
that comes in.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.560 align:middle line:90%
Is it yes?

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.500 align:middle line:90%
Is it no?

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.750 align:middle line:90%
Is it a longer understanding?

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.040 align:middle line:90%
Write it down as it comes in.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.840 align:middle line:90%
Don't judge it.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.170 align:middle line:90%
Don't try to analyze it.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.840 align:middle line:90%
Just get it down on paper.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.640 align:middle line:90%
Go away.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.020 align:middle line:84%
Come back later and take a look
at it, and see what you wrote.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.290 align:middle line:84%
I think you might be surprised
at the depth of the information

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.640 align:middle line:90%
that you let flow through.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.320 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.720 align:middle line:90%
This is how we do this.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.900 align:middle line:84%
We can choose to come
out of our confusion,

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.690 align:middle line:84%
and trust that we have
all answers within us.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.040 align:middle line:90%
And all of you do.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.170 align:middle line:90%
We all do.

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is how we get past this
wonky time in our humanity's

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.060 align:middle line:90%
history.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:26.570 align:middle line:90%


00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:33.533 align:middle line:10%
>> Suzanne, Beverly, I
heard you guys's sessions.

00:04:33.533 --> 00:04:35.700 align:middle line:10%
I think I heard the first
one reach out to you guys.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.370 align:middle line:10%
And then you've continued
this awesome regression work.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.772 align:middle line:10%
I'd love to know a little
back story for our audience.

00:04:43.772 --> 00:04:45.980 align:middle line:10%
The best thing is for them
to check out the sessions.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:46.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.260 align:middle line:90%
>> But how did you guys meet?

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:55.070 align:middle line:84%
How did this interaction
with the engineers and the--

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.020 align:middle line:90%
what's the other group?

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.240 align:middle line:84%
>> The designers of
the reality simulation.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, the designers
and the engineers.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.910 align:middle line:90%
And how did this come about?

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And walk us-- back us up just
to give us our back story

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:09.980 align:middle line:90%
a little bit for the audience.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.590 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, well, I'll begin.

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.703 align:middle line:84%
So Beverly reached out
to me with a friend.

00:05:15.703 --> 00:05:17.120 align:middle line:10%
They both wanted
to have sessions.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.870 align:middle line:10%
So it's just a normal way
of beginning the connection,

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.148 align:middle line:10%
the process, together.

00:05:23.148 --> 00:05:24.440 align:middle line:90%
That's just how it always goes.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.020 align:middle line:84%
I never usually know the
clients before they come in.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:33.170 align:middle line:10%
It's just a brand-new meeting,
and getting to one another.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.080 align:middle line:90%
And then Beverly happened.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.080 align:middle line:90%
>> That really happened?

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.920 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.180 align:middle line:90%
Bing.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.210 align:middle line:90%
You just happened.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.890 align:middle line:10%
What happened?

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:42.690 align:middle line:10%
Tell us about that.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it started--

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.510 align:middle line:84%
just as they do, we
always sit first.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And I give them some
information about how

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.380 align:middle line:84%
they can help themselves
to go in nice and deep,

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.310 align:middle line:84%
allow to access all the
information that they carry.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And then when we're
done with that part,

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.170 align:middle line:84%
they share with me a little
bit about their life story.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.258 align:middle line:84%
It's a big deal to
tell your life story.

00:06:06.258 --> 00:06:08.300 align:middle line:84%
There's probably never
any time in anybody's life

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.210 align:middle line:84%
where they say, hey, I want
to know your whole life story.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.380 align:middle line:10%
And to have somebody
who's unconditional,

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.490 align:middle line:10%
not judgmental, just very
curious, I'm listening for--

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.710 align:middle line:10%
I want to know what
they've been through.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.885 align:middle line:10%
And I'm listening
for things that I

00:06:24.885 --> 00:06:27.260 align:middle line:10%
know that I'm going to want
to ask about in their session

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.930 align:middle line:10%
to help them gain
more clarity on why

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.590 align:middle line:10%
life has been the way it is.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.210 align:middle line:84%
But when I got to that point
with Beverly, and I said,

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.430 align:middle line:84%
I want to know your
whole life story,

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.650 align:middle line:84%
and she just so
sweetly looked at me.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And she says, do
you want the truth?

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.360 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, yeah.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.950 align:middle line:90%
That would be most helpful.

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And there we began on
this amazing journey.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Beverly, what was your
intention to seek out Suzanne

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.480 align:middle line:90%
and to do this work?

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.820 align:middle line:90%
>> It was my friend, actually.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:04.340 align:middle line:84%
So she was watching
QHHT sessions

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.400 align:middle line:90%
and had gotten really into that.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:12.530 align:middle line:84%
And I suggested that she
goes and has a session.

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And she was hesitant in our
phone call of discussing this.

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:21.830 align:middle line:10%
And so I offered to go with her.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.778 align:middle line:10%
I said, do you want
someone to go with you?

00:07:23.778 --> 00:07:25.820 align:middle line:10%
Do you want to have the
experience with somebody?

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:26.620 align:middle line:10%
I'll go.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.610 align:middle line:10%
And she was like, you would?

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:30.710 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah, yeah, I'll go.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how
it all started.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Had you known much
about it before--

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:35.330 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>> --your friend?

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.080 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:36.880 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Did she go first or--

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:39.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Her friend went first.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And it was a great,
wonderful, amazing session.

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:44.570 align:middle line:90%
And then Beverly came in.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:52.768 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- it starts
out just like they all do.

00:07:52.768 --> 00:07:54.560 align:middle line:84%
You don't know where
they're going to go to

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.780 align:middle line:84%
and what the experience is
going to be like for them.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.790 align:middle line:84%
But she had had a
lot of challenges

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:00.980 align:middle line:90%
in life, as many humans have.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.020 align:middle line:90%
And that's not that unusual.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:07.550 align:middle line:84%
But when people come
in, there's just

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:11.390 align:middle line:84%
a lot of questions
people are mulling over,

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.370 align:middle line:84%
which has weighted them
down, broken down the body

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:17.630 align:middle line:90%
in a lot of cases.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:22.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's such an honor
to be in the position

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:25.880 align:middle line:84%
that I am, that they'll allow
me to hear their life stories.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And Beverly's was one I
had to keep track of it.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.070 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot that's gone
on in her young life.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:35.539 align:middle line:10%
And-- but I knew, from what
she was sharing with me,

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:37.789 align:middle line:10%
that there was going
to be potential,

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:40.429 align:middle line:10%
as there is with all, but
really interesting potential

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:45.080 align:middle line:10%
to find out why these abilities
that she's had since childhood

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.090 align:middle line:10%
were there, and to
understand those deeper.

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:49.410 align:middle line:84%
That's what I thought
we were going into.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:51.680 align:middle line:90%
And then we take a turn.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, walk us
through that process.

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:57.620 align:middle line:84%
So with Beverly and other
clients, how does that work?

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.190 align:middle line:90%
What-- somebody comes in--

00:08:59.190 --> 00:08:59.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:02.272 align:middle line:84%
So they've set up
the appointment.

00:09:02.272 --> 00:09:04.230 align:middle line:84%
It can be-- right now
I'm a little over a year.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:05.980 align:middle line:84%
So it takes a while
for them to get to me.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.290 align:middle line:90%
But it's just time.

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:08.090 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:09.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, you have a year booking?

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.300 align:middle line:84%
>> It's about 14
months right now.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:11.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.190 align:middle line:90%
You're catching up with Dolores.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.790 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.998 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, two years out when
you booked your sessions?

00:09:16.998 --> 00:09:17.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right,

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you're
going to get there.

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:19.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:21.720 align:middle line:84%
But-- so can I talk
about that a little bit?

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Because people are
like, oh, my gosh.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:24.440 align:middle line:90%
It's so long.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, I know.

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:26.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry it's so long.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:29.280 align:middle line:84%
But I double checked that with
the high cells in sessions.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, they were wishing
they could get in sooner.

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I can move people
up on my cancelation list.

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden they're
there sooner than expected.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'll always ask,
why did that happen?

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:41.520 align:middle line:90%
Why was I able to move them up?

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Or why did it need
to be this long?

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And the high self,
they're so funny.

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:50.460 align:middle line:84%
They say, you think you're
in control of your schedule.

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And they think
they're in control.

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:53.940 align:middle line:90%
And we're in control.

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And this was the time that
this one needed to get to you.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.720 align:middle line:84%
Or they needed that year
to really get the benefit

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.520 align:middle line:90%
from this.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.860 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't have asked
the same questions a year

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.420 align:middle line:90%
ago that they asked today.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And with Beverly
and her friend, I

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:10.980 align:middle line:84%
can't remember what
the reason was.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.140 align:middle line:84%
But I was able to
get them in sooner.

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:16.380 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have that long
to wait in comparison.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.450 align:middle line:90%
But that was interesting.

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.430 align:middle line:90%
Why did that happen?

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And so when they come
in, we will sit and talk.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:26.310 align:middle line:84%
I share the very best
information with them

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.640 align:middle line:84%
that I know will help them
get as deep as possible,

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.300 align:middle line:84%
to access as much
knowledge as they can.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:34.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm recording it.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:35.520 align:middle line:10%
I want to get all
of that information

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.530 align:middle line:10%
onto the recording for
them to have afterwards.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:40.170 align:middle line:84%
When I'm done sharing with them
the information that I have,

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:43.865 align:middle line:84%
then I'll ask them to share
to me their life story.

00:10:43.865 --> 00:10:45.490 align:middle line:84%
I want to hear about
the whole journey.

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:46.532 align:middle line:90%
I help them through that.

00:10:46.532 --> 00:10:48.840 align:middle line:90%
It's a big thing to do.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.070 align:middle line:90%
But it's fascinating.

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.710 align:middle line:84%
Every human being has
such a fascinating story.

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so interested in
understanding why their life

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:58.770 align:middle line:90%
has been the way that it is.

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:01.225 align:middle line:84%
When we get done
with that, then I

00:11:01.225 --> 00:11:02.850 align:middle line:84%
ask to look at their
list of questions.

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:06.450 align:middle line:84%
They've written these out
before they come to the session.

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And they're usually
two lists, one of life

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:11.910 align:middle line:84%
and personal questions, one
of health and body questions.

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And then, after we've read
through that list together,

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.530 align:middle line:84%
we'll take a quick restroom
break, come back at them,

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:21.250 align:middle line:90%
nice and cozy, on the table.

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:23.950 align:middle line:84%
That's when we begin
the amazing journey.

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:27.450 align:middle line:84%
I count them up at the
end, see what they recall.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:31.140 align:middle line:84%
That's always an
interesting perception,

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:34.380 align:middle line:84%
go over the recordings from
how it's going to come to them,

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:36.900 align:middle line:84%
give them some
steps to help them

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.090 align:middle line:84%
ground back in
after the session.

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And away they go, a new and
improved version of themselves.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:43.690 align:middle line:90%
>> A new and improved version.

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:49.710 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, that beginning
phase is a breaking the ice,

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:52.240 align:middle line:84%
getting them relaxed, because
you want them on the table.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.370 align:middle line:84%
You want them to be able to
just melt and relax in you.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:59.250 align:middle line:84%
So that it sounds like that's an
important part of the process?

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:00.050 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:03.660 align:middle line:84%
Because people are feeling
more aware in sessions

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.400 align:middle line:84%
than what they
used to, they need

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.290 align:middle line:84%
to have some tools
to help manage

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:10.930 align:middle line:84%
that analytical left
side of the brain.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.450 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I'm giving them.

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'm helping them get
very close to that state.

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:19.110 align:middle line:90%
They don't always know that.

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:24.090 align:middle line:10%
But I'm doing some prep work
with them, very subtly, so that

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:26.040 align:middle line:10%
when it's ready for--

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.780 align:middle line:10%
it's time for them to
get onto the table,

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.200 align:middle line:10%
and start getting ready,
and going in nice and deep,

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.800 align:middle line:10%
it's just a super-easy
transition in almost all cases.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And other than supporting
your friend, Beverly,

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:41.070 align:middle line:84%
did you have a specific thing,
questions that you wanted

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:43.110 align:middle line:90%
to get answered?

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:44.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yeah.

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:45.360 align:middle line:90%
>> What were they?

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.780 align:middle line:84%
>> It took me a while to
actually come up with questions

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:50.940 align:middle line:90%
because I had to really think.

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:54.090 align:middle line:84%
What am I trying
to get out of this?

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, what I
came to the conclusion of,

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.090 align:middle line:90%
is that it was healing.

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And so my whole intention,
after I figured that out, was I

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:07.140 align:middle line:90%
want healing out of this.

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:08.850 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:11.200 align:middle line:90%
But there was no expectations.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.850 align:middle line:84%
There was no-- nothing, just
whatever comes out of it,

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:17.520 align:middle line:90%
and hopefully some healing.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:17.775 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:13:17.775 --> 00:13:18.420 align:middle line:90%
>> So--

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And did you feel
like-- afterwards,

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:21.713 align:middle line:84%
did you feel like
that's what you got?

00:13:21.713 --> 00:13:22.960 align:middle line:90%
>> I felt so weird.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:23.760 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:24.150 align:middle line:90%
>> It was so weird?

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:25.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:26.070 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:27.270 align:middle line:90%
>> I felt so weird.

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.190 align:middle line:84%
It took me two weeks
to even come back

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:30.580 align:middle line:90%
into this reality, so--

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:31.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:32.520 align:middle line:90%
What can you describe?

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.930 align:middle line:90%
What is weird?

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Just how it was like I was
one foot in and one foot out,

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:39.990 align:middle line:90%
for two weeks.

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Like, I would think
about something.

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:43.410 align:middle line:90%
And then it would show up.

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh, I'm just
having a human thought.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.950 align:middle line:84%
Oh, there's this RV
I'm thinking about.

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:50.820 align:middle line:90%
And I'm on the road.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.470 align:middle line:90%
And I look over and, oh, look.

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:54.150 align:middle line:90%
There's that RV now.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:54.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:56.410 align:middle line:90%
Would be the red cardinal?

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:57.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:58.502 align:middle line:90%
That could be the red Cardinal.

00:13:58.502 --> 00:14:00.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, for sure.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.190 align:middle line:90%
And that's the--

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:03.900 align:middle line:84%
Beverly's story
is so fascinating

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.540 align:middle line:84%
because everybody's is so
unique after a session.

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:09.540 align:middle line:90%
They're not usually that--

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.150 align:middle line:84%
trying to wrap their
head around it like that.

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:15.360 align:middle line:84%
But still, I say
it's like they're

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:18.210 align:middle line:84%
creating the golden onion
during their session.

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And it takes afterwards to start
wrapping your head around it,

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:25.020 align:middle line:84%
peeling it back, understanding
what that meant and this meant.

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And then we have Beverly,
who's manifesting RVs

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:30.050 align:middle line:90%
with a thought one minute.

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:30.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:31.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:32.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Why gold?

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:34.630 align:middle line:84%
Why not a red onion,
or a yellow-- or not--

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:35.505 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, gold because--

00:14:35.505 --> 00:14:35.910 align:middle line:90%
>> --white, or--

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:37.220 align:middle line:84%
>> It's precious,
precious metal.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK, gotcha, yeah.

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And so those layers that you're
shedding are still precious?

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, yeah, absolutely,
because it's part of you.

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I think it's good
that you say that because a lot

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.360 align:middle line:84%
of people, and
especially now, are like,

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.205 align:middle line:84%
I've got to get rid of
that garbage, that stuff.

00:14:51.205 --> 00:14:52.080 align:middle line:90%
Get the onion layers.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.520 align:middle line:90%
Peel the onion layers in it.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:54.480 align:middle line:90%
And that's bad.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's, I think,
having respect for it.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:02.730 align:middle line:10%
It's the stuff that we don't
like has taught us a lot.

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And there's a way to
delve through that,

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:07.930 align:middle line:84%
and not throw it
out like garbage,

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:09.503 align:middle line:84%
but say, that was
part of my path.

00:15:09.503 --> 00:15:10.420 align:middle line:90%
And I've learned this.

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'm ready for
something else.

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>> And that almost helps the
layers get peeled off a little

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:18.310 align:middle line:90%
bit quicker--

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:19.245 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I think it does--

00:15:19.245 --> 00:15:19.500 align:middle line:90%
>> --by pondering it.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:20.610 align:middle line:84%
>> But when you're
not resisting it--

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:21.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:21.630 align:middle line:90%
>> --not fighting it.

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:22.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:23.460 align:middle line:90%
Peel those onions.

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.380 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my eyes are stinging.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.540 align:middle line:84%
But if it's nice and gold,
it's just like-- it's

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:30.270 align:middle line:84%
like a golden brown,
that when you grill it,

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:31.990 align:middle line:84%
the stuff doesn't hurt
your eyes as much.

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:35.080 align:middle line:84%
>> In total, so far,
you've had three sessions.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:35.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And after the first
one, two weeks of weird.

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.980 align:middle line:90%
What was the mechanisms to--

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.620 align:middle line:84%
you guys talked about wanting
to post it, I imagine?

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:50.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, well, when
I'm giving a session,

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.470 align:middle line:10%
I can tell right away if this
is material that I want to put

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:54.270 align:middle line:10%
out.

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm looking for
is things that I think

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:58.952 align:middle line:84%
can help others,
generally, because there's

00:15:58.952 --> 00:16:00.660 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people who
won't have a session.

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:01.980 align:middle line:84%
But they might
have similar issues

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:03.188 align:middle line:90%
that they're working through.

00:16:03.188 --> 00:16:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And if they hear how somebody
else uncovered it, and had

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.690 align:middle line:84%
a way of coping with it or
understanding it better,

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:11.280 align:middle line:90%
then I think, all the better.

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.800 align:middle line:84%
Now sometimes, they're
just fantastical.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And they're just
like, wow, that's

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:19.320 align:middle line:84%
amazing, that people will just--
their minds will be blown.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:22.410 align:middle line:84%
So Beverly had a double
hitter in her session.

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:26.850 align:middle line:84%
Her past life that she
went to was so amazing.

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- the way that
she shared the information,

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.060 align:middle line:84%
it was like you were in a
movie, watching it all unfold.

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was this amazing story of
this true love, and in Europe.

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And she was a
woman of prominence

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.420 align:middle line:84%
that was affecting
other countries.

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking that there's
historical things here

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:47.460 align:middle line:84%
we can probably
look up and find,

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:49.270 align:middle line:84%
which is just-- that
doesn't happen often.

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:50.713 align:middle line:84%
But it's really
cool when it does.

00:16:50.713 --> 00:16:51.630 align:middle line:90%
>> And you did, right?

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, we-- well,
yeah, she did.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:54.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:57.130 align:middle line:90%
>> And that was amazing.

00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:59.700 align:middle line:84%
If that was all we got out
of the session, it was--

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.860 align:middle line:84%
I would have put it up
because it was beautiful.

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:03.810 align:middle line:90%
It's a great story.

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:07.589 align:middle line:84%
But then we made the
transition to her high self,

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:08.700 align:middle line:90%
which is what we do.

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.460 align:middle line:84%
It's really easy,
quick thing, where

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:12.960 align:middle line:84%
they start allowing
this information

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.502 align:middle line:84%
to come through from this part
of them that knows everything.

00:17:15.502 --> 00:17:17.710 align:middle line:84%
It's them opening their
mouth, them saying the words.

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:19.470 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
speaking through them.

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And with Beverly, the very
first clue, I got immediately.

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:27.599 align:middle line:90%
The voice really switched.

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And most people's voices
will switch somehow.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.733 align:middle line:84%
It's usually a
little more subtle.

00:17:32.733 --> 00:17:35.400 align:middle line:84%
They'll speak a little softer, a
little louder, a little firmer,

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.650 align:middle line:90%
a little softer.

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:40.800 align:middle line:84%
Beverly went into a
very robotic voice.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.380 align:middle line:10%
And that's not
terribly uncommon.

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:44.650 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't happen often.

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:46.440 align:middle line:90%
But it does.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And the whole
question of, why is

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.200 align:middle line:84%
your voice sounding like this,
they might wonder afterwards.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.760 align:middle line:90%
Can you explain that to them?

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think we did that
one on her first session.

00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:01.980 align:middle line:84%
But the information that started
coming through was so big.

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And it was a lot for me
to wrap my head around.

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:08.700 align:middle line:84%
So I'm usually--
my goal is to ask

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.310 align:middle line:84%
lots of open-ended
questions, ask questions

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:15.240 align:middle line:84%
off their answers, just keeping
the flow going deeper, deeper,

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:19.440 align:middle line:84%
deeper into this database of
knowledge that they carry.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:24.240 align:middle line:84%
But the content of the
material that she was giving

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.180 align:middle line:84%
was so expanding
to me, that I had

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:30.000 align:middle line:84%
to be trying to wrap my
head around and understand

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.910 align:middle line:84%
the information as
she was giving it,

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:34.860 align:middle line:84%
and then being mindful
of all the other parts

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:38.860 align:middle line:84%
that I'm managing
on the side there.

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And so because this presence
of her that was coming through

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.800 align:middle line:90%
was so unique--

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.300 align:middle line:84%
I think it was actually towards
the end of the first session

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.390 align:middle line:90%
where I asked, who are you?

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:54.630 align:middle line:84%
How do you-- because it
didn't seem like a high self.

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is where she
says, well, I'm a designer.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.130 align:middle line:84%
And then we get into more
questions about that.

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And she ends up saying she's
the designer of our reality

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:05.110 align:middle line:90%
simulations.

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.910 align:middle line:90%
And very--

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:06.840 align:middle line:90%
>> --very specific, right?

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:07.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Very specific.

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:09.733 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, ooh, what that?

00:19:09.733 --> 00:19:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And Beverly, have you have
you used those terms before,

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:13.230 align:middle line:90%
simulation theory?

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:14.030 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:15.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you pay
attention to Elon Musk?

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:17.920 align:middle line:84%
You're not a big
Elon Musk fan, or--

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.985 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no.

00:19:19.985 --> 00:19:23.350 align:middle line:84%
I actually had to
research him, so--

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:24.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:24.950 align:middle line:90%
Very cool.

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:26.640 align:middle line:90%
>> That's awesome.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>> So that led to this
awesome recording.

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:32.550 align:middle line:90%
Now that's public.

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
sharing because that's

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.130 align:middle line:90%
how I found out about it.

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And then you had
a second session.

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:38.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:41.530 align:middle line:84%
So we became fast
friends after that,

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:45.270 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure friends from a
long time, no coincidences.

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And we both just had so many
questions about what happened.

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And Beverly's starting
to get downloads.

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:54.090 align:middle line:84%
She's calling me on the phone
like, OK, they're telling me

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:55.153 align:middle line:90%
I have to tell you this.

00:19:55.153 --> 00:19:56.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, oh, hold on.

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:58.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm in-- let me
pull over in Target.

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.150 align:middle line:90%
Let me stop my car.

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:02.670 align:middle line:10%
And so all this information
was coming through.

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:03.840 align:middle line:10%
And we just--

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:06.291 align:middle line:10%
>> And how does
that come through?

00:20:06.291 --> 00:20:07.940 align:middle line:10%
>> Out of nowhere.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:08.740 align:middle line:10%
>> Is it--

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:08.850 align:middle line:10%
>> Just--

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:10.860 align:middle line:10%
>> --is it-- what
voice does it have?

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:13.350 align:middle line:90%
Does it have a voice?

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:15.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but it's
not like us talking.

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:17.580 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not the
same voice that's--

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:17.840 align:middle line:90%
when you're on the table.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:18.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it like the designer?

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:18.510 align:middle line:90%
>> --the table.

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:19.380 align:middle line:90%
Is it like the--

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:21.763 align:middle line:84%
>> No, but that just
happened, actually.

00:20:21.763 --> 00:20:22.680 align:middle line:90%
>> What just happened?

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>> The robotic voice--

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:24.540 align:middle line:90%
>> yes.

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:25.740 align:middle line:90%
>> --comes through?

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:26.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:27.990 align:middle line:90%
Before, no.

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, interesting.

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:30.420 align:middle line:90%
And how did it start?

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And how to evolve
into that voice?

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.960 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:38.020 align:middle line:90%
It was last week.

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:38.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:43.230 align:middle line:84%
>> So last week, before we
were getting ready to do this

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:47.830 align:middle line:84%
session, I started
getting downloads.

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:49.750 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, OK, OK.

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And then the downloads
started coming

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:57.880 align:middle line:90%
in that really separated words.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.390 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, [GASPS].

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:01.290 align:middle line:90%
>> It's them.

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:02.370 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:04.386 align:middle line:90%
>> She's back.

00:21:04.386 --> 00:21:05.860 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's what I was like.

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:06.660 align:middle line:10%
And I was--

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:10.200 align:middle line:10%
I think I need to go
write things down.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.340 align:middle line:90%
>> And did you?

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:12.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Some of it, yes.

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:13.860 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:17.850 align:middle line:84%
So people have been telling me,
you need to write things down.

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:21.990 align:middle line:84%
The problem with me writing
things down is it comes so fast

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:26.100 align:middle line:84%
that writing and the connection
between my hand and my brain,

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.780 align:middle line:90%
is just-- it's--

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:31.020 align:middle line:90%
I'd get three words.

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And there's already
three paragraphs.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you do audio
recordings of it?

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:37.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Not yet.

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:39.300 align:middle line:90%
Not yet.

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:42.880 align:middle line:10%
>> That could be one way to get
it down a little bit faster.

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:43.680 align:middle line:10%
>> Exactly.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.980 align:middle line:10%
>> And that aspect is something
that is truly fascinating.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:50.430 align:middle line:10%
We were talking about this
journey that we're all making

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:52.710 align:middle line:10%
through this
ascension, and how--

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:56.250 align:middle line:10%
what I found in these sessions,
and other practitioners

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:59.550 align:middle line:10%
as well, is that
we're becoming this--

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:02.130 align:middle line:10%
they'll call this fully-realized
human, where we have

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:05.020 align:middle line:10%
access of this all the time.

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:06.750 align:middle line:10%
We don't have to
be having a session

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.200 align:middle line:10%
to get this information.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And so it hasn't been
terribly uncommon,

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:13.570 align:middle line:84%
in the last year or so, where
clients will get a hold of me

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:14.370 align:middle line:90%
afterwards.

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, hey, I can
access this all the time now.

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:22.890 align:middle line:90%
It's there whenever I need it.

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:26.260 align:middle line:84%
I recognize that now because
I've spent some time with it.

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:29.220 align:middle line:10%
And I think I've been
hearing it my whole life,

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:30.660 align:middle line:10%
but I didn't know what it was.

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And I dismissed it because
that can't be that easy.

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:36.790 align:middle line:90%
But this is where we're headed.

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is really
such a great example

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:45.870 align:middle line:84%
of our capabilities in accessing
our human consciousness

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:48.480 align:middle line:90%
to our highest ability.

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I find it similar to--

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:53.970 align:middle line:84%
I work-- I have
worked, in the past,

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:56.910 align:middle line:84%
with sacred
medicines, ayahuasca,

00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:59.850 align:middle line:90%
and San Pedro, and mushrooms.

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And I feel there's a similar
mechanism to QHHT, where

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:06.990 align:middle line:90%
you get to that frequency.

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:10.170 align:middle line:10%
And you start to access
that information.

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And then your cells-- you
come more familiar with it.

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And then once you recognize
what that frequency is,

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:20.220 align:middle line:84%
then again, those are just
tools that you use to get there,

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:21.940 align:middle line:90%
and to access the information.

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And once you've
created that bridge,

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:28.360 align:middle line:84%
then you don't need those items
or those tools to get there.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:29.160 align:middle line:90%
You can--

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly, right.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.340 align:middle line:10%
>> --start to access
it on your own.

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:35.910 align:middle line:10%
So maybe that's
what's happening.

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:38.610 align:middle line:10%
>> It could be, I guess.

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:39.543 align:middle line:10%
>> No medicine needed.

00:23:39.543 --> 00:23:41.460 align:middle line:10%
I've got all the medicine
you need right here.

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:42.718 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:42.718 --> 00:23:44.010 align:middle line:90%
>> She's got it all within her.

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:45.677 align:middle line:84%
>> She's got it all
within her, exactly.

00:23:45.677 --> 00:23:49.050 align:middle line:84%
But this is a great
alternative to people

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:50.613 align:middle line:84%
who-- because
people ask me, hey,

00:23:50.613 --> 00:23:51.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm interested in ayahuasca.

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:54.358 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, well,
tread lightly.

00:23:54.358 --> 00:23:55.900 align:middle line:84%
I used to think when
I first started,

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:57.442 align:middle line:84%
I was like, everybody--
the president

00:23:57.442 --> 00:23:58.873 align:middle line:90%
should be drinking ayahuasca.

00:23:58.873 --> 00:24:00.040 align:middle line:90%
The whole world will change.

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And then after doing
that work for a while,

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.800 align:middle line:84%
I've seen different people
react in different ways.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, ooh, maybe
it's not for everybody.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.930 align:middle line:10%
>> And there's all these
modalities, like QHHT,

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:19.440 align:middle line:10%
and regression work, and other
types of shamanism with just

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:22.980 align:middle line:10%
drum circles, or sweats, or--
our Indigenous have a lot

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:25.530 align:middle line:10%
of different modalities
to do these--

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:29.370 align:middle line:10%
to access these states
of consciousness

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:31.510 align:middle line:10%
that can bring through
this amazing information.

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:33.380 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we're
exploring in the show.

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:34.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:34.980 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's--

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:36.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's very exciting.

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:37.600 align:middle line:90%
>> There was a third session.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:38.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.067 align:middle line:84%
>> We didn't really
go into the details.

00:24:40.067 --> 00:24:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's OK because
I want to send traffic.

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:44.380 align:middle line:90%
Everybody should watch--

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:45.180 align:middle line:90%
>> There's a lot.

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.190 align:middle line:84%
>> --and listen
to the materials.

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:51.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and it's dense material.

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:54.000 align:middle line:84%
So I was constantly rewinding,
listen again, rewind it,

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.090 align:middle line:90%
listen again.

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And I still don't fully
understand all of it.

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:00.780 align:middle line:84%
But it was-- when I
heard it, I immediately

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:03.270 align:middle line:90%
knew, Beverly's channeling.

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And there's an episode
I did with Barbara Lamb

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:10.080 align:middle line:84%
in season one, where
she regressed me

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:11.010 align:middle line:90%
to a channeling state.

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:13.980 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that it was
possible to access

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:16.350 align:middle line:90%
channeling through hypnosis.

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:17.490 align:middle line:90%
How does it feel?

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:22.350 align:middle line:84%
Does it feel like a
group, or a person, or--

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:24.030 align:middle line:90%
how does the energy feel to you?

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:27.420 align:middle line:90%


00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:29.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's kind
of multilayered,

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:33.840 align:middle line:90%
to be completely honest.

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:37.110 align:middle line:84%
When Suzanne and I did the
interview after the first one,

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:41.850 align:middle line:84%
I had to explain what happened
when I was coming back up, when

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:43.260 align:middle line:90%
she was counting me up.

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And what had happened
was, there was this--

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:51.360 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it was.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:54.250 align:middle line:84%
But it was like a
beam coming down.

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:56.340 align:middle line:90%
And I was coming up.

00:25:56.340 --> 00:26:01.410 align:middle line:90%
And as we met, it was like, OK.

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:03.600 align:middle line:90%
And then I went back up.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.650 align:middle line:90%
And then they went back down.

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And so I actually got
to experience that.

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:11.400 align:middle line:90%
It was really--

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Like a shifting of--

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:13.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>> --yourselves as
you came back up?

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:16.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:18.720 align:middle line:84%
It was really,
really interesting.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:23.070 align:middle line:90%
And oh, man.

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:23.870 align:middle line:90%
>> I remember that.

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:24.690 align:middle line:90%
I was with you.

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:25.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yeah.

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:26.700 align:middle line:90%
>> That was fun.

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:27.950 align:middle line:90%
That's a change in perception.

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:30.122 align:middle line:84%
She thought I was with
her in the experience.

00:26:30.122 --> 00:26:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>> In the journey, wow.

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:31.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:35.100 align:middle line:84%
So I was kind of
confused because she's

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:38.040 align:middle line:90%
done this many times.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.660 align:middle line:90%
This is her thing.

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't really
think that my experience was

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:48.480 align:middle line:84%
really that odd, or different
for her, because she's

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.370 align:middle line:90%
done this a million times.

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And what I didn't
realize is that she

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:57.210 align:middle line:84%
can see what I was seeing, but
because her voice was there,

00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:01.860 align:middle line:84%
it felt like she was in the
nothingness with me, seeing it.

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.510 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know why--

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe it was an
aspect of her that was.

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:07.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, most definitely.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.977 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:08.977 --> 00:27:10.560 align:middle line:84%
>> But she's talking
to me afterwards.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:11.700 align:middle line:90%
I think it was the day after.

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:12.590 align:middle line:90%
We were talking on the phone.

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, well,
you were right there.

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.390 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, no, Beverly.

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:16.650 align:middle line:90%
I was sitting beside you.

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And she's like,
no, you were there.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.600 align:middle line:84%
So it was-- and
that-- gosh, that's

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.280 align:middle line:90%
such a good point to bring up.

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:26.010 align:middle line:84%
There's so many different
layers and levels

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:29.010 align:middle line:90%
that we're experiencing.

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:30.210 align:middle line:90%
So that could be.

00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:33.540 align:middle line:84%
>> But when I found out she
wasn't, then I was like,

00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:35.850 align:middle line:84%
well [GASPS] I have to
tell you what was there.

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:37.350 align:middle line:90%
I have to tell you what I saw.

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:38.910 align:middle line:90%
So then we got to talking.

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, I think
people need to know this.

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:45.330 align:middle line:90%
And I was like really?

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:48.900 align:middle line:90%
She's like, yeah.

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:51.570 align:middle line:84%
Would you be open
to talk about it?

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:53.400 align:middle line:90%
Of course, yeah, I'm--

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's what made
it go, OK, YouTube.

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, well, it was just
it was such mind-expanding

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:01.650 align:middle line:10%
information.

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And when I put it out on
YouTube, or on Facebook,

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:09.030 align:middle line:84%
or where people were
getting access to it,

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:12.930 align:middle line:84%
I just kept seeing the emoji
where the head's blowing off.

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, OK, yeah
this is a good one.

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.200 align:middle line:90%
This is a lot of fun.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.040 align:middle line:90%
And it is.

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:20.970 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- her
journey just gave us

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:25.530 align:middle line:84%
just this encompassing,
wide view of our reality.

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And of course, in
that time, we're in--

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:33.430 align:middle line:84%
it was before COVID,
the first one?

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:34.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Was it?

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:35.940 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, the first
one was before COVID.

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:41.075 align:middle line:10%
And then the second,
I think, was--

00:28:41.075 --> 00:28:42.620 align:middle line:10%
>> It was right after COVID--

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:43.030 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:43.496 align:middle line:10%
>> In the summer.

00:28:43.496 --> 00:28:43.940 align:middle line:10%
>> And so we got--

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:45.350 align:middle line:10%
>> --but they didn't
release it into much later.

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:46.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right, right, right.

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:48.470 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think it was
probably September,

00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:51.800 align:middle line:84%
just before the election,
leading up to the election.

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And there's some stuff in
there about that, yeah.

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:55.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:55.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:28:55.940 --> 00:29:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>> But once we got into that
conversation, you saw this--

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:03.740 align:middle line:84%
we're all like, oh, my
gosh, this is terrible.

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:04.520 align:middle line:90%
We're in our houses.

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:05.395 align:middle line:90%
And what's happening?

00:29:05.395 --> 00:29:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And the world is
changing so dramatically.

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And we're all in that really
funneled vision of what

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:13.520 align:middle line:90%
things are perceived as.

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And then you can listen
to this aspect of Beverly

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:22.790 align:middle line:84%
explain this from such a wider
view, and it's like, oh, OK.

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:23.930 align:middle line:90%
We're OK.

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:24.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.200 align:middle line:90%
It's not the end of the world.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not the
end of the world.

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:27.737 align:middle line:10%
It's just a different
way to look at it.

00:29:27.737 --> 00:29:33.890 align:middle line:10%
And I think what it did, too,
is it helped people to not get

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:37.160 align:middle line:10%
so gut wrenched into
what was on the news.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.990 align:middle line:90%
It's like, OK, hold on.

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:42.090 align:middle line:90%
There's a bigger story to this.

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:42.890 align:middle line:90%
It was just--

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:43.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Frustrating.

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:44.960 align:middle line:10%
>> --amazing.

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:48.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, so you started
getting these downloads,

00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:55.160 align:middle line:10%
and seeing the RVs, and these
other-- the red cardinals.

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.900 align:middle line:90%
In what other aspects--

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:58.760 align:middle line:90%
you've had three sessions now.

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.500 align:middle line:84%
You're starting to
connect to this energy

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:02.210 align:middle line:90%
without the hypnosis.

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:04.490 align:middle line:84%
How else is it
affecting your life?

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:08.520 align:middle line:84%
What other changes have happened
since this regression work?

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:13.940 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm being called to do
my spiritual work that I was

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:16.430 align:middle line:84%
really working
behind the scenes,

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:18.260 align:middle line:90%
because of where I live.

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And that has really
made a big transition.

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:28.320 align:middle line:90%
And also, when I walk into--

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:32.010 align:middle line:84%
if I'm called into a
haunted house, per se.

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And I know that it has
demonic spirits and ghosts,

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:37.980 align:middle line:84%
and these people are
extremely troubled,

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:41.550 align:middle line:84%
I can just walk in and
tell them what is there,

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:44.130 align:middle line:84%
and why it's there,
and what's going on,

00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:46.530 align:middle line:84%
and bring light
to the situation.

00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And then actually, they
have given me the tools now

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:56.280 align:middle line:84%
to help the people get their
power back in the situation,

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:59.520 align:middle line:84%
and heal their home,
and heal their lives.

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes this really
big, transformational point

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.630 align:middle line:84%
of existence for
them because they're

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:11.550 align:middle line:84%
no longer prisoners to their
home, in that situation that's

00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:15.330 align:middle line:84%
weighing so heavily in their
lives, and in so many aspects.

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:17.430 align:middle line:90%
And so that's really changed.

00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:22.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, it sounds like,
Suzanne, from our last talk,

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:27.210 align:middle line:10%
that this work is, really, when
you boil it down to what is it,

00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:30.450 align:middle line:10%
it's giving people tools
of self empowerment--

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:31.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:38.520 align:middle line:10%
>> --and finding their way
to navigate reality with this

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:42.810 align:middle line:10%
observer lens, or a
different perspective.

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:46.860 align:middle line:84%
But the result of
that tool, looking

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:48.540 align:middle line:84%
at things from
the other reality,

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:50.140 align:middle line:90%
is people are empowered.

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:50.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's everything
because if we-- we've

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:59.310 align:middle line:84%
grown up relying on
authority, and what

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:02.130 align:middle line:84%
does this professional
say, and what

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:05.190 align:middle line:84%
does that person in government
have to tell us about

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:07.770 align:middle line:90%
ourselves, our religion.

00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:10.860 align:middle line:10%
And so we're coming
out of this time

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:14.130 align:middle line:10%
where we've taken all of
those labels and descriptions,

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:16.830 align:middle line:10%
and applied them to us,
and this is who I am.

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:19.290 align:middle line:10%
But what I have
found, with people

00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:21.900 align:middle line:10%
that are even new to a
spiritual path, they'll say,

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:24.570 align:middle line:10%
but I've had this
really interesting thing

00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:28.080 align:middle line:10%
happen to me back in my
childhood, or just last week.

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:29.980 align:middle line:84%
And I can't tell
anybody about it.

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:31.170 align:middle line:90%
I don't get it.

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And through this
whole process, they

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:37.750 align:middle line:84%
see that they hold all
knowledge within them.

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:39.280 align:middle line:90%
We all do.

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:42.540 align:middle line:84%
We've never been taught
that because otherwise, we

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:45.030 align:middle line:90%
aren't controllable.

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a beautiful
way of teaching people

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:53.100 align:middle line:84%
to trust their intuition,
their gut, their knowing,

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:56.250 align:middle line:84%
and that they have created all
their own issues because we're

00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:57.510 align:middle line:90%
amazing creators.

00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And if we've created
issues, for example,

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:02.730 align:middle line:84%
that have made it
difficult on the body,

00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:06.270 align:middle line:84%
we can understand the story
of why they got there.

00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:08.760 align:middle line:84%
Because they
created it as energy

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.890 align:middle line:84%
in these dense, unique
forms, they can heal it.

00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:13.037 align:middle line:84%
We call it the high
self on that day.

00:33:13.037 --> 00:33:15.120 align:middle line:84%
The high self can come in
and heal it, and give us

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:16.650 align:middle line:90%
all the information about it.

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:19.170 align:middle line:84%
They know what they
need to do afterwards,

00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:20.400 align:middle line:90%
in order to maintain.

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.500 align:middle line:84%
But that-- it's
physical healing,

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:23.700 align:middle line:90%
but it's mental healing.

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's reprogramming
these thoughts

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:31.950 align:middle line:84%
that our families and
societies has given us,

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:36.090 align:middle line:84%
that we've accepted because
we didn't not to, to be,

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:37.560 align:middle line:90%
hold on a minute.

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.880 align:middle line:90%
That's not me.

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:40.290 align:middle line:90%
This is who I am.

00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:41.610 align:middle line:90%
I can help people.

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I'm
meant to be doing here.

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
one of the key things,

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.290 align:middle line:84%
that when people
come in, it doesn't

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:50.460 align:middle line:90%
matter their background.

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:53.640 align:middle line:84%
They feel like they're here
to do something in this life.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know
quite what it is.

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:58.110 align:middle line:90%
And they want to know.

00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:01.470 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's almost
a sense of urgency.

00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And this process unlocks that
knowing, so that they can--

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.080 align:middle line:90%
maybe it's not leave their jobs.

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:13.080 align:middle line:84%
Maybe being at their
job is actually helping.

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:16.500 align:middle line:84%
But they understand the
clarity of what they're doing,

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:20.940 align:middle line:84%
and can maybe make
that more an integrated

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:24.210 align:middle line:84%
part of their own
personal experience.

00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:27.389 align:middle line:84%
>> And would you say right
now, especially, we're seeing,

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:34.320 align:middle line:84%
in the world, almost this
overemphasis of trying

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:39.360 align:middle line:84%
to control some-- in many
aspects of our society,

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.750 align:middle line:84%
especially with government,
and politics, and institutions,

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:46.139 align:middle line:90%
are really trying to clench on.

00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:49.480 align:middle line:84%
Would you say that's because
people are finding their power?

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:50.280 align:middle line:90%
People are--

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:50.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:52.199 align:middle line:90%
>> --discovering who they are?

00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:53.969 align:middle line:90%
>> I think Bashar says it best.

00:34:53.969 --> 00:34:56.190 align:middle line:84%
We're like two trains
going on a track.

00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And you can't be on
both trains anymore.

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what--
it's led up to this.

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:05.942 align:middle line:84%
When I started doing this
work in 2012, it's like, oh,

00:35:05.942 --> 00:35:07.650 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about
the Mayan calendar,

00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:10.020 align:middle line:84%
and in all these great
shifts, and maybe

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:13.170 align:middle line:84%
the world is going to
change in a blink of an eye.

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:14.280 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't that.

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:16.660 align:middle line:84%
But yet, there's so many
other great, subtle things

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:17.460 align:middle line:90%
that have happened.

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:19.650 align:middle line:84%
But along the way we
started to wake up.

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And as I learn in
sessions, our outside world

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:28.080 align:middle line:84%
is only mirroring
our inside world.

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And we're going through
these great transformations

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:31.040 align:middle line:90%
internally.

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:32.910 align:middle line:90%
And I think this--

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:36.100 align:middle line:90%
a global flipping pandemic.

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:39.930 align:middle line:84%
What else do you need to start
going within and waking up?

00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think that,
on the flip side

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:46.320 align:middle line:84%
of that, that gets those in
control really, really nervous.

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.660 align:middle line:10%
So we've got one
side that's trying

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:53.130 align:middle line:10%
to instill fear, which when
we're in a fear mode, then

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:55.860 align:middle line:10%
we become smaller.

00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:58.230 align:middle line:10%
Were not thinking about
the pictures of things.

00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:59.640 align:middle line:90%
We're in survival mode.

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And what an interesting
time, in ways

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:05.430 align:middle line:84%
that we've been
presented the opportunity

00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:07.590 align:middle line:90%
to take a big trip with fear.

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:11.400 align:middle line:84%
But over on this
other side, it's

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.830 align:middle line:90%
showing us we're done with fear.

00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:16.420 align:middle line:84%
We're at the end
of that experience.

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And when we're done with fear,
then both sides of our brains

00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:22.440 align:middle line:90%
can integrate.

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And the left side lets
go of fear and worry.

00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And it can act more like
this all-knowing part

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:30.340 align:middle line:90%
on the right side.

00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know that time
where we're all locked down,

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:38.430 align:middle line:84%
and you can't go out, and
all that, it felt on one side

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:40.200 align:middle line:90%
like, oh, what a restriction.

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Or some people were going,
you have to do this.

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:44.220 align:middle line:90%
I feel safer.

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:46.210 align:middle line:84%
If you stay locked
in, I feel safer.

00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:48.240 align:middle line:90%
So do that.

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:52.800 align:middle line:84%
But then what I was noticing,
and hearing about from people,

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:53.940 align:middle line:90%
was that, oh, my gosh.

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:56.037 align:middle line:90%
I've got time to do deep down.

00:36:56.037 --> 00:36:57.120 align:middle line:90%
And why is this happening?

00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And it was such a great
tool for opening people up.

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:03.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the
ones that were trying

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.460 align:middle line:90%
to control anticipated that.

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, the more push, the
more awakening people are doing.

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:12.440 align:middle line:90%
And it's happening.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And so you-- can I
take that another way too.

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:15.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:18.670 align:middle line:10%
>> So I see that as that
as maybe, on some level,

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:19.810 align:middle line:10%
we're all working together.

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:20.610 align:middle line:90%
>> I think so.

00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:22.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe the bad
guys aren't so bad.

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there's
a master plan here.

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:26.910 align:middle line:84%
>> They're the ones that
signed up for that part

00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:27.930 align:middle line:90%
of the production.

00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:29.310 align:middle line:90%
I'll be the bad dude.

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:31.300 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to dim your light.

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:32.550 align:middle line:90%
And you're like, no you won't.

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:33.717 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to shine brighter.

00:37:33.717 --> 00:37:35.280 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And that even sort of came
through in the designers.

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:41.350 align:middle line:84%
They said that source
has-- knows it all, right?

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:42.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:43.483 align:middle line:90%
>> Source knows what's going on.

00:37:43.483 --> 00:37:47.340 align:middle line:84%
So it sounded like the
designers are doing their thing,

00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:48.450 align:middle line:90%
on their level.

00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:53.940 align:middle line:84%
But there is a certain unknown,
even from their perspective

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:56.880 align:middle line:84%
in that they're just leaving
it to source to figure it out,

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.770 align:middle line:84%
like it's all supposed
to happen the way it's

00:37:58.770 --> 00:37:59.970 align:middle line:90%
supposed to happen, right?

00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:00.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:04.350 align:middle line:84%
>> But ultimately, we know
where it's going, right?

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:06.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually, human
consciousness,

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.400 align:middle line:84%
I think the collective, will
decide the path moving forward,

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:15.360 align:middle line:84%
as all of us, we're
all connected.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:18.120 align:middle line:84%
But there are some
fated things that source

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:21.910 align:middle line:84%
has already planned, that even
the designers don't know--

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:25.590 align:middle line:90%
>> --because that's his timing.

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And time is not
what people think.

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:34.230 align:middle line:90%
So when we say time, it's--

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:36.150 align:middle line:84%
you're really trying
to take something

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:39.870 align:middle line:84%
at such a level of
understanding that we don't even

00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:42.210 align:middle line:90%
have in this existence.

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And so the designers
are allowed to ask.

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And if they get the answers,
they get the answers.

00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:50.940 align:middle line:84%
But if they don't, then
it isn't "time" for them

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:52.890 align:middle line:90%
to have the answer yet.

00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of
what I've learned

00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:57.570 align:middle line:84%
in the journey
with the designer.

00:38:57.570 --> 00:39:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And the designer really
works on two things,

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:02.730 align:middle line:90%
from what I understood.

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:05.880 align:middle line:10%
And when I'm in the
nothingness, they're

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:11.610 align:middle line:10%
working on the integration
of this same reality,

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:14.700 align:middle line:10%
but it's a different
vibrational level.

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:17.070 align:middle line:90%
It looks just like this world.

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:19.920 align:middle line:90%
They showed it to me.

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And there's little
kinks and things

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:25.840 align:middle line:84%
that they're working out,
and trying to perfect it.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:29.820 align:middle line:84%
But we get to see that in this
reality, them working it out

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:33.780 align:middle line:84%
because they also showed me our
planet, and what it looks like,

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:36.210 align:middle line:84%
and its vibrational
quality, and then

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:37.920 align:middle line:84%
when the one that
they are working on

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:40.320 align:middle line:84%
looks the exact
same as this one.

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And what they're
doing is, they're

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:46.320 align:middle line:90%
literally bringing it close.

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's huge
energy, even being

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:50.520 align:middle line:90%
brought into our existence.

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:53.130 align:middle line:90%
And then they're looking.

00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:54.390 align:middle line:90%
And they're checking things.

00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:56.193 align:middle line:90%
And then they pull it back.

00:39:56.193 --> 00:39:57.360 align:middle line:90%
>> They call it the overlay?

00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:58.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:02.667 align:middle line:84%
Until the complete overlay,
from what I'm guessing--

00:40:02.667 --> 00:40:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's because
it'd probably be too--

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.660 align:middle line:84%
and we can get into this
with them directly later--

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:10.000 align:middle line:84%
but my guess is it's just
too much energy, too fast.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.290 align:middle line:84%
So there has to be an
integration process.

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:19.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and also how that
works out with source,

00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:22.960 align:middle line:84%
and his timing, and
how that all works,

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:25.580 align:middle line:84%
and what it looks like
in this reality to us,

00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:29.810 align:middle line:84%
existing here still,
and how that changes us.

00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:34.100 align:middle line:84%
People have witnessed the
glitches when they're testing.

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:36.860 align:middle line:10%
It's as simple as
walking into a room,

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:38.360 align:middle line:10%
and you put something down.

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:42.320 align:middle line:10%
And you think, OK, I
just put that down.

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:43.710 align:middle line:10%
You walk out of the room.

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:44.510 align:middle line:10%
You walk back.

00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:45.950 align:middle line:10%
It's gone.

00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:49.753 align:middle line:10%
And you're like, no, I
swear I just saw that.

00:40:49.753 --> 00:40:51.170 align:middle line:10%
>> She started
giggling, actually,

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:54.438 align:middle line:10%
talking about the glitches in
the last one, about you guys,

00:40:54.438 --> 00:40:55.730 align:middle line:10%
you don't know what's going on.

00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:57.495 align:middle line:10%
But we're overlaying.

00:40:57.495 --> 00:40:58.295 align:middle line:10%
>> Exactly.

00:40:58.295 --> 00:41:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, lots and lots of
glitches because this is

00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:06.200 align:middle line:84%
massive amount of energy
meeting this other energy.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.720 align:middle line:90%
And they aren't in a likeness.

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:11.820 align:middle line:84%
This one's vibrating completely
different than this one.

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:13.790 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're
bringing these two

00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:17.330 align:middle line:84%
masses of different vibrations
even close to each other,

00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:19.290 align:middle line:84%
there's going to
be some reactions.

00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And so we get to experience
some of those reactions.

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:23.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's--

00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:28.800 align:middle line:84%
I always use the analogy of
a warm or cold front creating

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:29.600 align:middle line:90%
rain.

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:31.940 align:middle line:84%
So you have these two
different energies

00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:36.380 align:middle line:84%
colliding to make the third
outcome, and rain, or moisture,

00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:38.150 align:middle line:84%
or something, or
lightning sometimes.

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:40.130 align:middle line:84%
If they come together
too fast, then that's

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:42.000 align:middle line:90%
when you get big storms.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.220 align:middle line:84%
So that's-- it seems
like that's what--

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:47.440 align:middle line:84%
we're going through a little
storm period right now.

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:48.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Definitely are.

00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:52.120 align:middle line:84%
Just look at the
reality outside of us.

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:53.470 align:middle line:90%
>> But usually after the storm--

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:54.610 align:middle line:90%
>> It's beautiful.

00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:56.690 align:middle line:84%
>> --it's the
clearest skies ever.

00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:59.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's been-- part of
the fun part in doing these

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:03.040 align:middle line:84%
separate sessions, three
sessions now, four coming up,

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:06.160 align:middle line:84%
is that we I can go in
and ask for updates.

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:07.880 align:middle line:84%
You said this was
going on last time.

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:08.680 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And that was-- in
the third session,

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:16.040 align:middle line:84%
that was so interesting because
she sees things not as bodies.

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:18.880 align:middle line:90%
And she sees us in test tubes.

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:20.440 align:middle line:90%
We're molecules in a test tube.

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:26.500 align:middle line:10%
So oftentimes, she'll say words
where there's no words for this

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:30.280 align:middle line:10%
because she's translating from
such different dimensions.

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:37.120 align:middle line:10%
But she would say
that they were trying

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:41.590 align:middle line:10%
to clear up this fear molecule
that the dark had put in.

00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:44.170 align:middle line:10%
That could be called COVID.

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:49.090 align:middle line:10%
And that-- so she and the
engineers, her cohorts,

00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:51.760 align:middle line:10%
were working together
to come up with the plan

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.620 align:middle line:10%
to remove that fear molecule.

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And then they had stopped
work on ascension,

00:42:56.410 --> 00:42:58.810 align:middle line:84%
to deal with this,
because all of society

00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:01.780 align:middle line:84%
was feeling this ripple
of fear come through.

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And just when she thought
she had that fixed,

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:07.540 align:middle line:84%
they introduced a
new sticky molecule.

00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:08.382 align:middle line:90%
And she's like, OK.

00:43:08.382 --> 00:43:10.090 align:middle line:84%
We're going to-- and
I'm like, so did you

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:11.410 align:middle line:84%
have to stop the
ascension work yet?

00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:12.310 align:middle line:90%
And she's like, no.

00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:14.310 align:middle line:84%
She was, and actually,
that's going really good.

00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:15.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, oh, good news.

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:17.110 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:19.010 align:middle line:90%
So it's fun to see--

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>> The progression.

00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>> --the progression of it.

00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well, today we're going
to do a little more the next--

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:25.990 align:middle line:90%
sort of check in.

00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:29.110 align:middle line:84%
But maybe a little review
for our audience who--

00:43:29.110 --> 00:43:32.020 align:middle line:84%
so they may be seeing
this one first.

00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And then I recommend everybody
go back and see the others.

00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:38.290 align:middle line:84%
But so we'll do an
upgrade, or update,

00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:39.970 align:middle line:90%
probably an upgrade as well.

00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:44.660 align:middle line:84%
We'll do an update, but also
just a little review as well.

00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:45.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:49.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you have any personal
questions that you wanted us

00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:54.610 align:middle line:84%
to throw in there, as we
go in for another session?

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, heavens.

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:58.150 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:58.150 --> 00:44:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Or you're just like,
whatever it comes out.

00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:02.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Kind of whatever comes out.

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:06.190 align:middle line:84%
But I do have a couple
that I do wonder about.

00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:10.852 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not completely thinking
about it at the current moment.

00:44:10.852 --> 00:44:12.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let's take
a little break.

00:44:12.310 --> 00:44:13.700 align:middle line:90%
Think about them for a minute.

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:15.010 align:middle line:90%
We'll pass them to Suzanne.

00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:17.050 align:middle line:90%
And we have our list.

00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:19.270 align:middle line:90%
We'll all cross check notes.

00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:20.312 align:middle line:90%
It seems like this is a--

00:44:20.312 --> 00:44:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>> This is going
to be so much fun.

00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:22.950 align:middle line:90%
>> --another piece of the--

00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:25.960 align:middle line:84%
you guys, together,
I think, really

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:30.790 align:middle line:84%
is truly-- you obviously
have this ability

00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:34.580 align:middle line:90%
to check in with these beings.

00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:39.100 align:middle line:10%
But it's equally as important
to have Suzanne and her energy

00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:39.950 align:middle line:10%
here to unlock this.

00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:40.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>> So and now we're adding
another element to the soup,

00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:46.030 align:middle line:90%
me being here.

00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And for our audience, there's
a crystal skull in the room

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:52.900 align:middle line:84%
too, that another
project, overlapping here.

00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:54.620 align:middle line:10%
And we'll have that
present as well.

00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:57.790 align:middle line:10%
So lots of new elements
to add to the soup.

00:44:57.790 --> 00:45:03.700 align:middle line:10%
And I'm super excited to
go have lunch before we

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:06.010 align:middle line:10%
go into the cosmic soup.

00:45:06.010 --> 00:45:07.480 align:middle line:10%
Ground a little bit.

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:10.310 align:middle line:10%
And then we'll go out
there and see what happens.

00:45:10.310 --> 00:45:11.650 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, sounds good.

00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:12.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Sounds great.

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:13.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:30.420 align:middle line:90%


00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:34.750 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, Beverly, just
take some nice, deep breaths.

00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:35.550 align:middle line:90%
We'll start.

00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:36.370 align:middle line:90%
Take your time.

00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:37.170 align:middle line:90%
There's no rush.

00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:40.590 align:middle line:90%


00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:41.390 align:middle line:90%
Are you willing?

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:42.455 align:middle line:90%
And do you want to go?

00:45:42.455 --> 00:45:45.720 align:middle line:90%


00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:46.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Then with your permission,
and only with your permission--

00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:57.500 align:middle line:84%
we are drifting and floating
back to the designer,

00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:03.230 align:middle line:84%
drifting and floating, where
we have clear and easy access

00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:08.720 align:middle line:84%
to the designer of our
reality simulations.

00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:09.590 align:middle line:90%
Are we there now?

00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:14.910 align:middle line:90%


00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:15.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, well, we'd like to
say welcome to the designer.

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:23.670 align:middle line:90%
And how are you doing today?

00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:32.177 align:middle line:90%


00:46:32.177 --> 00:46:34.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:37.085 align:middle line:84%
>> And what would you like to
begin with sharing with us?

00:46:37.085 --> 00:46:39.595 align:middle line:90%


00:46:39.595 --> 00:46:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>> (ROBOTICALLY) How much
work humans have been doing.

00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:52.470 align:middle line:90%
It looks good.

00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:53.270 align:middle line:90%
>> That's good.

00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:54.840 align:middle line:90%
We're making some progress?

00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:55.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:59.720 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, well we're very curious
to know the progress that

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:01.460 align:middle line:84%
we're making, from
your perspective.

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:06.650 align:middle line:84%
As you know, we are having
friends join us here today.

00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:09.410 align:middle line:84%
They'll be more than
myself asking questions.

00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:12.000 align:middle line:90%
Is that OK with you?

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:12.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:14.720 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, very good.

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:19.700 align:middle line:90%
Well, we can maybe begin by--

00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:26.585 align:middle line:84%
could you please share with us
who you are as the designer?

00:47:26.585 --> 00:47:30.080 align:middle line:90%
>> I work with creator.

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:36.330 align:middle line:90%
I create a vibrational mol--

00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:37.290 align:middle line:90%
molecules.

00:47:37.290 --> 00:47:40.670 align:middle line:90%


00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:50.760 align:middle line:84%
I hand it off to engineers
to be implemented.

00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:56.070 align:middle line:90%


00:47:56.070 --> 00:47:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>> And the things that you
have created in your role

00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:02.745 align:middle line:84%
as a designer, can you share
with us more about those?

00:48:02.745 --> 00:48:07.335 align:middle line:90%


00:48:07.335 --> 00:48:18.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Working with creator,
different dimensional beings.

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:23.760 align:middle line:84%
My existence is outside
of the dimension.

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:27.160 align:middle line:90%


00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:31.690 align:middle line:84%
I implement in two
other dimensions,

00:48:31.690 --> 00:48:35.780 align:middle line:90%
different dimensional beings.

00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:37.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And the role
of the engineers,

00:48:37.530 --> 00:48:39.185 align:middle line:90%
can you explain that for us?

00:48:39.185 --> 00:48:43.050 align:middle line:90%


00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>> They make up the perfect
energy form to handle

00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:58.150 align:middle line:90%
the vibration, no molecules.

00:48:58.150 --> 00:49:00.830 align:middle line:84%
>> And what happens
when they do their work?

00:49:00.830 --> 00:49:04.000 align:middle line:84%
How does that-- what
happens after they're

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.500 align:middle line:90%
done with their work?

00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:07.390 align:middle line:90%
>> They watch.

00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And what are
they watching for?

00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Vibrations.

00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:14.850 align:middle line:90%
They extract.

00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:16.280 align:middle line:90%
>> And what are they extracting?

00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:19.610 align:middle line:90%


00:49:19.610 --> 00:49:24.420 align:middle line:90%
>> The necessary molecules.

00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:27.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And when they extract
the necessary molecules,

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:28.760 align:middle line:90%
then what happens?

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:33.990 align:middle line:90%
>> It shifts your realities.

00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:37.515 align:middle line:84%
>> And how might we
experience a shift like that?

00:49:37.515 --> 00:49:40.500 align:middle line:90%


00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:43.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Through idea-- ideas.

00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:46.170 align:middle line:90%


00:49:46.170 --> 00:49:47.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Through ideas.

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:48.970 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:49:48.970 --> 00:49:51.330 align:middle line:84%
So we think that we've
had a new idea, that this

00:49:51.330 --> 00:49:57.290 align:middle line:84%
has been a shift from
the result of what

00:49:57.290 --> 00:50:00.770 align:middle line:84%
the engineers implemented
and what you created?

00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:01.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:02.990 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:10.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's been a few months
since we spoke last.

00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:14.920 align:middle line:84%
When we spoke last, you
were talking about--

00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:24.910 align:middle line:84%
you had began a new existence
for the organic souls,

00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:27.550 align:middle line:84%
that we were working,
getting away from technology

00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:30.320 align:middle line:84%
or taking a break
from technology.

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:33.460 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us
more about that now?

00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:42.850 align:middle line:84%
>> It is necessary for light
beings in three dimension

00:50:42.850 --> 00:50:55.600 align:middle line:84%
to integrate vibrational
form without technology.

00:50:55.600 --> 00:51:01.750 align:middle line:84%
The technology they
need is within them.

00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:08.020 align:middle line:84%
It will be a crutch
if they do not.

00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:11.920 align:middle line:84%
>> So tell us about the
technology that's within them?

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:29.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Telepathy, time travel,
creation, teleportation,

00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:35.685 align:middle line:84%
healing, vibrational
likeness raising.

00:51:35.685 --> 00:51:40.380 align:middle line:90%


00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:44.070 align:middle line:84%
>> And by relying on
our technical devices,

00:51:44.070 --> 00:51:47.460 align:middle line:90%
how does that impede that?

00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:53.190 align:middle line:84%
>> They will not implement
these if they did not use

00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:55.380 align:middle line:90%
their voice.

00:51:55.380 --> 00:52:02.090 align:middle line:84%
They would have to find
another way to communicate.

00:52:02.090 --> 00:52:05.350 align:middle line:84%
>> So in your perspective,
do you think technology,

00:52:05.350 --> 00:52:08.620 align:middle line:84%
on our planet, at this time,
has been beneficial or not

00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:10.980 align:middle line:90%
beneficial?

00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:12.127 align:middle line:90%
>> Both.

00:52:12.127 --> 00:52:14.870 align:middle line:90%


00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:16.550 align:middle line:84%
>> But by taking
a break from it,

00:52:16.550 --> 00:52:22.230 align:middle line:84%
it helps people to go inward
and develop the gifts that they

00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:23.030 align:middle line:90%
naturally have?

00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:24.200 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're saying?

00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And once they understand that,
how can they best acclimate

00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:35.940 align:middle line:84%
to the frequency
so they can access

00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:39.290 align:middle line:90%
those gifts and their best way?

00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Each soul is here with a
set of vibrational likeness

00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:53.140 align:middle line:90%
at creation point.

00:52:53.140 --> 00:53:02.800 align:middle line:84%
Those abilities surface when
the mind, the body, the spirit,

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:05.120 align:middle line:90%
is quieted.

00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:05.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good.

00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:08.440 align:middle line:90%
OK, thank you for that.

00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:10.240 align:middle line:90%
Any other updates?

00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:14.350 align:middle line:84%
You had said that you had a
new creation, the last time we

00:53:14.350 --> 00:53:20.140 align:middle line:84%
spoke, that the dark had put
a very sticky molecule over,

00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:23.400 align:middle line:90%
which was increasing fear?

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:24.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:26.180 align:middle line:90%
>> How is it going now?

00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>> We are trying to
separate the molecules.

00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:38.745 align:middle line:84%
There has been some
success, but downfall.

00:53:38.745 --> 00:53:41.370 align:middle line:90%


00:53:41.370 --> 00:53:42.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Downfall?

00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>> The molecules that
had attachments have been

00:53:50.530 --> 00:53:57.350 align:middle line:84%
infiltrated with the
sticky-molecule energy,

00:53:57.350 --> 00:54:05.900 align:middle line:84%
without the ability to
transform the molecule energy.

00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:10.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And so what are you working
on now because of that?

00:54:10.410 --> 00:54:14.970 align:middle line:90%


00:54:14.970 --> 00:54:17.100 align:middle line:90%
>> A new way.

00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:24.150 align:middle line:84%
We need the humans to start
uncovering their truth.

00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:26.780 align:middle line:90%


00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:28.415 align:middle line:84%
>> And talk to us
more about that?

00:54:28.415 --> 00:54:31.330 align:middle line:90%


00:54:31.330 --> 00:54:40.880 align:middle line:84%
>> With what they have now,
it is not able to transform

00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:46.160 align:middle line:84%
the molecule back
to what they want.

00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:48.990 align:middle line:90%
>> They, meaning whom?

00:54:48.990 --> 00:54:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>> The soul.

00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:51.780 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:52.740 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:54.948 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any questions
do you like to add to that?

00:54:54.948 --> 00:54:58.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I'd like to ask about--

00:54:58.710 --> 00:55:00.964 align:middle line:90%
first of all, hello, designers.

00:55:00.964 --> 00:55:03.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:08.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Would you call this
work that you're doing,

00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:09.210 align:middle line:90%
behind the scenes--

00:55:09.210 --> 00:55:13.650 align:middle line:84%
sometimes we have a term,
divine intervention.

00:55:13.650 --> 00:55:17.910 align:middle line:84%
Would that match with
the work you're doing?

00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>> In a way.

00:55:21.210 --> 00:55:24.330 align:middle line:90%
>> And does that help--

00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:30.420 align:middle line:84%
I assume it's-- when
the humans are--

00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:38.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Creator made
other-dimensional beings

00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:46.350 align:middle line:84%
in higher dimensions
that intervene.

00:55:46.350 --> 00:55:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Those beings were created in
this space first, then put

00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:56.710 align:middle line:90%
into the other dimensions.

00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So do you work
with those beings,

00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:00.420 align:middle line:84%
those other beings
of higher dimensions?

00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:02.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:05.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Are those beings what we
term "the mantis beings?"

00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:08.410 align:middle line:90%


00:56:08.410 --> 00:56:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:56:10.330 --> 00:56:12.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Are you a mantis being?

00:56:12.610 --> 00:56:15.710 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:22.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Would-- if we were to find,
within our terms of different

00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:28.130 align:middle line:84%
alien races, and
angels, and Indigenous--

00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:31.660 align:middle line:90%
>> We created all them.

00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:35.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Hmm, OK, so somewhere in
between them and the mantis

00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:41.310 align:middle line:84%
beings is where the
designers reside?

00:56:41.310 --> 00:56:43.335 align:middle line:90%
>> Like a side step.

00:56:43.335 --> 00:56:46.780 align:middle line:90%


00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And we implement the
new molecular structures

00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:54.850 align:middle line:90%
and the different dimensions.

00:56:54.850 --> 00:56:57.480 align:middle line:90%


00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>> So you work-- do you
work through all dimensions?

00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:03.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:08.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And your focus on Earth right
now and the third dimension,

00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:13.000 align:middle line:84%
why was that a point
of interest for you?

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.680 align:middle line:90%


00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:22.085 align:middle line:84%
>> Like a foundation of a
house, it is not strong.

00:57:22.085 --> 00:57:26.280 align:middle line:90%


00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:29.880 align:middle line:84%
>> The Earth is not
strong in its foundation?

00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Not vibrational qualities
compared in with the other

00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:38.910 align:middle line:90%
dimensions.

00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:44.560 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, and so when--

00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:46.970 align:middle line:90%
how did you find that out?

00:57:46.970 --> 00:57:49.540 align:middle line:84%
How did you get
alerted so that you

00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:54.100 align:middle line:84%
would start creating
the new molecules

00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:58.960 align:middle line:84%
that the engineers
are implementing?

00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:00.603 align:middle line:90%
>> Creator.

00:58:00.603 --> 00:58:02.020 align:middle line:10%
>> And what was
that like for you,

00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:04.810 align:middle line:10%
when you got the
word from creator?

00:58:04.810 --> 00:58:06.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Exciting.

00:58:06.730 --> 00:58:08.080 align:middle line:90%
Waiting long.

00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:11.820 align:middle line:90%


00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:15.770 align:middle line:84%
That is the perception
of this soul.

00:58:15.770 --> 00:58:19.310 align:middle line:90%


00:58:19.310 --> 00:58:20.880 align:middle line:84%
>> That you were
waiting a long time?

00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:21.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:23.480 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:25.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's kind of like
"Mission Impossible,"

00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:28.910 align:middle line:84%
where you get your
secret mission.

00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:30.350 align:middle line:90%
And it's going to self destruct.

00:58:30.350 --> 00:58:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to go in
and do it under the radar.

00:58:34.550 --> 00:58:35.660 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that--

00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:38.310 align:middle line:90%
>> In your words, yes.

00:58:38.310 --> 00:58:39.740 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a little above us.

00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:41.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, right.

00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:42.470 align:middle line:90%
For our audience.

00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:48.180 align:middle line:84%
So if I recall, you're saying
that you don't perceive us

00:58:48.180 --> 00:58:48.980 align:middle line:90%
in bodies.

00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:52.665 align:middle line:84%
You perceive us as molecular
structures in test tubes.

00:58:52.665 --> 00:58:53.465 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:58:53.465 --> 00:58:56.050 align:middle line:90%


00:58:56.050 --> 00:58:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>> In a way.

00:58:57.730 --> 00:58:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>> In a cylinder,
I think you said?

00:58:59.230 --> 00:59:02.770 align:middle line:90%


00:59:02.770 --> 00:59:12.210 align:middle line:84%
>> There are souls in
the base of cylinder.

00:59:12.210 --> 00:59:15.140 align:middle line:90%


00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:23.230 align:middle line:84%
>> We create the soul,
implement the energy.

00:59:23.230 --> 00:59:26.920 align:middle line:90%


00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:28.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Of the soul?

00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:29.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so you implement the
energy of the soul as you

00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:33.790 align:middle line:90%
create that?

00:59:33.790 --> 00:59:37.750 align:middle line:90%


00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>> I help design the molecules
that make up the souls--

00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:49.030 align:middle line:90%


00:59:49.030 --> 00:59:49.830 align:middle line:90%
>> OK

00:59:49.830 --> 00:59:53.202 align:middle line:84%
>> --at the
different dimensions.

00:59:53.202 --> 00:59:57.670 align:middle line:90%


00:59:57.670 --> 01:00:01.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's almost like you're
really focused on a finite part

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:06.810 align:middle line:84%
of a soul, but in
a really big way.

01:00:06.810 --> 01:00:09.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Each one is perfect.

01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:13.170 align:middle line:90%


01:00:13.170 --> 01:00:14.150 align:middle line:90%
It takes time.

01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:18.050 align:middle line:90%


01:00:18.050 --> 01:00:24.290 align:middle line:10%
>> And then do you or the
engineers monitor how those

01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:31.360 align:middle line:10%
molecular structures advance
through their experience?

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:32.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:33.445 align:middle line:90%
>> And what is that like?

01:00:33.445 --> 01:00:36.320 align:middle line:90%


01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:37.511 align:middle line:90%
>> Exciting.

01:00:37.511 --> 01:00:43.470 align:middle line:90%


01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:47.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you give an example of
what it's like to follow a soul

01:00:47.450 --> 01:00:49.840 align:middle line:90%
in that way?

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I have been with this
one since its beginning.

01:00:59.250 --> 01:01:06.990 align:middle line:84%
I helped with its
molecular-design structuring.

01:01:06.990 --> 01:01:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And so what has it
been like through--

01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:13.050 align:middle line:84%
I know it's a linear question,
and you're not linear.

01:01:13.050 --> 01:01:15.600 align:middle line:84%
But what has it been like,
through her lifetimes,

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:21.360 align:middle line:84%
to observe the changes that
have happened through her?

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:23.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Frustrating.

01:01:23.250 --> 01:01:24.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

01:01:24.090 --> 01:01:24.890 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:27.920 align:middle line:90%


01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:35.510 align:middle line:84%
>> We implemented a molecule
from another-dimensional being

01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:37.730 align:middle line:90%
in this soul.

01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And the 3D is not
prepared for this.

01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:46.610 align:middle line:84%
But we needed to
start that process.

01:01:46.610 --> 01:01:53.480 align:middle line:84%
There are other souls with
different dimensional beings

01:01:53.480 --> 01:02:00.400 align:middle line:84%
that we implemented
molecules in for this timing.

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And what was the
dimensional experience like,

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:08.260 align:middle line:84%
where that originated
from for her?

01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:09.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Liked her.

01:02:09.370 --> 01:02:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And so she's here as maybe
one of few who are bringing

01:02:16.330 --> 01:02:19.470 align:middle line:84%
in the other-dimensional
energies?

01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:20.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:24.830 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, and what would you
recommend that she could do

01:02:24.830 --> 01:02:29.030 align:middle line:84%
to help with the work that
you're helping her do?

01:02:29.030 --> 01:02:31.570 align:middle line:90%
>> To continue her journey.

01:02:31.570 --> 01:02:35.290 align:middle line:90%


01:02:35.290 --> 01:02:37.650 align:middle line:90%
She has choice.

01:02:37.650 --> 01:02:41.550 align:middle line:84%
>> How have you witnessed the
changes that she's made since

01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:44.370 align:middle line:84%
she's started connection with
you through these sessions?

01:02:44.370 --> 01:02:48.840 align:middle line:90%
>> She is allowing more.

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:51.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And what do you
think about that?

01:02:51.870 --> 01:02:52.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

01:02:52.670 --> 01:02:57.180 align:middle line:90%
>> (WHISPERING) OK, yes.

01:02:57.180 --> 01:03:00.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Would you say,
from your perspective,

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:05.700 align:middle line:84%
that Beverly is a Trojan
Horse for this dimension,

01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:07.320 align:middle line:90%
in a good way?

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:08.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:03:08.250 --> 01:03:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there many Trojan horses
instilled in this reality?

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:14.060 align:middle line:90%
>> 26.

01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:16.940 align:middle line:90%


01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Has she met any
of the other 25?

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:22.320 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>> I assume they're spread
out across the globe?

01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:27.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:03:27.030 --> 01:03:29.070 align:middle line:84%
>> And are there
other Trojan Horses,

01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:30.930 align:middle line:84%
from other
dimensional realities,

01:03:30.930 --> 01:03:34.170 align:middle line:84%
also assisting in a
similar way as Beverly?

01:03:34.170 --> 01:03:36.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Two from each.

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:39.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Two from each reality?

01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:40.860 align:middle line:90%
Or how--

01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:42.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Dimensional being.

01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>> So-- and those two from
each, then that totals 26?

01:03:46.050 --> 01:03:46.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:48.070 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

01:03:48.070 --> 01:03:48.870 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:50.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Why two of each?

01:03:50.250 --> 01:03:53.460 align:middle line:90%


01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:56.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Masculine, feminine.

01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:01.420 align:middle line:90%
It keeps the balance in 3D.

01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:02.530 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:04:02.530 --> 01:04:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And so if you take
all of their-- the 26

01:04:05.590 --> 01:04:10.320 align:middle line:84%
work combined, that they're
here to do, overall,

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:13.160 align:middle line:90%
how are they doing?

01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:18.395 align:middle line:84%
>> Some good, some
not great yet.

01:04:18.395 --> 01:04:21.950 align:middle line:90%


01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:26.390 align:middle line:90%
There are warriors unawoke yet.

01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:30.680 align:middle line:90%
They do not know who they are.

01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:35.280 align:middle line:84%
>> And the ones that
do know what they are,

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:37.790 align:middle line:84%
what are they doing on
the planet to assist?

01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:39.155 align:middle line:90%
>> Lighting lights.

01:04:39.155 --> 01:04:42.710 align:middle line:90%


01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:47.720 align:middle line:84%
There is a
soul-vibrational light.

01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And overall, how are the
experiences or levels of fear

01:04:54.410 --> 01:04:57.800 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, in relation to
where we started with these

01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:59.830 align:middle line:90%
conversations?

01:04:59.830 --> 01:05:01.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Big.

01:05:01.730 --> 01:05:03.200 align:middle line:90%
Getting bigger.

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:07.170 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, and what do
you think about that?

01:05:07.170 --> 01:05:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>> It is part of the
process and the experiment.

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:15.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And explain
that more, please.

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>> The beings that have
implemented these extra DNA

01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:31.220 align:middle line:84%
molecules of light vibration
from other dimensional beings,

01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:36.080 align:middle line:84%
we have been watching them
since their creation point,

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:43.030 align:middle line:84%
through different lifetimes, to
see how their humans would be

01:05:43.030 --> 01:05:46.900 align:middle line:90%
accepting of these new energies.

01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:50.660 align:middle line:90%
It is an experiment.

01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:51.670 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:55.160 align:middle line:90%


01:05:55.160 --> 01:06:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I had a question about
the incarnation process from

01:06:00.530 --> 01:06:02.390 align:middle line:90%
your dimension.

01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:08.600 align:middle line:84%
How would someone like Beverly
be able to incarnate here,

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:10.070 align:middle line:90%
into this reality?

01:06:10.070 --> 01:06:12.230 align:middle line:90%
What's the process?

01:06:12.230 --> 01:06:14.480 align:middle line:90%
>> She gets to choose.

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:16.460 align:middle line:90%
She signed to help.

01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:19.430 align:middle line:90%


01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:26.390 align:middle line:84%
We knew that all 26 would,
because of those vibrations

01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:30.680 align:middle line:84%
that it exists in
their creation point,

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:33.200 align:middle line:90%
that they would want to help.

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:37.210 align:middle line:90%


01:06:37.210 --> 01:06:39.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

01:06:39.050 --> 01:06:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Is there a preparation that has
to take place for this mission?

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:48.458 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:06:48.458 --> 01:06:49.375 align:middle line:90%
>> How does that work?

01:06:49.375 --> 01:06:51.890 align:middle line:90%


01:06:51.890 --> 01:06:53.495 align:middle line:90%
>> Trying to find words.

01:06:53.495 --> 01:06:57.750 align:middle line:90%


01:06:57.750 --> 01:07:08.930 align:middle line:84%
The souls are in another
form, in another dimension,

01:07:08.930 --> 01:07:17.150 align:middle line:84%
before being implemented into
the third-dimensional cylinders

01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:21.620 align:middle line:84%
that are connected
to the collective.

01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:28.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So are the third-dimensional
cylinders also with, maybe,

01:07:28.790 --> 01:07:31.430 align:middle line:90%
six-dimensional cylinders?

01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Or are they grouped
away from one another?

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:42.550 align:middle line:84%
>> It is all connected
and separate at the same.

01:07:42.550 --> 01:07:45.220 align:middle line:90%


01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And when we're at a stage in
our humanity where we're ready

01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:54.840 align:middle line:84%
to go into a higher dimension,
what is that like for you,

01:07:54.840 --> 01:08:00.280 align:middle line:84%
from your perspective of
seeing them in the tubes?

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:06.850 align:middle line:84%
>> I see the molecules'
vibrations change.

01:08:06.850 --> 01:08:11.380 align:middle line:84%
It is the soul's
choice to see or not,

01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:18.160 align:middle line:84%
or have anything to do with
higher-dimensional forms

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:18.979 align:middle line:90%
or energies.

01:08:18.979 --> 01:08:22.439 align:middle line:90%


01:08:22.439 --> 01:08:28.319 align:middle line:84%
>> And so when there's a whole
planet full of souls that are

01:08:28.319 --> 01:08:33.090 align:middle line:84%
in the midst of an ascension,
and there's some of those souls

01:08:33.090 --> 01:08:38.630 align:middle line:84%
that are trying to hold
back and not allow for that,

01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:40.140 align:middle line:90%
what do you know about that?

01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:44.040 align:middle line:84%
What is it like from
your perspective?

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:50.729 align:middle line:84%
>> The soul's not wanting to
shift art here because it keeps

01:08:50.729 --> 01:08:52.620 align:middle line:90%
the balance.

01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:57.680 align:middle line:84%
There is balance
in all dimensions.

01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:03.350 align:middle line:84%
In 7th with angelic,
there are demons.

01:09:03.350 --> 01:09:08.410 align:middle line:90%
There are angels, the same.

01:09:08.410 --> 01:09:12.940 align:middle line:90%
All dimensions have the balance.
