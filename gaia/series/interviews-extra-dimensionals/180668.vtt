[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.958 --> 00:01:37.530 align:middle line:90%


00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.823 align:middle line:90%
>> So, Roxanne, here we are.

00:01:40.823 --> 00:01:41.740 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for doing this.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.450 align:middle line:90%
>> You're welcome.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.100 align:middle line:10%
>> I'd love to just get to know
you a little bit and talk about

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.630 align:middle line:10%
your work or your play.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Definitely play.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.230 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.610 align:middle line:90%


00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, first of all,
tell us, we're here in--

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.050 align:middle line:90%
>> San Antonio.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.400 align:middle line:90%
>> --San Antonio, Texas.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.660 align:middle line:90%
>> And this is home for now?

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.260 align:middle line:90%
I love it here.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.925 align:middle line:10%
I don't think I want to leave.

00:02:06.925 --> 00:02:08.300 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I might
leave, of course.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.580 align:middle line:10%
But right now, it's
a really cool place.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.520 align:middle line:10%
It's got a great vibe.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.170 align:middle line:10%
It's a big city.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.570 align:middle line:84%
But it's laid out, and
the highways are awesome.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.805 align:middle line:90%
So I dig it here.

00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:21.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And have you been
here your whole life?

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>> I moved here in 2012.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.820 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:29.620 align:middle line:90%
>> I left--

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.250 align:middle line:90%
I was in Las Vegas for 11 years.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.500 align:middle line:90%
And I was in the car business.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And I transitioned in
2010 and stayed on my job

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.620 align:middle line:84%
for another year
and plus months.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And then time for me to
leave that apparently.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.748 align:middle line:84%
>> And then stayed in Vegas
for a few more months.

00:02:50.748 --> 00:02:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And mom and dad said, why
don't you come out here

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.670 align:middle line:84%
and see if you can
get something going?

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And it was funny, because the
intention was to come out here.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.150 align:middle line:90%
I was veteran, five years.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.140 align:middle line:90%
This is military city USA.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.527 align:middle line:84%
So the job opportunities
looked good.

00:03:09.527 --> 00:03:10.610 align:middle line:90%
I was in the car business.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.693 align:middle line:84%
I tried several places to
get in the car business,

00:03:12.693 --> 00:03:15.440 align:middle line:84%
but it's tough in
such a public view.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was my
perception then.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.700 align:middle line:84%
Tough in the public view to
get a job as a transgender.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.860 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not passable.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm not
going to say that I'm

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.210 align:middle line:84%
anywhere close to being idea
of a passable transgender.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.570 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't matter
because I'm happy.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:33.920 align:middle line:90%
That's for certain.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.090 align:middle line:84%
So I tried to get jobs out
there in the car business.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.650 align:middle line:90%
Came over here, tried here.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Applied with the military
or different Department

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.660 align:middle line:84%
of Defense's, civilian, idea of
military, ideas, and no luck.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.410 align:middle line:10%
And then just
synchronicity sunk in.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.560 align:middle line:10%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.040 align:middle line:90%
>> My unemployment ran out.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.880 align:middle line:84%
My mom and dad said, well,
you know, we love you,

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.510 align:middle line:90%
but you got to go.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.660 align:middle line:90%
Because I was living here.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And I was infringing
upon their retirement,

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.930 align:middle line:90%
which I understand.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:08.345 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:04:08.345 --> 00:04:09.175 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:09.175 --> 00:04:11.342 align:middle line:84%
>> Because now I'm going
to start costing them money

00:04:11.342 --> 00:04:13.610 align:middle line:90%
because I have no other income.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And, Reuben, that
was the first day.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.399 align:middle line:84%
That was the first
time I felt something.

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:25.400 align:middle line:84%
When they said that, my ordinary
Roxy/Roy self would have

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.545 align:middle line:90%
reacted, but I didn't.

00:04:27.545 --> 00:04:30.800 align:middle line:90%
I had a sense of peace.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.050 align:middle line:84%
It was like the first time
I tried on ladies underwear

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.120 align:middle line:90%
in the mirror, I knew.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.460 align:middle line:90%
I was done.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:42.090 align:middle line:10%
It was like, oh, that kind of
thing, the same sense of peace.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.810 align:middle line:10%
It was so beautiful.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.830 align:middle line:10%
And I said, OK.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.030 align:middle line:10%
And it was three
weeks later, and I'll

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.180 align:middle line:10%
tell you the result
of three weeks

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.280 align:middle line:10%
in that peaceful thing
was I got an apartment

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.740 align:middle line:10%
through the housing program.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.680 align:middle line:90%
I got food stamps.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And I got a job in all
of three weeks time.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.300 align:middle line:90%
Everything just clicked.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.540 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, holy cow.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.410 align:middle line:90%
It's perfect.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.210 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, wow.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.545 align:middle line:90%
It was no effort literally.

00:05:15.545 --> 00:05:17.670 align:middle line:84%
It was one person telling
me this, telling me this,

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.050 align:middle line:90%
and going, going, going.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.840 align:middle line:84%
But when I was taking the
action, it wasn't a struggle.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.540 align:middle line:84%
It was just do it,
and it was perfect.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.000 align:middle line:90%
And there it was.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And during that time I moved
out and moved in the apartment

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.800 align:middle line:84%
and started my job, it was
a training for two months,

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.560 align:middle line:84%
I had joined an idea of a
guided meditation group.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was
with Wink Carlock,

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.230 align:middle line:84%
wonderful awake lady
that helped quite a bit,

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.880 align:middle line:84%
introduced me to the lady
behind the camera my videos.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:51.970 align:middle line:90%
You all know her as Rita.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:52.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:59.290 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was
my awakening time.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:03.973 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as she said,
I remember this distinctly

00:06:03.973 --> 00:06:05.640 align:middle line:84%
when we were having
a guided meditation,

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.848 align:middle line:84%
afterwards, we were sitting
around talking, she says,

00:06:07.848 --> 00:06:09.960 align:middle line:90%
you create your own reality.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And that was a
that trying to fit

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.960 align:middle line:90%
a round peg in a square hole.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.640 align:middle line:90%
I was like, what?

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.170 align:middle line:90%
But there was so much intrigue.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:23.760 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't immediately
pushed off.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.595 align:middle line:84%
It was like, can you
talk more about that?

00:06:28.595 --> 00:06:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And through the times, she
introduced me to Channeling

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:44.050 align:middle line:84%
Bashar, Abraham, Kryon, just
different ones start coming up.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.210 align:middle line:90%
Rob Gauthier with Trebb.

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.990 align:middle line:84%
At the time, he was
more Trebb than Aridif.

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And of course, Brad Johnson,
Nora, Wendy, all the greats.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And then I was
doing this job.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And I was in the
car business before.

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:08.270 align:middle line:84%
So I was making, during the
heyday of the car business,

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.430 align:middle line:90%
$140,000, $150,000 a year.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:11.230 align:middle line:90%
I had the house.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.580 align:middle line:84%
I had all the stuff, the
stuff that defined you.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>> That come to find out
is not very valuable.

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.470 align:middle line:90%
So and I went to $9.25 an hour.

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:28.340 align:middle line:84%
But if I showed up in
time for the entire week,

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.540 align:middle line:90%
I'd get $9.75 an hour.

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.200 align:middle line:90%
I was like, holy cow.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.670 align:middle line:84%
If I show up on
time, I get a raise.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:35.470 align:middle line:90%
>> That's cool.

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:36.650 align:middle line:90%
>> And I did.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:37.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:38.270 align:middle line:90%
>> I like that.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:38.880 align:middle line:90%
I liked that too.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.255 align:middle line:84%
>> I should have used that
with my employees in the past.

00:07:41.255 --> 00:07:43.210 align:middle line:90%
>> I know, right?

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.540 align:middle line:84%
So I stayed there for
the two week training.

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And I was on the
job for two weeks.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And during this awakening
time, I'm feeding on Bashar

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.050 align:middle line:90%
and just understanding that.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:57.990 align:middle line:90%
And I'm meditating.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:59.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Darryl's Bashar or?

00:07:59.050 --> 00:07:59.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:07:59.980 align:middle line:90%
Darryl Anka.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:00.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Or Andrew?

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.010 align:middle line:90%
There's several.

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, not Andrew's.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:02.970 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>> But I did, of course,
know Andrew and a couple

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:06.850 align:middle line:90%
of the other ideas.

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:10.810 align:middle line:90%
But Darryl, right, Anka.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.840 align:middle line:84%
>> And then after the two weeks
of working and while I was

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.130 align:middle line:90%
doing that, I'm watching Bashar.

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:21.190 align:middle line:90%
And I'm meditating.

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:22.060 align:middle line:90%
And I'm toning.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And Wink had introduced me
to the Hathor civilization,

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.410 align:middle line:90%
Tom Kenyon.

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And all of this stuff just
started pouring on me.

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:33.700 align:middle line:84%
>> So then you went from,
in the same three week,

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.230 align:middle line:90%
four week period, meditating--

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:36.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Six week total.

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:36.510 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And meditating, this we was sort
of your first time meditating?

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:38.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:39.419 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:39.820 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.409 align:middle line:84%
>> I was a martial arts,
still in martial arts.

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:43.610 align:middle line:84%
Studied couple different
things around the world

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:45.890 align:middle line:84%
when I was in the military
in different places.

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And I would meditate in that
kind, but not in this idea.

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:53.070 align:middle line:84%
Not the guided and the
more deeper idea sense.

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:55.970 align:middle line:84%
But it was toning
and I was OMing

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:59.020 align:middle line:84%
and different
things would happen.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.810 align:middle line:90%
And then I just knew.

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:03.770 align:middle line:84%
I just knew I'm
going to do this.

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:07.650 align:middle line:90%
I just knew I was awake.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't even know
how to say I'm awake.

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:10.490 align:middle line:90%
Wink, am I awake?

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:11.290 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:12.200 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.000 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.950 align:middle line:84%
I was checking
with everyone else.

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:16.610 align:middle line:90%
Am I sure I'm awake?

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:18.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Wink, the meditation teacher?

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.370 align:middle line:90%
Wink the meditation teacher.

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:26.860 align:middle line:10%
So that's how it
led to transitioning

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.410 align:middle line:10%
was the first step for
me to be OK with myself

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:31.700 align:middle line:10%
in public, which was huge.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:32.500 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:33.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Just you were scared.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.410 align:middle line:90%


00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:43.830 align:middle line:84%
I was just scared to get
out there, but I did.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:44.630 align:middle line:90%
Because I knew.

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:48.350 align:middle line:84%
I had this thing when
I looked down one day,

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:51.440 align:middle line:84%
when I knew I was in that
phase of transitioning.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:57.230 align:middle line:84%
When I knew it was June,
pardon me, July 1, 2010,

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:00.410 align:middle line:84%
I walked out of the door as
a woman and never went back.

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:03.350 align:middle line:10%
And couple of days
before I'm looking down

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:06.320 align:middle line:10%
at my shoes, my men's shoes.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And I called them clown
shoes because they just

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.890 align:middle line:90%
looked so big.

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, I'll never wear
a pair of clown shoes again.

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:14.150 align:middle line:90%
And that's when I knew.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And when I did that,
and my job accepted me.

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:21.590 align:middle line:84%
The owner of the
company accepted.

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:22.590 align:middle line:90%
>> This was the new job?

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:23.390 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:26.600 align:middle line:84%
This was the car company
when I first transitioned.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.680 align:middle line:84%
He accepted me because
my performance.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.730 align:middle line:90%
So that was awesome.

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.950 align:middle line:84%
So I had that
comfort there to be

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:38.000 align:middle line:84%
able to earn income
not be broke in a day,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.690 align:middle line:90%
in a month, that kind of idea.

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:44.900 align:middle line:90%


00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:49.010 align:middle line:84%
so that transition gave
me, it was pinnacle

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:51.530 align:middle line:84%
because it gave me
the bravery, if you

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:57.170 align:middle line:84%
will, to walk out of the house,
be that person I wanted to be.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:00.548 align:middle line:84%
And then when I transitioned
into the idea of channeling

00:11:00.548 --> 00:11:02.090 align:middle line:84%
before I started
channeling, I didn't

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:04.010 align:middle line:84%
know I was going to
channel, and then it came.

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And then when I
started channeling,

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.350 align:middle line:84%
I had no fears
about putting it up.

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:11.930 align:middle line:10%
Because I went through
that idea of acceptance

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:13.990 align:middle line:10%
in the idea of transgender.

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:15.200 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.450 align:middle line:10%
>> So that was--

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:18.480 align:middle line:10%
>> An easier transition?

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.130 align:middle line:84%
It was perfect, to put
my videos up there.

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:23.390 align:middle line:90%
I created a YouTube page.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:24.440 align:middle line:90%
I started the channeling.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.877 align:middle line:90%
And I just put it out there.

00:11:25.877 --> 00:11:26.960 align:middle line:90%
>> And who came out first?

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:27.600 align:middle line:90%
Who came through first?

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.683 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, actually, it was
a Purishin civilization.

00:11:29.683 --> 00:11:31.430 align:middle line:90%
Here's how it played out.

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:33.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm laying in bed
one day meditating.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:37.560 align:middle line:84%
Tom Kenyon has this
meditation called Aethos.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.920 align:middle line:84%
Aethos meditation,
five minutes long,

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.210 align:middle line:90%
and it's just this OMing tone.

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:43.440 align:middle line:90%
So I'm doing that.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm toning along with it.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.680 align:middle line:90%
And I notice something one day.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm listening and I'm
hearing the frequencies.

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm listening,
I'm hearing words.

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, and there's
information, not just, hey,

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:01.840 align:middle line:84%
Roxy, what are you doing,
that kind of thing.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:02.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.380 align:middle line:90%
>> It was information.

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:04.880 align:middle line:90%
And I'd hear different ideas.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:05.900 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't quite tune.

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.700 align:middle line:84%
It was like background
chatter at a party.

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:09.500 align:middle line:90%
I heard it.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.390 align:middle line:84%
I'd have to listen in
and get a few words,

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.670 align:middle line:84%
but it was a
conversation going on.

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:15.450 align:middle line:90%
And that was really cool.

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And then in continuation of
that, I was toning one day.

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And the tone started, it
was very long and majestic

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.020 align:middle line:84%
and loud and thunderous
and beautiful.

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:31.460 align:middle line:84%
It just, my throat would
you shut down and shut down.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:32.870 align:middle line:90%
I'd do it again and stop.

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And then in that
idea, a language.

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:39.380 align:middle line:84%
I started speaking
this language.

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, as soon
as I'd try to tone again,

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.080 align:middle line:90%
it would come out the language.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:53.460 align:middle line:84%
It's like [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
so thank you for doing this.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.610 align:middle line:90%
We welcome you aboard.

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:58.540 align:middle line:84%
So that's this
language Purishia.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Purishia-- and this
is the civilization?

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:01.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:03.540 align:middle line:84%
It's another
extraterrestrial race.

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:04.340 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And I got a little background
on them and how they're part

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:08.970 align:middle line:84%
of humanity's
timeline and stuff.

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:11.690 align:middle line:84%
They're just not known
yet, but they'll be around.

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:13.250 align:middle line:90%
So they were doing this.

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:17.518 align:middle line:84%
And I would speak
and I would hear it.

00:13:17.518 --> 00:13:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And the language,
it would translate.

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:20.528 align:middle line:90%
It was just wonderful.

00:13:20.528 --> 00:13:22.820 align:middle line:84%
Just like I knew the language
just like I know English.

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:23.900 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.880 align:middle line:90%
And it was just really cool.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.800 align:middle line:90%
So I told Wink about it.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And Wink came over to my
apartment and she heard it.

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And I said, just
ask me anything.

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:33.890 align:middle line:90%
They're right there.

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:36.110 align:middle line:90%
I can see them in my mind's eye.

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:37.470 align:middle line:90%
They were there.

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
Wink, ask a question.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.730 align:middle line:84%
Wink would ask a question, and
they would give me the answer.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'd translate it
and give her the answer.

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:48.830 align:middle line:90%
And she was like, holy shit.

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:50.510 align:middle line:90%
This is awesome.

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:53.330 align:middle line:84%
So that day, right then
and there, she called Rita.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And Rita came over
with a camera.

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:56.930 align:middle line:90%
And that was the first idea.

00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, nice.

00:13:57.730 --> 00:13:59.030 align:middle line:90%
>> And then that was that.

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:01.320 align:middle line:84%
So I channeled in
kind of a translation.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.930 align:middle line:84%
>> The group of people
would get in the room.

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:04.760 align:middle line:90%
They'd ask questions.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.093 align:middle line:84%
I'd talk to them, translate
it, speak in their language.

00:14:07.093 --> 00:14:08.930 align:middle line:84%
I would speak in
the idea like that.

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:10.520 align:middle line:84%
Now I know they
understood English.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.410 align:middle line:84%
I know they had that
telepathy thing.

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:14.730 align:middle line:84%
They were all encouched in
this, but it was for me.

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:15.530 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:17.640 align:middle line:84%
So the language
had come out first?

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>> I would hear it.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:19.670 align:middle line:90%
And then I would, you know.

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:21.620 align:middle line:90%
They would ask me a question.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:24.245 align:middle line:84%
And then I would speak it in the
language of Purishian to them.

00:14:24.245 --> 00:14:25.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:27.080 align:middle line:84%
>> They would tell me the
answer back in Purishian,

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.040 align:middle line:90%
and I would translate.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:28.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, interesting.

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>> It was brilliant.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>> So you literally had in
your mind's eye or your mind,

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:37.610 align:middle line:84%
you had this other
language that was.

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And was it this knowing of this
other language automatically?

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:42.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Or did it just--

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.935 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't have to--

00:14:43.935 --> 00:14:44.860 align:middle line:90%
>> It just came out that way?

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:45.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Done.

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:49.120 align:middle line:84%
It was as if I'm speaking
English right now.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:52.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So there was, I guess, a
little time lag in those early

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:55.130 align:middle line:90%
days where words--

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:55.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:58.550 align:middle line:84%
>> --translation,
words, feedback, words.

00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:59.350 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:00.150 align:middle line:90%
>> It was just like that idea.

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:01.030 align:middle line:90%
>> It was a process.

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Like if we had a
translator right now?

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Bingo, same idea.

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'd have to go
through them to speak to you.

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:07.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:08.410 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And I realized the
information was coming.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'm getting validation,
validation out of four or five

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:17.920 align:middle line:84%
people, whoever showed up
for those idea sessions

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.970 align:middle line:90%
that we started having.

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And like three days later, an
entity pops into my mind goes,

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:26.620 align:middle line:90%
hi, I'm Hugh.

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:29.620 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, whoa, hi, Hugh.

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, I'm
going to teach you how

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.655 align:middle line:90%
to be a conscious channeler.

00:15:32.655 --> 00:15:33.970 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to learn?

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:36.220 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh, yeah.

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:41.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was nothing else
I wanted to do except channel.

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.060 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, OK.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:44.950 align:middle line:84%
So he took me
through the process

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:49.000 align:middle line:84%
of the ins out, the idea of the
doubts, how it's going to be.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.418 align:middle line:84%
They put me on a
little bit of a delay.

00:15:51.418 --> 00:15:52.960 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
when I'm speaking,

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.570 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't perceive I'm speaking
until a couple seconds later,

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:58.600 align:middle line:84%
so I can see where
the conversation goes.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:03.280 align:middle line:10%
Because what I noticed among
the teachers, the channelers

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.250 align:middle line:10%
that I'm teaching through
Sylvester in the class,

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:08.980 align:middle line:10%
they get a little bit
held up because they

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:11.560 align:middle line:10%
know where the words are
going, but they're not sure.

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.550 align:middle line:90%
They hear the words.

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:13.870 align:middle line:90%
They channel the words.

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:17.050 align:middle line:84%
But what they do is they think
ahead, where's this going?

00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And they might try
to fix the word.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.020 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:20.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And they don't trust
the information yet,

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:24.890 align:middle line:84%
which I didn't trust
the information,

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:28.030 align:middle line:84%
especially coming from the
idea of non-translation,

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:31.000 align:middle line:84%
which I was first
birthed with in the idea.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And then so they
put me on a delay

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:37.150 align:middle line:84%
so I would see where the
conversation is going, and then

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:39.180 align:middle line:90%
go, oh, OK, now I get it.

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.290 align:middle line:90%
And then I wasn't jumping away.

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:43.100 align:middle line:90%
You know, that kind of idea.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And then there's no delay
after a few times of that.

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And he was the first
idea I channeled.

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And then Ocyphius came in
pretty, like couple of days

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:53.380 align:middle line:90%
after that.

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow, just days after.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And Ocyphius just
told me, hey, I'm this.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.303 align:middle line:90%
And this is what we have.

00:17:00.303 --> 00:17:01.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm part of a
collective over soul

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.310 align:middle line:84%
that you're a part
of called fire.

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:04.690 align:middle line:90%
And my name is Ocyphius.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm an individual
singularity

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:08.750 align:middle line:90%
in this idea and channel.

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going to
be a conscious channel,

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:14.650 align:middle line:84%
so I'll be like a door
keeper, a gatekeeper.

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:17.650 align:middle line:84%
This person's coming,
so here it is.

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:20.619 align:middle line:90%
And he wasn't telling anyone no.

00:17:20.619 --> 00:17:22.900 align:middle line:84%
He was introducing
me to the vibrations

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.960 align:middle line:84%
because different
vibrations are distinct.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.230 align:middle line:84%
Much like I can see you
and I know you're Rueben.

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:28.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>> You can look at
me, you know I'm Roxy.

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:33.040 align:middle line:84%
But it's a signature
vibration of feeling.

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.150 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:35.830 align:middle line:84%
So I'd get that
feeling, and if it

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:42.040 align:middle line:84%
was any of the entities, Mother
Mary, David, Jane, Ocyphius,

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:46.630 align:middle line:90%
Sylvester, George, Chuck.

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>> These are all
different entities?

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:48.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Buford.

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:49.590 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:52.060 align:middle line:84%
There are vibrational
signatures.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:54.560 align:middle line:84%
I've even heard some Elan
channelings from the Essassani.

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:58.250 align:middle line:84%
I had the Paleah and
Elan came through.

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Elan only came through
a couple of times.

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:02.560 align:middle line:10%
And I had a talk with
him, I said, I had fear.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:03.360 align:middle line:10%
I had doubt about.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:06.100 align:middle line:10%
I was like, really,
I mean, Andrew

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.170 align:middle line:10%
did it and that kind of idea.

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And for me, and he goes, I
just want to say something.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.150 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:12.950 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:13.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:14.880 align:middle line:84%
There's others out there
too that are a little--

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that have
been sort of--

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>> And I love it.

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:17.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:18.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And it fascinates me because
I interviewed Ayako Sekino from

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:27.460 align:middle line:90%
Japan--

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:27.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.230 align:middle line:90%
>> --who used to channel Bashar.

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:30.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:33.010 align:middle line:84%
>> But she has a very close
connection to the Essassani.

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And the Bashar, I
guess, they're all sort

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:40.390 align:middle line:90%
of a collective anyways.

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:42.348 align:middle line:84%
Right now, they're moving
into that collective.

00:18:42.348 --> 00:18:45.250 align:middle line:84%
It seems very almost the
same, like Bashar and Elan.

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it is
because, well, here--

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.890 align:middle line:90%
>> And the Essassani, I guess.

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's the
Essassani civilization,

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:55.320 align:middle line:84%
which is a hybrid, 10
generations of hybrid

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.120 align:middle line:90%
of humanity.

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.030 align:middle line:84%
So they're
extraterrestrial, not alien.

00:18:59.030 --> 00:18:59.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:00.630 align:middle line:90%
>> A difference.

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:05.380 align:middle line:84%
So anyways, so that
Essassani is a collective.

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And remember Bashar
means messenger.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Bashar is not
the entity's name.

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:12.280 align:middle line:84%
So anyone can channel,
quote, "Bashar."

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.530 align:middle line:84%
But they're an individual
within the collective whole.

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And they do seem to have
the same idea flavor.

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:19.060 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:22.317 align:middle line:84%
I mean, mine came
through was Paleah.

00:19:22.317 --> 00:19:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Paleah was another
Essassani being?

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:24.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:24.980 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And I channel
her now and again.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:27.260 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.060 align:middle line:90%
>> You know?

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:28.860 align:middle line:90%
Pardon me.

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:30.940 align:middle line:84%
More so at the beginning,
but not so much now.

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:33.010 align:middle line:84%
But she still makes an
appearance now and again.

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:33.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:36.130 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:40.770 align:middle line:84%
I think especially with the
I'm finding the Essassani

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:46.330 align:middle line:84%
channelings very interesting
because I've interviewed Ayako.

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:47.350 align:middle line:90%
I know Darryl.

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:48.442 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:19:48.442 --> 00:19:49.940 align:middle line:90%
How is Darryl?

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:51.778 align:middle line:84%
>> I haven't--
it's been a while.

00:19:51.778 --> 00:19:53.320 align:middle line:84%
He's been working
on his documentary.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.030 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Darryl.

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:56.830 align:middle line:84%
>> So I know that's
coming out soon.

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:57.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:00.970 align:middle line:84%
>> But there was a lot of delays
and work to be done in that.

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:03.590 align:middle line:84%
So he's been very
busy with that stuff.

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And then I haven't
spoken with Andrew.

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:09.190 align:middle line:84%
But I know of Andrew's work
and your work and others

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:11.990 align:middle line:84%
on the internet who
are a little less--

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Known.

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>> --known, right, who are
also doing the idea of Elan

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.200 align:middle line:90%
and other.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:17.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Which is great.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>> And Essassani.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:22.060 align:middle line:84%
I've even had sort of an
idea of the Essassani come

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:24.100 align:middle line:90%
through me at one point.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:25.910 align:middle line:90%
And I just I find that--

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:26.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Fascinating.

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:27.510 align:middle line:90%
>> --fascinating.

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:28.330 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:29.130 align:middle line:90%
>> All of this is.

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.450 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's shifting.

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And there's more
channelers coming online.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you channel
now, you're still present,

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:40.760 align:middle line:90%
so to say?

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.010 align:middle line:90%
You're not doing full trance.

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:43.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, no, no, no.

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>> You're there.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And you're able
to kind of switch

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:46.050 align:middle line:90%
back and forth a little bit.

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:50.890 align:middle line:84%
It's like I'm here and I'm
listening to the conversation.

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:53.260 align:middle line:84%
Although, while the
conversation is going on,

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:56.020 align:middle line:84%
while the channeling is going,
I can talk to whoever else

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:56.860 align:middle line:90%
is there.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.300 align:middle line:90%
>> OK so dual Conversations

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.720 align:middle line:90%
And it just flows.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And I have no mindset
on channeling.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.270 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm not trying to channel.

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:09.000 align:middle line:84%
Once it goes, I
get out of the way.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:14.092 align:middle line:84%
>> And then I can talk
to Sly or O or whoever.

00:21:14.092 --> 00:21:15.550 align:middle line:84%
Even if O's
channeling, I can still

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:18.940 align:middle line:84%
talk to Ocyphius,
which is really cool.

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:21.220 align:middle line:84%
>> So Ocyphius can be
coming through you,

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.595 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time, you're
having a completely separate

00:21:23.595 --> 00:21:24.512 align:middle line:90%
conversation with him?

00:21:24.512 --> 00:21:25.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.010 align:middle line:84%
>> But knowing what this
conversation is about.

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:29.640 align:middle line:84%
So you're not
completely checked out.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Unlike Rob, who
completely checks out.

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:34.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>> He goes up and
hangs with them.

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I call it going
fishing with Trebb.

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:38.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.120 align:middle line:90%
>> So he goes fishing.

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And then he comes back, and
how is your fishing trip?

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, which
I think is great.

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:50.440 align:middle line:84%
>> But and Darryl, I
think is the same way.

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.080 align:middle line:84%
But it seems like everybody
else now, and especially

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.270 align:middle line:84%
the new channelers
yourself, coming online

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:58.232 align:middle line:84%
seem to have this more of
a presence and awareness.

00:21:58.232 --> 00:21:59.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, conscious channeler.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.732 align:middle line:90%
>> A conscious channeler, yeah.

00:22:00.732 --> 00:22:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And here's the reason why
I believe, in my reality,

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:05.600 align:middle line:90%
that is relevant.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:06.400 align:middle line:90%
It's awesome.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:10.660 align:middle line:84%
Because I get to experience
it from the idea of me.

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:12.800 align:middle line:84%
If I'm out, I have to
go back and watch it.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:19.580 align:middle line:84%
>> However, the validity of
the raw material, you know?

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.353 align:middle line:90%
>> And that came through?

00:22:21.353 --> 00:22:22.270 align:middle line:90%
The raw material came?

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:23.447 align:middle line:90%
I forgot who.

00:22:23.447 --> 00:22:24.280 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't remember.

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:25.000 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:25.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Carla.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:25.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Carla.

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:26.583 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm sorry, Carla.

00:22:26.583 --> 00:22:27.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:29.902 align:middle line:90%
>> Carla and then--

00:22:29.902 --> 00:22:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>> And then Jane
Roberts with Seth.

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.370 align:middle line:90%
>> --Jane with Seth.

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:39.010 align:middle line:84%
So that information validated
starting in the '70s.

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:42.040 align:middle line:84%
and here we are in
2016, and now it's

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.600 align:middle line:84%
becoming more and
more acceptable.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:45.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>> The benefit for the conscious
channeler in my world is I

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:49.480 align:middle line:84%
would want to be a
conscious channeler.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.940 align:middle line:84%
I thought I wanted to
be a trance channeler.

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:53.232 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out to understand
to myself that I'm just

00:22:53.232 --> 00:22:54.110 align:middle line:90%
adding my own idea.

00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:54.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:55.500 align:middle line:90%
>> You know?

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:56.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>> My own, am I
getting in the way?

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And whether I am or not,
I don't care anymore,

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:02.890 align:middle line:84%
because I'm having
a good fucking time.

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:03.732 align:middle line:90%
I love channeling.

00:23:03.732 --> 00:23:04.690 align:middle line:90%
I love the information.

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:06.370 align:middle line:84%
I love the ideas
that it's doing.

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:09.160 align:middle line:84%
So it took me through
an evolutionary process

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.822 align:middle line:84%
in and of itself for
myself, my own evolution.

00:23:11.822 --> 00:23:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's my world,
and it's my evolution.

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:14.850 align:middle line:90%
And I love how I did it.

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:15.730 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:17.710 align:middle line:84%
So for me being
presence and others,

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:20.058 align:middle line:84%
you go through the idea
of not only the message,

00:23:20.058 --> 00:23:21.850 align:middle line:84%
but the vibration of
the entity that you're

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:24.160 align:middle line:84%
co-creating with,
sharing, becoming

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.150 align:middle line:84%
this new idea of an
expression, just beautiful.

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:26.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're in
the present moment.

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:30.880 align:middle line:90%
You're seeing different things.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.740 align:middle line:84%
It's like when I'm
channeling four people

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:34.080 align:middle line:90%
and I'm having sessions.

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.080 align:middle line:84%
We tune in with the higher
self at that session,

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.560 align:middle line:84%
and I get to see the
images of everything that's

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.260 align:middle line:90%
going on in their life.

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:41.972 align:middle line:90%
And it's a magical mystery tour.

00:23:41.972 --> 00:23:43.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I get to see
everything that's going on

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:45.970 align:middle line:90%
with them in that idea.

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And Sly's talking and the other
higher self are communing.

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:52.070 align:middle line:90%
And I get to see these worlds.

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:56.688 align:middle line:90%
And it's just can't replace it.

00:23:56.688 --> 00:23:57.730 align:middle line:90%
I want to be in the game.

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:01.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Now I've asked this to, I
think I may have asked this

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:06.340 align:middle line:84%
to Ardiff about this idea of
multitasking and fractalizing

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:08.910 align:middle line:90%
yourself into doing too much.

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And we have this idea
in this Earth plane

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:19.510 align:middle line:84%
now that multitasking is a
bad thing because you're not

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:20.620 align:middle line:90%
as focused as much.

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:23.930 align:middle line:84%
But it seems like as we
go higher in consciousness

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:31.420 align:middle line:84%
and we understand our
multiple now lives, in a way,

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:34.180 align:middle line:84%
we're already
fractalized, I guess.

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:36.490 align:middle line:84%
But I guess we're
just becoming aware

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:39.060 align:middle line:84%
of the multitasking
that's happening.

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.230 align:middle line:90%
Is that how you see it?

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:41.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:44.400 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you're it sounds like
there's a lot going on when you

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:48.668 align:middle line:84%
go into the channeling with
being with the entity and then

00:24:48.668 --> 00:24:50.710 align:middle line:84%
seeing all these other
things that you just said.

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:52.470 align:middle line:90%
Do you find it confusing?

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:55.410 align:middle line:10%
Does it get confusing,
or just it's a flow?

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:59.510 align:middle line:84%
>> It was, well, I didn't
do it until I understood it.

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And once I understood
it, it came naturally.

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:01.770 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:01.818 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:01.818 --> 00:25:02.651 align:middle line:90%
There was no effort.

00:25:02.651 --> 00:25:05.280 align:middle line:84%
>> As long as I didn't try and
make it happen, figure it out,

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.370 align:middle line:90%
it developed on its own.

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:09.030 align:middle line:84%
Because it's what
we are already.

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:09.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:09.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Think about it.

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:10.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:13.650 align:middle line:84%
>> The one thing that was the
coolest epiphany idea during

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:16.860 align:middle line:84%
the conscious channeling
is the thought blocks.

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:18.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Thought blocks, explain that.

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Thought block is here
comes the idea of the entire

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.460 align:middle line:84%
channeling, 20
minute channeling,

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:25.290 align:middle line:84%
and it's encompassed
in one word.

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:26.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, OK.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And then I get
the entire thing,

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:32.890 align:middle line:84%
but I can't speak of the entire
thing unless I speak one word

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:33.690 align:middle line:90%
at a time.

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:39.468 align:middle line:84%
>> But telepathically, we
are connecting like that.

00:25:39.468 --> 00:25:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I think people
can finish other people's

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:42.600 align:middle line:90%
sentences.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:43.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>> That's why I think they
have the idea because that

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:49.050 align:middle line:84%
connection of that co-created
now that we're catching up

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:52.870 align:middle line:84%
to in time, everyone involved
in that focus now knows it all.

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:53.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Because it's now.

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:55.810 align:middle line:90%
We all know it.

00:25:55.810 --> 00:26:00.380 align:middle line:84%
So we're kind of tuning in more
and more telepathy and idea.

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And you get that thought block
and you know the entire thing.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And now I see, they give
me whatever the channeling

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:08.310 align:middle line:90%
is going to be about.

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:10.010 align:middle line:84%
Like billions of
Earth, that Ocyphius

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:11.640 align:middle line:90%
channel a few weeks ago.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And you know just billions
of Earth, and it was like,

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:17.320 align:middle line:84%
but I can't down
here or in this--

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:18.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:19.850 align:middle line:84%
We have to chop it
up a little bit.

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:21.642 align:middle line:84%
>> I have to chop it
up and put it in time.

00:26:21.642 --> 00:26:23.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:24.510 align:middle line:90%
>> But just channeling.

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, even Nora and Wendy
have done dual channels with

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:28.980 align:middle line:90%
the Pleiadians.

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:31.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've
seen any videos of that.

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:32.520 align:middle line:84%
I find it fascinating,
where they literally

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.147 align:middle line:84%
are finishing each
other's sentences.

00:26:34.147 --> 00:26:34.980 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, whoa.

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:35.780 align:middle line:90%
>> It's like, yeah.

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:38.820 align:middle line:84%
Because it's that
co-created moment of now.

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:40.060 align:middle line:90%
And that's all there is.

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:42.280 align:middle line:84%
And in that, everyone
there knows it,

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:44.440 align:middle line:84%
because it's all co-creation
of that experience.

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:47.600 align:middle line:84%
We don't look at it in
time like, well, I've

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.540 align:middle line:90%
got to catch up to it.

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:49.350 align:middle line:90%
The fractal does.

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:51.000 align:middle line:84%
But all the higher
selves involved,

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.050 align:middle line:84%
we know it because we
created it in the now.

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:53.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:57.240 align:middle line:84%
It's like getting
Bashar and others

00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:03.420 align:middle line:84%
have talked about the
movie analogy, where

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:05.050 align:middle line:90%
sort of the frames on time.

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:09.570 align:middle line:84%
So like you're getting, and now,
we can download a whole movie

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:12.000 align:middle line:90%
file in a little five gig--

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.240 align:middle line:90%
>> I know, Isn't that cool?

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.040 align:middle line:90%
>> --section.

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:17.910 align:middle line:84%
So but to unwrap it,
you have to watch it

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:21.330 align:middle line:84%
through QuickTime or one
of these software programs

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:22.620 align:middle line:90%
that then play it out.

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:25.670 align:middle line:84%
But all that data, it's in
that nice little compact file.

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:26.470 align:middle line:90%
>> That's it.

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:27.760 align:middle line:90%
They send it in.

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:31.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And those movies are being
transferred wirelessly over

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:33.100 align:middle line:90%
our internet every day.

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:34.800 align:middle line:90%
So we're just the same concept.

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:35.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Same idea.

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:36.720 align:middle line:90%
That's cool.

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:37.430 align:middle line:90%
>> It is very cool.

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:38.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:40.410 align:middle line:90%
That's very cool.

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:44.820 align:middle line:84%
So because this is
all, I guess, it

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:49.410 align:middle line:84%
sounds like it's been pretty
recent, since 2012 is it?

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:51.750 align:middle line:84%
>> I started
channeling it was 2013.

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:53.970 align:middle line:84%
I stayed with my
parents for a year.

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And May of 2013 is when
they told me I got to go.

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And by the end of May,
beginning of June,

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.710 align:middle line:84%
I was out and in my
apartment, had the job.

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:07.980 align:middle line:84%
So it was actually, it was two
weeks to training, two weeks

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:09.220 align:middle line:90%
on the job, and then I quit.

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:10.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:11.900 align:middle line:84%
>> And then it was
like, I had no income.

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:12.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>> You know?

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.597 align:middle line:84%
But Odyssey of Ascension
popped in my head

00:28:15.597 --> 00:28:16.680 align:middle line:90%
through the synchronicity.

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:17.970 align:middle line:90%
That's what I was going to do.

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:19.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to start this idea.

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And it was funny, because
I wasn't channeling it

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:22.638 align:middle line:90%
when I quit.

00:28:22.638 --> 00:28:24.680 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know I was
going to be a channeler.

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:25.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>> But what I was doing is I
went to a Law of Attraction

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:28.978 align:middle line:84%
meeting that a friend
of mine that I met,

00:28:28.978 --> 00:28:31.200 align:middle line:84%
her name was Sylvia,
invited me to.

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of the meet
up groups here in town.

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:35.578 align:middle line:84%
And after, I went to
the first meeting,

00:28:35.578 --> 00:28:37.370 align:middle line:84%
and they went around
to introduce everyone.

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And after I spoke, the leader
of that or the facilitator says,

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:42.780 align:middle line:90%
hey, I would love you to speak.

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:44.310 align:middle line:90%
You just seem to have it.

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
coolest thing is

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:49.290 align:middle line:84%
because when I was in
the sales business,

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:51.930 align:middle line:84%
especially training
my salespeople,

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:54.000 align:middle line:90%
there was no way to do it.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:54.880 align:middle line:90%
I just had it.

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.130 align:middle line:90%
And I would just channel it.

00:28:57.130 --> 00:28:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:01.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And it was the same thing
with Law of Attraction.

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:04.590 align:middle line:84%
I'd just start, and
I would just go.

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:09.330 align:middle line:84%
So that was an idea that
started me on the idea of people

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:12.540 align:middle line:84%
wanting to listen to
what I had to say,

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:14.240 align:middle line:90%
because it's not the messenger.

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.240 align:middle line:90%
It's the dialogue.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>> If the dialogue has love,
it's not for a [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.800 align:middle line:84%
purpose, or especially
preaching, oh,

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:23.940 align:middle line:90%
we're so done with that.

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:25.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.130 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:27.720 align:middle line:90%
>> And that idea.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:31.643 align:middle line:84%
It was just this
magnificent symphony

00:29:31.643 --> 00:29:33.060 align:middle line:84%
of words that would
just come out.

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:35.352 align:middle line:84%
And that's the connection
that people was the dialogue.

00:29:35.352 --> 00:29:37.720 align:middle line:90%
It just they wanted to hear it.

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:40.630 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, whoa, yeah.

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And then soon after that,
the channeling started.

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:45.900 align:middle line:84%
But it was about
a month after that

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.820 align:middle line:84%
when people would
come and donate

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:50.500 align:middle line:84%
after I spoke at the
Law of Attraction,

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:51.670 align:middle line:90%
but there was only a couple.

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And then people
would actually, hey,

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:55.380 align:middle line:84%
can I come and sit with
you and talk to you?

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:56.260 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:29:56.260 --> 00:30:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And it was so funny, because it
was like, they were like, Roxy,

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.358 align:middle line:90%
you should start charging.

00:30:02.358 --> 00:30:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, how
much do I charge?

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:05.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:08.080 align:middle line:90%
>> I was so scared.

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:11.270 align:middle line:84%
I was asking for
$60 for an hour.

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh
my god, $60 an hour.

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.450 align:middle line:84%
That was a big
frickin' step for me.

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:16.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>> And it turns out, of
course, it's your value.

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.800 align:middle line:84%
It's the value of
yourself, you know?

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking, well,
spiritual people are poor.

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:24.870 align:middle line:90%
They can't afford me.

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, what a nice reality
I'm creating for myself.

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:28.960 align:middle line:90%
So I learned.

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.360 align:middle line:84%
I said, wait a, it's a
co-created world of a bubble

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:32.770 align:middle line:90%
in the now that's infinite.

00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:34.970 align:middle line:84%
There's a billion Earths
that I can shift to.

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:37.120 align:middle line:84%
So through my evolution,
I realize that now.

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:40.540 align:middle line:84%
But that was a great stepping
stone to see the self value

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:41.410 align:middle line:90%
and work in that.

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And then when the channeling
started, the YouTube started.

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:53.890 align:middle line:84%
People started calling
me this and that.

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:56.590 align:middle line:90%
Then people wanted sessions.

00:30:56.590 --> 00:31:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And then I got help from
Simon over in Australia.

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:04.150 align:middle line:84%
He revamped my website,
raised my prices, says,

00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:06.260 align:middle line:84%
you're much more
valuable than this.

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:07.060 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:10.360 align:middle line:84%
So we raised my prices
to $140 for an hour.

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And I do $195 now for
my channeling classes,

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:18.670 align:middle line:84%
which the students say, Roxy,
you need to charge more.

00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:19.590 align:middle line:90%
Put an ending on it.

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
it's not about that.

00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:24.310 align:middle line:84%
That's the one
thing I found out.

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:25.600 align:middle line:90%
It's not about that.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:28.210 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I do charge
because I want to eat.

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:29.640 align:middle line:90%
I want to buy my shoes.

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to save
up for my boobs.

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:35.720 align:middle line:90%
That's what I want to do.

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:36.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:40.010 align:middle line:84%
>> But I don't over
price and cut people off.

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:42.490 align:middle line:84%
It's like I don't
want to feed it lack.

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:43.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:43.560 align:middle line:90%
>> You know?

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:44.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:47.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's why I've
had suggestions to charge

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:49.540 align:middle line:84%
for my YouTube channels or
put it on the app stores.

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:50.483 align:middle line:90%
That's not my rodeo.

00:31:50.483 --> 00:31:51.400 align:middle line:90%
Others, rock and roll.

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:51.940 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:52.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:54.140 align:middle line:90%
That's what I do, yeah.

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>> But I'm going
to put that out.

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:56.647 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be
out there because I

00:31:56.647 --> 00:31:57.880 align:middle line:90%
have no lack for that.

00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And if that information
changes one life,

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:07.900 align:middle line:84%
then I can't find another bit
of materialistic happiness

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:11.080 align:middle line:84%
that would ever fulfill
that idea myself

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.380 align:middle line:90%
to see the shift in somewhere.

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:13.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:13.980 align:middle line:90%
>> You know?

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:15.803 align:middle line:90%
So that's epic.

00:32:15.803 --> 00:32:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's happening.

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:16.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:18.805 align:middle line:84%
>> So many people do
resonate with your work.

00:32:18.805 --> 00:32:22.480 align:middle line:84%
I've gotten emails from
people asking when are you

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.650 align:middle line:90%
going to get Roxy on?

00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:26.680 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, I'm working on it.

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:27.880 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:29.170 align:middle line:90%
I love doing it.

00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And people, I know that
I'm changing lives,

00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:35.620 align:middle line:90%
but I'm changing.

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:37.900 align:middle line:84%
So since I'm changing,
my reality changing.

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:41.260 align:middle line:84%
My reality changes, then I can
see the change in my reality,

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:44.620 align:middle line:84%
and it's epic that this
world works at that.

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:47.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, that not even this
world, creation works that way.

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:48.490 align:middle line:90%
And I love it.

00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Prior to the channelings,
well, I guess, not even prior,

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:55.720 align:middle line:84%
but I guess more recently, I've
noticed in Ocyphius teachings

00:32:55.720 --> 00:33:01.690 align:middle line:84%
that they often talk about
this sort of reality bubble.

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And that goes into
quantum physics--

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:12.520 align:middle line:84%
>> --with the whole idea
of what's that book?

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:13.720 align:middle line:90%
Is it Michael Tellinger?

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:15.490 align:middle line:90%
No, not Tellinger.

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:17.190 align:middle line:84%
The book, "The
Holographic Universe."

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:17.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh huh.

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:17.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:18.790 align:middle line:90%
>> I forgot who--

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:21.100 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know who,
but I have heard of it.

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So that whole concept, which
came out in the '90s talks

00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:25.730 align:middle line:90%
about--

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:27.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And Nassim is doing
good work on that.

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:28.157 align:middle line:90%
>> Nassim doing great.

00:33:28.157 --> 00:33:29.650 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
great, I just came

00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:37.150 align:middle line:84%
from a conference that seems to
be the scientific consensus is

00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:41.320 align:middle line:84%
we're moving into
this quantum reality

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.660 align:middle line:84%
where there's this field
of infinite potentials.

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And you literally are moving
from one reality to the next.

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, when Tesla said
that and Einstein said that,

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:52.150 align:middle line:84%
if you want to understand
the secrets of the universe,

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:54.180 align:middle line:84%
start looking at it in
vibration and frequency.

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:54.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>> You know?

00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:57.680 align:middle line:84%
Change your vibration,
change your reality.

00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And that, it's a
big one to swallow.

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:04.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you understand any of
that before the channelings?

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:06.100 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:06.550 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:07.350 align:middle line:90%
And how about now?

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:09.174 align:middle line:84%
Now you seem to really
grasp that concept.

00:34:09.174 --> 00:34:09.489 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:34:09.489 --> 00:34:10.340 align:middle line:90%
I got it.

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:11.199 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's epic.

00:34:11.199 --> 00:34:11.739 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:34:11.739 --> 00:34:13.389 align:middle line:84%
>> And actually,
this week coming up,

00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:17.380 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be channeling
the idea of the uniqueness

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:20.679 align:middle line:84%
of co-creation realities,
talking about it in more

00:34:20.679 --> 00:34:21.880 align:middle line:90%
in depth ideas.

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.080 align:middle line:90%
So just really cool stuff.

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:23.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:29.199 align:middle line:84%
That's because I tried to
explain from all the teachings

00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:32.830 align:middle line:84%
that I've learned and as
well as my own downloads,

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:37.429 align:middle line:84%
I tried to explain that your
vibrational frequency creates

00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:40.160 align:middle line:84%
your reality, and you're in
your individual reality bubble.

00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:40.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:44.790 align:middle line:84%
>> But the interesting part is
that I haven't sort of wrapped,

00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:46.860 align:middle line:84%
been able to, I kind
of got the concept,

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:49.899 align:middle line:84%
but I haven't been able to put
it into words is what about

00:34:49.899 --> 00:34:50.699 align:middle line:90%
the other guy?

00:34:50.699 --> 00:34:52.570 align:middle line:84%
What about the
co-creation process?

00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:55.129 align:middle line:84%
So maybe we can get a little
bit of that later today

00:34:55.129 --> 00:34:55.929 align:middle line:90%
in the channelings.

00:34:55.929 --> 00:34:56.515 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:34:56.515 --> 00:34:57.315 align:middle line:90%
That'd be fun.

00:34:57.315 --> 00:34:59.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Because that's something that
I personally I think I would

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:00.750 align:middle line:90%
like to know.

00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:01.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, we can do that.

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:04.720 align:middle line:84%
>> It sounds like you will
be doing it too next week.

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:07.035 align:middle line:84%
But maybe this could
be an offshoot of that

00:35:07.035 --> 00:35:08.160 align:middle line:90%
and we can connect the two.

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:08.960 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:09.960 align:middle line:90%
>> And figure that out.

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:10.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Very exciting.

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:14.250 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, I ask this to
everybody who has multiple

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:16.290 align:middle line:10%
beings that they're
able to channel,

00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:18.250 align:middle line:10%
do you have a favorite?

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:20.740 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, Sylvester.

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:21.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Sylvester, OK.

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:24.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Probably Sly.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.188 align:middle line:90%
But see, I like Sylvester for--

00:35:29.188 --> 00:35:30.480 align:middle line:90%
they all have their own flavor.

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:36.780 align:middle line:84%
>> But Sylvester resonates with
me in this now the most not

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:39.540 align:middle line:84%
because the others are less
than or anything like that,

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:42.340 align:middle line:84%
because Sylvester's
taken me closer to home.

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:43.140 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:46.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And of course, all the
other entities aren't offended.

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:47.560 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't
have polarity.

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:48.560 align:middle line:90%
>> They're not offended?

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:48.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:49.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:50.670 align:middle line:84%
>> That I like one
more than the other.

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:51.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:53.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Because that's a
human perspective.

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:54.040 align:middle line:90%
We're in polarity.

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:57.990 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, we see the
gauging scales of polarity.

00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And I talked to O about that,
and he goes, kid, I don't care.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.840 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm now, and I'm love.

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
oh, that's right.

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:08.490 align:middle line:84%
But O got me to different
ideas and really

00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:10.820 align:middle line:84%
going through the experience
and the information.

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And Ocyphius always
still comes in.

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And then when I was
introduced to Sly,

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:18.450 align:middle line:84%
there was just this
click of information.

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:21.770 align:middle line:84%
Like I went from earning
my master's to going to get

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:25.300 align:middle line:84%
the doctorate or something,
that kind of idea.

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:30.180 align:middle line:90%
And then behind Sly is more.

00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:36.240 align:middle line:90%
And this quasi mind's growing.

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:38.960 align:middle line:84%
So I can see that
and understand that

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.070 align:middle line:84%
and be able to put
it into reference

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:44.070 align:middle line:90%
points of my current self.

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:45.767 align:middle line:84%
Because anything
that's out of bounds,

00:36:45.767 --> 00:36:48.100 align:middle line:84%
I can't perceive because I
have nothing to translate it,

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:49.850 align:middle line:90%
nothing to reference it to.

00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And Sly's moving me
in that direction.

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:52.560 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:55.570 align:middle line:90%
>> And is Sly a collective?

00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:58.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, he's a big
ass over soul, I guess.

00:36:58.540 --> 00:36:59.340 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:00.294 align:middle line:90%
Big ass over soul.

00:37:00.294 --> 00:37:01.250 align:middle line:90%
>> He's way up there.

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:02.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:05.400 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, for structural
purposes is Ocyphius is fire.

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:09.100 align:middle line:84%
Out of fire is Sylvester,
or out of Sylvester is fire.

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:11.970 align:middle line:84%
But Sylvester is and
I'm not Sylvester.

00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:12.787 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:37:12.787 --> 00:37:14.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's where
I'm working on it.

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:15.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Roman came through.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:17.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And Roman says, I'm the
expression of you, Roxy.

00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:22.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm Roy.

00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:23.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm Roxy.

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:24.890 align:middle line:90%
Roy then, Roxy now.

00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:25.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>> But I'm also
Roman, but I'm you.

00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
it's going is there's

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:34.110 align:middle line:90%
an expression behind Rueben.

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:36.060 align:middle line:84%
There's an expression
behind the over soul.

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:37.650 align:middle line:84%
There's an expression
behind that.

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:40.450 align:middle line:84%
Right back to the
individual one.

00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:45.270 align:middle line:84%
It's all that idea of vibrated,
let's say, energy of expression

00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:48.060 align:middle line:84%
that creates in every
individuals' singularity

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:49.950 align:middle line:90%
leading back to the whole.

00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just now I got an
understanding about it.

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:56.070 align:middle line:90%


00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:57.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.267 align:middle line:90%
That's cool.

00:37:58.267 --> 00:37:59.100 align:middle line:90%
>> And what is that?

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:00.066 align:middle line:90%
Can you share?

00:38:00.066 --> 00:38:02.086 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't think I can
put it into words yet.

00:38:02.086 --> 00:38:02.886 align:middle line:90%
>> Put into words.

00:38:02.886 --> 00:38:02.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:05.190 align:middle line:84%
>> But there was a little
bit of a click there.

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:06.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:09.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, god.

00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:14.120 align:middle line:84%
You just want to put it
together, but it's yeah.

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:15.120 align:middle line:90%
I get it more and more.

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:15.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:16.590 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm the same.

00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:27.360 align:middle line:84%

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:28.410 align:middle line:90%
teachings.

00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I live it.

00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:31.380 align:middle line:90%
I live the fear.

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:32.460 align:middle line:90%
I love the fear.

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:34.770 align:middle line:84%
Abundance was an
ass kicker for me.

00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:36.160 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm telling you.

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.890 align:middle line:84%
It was like I was
so afraid of money

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:40.852 align:middle line:84%
and charging money and accepting
money and the guilt about it.

00:38:40.852 --> 00:38:42.060 align:middle line:90%
And I just worked through it.

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was like you're
being taught to save

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:47.460 align:middle line:90%
all your life for a rainy day.

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And if you put that vibration
out that you have to save,

00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:52.410 align:middle line:90%
you're going to have to save.

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to use
that money for something.

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And then you know, O
said to me one day,

00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:00.090 align:middle line:84%
spend what you have in
the now, because there's

00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:02.190 align:middle line:90%
an infinite number of nows.

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:05.280 align:middle line:84%
The money is paper
that's vibrated.

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:06.150 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:07.890 align:middle line:90%
And it's my Earth.

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:10.320 align:middle line:90%
I get to create my Earth.

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:12.780 align:middle line:84%
I get to put the
things into place.

00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:15.580 align:middle line:84%
I trust this guy,
the higher self now.

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:18.460 align:middle line:84%
So I was moving
in that direction

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:20.360 align:middle line:84%
and understanding that
I don't have to save

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:23.460 align:middle line:84%
and I don't have to
fear, and now it flows.

00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:25.480 align:middle line:84%
I still got a lot eh
about this and that.

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:26.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:29.280 align:middle line:84%
>> But compared to what it was,
I understand that abundance

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.970 align:middle line:90%
comes in all ways.

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:32.820 align:middle line:90%
I remember my truck got repoed.

00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:35.730 align:middle line:84%
I took a title loan
out on it before I

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:41.700 align:middle line:90%
quit to have that extra money.

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And then I never had the
money to pay it back.

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:47.245 align:middle line:84%
So a mother MFin the
universe, sorry, and why?

00:39:47.245 --> 00:39:48.045 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:39:48.045 --> 00:39:48.240 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:48.630 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:49.020 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:49.820 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And then one person you
know, which is the interview,

00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:58.070 align:middle line:90%
I met her.

00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:00.880 align:middle line:90%


00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.870 align:middle line:90%
Connie and her husband.

00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:04.300 align:middle line:90%
I met her.

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:07.540 align:middle line:84%
Jason had said,
Connie, to Connie, you

00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:10.120 align:middle line:90%
should get a session with Roxy.

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:11.530 align:middle line:90%
She called me.

00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:13.960 align:middle line:84%
I said, it doesn't
feel like a session.

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:15.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually turning
down a session.

00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:16.948 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, I think
you're supposed

00:40:16.948 --> 00:40:19.450 align:middle line:84%
to just come to the channeling,
and we'll meet there.

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:22.135 align:middle line:84%
So she came in and said,
look, I don't have a car.

00:40:22.135 --> 00:40:24.010 align:middle line:84%
Can you come and pick
me up tomorrow and then

00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:25.203 align:middle line:90%
we'll go to the channeling?

00:40:25.203 --> 00:40:26.620 align:middle line:84%
She goes, yeah,
where do you live?

00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:28.900 align:middle line:90%
Turns out three miles away.

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:31.520 align:middle line:84%
So she takes me
to the channeling.

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:32.320 align:middle line:90%
We meet.

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:36.300 align:middle line:84%
We talk like we're old friends,
like we've never separated.

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:40.450 align:middle line:84%
It was wonderful,
her and her husband.

00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:43.090 align:middle line:84%
Two days later on that Friday,
on Sunday, she called me,

00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:44.710 align:middle line:84%
and she goes, we
have an extra car.

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:45.710 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to use that?

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:49.800 align:middle line:84%
So I got a 2007 black
Hummer H2 chromed out

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.460 align:middle line:84%
that I got to use for
free for three months.

00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:53.260 align:middle line:90%
Abundance.

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:54.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:54.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Abundance.

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:55.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Did it come with gas?

00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:56.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:40:56.610 --> 00:40:57.613 align:middle line:90%
Full tank.

00:40:57.613 --> 00:40:59.530 align:middle line:84%
He washed it and put a
full tank in it for me.

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:00.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:01.250 align:middle line:90%
>> He did.

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:02.990 align:middle line:90%
So that was abundance.

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>> And that blew my socks off.

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:09.160 align:middle line:84%
I was like, OK, there
is something to this.

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:10.960 align:middle line:84%
But I still had to
go through the fears.

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:11.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:12.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And Ocyphius,
love your fears.

00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:14.030 align:middle line:90%
Engage in them.

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:14.830 align:middle line:90%
Play with them.

00:41:14.830 --> 00:41:15.310 align:middle line:90%
Be them.

00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:17.440 align:middle line:84%
Because if your love
and fear is an illusion

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:19.230 align:middle line:90%
of love, which is still love.

00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:21.363 align:middle line:90%
You're the one distorting it.

00:41:21.363 --> 00:41:22.780 align:middle line:84%
I'd take it and
turn it into this.

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:23.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:24.355 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a neutral universe.

00:41:24.355 --> 00:41:25.400 align:middle line:90%
I got it.

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:27.470 align:middle line:84%
So I start working and
understanding that.

00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:31.240 align:middle line:84%
So I love going through it
and living the evolution

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:33.310 align:middle line:90%
and practicing what I preach.

00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:34.508 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:41:34.508 --> 00:41:35.800 align:middle line:90%
Oh, god, I said that, didn't I?

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:38.200 align:middle line:90%
OK, what I teach.

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.460 align:middle line:90%
Preach.

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:40.680 align:middle line:90%
O goes, yikes.

00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:42.310 align:middle line:90%
I was like, I know.

00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:43.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's all you.

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:44.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I know.

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:47.870 align:middle line:90%
So and just live that.

00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:48.670 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:50.410 align:middle line:90%
So I do what I want to do.

00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:51.730 align:middle line:10%
I love shoes.

00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:54.280 align:middle line:10%
And I love bell
bottom jeans, flares.

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:57.640 align:middle line:84%
I do love them, because I
didn't get to wear them then.

00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:00.270 align:middle line:90%
So I buy my clothes that I like.

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:02.350 align:middle line:90%
I get my food that I like.

00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:03.820 align:middle line:90%
I go out and eat.

00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:05.500 align:middle line:90%
I don't save.

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:09.940 align:middle line:84%
Although, I have abundance in
the idea of my bank, of course.

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:10.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>> But I do the now.

00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:14.580 align:middle line:90%
I do the now.

00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And it was a son of a bitch
to learn to do the now.

00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:18.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Because everything is
telling you future, past,

00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:21.960 align:middle line:90%
what if, and this.

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And that wonderful
cycle of the illusion

00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:28.480 align:middle line:84%
that's just spinning as
a background program,

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:31.780 align:middle line:84%
but then seeing it and
just this little piece here

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:34.120 align:middle line:84%
and looking at it and
go, your piece was seen.

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:35.290 align:middle line:90%
Poof.

00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:36.220 align:middle line:90%
And it's done.

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And then through that, the
only thing that emerges is you.

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:41.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:44.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Not the idea of
the suit you don.

00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:45.540 align:middle line:90%
The identity of separation.

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:49.000 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the excitement and
the joy of you version.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.450 align:middle line:90%
It's not the other version.

00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:51.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:52.060 align:middle line:90%
It's me.

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:53.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:54.640 align:middle line:90%
>> And I rock.

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:56.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's what's
fun every day.

00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:57.410 align:middle line:90%
I've been--

00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:58.210 align:middle line:90%
>> It's beautiful.

00:42:58.210 --> 00:42:59.830 align:middle line:84%
>> In past year or
two, same with me.

00:42:59.830 --> 00:43:01.000 align:middle line:90%
>> It's just shifting.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.710 align:middle line:90%
>> It's amazing.

00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:07.210 align:middle line:84%
>> When I channeled
Jane, the 12 endoctrines,

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:09.390 align:middle line:84%
endoctrine number eight
was the most important.

00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:11.830 align:middle line:90%
And that was vulnerability.

00:43:11.830 --> 00:43:13.930 align:middle line:90%
Be vulnerable, OK?

00:43:13.930 --> 00:43:17.300 align:middle line:84%
You can't have-- people think,
vulnerable, you invite attack.

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:18.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:19.630 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, defense invites attack.

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:20.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>> So I understood that.

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And I had to let go and
not try to secure my future

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:26.080 align:middle line:90%
and be in the now.

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And through that painful
time scary, scary,

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:35.840 align:middle line:84%
times, down to the last
no food minute times,

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:36.640 align:middle line:90%
it all worked out.

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:38.200 align:middle line:90%
The miracle came every time.

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And now it's just
this effortless flow.

00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:43.040 align:middle line:84%
Because it was the belief
in myself that changed it.

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:43.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:48.340 align:middle line:84%
>> But I had to go through that
idea of those beliefs to see

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:49.380 align:middle line:90%
that they weren't real.

00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:53.020 align:middle line:84%
That it was me that was choosing
it to be that vibration instead

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:55.164 align:middle line:90%
of the vibration it was, love.

00:43:55.164 --> 00:43:57.645 align:middle line:90%
And it was what a journey.

00:43:57.645 --> 00:43:58.445 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:43:58.445 --> 00:44:00.250 align:middle line:90%
>> You can't write this.

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:02.360 align:middle line:84%
Just in the now,
and it's wonderful.

00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And here I am now with you,
which is freaking awesome.

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:08.570 align:middle line:90%
I get to do this now.

00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And then I have an
actual, I got invited out

00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:14.740 align:middle line:84%
to the Houston
Edgar Cayce Center

00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:16.730 align:middle line:90%
in June to do a channeling.

00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:18.350 align:middle line:90%
So I get to go out and channel.

00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:19.970 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I want to do.

00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:20.930 align:middle line:90%
I want to channel.

00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:21.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:24.350 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean, I love channeling.

00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:25.550 align:middle line:90%
So I get sessions.

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:28.130 align:middle line:90%
And I get the channeling thing.

00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And I have an Ascension
University idea coming online.

00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And we're working on that with
Sly and the boys and girls.

00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And everyone is
going to be involved.

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:39.030 align:middle line:90%
And it's just wonderful.

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's not about the
idea of the outcome.

00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:44.985 align:middle line:84%
It's about the journey
to watch it unfold.

00:44:44.985 --> 00:44:45.880 align:middle line:90%
It's magic.

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:47.221 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:44:47.221 --> 00:44:48.690 align:middle line:90%
>> It truly is.

00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:49.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Very cool.

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:50.270 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you.

00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:50.600 align:middle line:90%
>> So what else?

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:50.930 align:middle line:90%
Is that good for now?

00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yeah.

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:53.030 align:middle line:90%
I say thank you for sharing.

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And a little bit later, we'll
get into some channeling

00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:57.850 align:middle line:90%
and share some more.

00:44:57.850 --> 00:44:58.650 align:middle line:90%
>> We'll do it.

00:44:58.650 --> 00:44:59.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:44:59.450 --> 00:45:02.430 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any
questions for me?

00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:04.520 align:middle line:84%
I've never asked that
before in an interview.

00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:06.690 align:middle line:84%
>> But in the moment,
you were inspired.

00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:07.800 align:middle line:90%
>> I was inspired, yeah.

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.760 align:middle line:90%
>> It was like uh.

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:12.620 align:middle line:84%
What do you want
to eat for lunch?

00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:16.010 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm you know, I like
healthy vegan stuff.

00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:18.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my god, you're in Texas.

00:45:18.010 --> 00:45:22.560 align:middle line:90%
