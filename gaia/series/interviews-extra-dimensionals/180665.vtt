00:00:04.482 --> 00:01:44.687 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.687 --> 00:01:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Greetings, once
again, to the collective.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.700 align:middle line:10%
This is Ocyphius.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.760 align:middle line:10%
I have Reuben.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.660 align:middle line:10%
Welcome.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:51.610 align:middle line:10%
How are you?

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.890 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:53.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.220 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for inviting us, truly.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks for coming.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, let me just say this.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.600 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't not come.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.220 align:middle line:90%
Hm.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.250 align:middle line:90%
Truly.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.890 align:middle line:84%
It is all choice,
co-creation of now.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:07.880 align:middle line:90%
Hm.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I had a question in regard
to Ocyphius and the oversoul

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.820 align:middle line:90%
collective fire.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Could you explain a little
more detail about that idea,

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.760 align:middle line:84%
that density, and
sort of in the series,

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm investigating and
interviewing a lot of different

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.620 align:middle line:90%
entities from different realms.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And I know it's not maybe the
best thing to always classify

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.450 align:middle line:84%
things in a nice,
neat little way.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>> But it helps the Human
Collective to categorize,

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.420 align:middle line:84%
logicalize, to keep
things in check,

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.670 align:middle line:84%
so they can take the
evolution of reference points.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Boo-yah.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.070 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's sort of what I'm
creating a library of ideas

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.980 align:middle line:90%
and entities and densities.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:56.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'm very curious to
know a little bit more about

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.180 align:middle line:84%
the Ocyphius
Collective and def--

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.480 align:middle line:84%
I guess in more
of a defining way.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Out of the idea of fire,
fire created an idea of itself,

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.050 align:middle line:84%
and that expression is
the idea of Ocyphius.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Coming out of that idea oversoul
is another expression of itself

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.970 align:middle line:90%
in the now.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.180 align:middle line:84%
Always understand that there
is no older nor younger.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.340 align:middle line:84%
There is no old souls
and young souls.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.140 align:middle line:90%
Mm-mm.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.040 align:middle line:90%
Truly not.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.840 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.390 align:middle line:90%
Because there is no time.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.880 align:middle line:84%
From the reference point of
humanity understanding itself,

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.180 align:middle line:84%
it elaborates in, let's say, hm,
validates to a resounding theme

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.253 align:middle line:90%
that time does exist.

00:03:36.253 --> 00:03:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it
does in the now,

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.030 align:middle line:84%
as everyone and anyone who
chooses to perceive time

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.380 align:middle line:84%
will experience
the idea of time.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.070 align:middle line:84%
But in the idea that,
I was born in the now,

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.270 align:middle line:90%
much like all of you were.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:48.410 align:middle line:90%
Hm.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.110 align:middle line:84%
So in that idea, I'm an
expression birthing itself out

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.350 align:middle line:84%
of fire, birthing itself out of
Sylvester, birthing itself out

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.670 align:middle line:90%
of all that is.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.790 align:middle line:84%
There are different
ideas of names for names,

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.490 align:middle line:84%
clarifications on
idea of structure

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.780 align:middle line:84%
help the collective idea,
used as permission slips,

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.370 align:middle line:90%
to evolve itself.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:08.960 align:middle line:90%
So we give names.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Truly, we don't call
each other by the name.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.720 align:middle line:84%
What's up, Sly, or hey,
yo, Jane, come over here.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.750 align:middle line:84%
It's a vibration of contact, of
connection in the now, truly.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.690 align:middle line:84%
The recognition of each now of
all the entities we understand,

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.920 align:middle line:84%
which is everything in
every individual singularity

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.650 align:middle line:90%
perceived focus of now, too.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.960 align:middle line:90%
So I'm an idea of a galaxy--

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.250 align:middle line:84%
galaxy, right now, was what
you call an idea of you--

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.610 align:middle line:84%
what you call earth
years ago, as what

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.550 align:middle line:84%
you call a constellation,
moving itself

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.930 align:middle line:84%
and incarnating as an
entire idea galaxy.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And in that frequency,
that's where

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm playing in my playground
right now as the old, let's

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.310 align:middle line:84%
say, focused idea of
Ocyphius, although it is now,

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.330 align:middle line:84%
I can focus truly
anywhere I want to.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of me is focused
in the idea of Roxie/Ocyphius

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.820 align:middle line:84%
and this now expressing
this idea of creation

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:11.330 align:middle line:84%
through the idea of co-creation
of us too, and truly all of you

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.930 align:middle line:90%
in this now.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.830 align:middle line:10%
So fire, as a collective,
is not like what

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.200 align:middle line:10%
you would call a density.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.680 align:middle line:90%
It is an intergalactic.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>> In the idea of the Octavia
that you guys exist in in this

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.020 align:middle line:84%
now, your focus there
are eight idea densities.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.610 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we understand that.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:29.720 align:middle line:90%
Of course, there are more.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.020 align:middle line:84%
There are countless, however
you wish to structure it.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.850 align:middle line:84%
But in this idea of this
journey, there are eight.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And in that idea, the
collective oversoul

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.510 align:middle line:84%
is not focusing on an idea
of understanding itself

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.750 align:middle line:84%
and evolution through the
idea experiences of what

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.200 align:middle line:84%
you call an Octavia, or
eight density illusion.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Now in that idea,
fire, as well as I am,

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.520 align:middle line:84%
am interdimensional,
being an idea over here,

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.500 align:middle line:90%
being an idea over here.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.290 align:middle line:84%
The focus of the
idea of evolution

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.890 align:middle line:84%
is that of Roxanne in
this idea, a density idea.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>> And then the Ocyphius
Collective would be outside

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.370 align:middle line:84%
that realm, even
outside of the--

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, but outside
that idea game.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.190 align:middle line:90%
There's no outside of the realm.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, OK.

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.340 align:middle line:90%
>> There's always here and now.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Make sense?

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Makes sense.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Because whenever you
put something over there,

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.640 align:middle line:90%
you are not here and now.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.020 align:middle line:90%
And there is no over there.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>> And there's never then.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.180 align:middle line:90%
True?

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.450 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And going back to
the fire collective--

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.020 align:middle line:90%
>> --so sort of the--

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.930 align:middle line:84%
if we take all the elements, the
ele-- we call them elementals,

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.670 align:middle line:84%
almost, these beings that are
sort of birthed from these

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:52.360 align:middle line:84%
elements, these consciousnesses,
this energy, I guess,

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:59.500 align:middle line:84%
that we label are
different-- our Earth, Wind,

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.030 align:middle line:84%
and these are all--
they all have--

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Fire and air,
which is truly space.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:04.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And so all of these, we sort
of put deities behind these

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:07.950 align:middle line:90%
energies.

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:08.830 align:middle line:90%
>> They're entities, true.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:09.730 align:middle line:90%
>> And entities.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.460 align:middle line:90%
>> They are.

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.960 align:middle line:84%
But fire is not the idea of the
same fire as you understand.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.920 align:middle line:84%
The collective oversoul fire
is, let's say, many names

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.650 align:middle line:84%
and many different ideas,
civilizations around the world,

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:23.350 align:middle line:84%
all interpreted by the
idea of the individual

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:24.940 align:middle line:90%
experiencing that.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.910 align:middle line:84%
Through the human idea,
Roxie deemed the idea of fire

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.190 align:middle line:90%
as a plausible idea name.

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:33.010 align:middle line:84%
In the idea of Roxie's
Sagittarian itself

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:35.680 align:middle line:84%
being the fire sign,
felt that connection

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.000 align:middle line:84%
to the idea of Ocyphius and
the oversoul collective fire.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.220 align:middle line:90%
Just the vibration of that--

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Just a little.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:43.977 align:middle line:90%
>> Essassani in there.

00:07:43.977 --> 00:07:45.520 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for coming in.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.890 align:middle line:84%
The idea of that
idea, fire idea,

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:50.980 align:middle line:90%
but not as in the elemental.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.980 align:middle line:84%
Fire in and of itself, just
like breath in and of itself,

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.670 align:middle line:84%
space in and of itself,
are all idea entities

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:00.100 align:middle line:84%
in and of themselves,
much like Gaia, much

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.730 align:middle line:84%
like the idea of your Logos of
this idea of a solar system,

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:04.850 align:middle line:90%
that'd be your sun.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:05.650 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:09.230 align:middle line:84%
So not necessarily the fire
entity, but more of the energy?

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:10.030 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:10.830 align:middle line:10%
>> I see, OK.

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:12.680 align:middle line:10%
>> From the way
Roxie perceived it.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.930 align:middle line:10%
>> The way Roxie perceived it.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.690 align:middle line:10%
>> And that idea being
introduced to herself called

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:19.930 align:middle line:10%
"fire" in that idea
oversoul, whoa.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:20.950 align:middle line:10%
It can be nothing else.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.130 align:middle line:10%
That was the immediacy
of her, let's say,

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:26.710 align:middle line:10%
interpretation of the vibration
during the introduction

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:29.410 align:middle line:10%
of herself to the idea of
the collective oversoul.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:30.980 align:middle line:90%
She deemed it as fire.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:31.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.309 align:middle line:90%
And that makes sense.

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for putting
it in the context

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.669 align:middle line:84%
of the astrological
sign, the Sagittarius.

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:37.469 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect.

00:08:37.469 --> 00:08:39.127 align:middle line:90%
>> That energy I can--

00:08:39.127 --> 00:08:40.419 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, glad to be of service.

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:42.840 align:middle line:90%
>> We can relate to.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:47.650 align:middle line:84%
So talking about
energies and archetypes,

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:51.700 align:middle line:84%
and you said, you know, we,
in this dimension reality,

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.120 align:middle line:90%
label everything with names.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.050 align:middle line:84%
But sort of when you
get beyond the names,

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:58.390 align:middle line:90%
you perceive things--

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:02.710 align:middle line:84%
I've started to perceive
things as archetypal energies.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:05.680 align:middle line:84%
You know, when we
label fire and--

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.647 align:middle line:84%
but you know, fire is such a
limiting word to that ener--

00:09:10.647 --> 00:09:12.730 align:middle line:84%
all the different things
that come with that fire.

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:14.380 align:middle line:84%
So is that how,
sort of, once you

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:17.780 align:middle line:84%
get into these other
states of consciousness--

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:18.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, keep going.

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>> --the Ocyphius consciousness,
is that how you then interp--

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:22.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Perceive.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.660 align:middle line:84%
>> --perceive ideas and
connect with energies?

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:27.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, not only that here.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to elaborate on where
your idea thoughts are going.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>> There is an idea
of a definition.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.730 align:middle line:84%
Behind the definition,
there's another definition.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:38.200 align:middle line:84%
It is a larger definition, which
is in cases encompasses a more

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.610 align:middle line:90%
idea than that.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:42.610 align:middle line:84%
However, the perceivable
translation of your own,

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:45.880 align:middle line:84%
let's say, acquired through
your nows of being a human,

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.790 align:middle line:84%
reference points cannot allow
the frequency translation

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:50.680 align:middle line:90%
to come in until you allow it.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.110 align:middle line:84%
That's why all solutions
present themselves

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:54.520 align:middle line:90%
when you don't think about it.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.010 align:middle line:84%
Now and that idea,
you will evolve

00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:59.680 align:middle line:84%
into that idea of a
definition and realize

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.770 align:middle line:84%
the definition is more than the
definition of and of itself.

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:04.360 align:middle line:84%
Release yourself
from the stricture

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.842 align:middle line:84%
of that idea
structured definition,

00:10:05.842 --> 00:10:07.300 align:middle line:84%
and the only thing
that will happen

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.220 align:middle line:84%
is more understanding
of that word.

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:10.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And that thought block
becomes the entire idea behind

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:13.510 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:15.670 align:middle line:90%
And then there's more.

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:16.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:17.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>> In that idea,
let's look at this.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:23.350 align:middle line:84%
You're looking at a painting,
a very large painting,

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:24.410 align:middle line:90%
maybe the Sistine Chapel.

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:25.210 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:27.348 align:middle line:84%
You're looking at
something, and in that idea,

00:10:27.348 --> 00:10:29.140 align:middle line:84%
there's the grandeur
of it, but you're also

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:33.830 align:middle line:84%
just focusing on one part of it
to watch the experience unfold.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:37.480 align:middle line:84%
It's one idea, but there's a
billion nows within that idea

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.877 align:middle line:90%
to explore it.

00:10:38.877 --> 00:10:40.960 align:middle line:84%
So you look at this part
of it and this part of it

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.200 align:middle line:84%
and this part of it
and this part of it,

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.242 align:middle line:84%
and you keep evolving
until you see the big idea.

00:10:44.242 --> 00:10:45.490 align:middle line:90%
Hm.

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:46.290 align:middle line:90%
Make sense?

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:46.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Makes sense.

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:47.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Boo-yah.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- and it seems our
Earth reality is quite a big

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:53.270 align:middle line:90%
idea.

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:56.190 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of little
ideas in this idea.

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:56.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.720 align:middle line:84%
Do you understand what
it is to be an Earthling,

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.540 align:middle line:90%
a human at this time?

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:05.710 align:middle line:84%
To understand the depths
of limitation, do you see--

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:07.450 align:middle line:84%
do you see, entity,
how much you've

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:10.090 align:middle line:90%
created out of limitation?

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:13.870 align:middle line:84%
Without your limitations,
you do not find a way.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that a resounding
theme when things go wrong--

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:18.520 align:middle line:90%
natural disasters and such--

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.700 align:middle line:84%
how you bond together
and find a way?

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.650 align:middle line:84%
When things are at
their worst, humanity

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:26.790 align:middle line:84%
is at their best
because of limitation.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:27.610 align:middle line:90%
Truly.

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:28.630 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:29.560 align:middle line:90%
So what's to gain?

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.390 align:middle line:84%
Experience, to
understand and create

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:34.750 align:middle line:84%
beyond your idea of
measure of yourself.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
you all are doing

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:38.740 align:middle line:84%
to see the beauty
of being limited,

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:42.500 align:middle line:84%
to know that you have
always been unlimited.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.794 align:middle line:90%
Truly.

00:11:43.794 --> 00:11:44.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Very nice.

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:45.810 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:51.990 align:middle line:84%
Going into this galactic
idea of different archetypes,

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:55.460 align:middle line:84%
we have such a mixed soup
here on this planet of--

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:56.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:56.700 align:middle line:90%
>> --different entities.

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:57.790 align:middle line:90%
>> A lot going on.

00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:58.590 align:middle line:90%
>> A lot going on.

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Truly.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:07.090 align:middle line:84%
>> And maybe just kind of a
confirmation or the checking

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:08.160 align:middle line:90%
in to say--

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:08.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Go ahead.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:12.498 align:middle line:84%
>> --right now in this idea of
disclosure of our intergalactic

00:12:12.498 --> 00:12:14.790 align:middle line:84%
families or connecting to
these intergalactic families.

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:16.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Becoming galactic.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, becoming galactic.

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:19.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Part of the idea.

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:23.550 align:middle line:84%
Homo-Galacticus is the idea,
echoing that of Bashar,

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:26.520 align:middle line:90%
channeled through Darryl, truly.

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:30.060 align:middle line:84%
>> So we have
reptilian I think is--

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.730 align:middle line:84%
it seems to be a key
theme, especially of late,

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:36.720 align:middle line:84%
where in the past, people
have sort of looked

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.370 align:middle line:84%
at this reptilian
archetypal energies.

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:41.280 align:middle line:84%
Why do they look
at men as negative?

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, exactly, negative.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:43.980 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Bad, scary.

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:46.920 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.550 align:middle line:84%
Is it humanity is
encouched in fear?

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:49.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:51.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And what doesn't
make the news?

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.330 align:middle line:90%
Clean laundry!

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.132 align:middle line:90%
But dirty laundry-- oh, yeah.

00:12:55.132 --> 00:12:56.090 align:middle line:90%
Let's get it out there.

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:56.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's scare the shit, so we
can build more guns and more

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:03.420 align:middle line:84%
walls and more bars, and keep
the idea of humanity encouched

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:08.800 align:middle line:90%
in the idea system that pays 1%.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:09.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.410 align:middle line:90%
>> And the rest work.

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:13.350 align:middle line:90%
But it worked.

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:14.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:14.400 align:middle line:90%
Up until now.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.260 align:middle line:10%
>> It was a great service
and understanding,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.950 align:middle line:10%
as many know now the idea of
the alien interaction with that

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:26.670 align:middle line:10%
reptilian idea in their idea
memories are now changing

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:28.200 align:middle line:10%
in the interactions
they thought,

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.658 align:middle line:10%
where that idea as scary were
not actually that, were they?

00:13:30.658 --> 00:13:31.458 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:13:31.458 --> 00:13:32.490 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Because the idea memory
is given in a moment

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:38.100 align:middle line:84%
that serves a purpose for
the ascension of the self,

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.700 align:middle line:84%
as well as the byproduct
out of the collective whole.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And when abductions are
happening and conspiracy

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:45.930 align:middle line:90%
happening, it makes the news.

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:47.430 align:middle line:90%
News is a what?

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:48.450 align:middle line:90%
Awareness.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:50.040 align:middle line:90%
Awareness is expansion.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.050 align:middle line:84%
Awareness is choice,
understanding

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:55.860 align:middle line:84%
its own individual reality
in reflection of itself.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:00.030 align:middle line:84%
Expanding, choosing,
broadening, calling bullshit.

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:01.170 align:middle line:90%
I like this better.

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:02.940 align:middle line:84%
Through that idea
of evolution, you

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.530 align:middle line:90%
are here now on the evolution.

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:06.330 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:09.610 align:middle line:84%
Of the awakening of the
species, the grand awakening.

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:10.410 align:middle line:90%
>> So.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:14.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Because of all these ideas,
to know what you are what?

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.750 align:middle line:10%
Not to understand which you are.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:17.550 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:19.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Unconditional love.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:20.850 align:middle line:10%
Truly.

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:22.060 align:middle line:10%
Exciting times.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:22.860 align:middle line:10%
Go ahead.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So this sort of infusion--
some people look at these times

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:33.930 align:middle line:84%
that we're in right now as
biblical times of apocalyptic

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:35.400 align:middle line:90%
ideas and all this fear--

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:35.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Scary.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:36.470 align:middle line:90%
>> --scary.

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:37.470 align:middle line:90%
>> That's their world.

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:38.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I agree.

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:39.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm not buying into that.

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:46.950 align:middle line:84%
But is this all coming out
now, so we can choose clearly

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:48.140 align:middle line:90%
what we don't want?

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:48.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:50.398 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel in our
political arenas--

00:14:50.398 --> 00:14:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>> It is time to know that
extraterrestrials have been

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:55.320 align:middle line:84%
with us for many
years upon your nows,

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:58.400 align:middle line:84%
your Earth timeline you
are all experiencing now,

00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.790 align:middle line:90%
that you've been in interaction.

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:01.980 align:middle line:84%
They have offered
many idea inventions

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.660 align:middle line:84%
in different ways, hidden away
because of fear, of course.

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:06.910 align:middle line:90%
But that was part of the game.

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:08.400 align:middle line:90%
We understood that.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And now to know
that you are, hm,

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.500 align:middle line:84%
part of the whole, part of
the one, part of the all,

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:16.410 align:middle line:84%
to join the idea in the
galactic idea of federation

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:18.210 align:middle line:90%
in that idea of words.

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:19.010 align:middle line:90%
Make sense?

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Makes sense.

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:22.740 align:middle line:84%
>> So the disclosure happens in
its perfect timing to different

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.980 align:middle line:84%
ideal whistleblowers and
politicians to bring it out

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:29.178 align:middle line:90%
and say, yes, there is this.

00:15:29.178 --> 00:15:30.720 align:middle line:84%
There is that, and
this has happened,

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.900 align:middle line:84%
and that has happened,
and it will come out.

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Then there will be some
friction-- we all know that--

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:39.790 align:middle line:84%
and that idea during
that transitional stage.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:42.990 align:middle line:84%
But then we will know, cool,
we're a part of a whole.

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:43.990 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:46.110 align:middle line:90%
And the awakening continues.

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:50.070 align:middle line:84%
Mass idea contact or first
contact, in your terms,

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:52.470 align:middle line:84%
and you've had many first
contacts with humans

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:55.710 align:middle line:84%
all over the Earth, but we're
talking in a mass awareness

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:58.680 align:middle line:84%
level, where all of
humanity will be introduced

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.710 align:middle line:84%
to an alien species when
the collective whole is

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:06.450 align:middle line:84%
ready for that, moving
yourself into Homo-Galacticus,

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:11.250 align:middle line:90%
being part of all that is.

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:13.980 align:middle line:84%
Connected, as you've
always been, but just chose

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:16.770 align:middle line:84%
to separate for the
experience of limitation.

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:21.870 align:middle line:84%
What a fun game to know you're
not God to know you are God.

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:25.740 align:middle line:84%
As God said, what fun is
it being God all the time?

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Ta-da.

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:30.640 align:middle line:90%
Great game.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:31.440 align:middle line:90%
Truly.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.090 align:middle line:90%
>> So it seems to be--

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:37.297 align:middle line:84%
I mean this may be my own
personal account, but I feel--

00:16:37.297 --> 00:16:38.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it anything
other than personal?

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.025 align:middle line:90%
>> It is all personal, yes.

00:16:40.025 --> 00:16:40.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.400 align:middle line:90%
There's no objective.

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm seeing the
reflection in others.

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:44.730 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:49.670 align:middle line:84%
That there are many
people sort of having

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:53.570 align:middle line:84%
this exponential awakening,
including Roxie herself--

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:55.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.790 align:middle line:84%
>> --from the realization,
oh, reptilians are amongst us,

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:01.280 align:middle line:84%
to they're bad to now
they're not so bad,

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.530 align:middle line:84%
and now we're all sort
of this one happy family.

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And all of this very fast
awakening of awakening,

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:10.190 align:middle line:90%
I guess.

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:11.273 align:middle line:90%
And it seems to be quite--

00:17:11.273 --> 00:17:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's taken a long
time to get to this now.

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:14.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>> But the 2012 awakening,
triggered by the harmonic

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:23.660 align:middle line:84%
convergence in 1987, spawning
the new ideas of the birthing

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.839 align:middle line:84%
old guard is what a lot of them
was deemed an idea in those

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:30.470 align:middle line:84%
days to move and start
to shake things up--

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:32.210 align:middle line:90%
Earth Day, hm?

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:34.760 align:middle line:90%
More ideas of recycling, hm?

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:38.420 align:middle line:84%
More ideas of holistic foods
and movement in whatever,

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:41.120 align:middle line:84%
say this, say that,
do this, do that.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.810 align:middle line:84%
Getting people to move, to
care, to shake themselves up

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:47.870 align:middle line:84%
out of the humdrum of the nows
that they were birthed with,

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:50.450 align:middle line:84%
to say no to this
and nay to that,

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:55.520 align:middle line:84%
and now leaving to the idea of
what you guys call your 2012

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:56.430 align:middle line:90%
great awakening.

00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:57.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:01.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And then you've all been
waiting for it, and it's here.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And through your own
idea perceptions,

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.430 align:middle line:84%
you can see the accelerated
repetivity of it, truly,

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:08.210 align:middle line:84%
and it's only going
to get faster.

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Things are getting
exciting, so much fun

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.460 align:middle line:84%
to perceive in the
next few nows to come.

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:14.510 align:middle line:90%
Truly.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:17.090 align:middle line:90%
>> The idea of--

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:21.470 align:middle line:84%
I can-- the acceptance
for gays, lesbians,

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:23.810 align:middle line:90%
transgenders in our society--

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:24.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Big time in the '80s.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:25.820 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people died.

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:27.230 align:middle line:84%
A lot of punishments,
a lot of hate it.

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:28.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it was.

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of seeing what
they were to understand

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:32.870 align:middle line:90%
that's a human.

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:33.787 align:middle line:90%
That can't be a human.

00:18:33.787 --> 00:18:36.350 align:middle line:84%
I hate that human, so I
have to punish that human,

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:38.300 align:middle line:84%
because I represent
God, the god of anger.

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.960 align:middle line:90%
Hm.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.780 align:middle line:90%
Working what?

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Working it out, understanding,
and that represents to others.

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And now gay, transgender,
lesbian are out and about,

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:52.370 align:middle line:90%
accepted.

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:53.560 align:middle line:90%
Because what are we?

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:54.360 align:middle line:90%
Humans--

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.750 align:middle line:10%
>> --hanging out, having a good
time on this Earth vacation,

00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:01.190 align:middle line:10%
truly, to experience what it
is to be a human in this space

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:05.950 align:middle line:10%
time now, all serving a
purpose to evolve the species.

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:06.780 align:middle line:90%
Make sense?

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:07.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:13.076 align:middle line:84%
And I was going-- going
to ask if that idea is--

00:19:13.076 --> 00:19:17.090 align:middle line:84%
and maybe in other
worlds as well, is it--

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:21.470 align:middle line:84%
I feel that it's leading
us towards the disclosure

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:25.850 align:middle line:84%
of the intergalactic
Homo-Galacticus state of being,

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:28.430 align:middle line:84%
because we have to
first accept ourselves

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:32.930 align:middle line:84%
before we can accept our alien
families or our ET families.

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:39.260 align:middle line:84%
So is that also represented
in other civilizations

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:44.780 align:middle line:84%
in a similar sort of
evolutionary acceptance

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:46.290 align:middle line:90%
as that--

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:47.090 align:middle line:90%
does not work?

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:47.290 align:middle line:90%


00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:48.290 align:middle line:90%
>> How does it-- it is--

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:50.960 align:middle line:84%
is it like that on
other civilizations?

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.240 align:middle line:10%
>> My name's Sylvester.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:52.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.160 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.230 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Sylvester.

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it like that on
other civilizations?

00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:01.090 align:middle line:10%
If-- let's call it like this.

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:03.460 align:middle line:10%
I'm playing a game of
Monopoly, and I get

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:05.338 align:middle line:10%
to write my rules of Monopoly.

00:20:05.338 --> 00:20:07.630 align:middle line:10%
I get to pick my money, and
I tell all my friends, hey,

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:08.380 align:middle line:10%
I got a new game.

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.672 align:middle line:10%
It's called Monopoly, and
here's this, and here's that,

00:20:10.672 --> 00:20:12.130 align:middle line:10%
and that's the
game and the thing.

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Does it exist on that,
if that idea, idea over

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:18.670 align:middle line:84%
there planet
co-creation reality,

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:20.200 align:middle line:90%
and that's the rules, yeah.

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.130 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:22.900 align:middle line:84%
>> But is it in the
same context as this?

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:23.410 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:23.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:26.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Because every now is new
from a different perspective

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:26.940 align:middle line:90%
of the now.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And in that idea, that now is
perceived in such an individual

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.985 align:middle line:84%
singularity way, it
cannot be repeated,

00:20:32.985 --> 00:20:35.193 align:middle line:84%
because every time you look
at it again from the same

00:20:35.193 --> 00:20:37.140 align:middle line:84%
perspective of now,
you're still a new you.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.230 align:middle line:90%
You're always evolving.

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:39.760 align:middle line:90%
You're always becoming larger.

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.500 align:middle line:84%
So other games are played
with polarity-- yes.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:43.300 align:middle line:90%
At this level?

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:44.950 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:46.750 align:middle line:90%
This is 100% separation.

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:49.902 align:middle line:84%
There's ideas of evolution,
birthing of a species,

00:20:49.902 --> 00:20:51.610 align:middle line:84%
understanding it
through the construction

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:53.170 align:middle line:84%
that it was built
upon to understand

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:55.990 align:middle line:84%
within the boundaries of
that, like a dog's not

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:58.180 align:middle line:84%
going to get up
and start typing,

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.130 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
structure of an idea dog.

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:00.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>> So put a dog on this species
or this species in the idea

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:05.530 align:middle line:84%
of the structure to
see where that goes.

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.030 align:middle line:84%
Then you get to
go into that world

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:10.570 align:middle line:84%
and explore it to see the
endless possibilities of it.

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:11.370 align:middle line:90%
Make sense?

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:11.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Kind of like the Zetas
played out their game.

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:14.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:16.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And now the Zetas go,
OK, time to shift the game.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:17.517 align:middle line:90%
I need some human DNA.

00:21:17.517 --> 00:21:18.317 align:middle line:90%
Bingo.

00:21:18.317 --> 00:21:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Where humanity says,
we're on board.

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:21.080 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And now we got this
new idea, the Essassani

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:24.880 align:middle line:90%
and different ideas off of that.

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:25.680 align:middle line:90%
Make sense?

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:25.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:26.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:30.190 align:middle line:84%
>> So with this acceptance,
because now it is a--

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:33.730 align:middle line:84%
even on our government
federal levels and definitely

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:38.343 align:middle line:84%
individuals, for me, for several
years, but on a government

00:21:38.343 --> 00:21:39.760 align:middle line:84%
status, and their
government seems

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.620 align:middle line:84%
to represent the collective
in a lot of ways.

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:43.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Even though--

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:44.600 align:middle line:90%
>> They don't.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:45.040 align:middle line:90%
>> --it may not.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:45.998 align:middle line:90%
Even though they don't.

00:21:45.998 --> 00:21:47.370 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:49.490 align:middle line:84%
>> But that's the game
you're playing right now.

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:50.890 align:middle line:90%
And that's going to shift.

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:54.420 align:middle line:84%
That idea of government
becomes administrative.

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:57.550 align:middle line:84%
>> And then moving that into a
political arena right now with

00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:01.950 align:middle line:84%
upcoming elections, you
see such a polarity with--

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:02.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Huge.

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>> --especially with--
and I'll say the names--

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:06.220 align:middle line:90%
Trump and Sanders.

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:07.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems like Hillary's
sort of falling to the wayside

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:11.170 align:middle line:90%
at the moment.

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:11.970 align:middle line:90%
>> For now.

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>> For now, which, again,
these two entities,

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:21.530 align:middle line:84%
energies are representations
of the people.

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:22.330 align:middle line:90%
I feel--

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:23.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Of love and fear, truly.

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:24.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:27.745 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a
drastic polarity.

00:22:27.745 --> 00:22:29.520 align:middle line:84%
>> To see the
choices in the now.

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:33.410 align:middle line:90%
>> And that coming into--

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:34.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Mass awareness.

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:34.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Mass awareness.

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:35.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Bingo.

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:36.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Mass awareness.

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Truly.

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:39.430 align:middle line:90%
It's epic times coming.

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So all of this,
I guess, are signs.

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:44.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm having this
conversation and sort

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.670 align:middle line:84%
of coming to the
realization that all of this

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:50.000 align:middle line:84%
is just signs of the big
D, the big disclosure day.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:50.800 align:middle line:10%
So--

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:51.758 align:middle line:10%
>> Everything's coming.

00:22:51.758 --> 00:22:54.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Once we get into the--

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:55.580 align:middle line:10%
to that.

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:59.890 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to go back to
a lot of the teachings,

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:02.020 align:middle line:84%
probably from
Sylvester and Ocyphius,

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:05.230 align:middle line:84%
about our individual
reality bubbles,

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:09.160 align:middle line:84%
if you could maybe elaborate
on that idea and how that--

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Tommy will be
here to higher self,

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:14.620 align:middle line:84%
kind of described
in a great way,

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:19.490 align:middle line:84%
so Roxie got in that co-creative
realities, the description.

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:21.790 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
give you an idea.

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:25.540 align:middle line:10%
Every idea individual
now is a perceived focus

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:30.360 align:middle line:10%
of that now to receive
itself an expression reality.

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.440 align:middle line:10%
And it all shifts very
now, so right now,

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.960 align:middle line:10%
this is a film strip that
you can't see the strip.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.770 align:middle line:10%
You're shifting
billions of Earths.

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:36.840 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:37.670 align:middle line:10%
Don't let--

00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:38.680 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a high speed.

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:40.470 align:middle line:90%
>> It's very high speed.

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:41.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Flash.

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.430 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:46.000 align:middle line:90%
So say this is the higher self.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.410 align:middle line:90%
I'll use this Roxie's body.

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And Roxie is the skin
on this fingertip,

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:57.580 align:middle line:84%
so to understand an expression
of Roxie, the energy behind it

00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:59.140 align:middle line:90%
creates Roxie.

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:03.130 align:middle line:84%
Roxie goes out
and feels reality.

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:04.630 align:middle line:10%
She's a dream.

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:07.203 align:middle line:10%
She's being dreamt of, truly.

00:24:07.203 --> 00:24:08.620 align:middle line:10%
And that idea of
the higher self--

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:13.070 align:middle line:10%
so Roxie co-creates
with you and this now.

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:15.610 align:middle line:10%


00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:17.950 align:middle line:10%
Do you see an
entire Earth there?

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:18.970 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:20.848 align:middle line:84%
You see two people
co-creating in the now.

00:24:20.848 --> 00:24:22.390 align:middle line:84%
Tommy's here, so
that's three people.

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:24.343 align:middle line:10%
Now when you guys
tune in, it's the same

00:24:24.343 --> 00:24:26.260 align:middle line:10%
now from a different
perspective of the people

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:30.130 align:middle line:10%
out there watching, all
focusing on this moment.

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:34.600 align:middle line:84%
Now look at all these
individual parts of you--

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.730 align:middle line:84%
the higher self, or you
can go with the standpoint

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:37.530 align:middle line:90%
of oversoul.

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:39.100 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:41.530 align:middle line:10%
All of them are having
individual singularities,

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:45.940 align:middle line:10%
portions of you having
experiences with co-creation.

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.050 align:middle line:10%
There's no one Earth.

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:48.310 align:middle line:10%
There's billions.

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:51.790 align:middle line:10%
It's so unique, and what's
created in every single

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:54.990 align:middle line:10%
now is the memory.

00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:57.940 align:middle line:10%
And now creates the
past and the future.

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:00.540 align:middle line:10%
So you're in this timeline.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.520 align:middle line:10%
Roxie jumps over to
this timeline, and then

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:04.600 align:middle line:10%
this timeline,
and this timeline.

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.770 align:middle line:10%
In every moment,
it seems perfect,

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:09.310 align:middle line:10%
because she gives herself
the memory of that now.

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:10.290 align:middle line:90%
Make sense?

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:11.580 align:middle line:90%
>> The memory of that now.

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:12.610 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Of the now of the
expression that she's choosing.

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:19.050 align:middle line:84%
So this is actually, in some
times, playing out tomorrow.

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:20.920 align:middle line:84%
But we're giving our
service of tomorrow.

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.760 align:middle line:90%
This is playing out today.

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.480 align:middle line:90%
Me and you just went to lunch.

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:28.550 align:middle line:84%
We came back and co-created
again in this now,

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:30.420 align:middle line:84%
but we actually
got here just now

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:32.070 align:middle line:84%
and gave ourselves
the memory of time

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:35.640 align:middle line:84%
passed between when we filmed
this morning and lunch now.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.520 align:middle line:84%
But we actually didn't spend
all of that time in that

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.590 align:middle line:90%
now in what?

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:42.120 align:middle line:90%
Physical reality.

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.620 align:middle line:90%
We only spend a portion of it.

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Then we give
ourselves the memory

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.850 align:middle line:84%
that we actually spend
every single second here.

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:48.810 align:middle line:90%
That's one aspect.

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:49.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:52.770 align:middle line:10%
>> But the uniqueness of
the nows are so individual,

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:54.210 align:middle line:10%
but you give
yourself, in memory,

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:56.400 align:middle line:10%
the experience of
the entire Earth,

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.520 align:middle line:10%
and it's all one big Earth.

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:00.970 align:middle line:90%
It's your choice.

00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:03.360 align:middle line:84%
The vibration of you and
what you validate and every

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.030 align:middle line:84%
now becomes your
world in continuation.

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:09.550 align:middle line:10%
The more you understand what
is and is not about yourself,

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:11.910 align:middle line:10%
the more evolution of
the natural higher self

00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:16.170 align:middle line:10%
comes through to you, and
your whole world changes.

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:19.080 align:middle line:84%
So disclosure doesn't happen
to happen on your world.

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.960 align:middle line:84%
You could have had all
this stuff 20 years ago.

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:26.615 align:middle line:10%
You can change anything and
everything, according to you.

00:26:26.615 --> 00:26:28.740 align:middle line:84%
Now a lot of things the
Human Collective as a whole

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:31.470 align:middle line:84%
does not want to change, because
the evolution of it is free

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:34.440 align:middle line:84%
will choice amongst
the entire bubble--

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:37.140 align:middle line:90%
a billion people, as you said--

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:39.150 align:middle line:84%
all joining together
to understand

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:41.380 align:middle line:90%
this evolution of a species.

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:43.500 align:middle line:10%
The species is
evolving, so it's going

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:50.160 align:middle line:10%
to stay within a contextual
flow to seamlessly understand

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:55.090 align:middle line:10%
time for the experience
of the evolution.

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:56.880 align:middle line:84%
But each individual
has that choice,

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:59.552 align:middle line:84%
whether they want to hang out
or not and how they hang out

00:26:59.552 --> 00:27:01.260 align:middle line:84%
and how they see it
and how they perceive

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:04.210 align:middle line:84%
it is all individual,
making up the entire thing

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:05.820 align:middle line:90%
of a whole Earth.

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:06.910 align:middle line:90%
Make sense?

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:07.710 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm--

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:08.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Keep going.

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.350 align:middle line:84%
>> I'll probably have
to-- as I'm editing this,

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:13.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to watch this a
million times to really digest

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:13.440 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:13.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>> But the--

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:16.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Here, let me give
you this right here.

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:17.070 align:middle line:90%
You see this backyard?

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:18.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Anything you can't
see is not over there.

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:22.167 align:middle line:90%
The street is not over there.

00:27:22.167 --> 00:27:23.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I understand that.

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:23.930 align:middle line:90%
>> That's not over there.

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:24.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:26.160 align:middle line:90%
>> France is not over there.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.850 align:middle line:90%
England is not over there.

00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:30.430 align:middle line:84%
The only Earth that me and
you and Tom are experiencing

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:31.230 align:middle line:90%
is this.

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:32.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And we get to shoot at-- we
create in the nows as we go.

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And whoever we choose to
co-create with is that Earth,

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:40.710 align:middle line:84%
so whatever you hear,
the diarrhea of them

00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:43.320 align:middle line:84%
outside breathing down
your neck about what it is,

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.945 align:middle line:84%
it's your choice to
accept that or not.

00:27:44.945 --> 00:27:45.745 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:45.745 --> 00:27:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>> And as soon as you
accept that portion,

00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:51.870 align:middle line:84%
that idea of validation of
fear, you're accepting a portion

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:55.720 align:middle line:84%
of reality that is fear-based
over your own self.

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:59.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Truly, think about it.

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:01.830 align:middle line:84%
Your natural state
of being, your love--

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:05.550 align:middle line:90%
you can't be anything but love.

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:08.410 align:middle line:84%
Everything is created
as unconditional love.

00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:09.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:12.420 align:middle line:10%
>> You can't be anything
except what the creation is--

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:15.180 align:middle line:10%
unconditional love,
the state of being,

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:17.460 align:middle line:10%
not the emotional contact,
the state of being.

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:21.960 align:middle line:84%
That's what you are--
vibrating signature all times.

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.570 align:middle line:84%
Through energetic
idea of expressions,

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:30.300 align:middle line:84%
we create creation,
species, ideas, galaxies,

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:33.510 align:middle line:84%
dimensions you guys
can't even comprehend,

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:37.680 align:middle line:84%
colors that you can't see
that are colors in your idea

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:38.940 align:middle line:90%
spectrum at this time.

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:40.990 align:middle line:90%
Different ideas come in.

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:43.470 align:middle line:84%
So in that, we create,
and through that idea

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:45.300 align:middle line:84%
of this objective
universe, you're

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:47.310 align:middle line:90%
living in an idea of fear.

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:49.920 align:middle line:84%
So that fear is the
coveting idea since birth,

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:53.370 align:middle line:84%
and you understand what
fear is, because that's all

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:55.300 align:middle line:90%
you've been fed from day one.

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:58.770 align:middle line:10%
But as you evolve, you have
that pounding inside of you,

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:01.780 align:middle line:10%
that idea discernment that
says, that's bullshit.

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:03.690 align:middle line:10%
And you get mad at
it, and it perceived

00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:06.840 align:middle line:10%
lack and different ideas
of guilt and obligation,

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.240 align:middle line:10%
responsibility, things that
just don't jive with you,

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:11.400 align:middle line:10%
but you choose it,
because you're afraid.

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:15.270 align:middle line:84%
Not your fault. But
that's the species idea.

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:17.220 align:middle line:90%
That's the species of humanity.

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:18.960 align:middle line:90%
It's not you.

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:22.600 align:middle line:84%
You're already God, the
individual singularity.

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:25.080 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at the
idea of fear from the TV--

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:25.900 align:middle line:90%
what about this?

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:26.700 align:middle line:90%
What about that?

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:27.570 align:middle line:90%
What about that?

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:28.560 align:middle line:90%
You accept that.

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:31.230 align:middle line:84%
That becomes your
reality, because that's

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:34.020 align:middle line:84%
the vibrational acceptance
that you're allowing in

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:36.840 align:middle line:84%
as a valid idea,
so in co-creation

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:41.160 align:middle line:84%
on your individual Earths,
you get that timeline.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.980 align:middle line:90%
But this person won't.

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:47.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So this getting to
the co-creation idea,

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:50.730 align:middle line:84%
and we have relationships
with family and friends and--

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:51.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Only in that now.

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.137 align:middle line:90%
>> Only in that now.

00:29:53.137 --> 00:29:53.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Only in that now.

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:55.980 align:middle line:84%
The memory of your
family being there

00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:59.100 align:middle line:84%
is what you perceive
them as in the now.

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.888 align:middle line:10%
So if, in other words, you have
a problem with a family member,

00:30:01.888 --> 00:30:03.430 align:middle line:10%
because they're this
way or that way,

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:04.830 align:middle line:10%
as soon as they come
into your world, then

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:06.205 align:middle line:10%
you perceive them
in that, that's

00:30:06.205 --> 00:30:09.510 align:middle line:10%
the version you get of that
co-created world in that now.

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:10.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:11.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Make sense?

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:16.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So in order to get the
version of the family that we

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:17.190 align:middle line:90%
desire--

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:18.060 align:middle line:90%
>> You've got to change.

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:18.900 align:middle line:90%
>> We have to change.

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:19.700 align:middle line:90%
>> You.

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:22.690 align:middle line:84%
You cannot idealize them
in that way anymore,

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:25.050 align:middle line:84%
which means you're idealizing
yourself in that way.

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:25.600 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>> You understand that
you're judging them.

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:27.480 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.330 align:middle line:90%
Because they did this.

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:28.370 align:middle line:90%
They did this.

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:28.790 align:middle line:90%
They did this.

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:30.720 align:middle line:84%
They did this, and you get
mad, and you get angry,

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.490 align:middle line:84%
and you want revenge,
and you're like, stop it.

00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:33.030 align:middle line:90%
I hate you.

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:33.390 align:middle line:90%
Blah.

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:34.410 align:middle line:90%
You're doing this to me.

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:35.410 align:middle line:90%
And you understand that.

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And that goes for
anything-- coworkers,

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:39.090 align:middle line:90%
lovers, ex-lovers, whatever.

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:42.690 align:middle line:10%
But that is an idea of you
judging yourself in creation.

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:45.390 align:middle line:10%
To understand that's a lost
god that actually chose

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:50.160 align:middle line:10%
the bravery of being a
lost idea god in humanity,

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:53.610 align:middle line:10%
so honorship is in
play in one way.

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:56.670 align:middle line:84%
The idea of charity, which
is compassion, in another way

00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:58.960 align:middle line:84%
to view them is
doing their best.

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:01.990 align:middle line:84%
There's no not best of
every self from the now.

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:03.960 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is doing
the best they can.

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:06.360 align:middle line:84%
They can't choose the
worst of themselves.

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:09.240 align:middle line:84%
They only, in their
subjective universe,

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.310 align:middle line:90%
can only idealize themself.

00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:13.380 align:middle line:84%
That idea now is
the best choice.

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:14.850 align:middle line:84%
But of course,
people make choices,

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:16.050 align:middle line:84%
and then regret
comes in and says,

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:17.425 align:middle line:84%
damn, I shouldn't
have done that.

00:31:17.425 --> 00:31:19.380 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you should've,
because without that, you

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:21.990 align:middle line:84%
don't have the realization
of what you're not.

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:23.850 align:middle line:84%
So when you covet
that idea belief

00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:26.760 align:middle line:84%
system of the fear-based
ideas and the reptilians

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:30.150 align:middle line:84%
and doing that, then you, on
your individual singularity

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:33.100 align:middle line:84%
Earth that goes down this
timeline becomes your reality.

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:33.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Or bullshit,
I'm going this way.

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:39.060 align:middle line:84%
And that co-creation
with all those people

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:41.430 align:middle line:84%
on this timeline that are
vibrating at the frequency--

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:42.810 align:middle line:90%
you get that version.

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:43.660 align:middle line:90%
Your parents change.

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:44.460 align:middle line:90%
People change.

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:45.418 align:middle line:90%
The government changes.

00:31:45.418 --> 00:31:47.550 align:middle line:84%
The world changes,
because you change.

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:49.030 align:middle line:10%
It's a mirror.

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:49.830 align:middle line:90%
You smile.

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:50.700 align:middle line:90%
The mirror smiles.

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:51.840 align:middle line:90%
It can work no other way.

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:52.540 align:middle line:90%
It is a law.

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:54.123 align:middle line:84%
What you put out is
what you get back.

00:31:54.123 --> 00:31:57.820 align:middle line:84%
It cannot be overridden,
ignored, or amended.

00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:58.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Amended.

00:31:58.620 --> 00:31:59.130 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:59.130 --> 00:31:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Make sense?

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:00.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:02.430 align:middle line:84%
>> It is so beautiful--
the simplicity of universe,

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:03.690 align:middle line:90%
how it works.

00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:05.610 align:middle line:84%
But it is so hard
to understand that

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:08.280 align:middle line:84%
from the standpoint of
thousands and thousands

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:10.950 align:middle line:84%
upon thousands of millennia
of collapsed timelines,

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:14.640 align:middle line:84%
of humans, co-creation
to understand this idea

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.413 align:middle line:90%
that it can be a different way.

00:32:16.413 --> 00:32:18.830 align:middle line:84%
So through this evolution, you
give yourself breadcrumbs--

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:23.310 align:middle line:84%
this and that and ideas,
and Tommy loves the show,

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:25.980 align:middle line:84%
"Ancient Aliens," and all
this stuff that you look,

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:27.060 align:middle line:90%
and you can't--

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:30.220 align:middle line:84%
you can't-- you just
can't deny it anymore.

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:32.670 align:middle line:10%
So that's my idea,
and here we are,

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:36.630 align:middle line:10%
knowing that you had no
gods to a lot of gods

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:39.870 align:middle line:10%
to one big, angry god
to I can go to God

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:44.670 align:middle line:10%
through the god's son, and
now, holy shit, I'm God.

00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:47.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm the individual
part of the whole.

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:49.410 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it is.

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And then in that now
realization, you wake up.

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:52.710 align:middle line:90%
You understand.

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:55.200 align:middle line:90%
You look at choices of the now.

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.580 align:middle line:84%
Even when you're
awake, you still

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:58.260 align:middle line:84%
fear, because it's
encouched in you.

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And you go through
your ideas now

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.220 align:middle line:84%
of understanding what
you choose about yourself

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:03.960 align:middle line:90%
that is or is not.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:06.540 align:middle line:10%
And when you see fear,
it's a choice to choose it

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:09.760 align:middle line:10%
or not, to energize
it or let it go.

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:10.560 align:middle line:90%
Make sense?

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:11.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Makes sense.

00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:12.690 align:middle line:90%
So if we have--

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:19.010 align:middle line:84%
for example, we have a family
member, a loved one that is--

00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:21.930 align:middle line:84%
and we release our judgments
of their belief system.

00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:24.680 align:middle line:90%
We allow them to pursue--

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:25.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Whatever they choose.

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:26.763 align:middle line:90%
>> --whatever they choose.

00:33:26.763 --> 00:33:27.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:30.465 align:middle line:84%
>> But yet we choose
a different path.

00:33:30.465 --> 00:33:33.195 align:middle line:90%


00:33:33.195 --> 00:33:34.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Let them go.

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:34.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:35.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Let them go.

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:39.270 align:middle line:10%
>> So that's why I'm
getting to is, is it--

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:41.550 align:middle line:10%
does it come to that, finally,
where we just have to--

00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:42.150 align:middle line:10%
>> Sometimes a little.

00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:42.780 align:middle line:90%
>> --let them go?

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:43.170 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:44.670 align:middle line:84%
>> It depends on
each individual.

00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:45.890 align:middle line:90%
It won't be a blanket idea.

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:46.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:49.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Always remember,
humanity, do not blanket,

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:51.870 align:middle line:84%
because we're so used
to but they did that,

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:53.840 align:middle line:84%
and I remember
when they-- and oh,

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:56.490 align:middle line:84%
and you put your
ideas in comfort,

00:33:56.490 --> 00:34:00.090 align:middle line:84%
because you don't want to be
left out and be a solo act.

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:03.210 align:middle line:84%
So you put yourself in
comforting ideas of others

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:07.470 align:middle line:84%
that we did that or they did
that, but we-- and that-- no.

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:09.570 align:middle line:84%
That idea is you're
going to choose,

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:11.040 align:middle line:84%
and if that family
member chooses,

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.830 align:middle line:90%
that's only your world.

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:14.000 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about the rest.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.460 align:middle line:90%
It won't happen to everyone.

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:17.670 align:middle line:84%
It's all going to be
individual singularities.

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:20.040 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, is your
mother or your father

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:23.517 align:middle line:84%
is your lover and your
sister on another timeline.

00:34:23.517 --> 00:34:24.600 align:middle line:90%
They're part of the whole.

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:27.059 align:middle line:84%
They're part-- they've
played many different roles.

00:34:27.059 --> 00:34:29.159 align:middle line:84%
You guys are on this
big stage of Earth,

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:32.197 align:middle line:84%
and you're all actors, and you
get your idea script that's

00:34:32.197 --> 00:34:33.989 align:middle line:84%
written in the moment,
and you play a role,

00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:35.239 align:middle line:90%
and go and play that role out.

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And your best friend
says, OK, this time,

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be this, and
you're going to be that.

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:40.443 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say, OK,
I'm going to set it up.

00:34:40.443 --> 00:34:42.913 align:middle line:84%
And you get in and set it up,
and you jump into the game.

00:34:42.913 --> 00:34:43.830 align:middle line:90%
And that kind of idea.

00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:46.220 align:middle line:84%
So don't harbor any ill will
toward your own best friend.

00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I'm--

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:48.103 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I'm not saying you.

00:34:48.103 --> 00:34:49.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm giving you the idea.

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:49.920 align:middle line:90%
>> I understand.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:52.389 align:middle line:84%
>> But I am saying
you in some realities.

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:55.120 align:middle line:10%
>> But yeah, I'm sure there
is versions of me that--

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:55.929 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:34:55.929 --> 00:35:00.160 align:middle line:84%
So what happens--
if you feel guilty,

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.210 align:middle line:84%
because you're obligated--
even if it's a parent.

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:03.670 align:middle line:90%
OK, they gave you life, yeah?

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:04.470 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:06.580 align:middle line:90%
But you chose each other.

00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:09.830 align:middle line:10%
But if they gave you life, and
you use that as an excuse to--

00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:12.040 align:middle line:10%
you feel guilty and
obligated to them,

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:14.620 align:middle line:10%
then you're going
to keep your walls

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:18.310 align:middle line:10%
of your self-imposed
prison very strong.

00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:21.350 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to be
guilty about being birthed.

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:22.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.820 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:23.620 align:middle line:10%
And not only that.

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:26.290 align:middle line:10%
You were already chosen
to exist forever,

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:31.660 align:middle line:10%
so you can never unexist, so
you got that going for you.

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:33.280 align:middle line:84%
So you exist always--
just whatever

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:35.470 align:middle line:84%
you're choosing to
perceive in the now.

00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:38.380 align:middle line:10%
So when that idea,
that obligation idea

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:42.430 align:middle line:10%
is not a responsibility
for you to feed,

00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:44.080 align:middle line:10%
because they're
their own god that

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:49.325 align:middle line:10%
looks for ideas of self-love
in a way of acceptance.

00:35:49.325 --> 00:35:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't get it from
the kids and this and that,

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:52.650 align:middle line:90%
they may try to--

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:56.276 align:middle line:84%
there's a whole bunch of games
coming on of this beautiful--

00:35:56.276 --> 00:36:00.970 align:middle line:84%
it's expressionless on
how many beautiful ways

00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:02.890 align:middle line:90%
humanity has understood itself.

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:05.600 align:middle line:90%
It's just gorgeous, truly.

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:08.080 align:middle line:10%
So if you're feeling guilty
about letting someone out

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:11.730 align:middle line:10%
of your life, understand
you don't need to.

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:13.420 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I understand.

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And I guess my question is,
because I always thought that,

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:20.540 align:middle line:84%
as you mentioned before, that
the shift comes from within.

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:24.162 align:middle line:84%
So if you shift your point
of view on what reality is--

00:36:24.162 --> 00:36:25.112 align:middle line:90%
>> Bingo.

00:36:25.112 --> 00:36:27.070 align:middle line:84%
>> --and then, like you
said, you see the shift

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:31.013 align:middle line:84%
in the others, but sometimes
we don't see the shift.

00:36:31.013 --> 00:36:32.680 align:middle line:84%
If we don't see the
shift in the others,

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:34.660 align:middle line:84%
does that mean we haven't
shifted ourselves?

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, no.

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:36.340 align:middle line:10%
You will eventually.

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:37.210 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:38.780 align:middle line:10%
>> As you evolve.

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:40.150 align:middle line:90%
There's a frequency range.

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:42.820 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's just give
it a humanity from,

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:44.665 align:middle line:84%
let's say, we'll give
you a nice number

00:36:44.665 --> 00:36:46.290 align:middle line:84%
so you don't think
too much about this.

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:50.020 align:middle line:84%
So we'll give you
between 25 and 50.

00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:52.480 align:middle line:90%
So you got 25 points of degrees.

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.550 align:middle line:84%
You have a co-created
frequency band

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:58.510 align:middle line:84%
that people in that same
frequency can't co-create.

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:01.947 align:middle line:84%
But below that 25, they can't
be in your here and now,

00:37:01.947 --> 00:37:04.030 align:middle line:84%
because you're vibrating
at a different frequency.

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:06.010 align:middle line:90%
They can't even see you.

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:08.260 align:middle line:10%
There's a whole bunch
of everythings going on

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:09.220 align:middle line:10%
right here and now.

00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:10.020 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a star
system over there.

00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:13.360 align:middle line:90%
There's a planet right there.

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:14.860 align:middle line:90%
There's an alien right there.

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:17.210 align:middle line:84%
There's a civilization
of another galaxy.

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:19.820 align:middle line:84%
There's another dent--
it's all right here.

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:20.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So they walk through
you, if you want to put it.

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:25.450 align:middle line:84%
They are on the
idea of their own

00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:28.018 align:middle line:84%
here and now in
the here and now.

00:37:28.018 --> 00:37:29.560 align:middle line:84%
So they're not on
the same frequency.

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:32.510 align:middle line:84%
They can't even co-create
with you anymore.

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:34.250 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes you don't
even remember.

00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:35.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Mm-hm.

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:36.940 align:middle line:10%
>> You give yourself a
whole new memory of not even

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:38.560 align:middle line:10%
understanding that
set of parents,

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:41.170 align:middle line:10%
and you have this set of
parents in this life as you.

00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:42.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Great explanation.

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:43.872 align:middle line:90%
I definitely have--

00:37:43.872 --> 00:37:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, get a little
bit more into that.

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:46.955 align:middle line:84%
>> --a much better
understanding.

00:37:46.955 --> 00:37:50.740 align:middle line:10%
>> You'll understand that in--

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.840 align:middle line:10%
you'll understand
that the uniqueness

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:55.530 align:middle line:10%
of co-created
realities, to a point

00:37:55.530 --> 00:38:01.540 align:middle line:10%
there, fear would be silly,
because it's your world.

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And what you choose
in the now that

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.500 align:middle line:84%
is your world according
to your vibration,

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:07.870 align:middle line:90%
you can only get that.

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:11.390 align:middle line:10%
So when you feed the idea of
mere fear by action in fear--

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:14.650 align:middle line:10%
now I'm going to get
to that in a second.

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:18.010 align:middle line:84%
Then you're going to
get a probable realities

00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:20.440 align:middle line:84%
of that fear-based reality
you're conjuring up

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:23.800 align:middle line:84%
through the idea of other
people offering you a change.

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.810 align:middle line:84%
Listen, everybody
is servicing you.

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:28.900 align:middle line:84%
They're servicing you
to choose what you are,

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:31.030 align:middle line:84%
not what you're not,
right back to the idea.

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:33.550 align:middle line:84%
I need to know that
I'm all that is

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:36.040 align:middle line:90%
individual singularity of love.

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.160 align:middle line:84%
I can't be fear, but I'm giving
myself the illusion of fear

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:40.660 align:middle line:90%
to experience fear.

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:43.330 align:middle line:84%
But through the evolution,
I realize that I'm not

00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:45.730 align:middle line:90%
God to realize that I am God.

00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:47.350 align:middle line:84%
So now that I know
I'm God, I still

00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:49.510 align:middle line:84%
have all these
vibrations of co-creation

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:52.270 align:middle line:84%
through the idea
of humanity built

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:53.960 align:middle line:90%
in the algorithm of humanity.

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:56.810 align:middle line:84%
Just the word "humanity"
is encouched in fear,

00:38:56.810 --> 00:38:59.900 align:middle line:84%
so that's where your reality
is-- polarity-- up, down, left,

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:04.540 align:middle line:84%
right, measure, weights,
scales, this, that.

00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:07.750 align:middle line:84%
So in that understanding,
I'm seeing that I always have

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:10.420 align:middle line:90%
a choice to understand myself.

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:11.450 align:middle line:90%
That's bullshit.

00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:13.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
choose that anymore.

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:16.610 align:middle line:84%
Everyone takes that idea
at one time or another,

00:39:16.610 --> 00:39:17.730 align:middle line:90%
and they give up.

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And they say, I
can't do it anymore.

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And they shift, and
it may be that small,

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:25.150 align:middle line:84%
but that's enough
to move and enough--

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:32.100 align:middle line:84%
one services always, and you got
that service by another acting

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:35.420 align:middle line:84%
upon an idea of
what they are not.

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And then you get to
see it and choose it.

00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:38.900 align:middle line:90%
I see that entity.

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:42.390 align:middle line:84%
They are causing an
idea of a bad idea.

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:45.840 align:middle line:84%
They are doing a
crime or this or that.

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:49.520 align:middle line:84%
It's not that you get
back and punish them,

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:51.890 align:middle line:90%
because they were taught lack.

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:54.420 align:middle line:84%
If you didn't have
any lack in the world,

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:56.540 align:middle line:84%
because there's enough
food, there's enough money,

00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:58.590 align:middle line:84%
if you even want to play the
money game, which you really,

00:39:58.590 --> 00:39:59.390 align:middle line:90%
truly don't.

00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:01.093 align:middle line:84%
It can be all the
idea of everyone

00:40:01.093 --> 00:40:02.510 align:middle line:84%
has whatever they
need in the now,

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:03.920 align:middle line:90%
and that's where you're going.

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:07.130 align:middle line:84%
But if there's enough
money, there's enough--

00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:08.860 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:10.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:12.580 align:middle line:90%
Food, money, shelter, every--

00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:15.528 align:middle line:90%
there's so much land.

00:40:15.528 --> 00:40:17.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean you can have your
tiny house, if you want.

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:19.510 align:middle line:90%
That's cool, you know.

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:22.130 align:middle line:90%
Everyone can have a house.

00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:23.090 align:middle line:90%
Everybody.

00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And everyone can have a big
house with a lot of land,

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.500 align:middle line:90%
because there's so much land.

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:28.770 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:31.190 align:middle line:90%
Why is there so much land?

00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:33.830 align:middle line:90%
Because it's not one Earth.

00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:35.450 align:middle line:90%
It's billions.

00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:38.360 align:middle line:84%
We can create a world
on top of worlds

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.910 align:middle line:84%
on top of worlds on top
of worlds on top of worlds

00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:42.080 align:middle line:90%
forever.

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Anyone can have whatever
they want everywhere,

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:46.040 align:middle line:90%
because there's no space.

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:49.730 align:middle line:84%
It's only an illusion of space,
and everything is here and now.

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:52.100 align:middle line:10%
So on that idea, we're
all servicing each other

00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:55.370 align:middle line:10%
by understanding ourselves to
choose differently in the now

00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:58.910 align:middle line:10%
through the built-in discernment
of your natural state

00:40:58.910 --> 00:41:00.230 align:middle line:10%
of being--

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:01.580 align:middle line:10%
love.

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And then we're choosing it, and
here comes this evolution, just

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:07.730 align:middle line:84%
screaming now, just
really shifting.

00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And people are holding
on, and, of course,

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:10.572 align:middle line:90%
what are they predicting?

00:41:10.572 --> 00:41:14.760 align:middle line:84%
Fear, economic collapse, this,
that, and all these things.

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:17.700 align:middle line:84%
But that's their interpretation
of their reality.

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:20.150 align:middle line:84%
That's what their best
self says it has to be,

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:22.460 align:middle line:84%
because they can't
see another idea.

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:26.210 align:middle line:84%
When you put on an idea
of a belief system,

00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:29.720 align:middle line:84%
that's what your idea
only focus can be.

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:31.730 align:middle line:84%
If you validate and
put your filter,

00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:34.400 align:middle line:84%
your trust through that
filter, then that's

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.080 align:middle line:90%
what's reflected in the mirror.

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:37.850 align:middle line:84%
What you put out is
what you get back.

00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:41.510 align:middle line:84%
You can't see any other way,
until a vibrational sense

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:42.620 align:middle line:90%
of now says, uh-uh.

00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:44.020 align:middle line:90%
Something's wrong here.

00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:45.600 align:middle line:90%
And here comes another--

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:47.320 align:middle line:84%
and it's encompassed
in all the now.

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:48.680 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hm.

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:53.080 align:middle line:84%
Another choice, an idea of a
higher version of yourself.

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And as you choose
that, you move.

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:57.690 align:middle line:10%
And it may take you
100,000 lifetimes.

00:41:57.690 --> 00:41:58.490 align:middle line:90%
Who cares?

00:41:58.490 --> 00:41:59.290 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:01.158 align:middle line:90%
Because it's all now.

00:42:01.158 --> 00:42:02.450 align:middle line:90%
It's done in a blink of an eye.

00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:03.740 align:middle line:90%
You've played it out already.

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:06.000 align:middle line:84%
You're just catching
it up to in time.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.540 align:middle line:10%
So if you stay in
the idea that you're

00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:14.030 align:middle line:10%
being fed idea options,
choices to say, that's real.

00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:14.900 align:middle line:10%
That's not.

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:17.180 align:middle line:10%
Now I want you all to
understand this, and go back

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:19.770 align:middle line:10%
in your memories of the
now, and think about this.

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:21.450 align:middle line:10%
How many of your
fears have come true?

00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:25.070 align:middle line:10%
How many of your beliefs are
way back there 20 years ago?

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:28.060 align:middle line:10%
How many of the things that
you are just dragging along

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:31.340 align:middle line:10%
for big gilts are big
ideas of obligation

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:33.080 align:middle line:10%
that you bring
them into the now?

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:36.650 align:middle line:10%
But it's so scary to let go,
because that's all you know.

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:37.800 align:middle line:90%
You are coveting gods.

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:38.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:40.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's why this
is the mastery class.

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:43.940 align:middle line:84%
This is the son of a bitch,
but it's the best ride of them

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:46.910 align:middle line:84%
all, because you get to
experience the emotional range

00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:49.070 align:middle line:90%
of what it is to be a human.

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:52.010 align:middle line:90%
Oh, god, it's wonderful.

00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:53.390 align:middle line:90%
You get to drink coffee.

00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:54.510 align:middle line:90%
>> oh, yes, coffee.

00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:55.310 align:middle line:90%
>> You get to--

00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:58.100 align:middle line:84%
you get to experience
life as it is.

00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And the whole collective--
you know, the people--

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:02.970 align:middle line:84%
during the awakening
of this century,

00:43:02.970 --> 00:43:05.460 align:middle line:84%
people were just ready to
be these ascended masters

00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:06.260 align:middle line:90%
and do that.

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted the
ascension to happen,

00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:10.700 align:middle line:84%
so now, ma'am, we
got 1,000 years left

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:12.020 align:middle line:90%
of what it is to be a human.

00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:14.620 align:middle line:90%


00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:15.420 align:middle line:90%
Truly.

00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>> 1,000 used to be a human
in what-- in this Earth?

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:19.040 align:middle line:90%
>> This Earth, OK.

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:22.430 align:middle line:84%
Why would you leave it now
when the game just got good?

00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:23.600 align:middle line:90%
Think of all the--

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:28.260 align:middle line:84%
you went to a conference and saw
the new energy ideas, new idea

00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:29.060 align:middle line:90%
inventions.

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:30.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's beautiful.

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:33.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you imagine a human being
that's not funneled into this

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:37.212 align:middle line:84%
system of education and
lack with the beauty of each

00:43:37.212 --> 00:43:39.170 align:middle line:84%
individual, although you
guys are thinking, no,

00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:40.640 align:middle line:84%
humans are this, and
they're that and that.

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:43.098 align:middle line:84%
That's your own judgment on
yourself, but that's all right.

00:43:43.098 --> 00:43:44.940 align:middle line:90%
You're evolving.

00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:46.430 align:middle line:90%
And you see this--

00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:49.070 align:middle line:84%
like, now example, a
three-year-old prodigy playing

00:43:49.070 --> 00:43:52.220 align:middle line:84%
the piano, and then this
idea of Mozart over here

00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:56.240 align:middle line:84%
and this artist over here,
because they were not funneled

00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:58.340 align:middle line:90%
and said, you have to do this.

00:43:58.340 --> 00:43:59.660 align:middle line:90%
And that's the evolution.

00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:04.640 align:middle line:10%
And now can you imagine
a billion, four billion,

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:07.820 align:middle line:10%
eight billion people being
individual singularities,

00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:09.653 align:middle line:10%
bringing their
beauty to the earth?

00:44:09.653 --> 00:44:11.070 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
leave this game.

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:13.010 align:middle line:84%
This fucking shit's
just getting good.

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:17.660 align:middle line:10%
I mean we're going to just
have so much fun being a human,

00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:20.330 align:middle line:10%
all living as one,
but individually,

00:44:20.330 --> 00:44:22.438 align:middle line:10%
expressing the one.

00:44:22.438 --> 00:44:23.480 align:middle line:90%
That's where we're going.

00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:24.530 align:middle line:90%
We got a long time here.

00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:25.830 align:middle line:90%
Relax.

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:28.070 align:middle line:84%
Have fun, because
we got so much.

00:44:28.070 --> 00:44:30.170 align:middle line:10%
And during this
evolution, the truths

00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:32.120 align:middle line:10%
that you're hearing
today, Reuben,

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:35.900 align:middle line:10%
will not be the truths you
understand in 100 years.

00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:37.670 align:middle line:84%
But without these
truths, you don't have

00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:39.030 align:middle line:90%
a reference point to evolve.

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:39.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:42.163 align:middle line:84%
>> So a lot of the stuff that
we're playing out is going

00:44:42.163 --> 00:44:44.185 align:middle line:84%
to evolve into another
idea in and of itself,

00:44:44.185 --> 00:44:46.560 align:middle line:84%
much like the definition thing
when we were talking about

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:47.570 align:middle line:90%
Ocyphius earlier.

00:44:47.570 --> 00:44:47.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:50.173 align:middle line:84%
>> You have an idea, but that
idea becomes another idea.

00:44:50.173 --> 00:44:52.100 align:middle line:90%
And ah, it's beautiful.

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:53.230 align:middle line:90%
This game is getting good.

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:55.892 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:44:55.892 --> 00:44:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and speaking of
the conference and these new

00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:04.640 align:middle line:84%
inventions, all of these sort
of free energy technologies are

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:08.160 align:middle line:84%
based on the idea
of non-lack, of--

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:08.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:11.760 align:middle line:90%
>> --of infinite--

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:12.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Abundance.

00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:15.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Abundance tapping
into these realms that--

00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it's
all consciousness.

00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:18.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:20.930 align:middle line:84%
>> It can't run out, because
everything within existence is

00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:24.290 align:middle line:84%
existence, and whatever
you define existence to be

00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:27.843 align:middle line:84%
in the idea of your
own created role--

00:45:27.843 --> 00:45:30.260 align:middle line:84%
if you say it's a color red,
it'll be red in your reality.

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:32.180 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean it needs
to be in other ones.

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Or you want free energy,
and it works this way

00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:37.030 align:middle line:84%
through this idea,
then it works.

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:40.568 align:middle line:84%
And if you create the
idea of reality bubble,

00:45:40.568 --> 00:45:42.110 align:middle line:84%
that this energy is
going to be free,

00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:44.240 align:middle line:84%
and anyone can build
that out of their garage,

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:47.540 align:middle line:84%
then it will be that for that
inventor's perspective, not

00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:49.240 align:middle line:90%
yours.

00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:50.330 align:middle line:90%
Only his.

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:53.090 align:middle line:84%
He gets that, because
that's his joy.

00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:54.800 align:middle line:84%
Now if you want to
jump in and hear

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:57.560 align:middle line:84%
about it, which you did through
your own following of your joy,

00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:59.510 align:middle line:84%
which is the highest
benefit to yourself,

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:01.590 align:middle line:90%
you get to play in that world.

00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:03.120 align:middle line:10%
But the other ones might not.

00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:03.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Sure.

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:05.090 align:middle line:10%
>> And that's not your worry.

00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:05.990 align:middle line:10%
That's not your concern.

00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.790 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:09.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Don't worry about who's
getting and who's not,

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:11.310 align:middle line:10%
what they're doing,
what's going to happen.

00:46:11.310 --> 00:46:12.110 align:middle line:10%
Why?

00:46:12.110 --> 00:46:13.880 align:middle line:10%
Because they're gods.

00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:16.550 align:middle line:84%
They're individual
singularities that live forever.

00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:18.080 align:middle line:84%
They're playing a
game, and if they

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:19.730 align:middle line:84%
don't choose what
you're choosing,

00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:22.630 align:middle line:84%
have no lack about your
own self-worth, saying,

00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:23.780 align:middle line:90%
you need to believe me.

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:25.790 align:middle line:90%
Or what about in--

00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:29.570 align:middle line:84%
If you see them in sorrow,
don't, because then you're only

00:46:29.570 --> 00:46:31.610 align:middle line:90%
vibrating in your reality--

00:46:31.610 --> 00:46:34.340 align:middle line:84%
individual realities,
again, being very unique.

00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Then that's the
version of the person

00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:39.800 align:middle line:84%
that you get that you're
feeling sorrow or lack for.

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:41.900 align:middle line:84%
But they have another
version of themselves

00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:45.260 align:middle line:84%
on another reality that
they're choosing their joy.

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's from their
subjective universe.

00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:49.010 align:middle line:90%
>> So there's no--

00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:55.580 align:middle line:84%
I guess I-- some people might
look at this perspective

00:46:55.580 --> 00:47:00.560 align:middle line:84%
and feel that it
negates responsibility.

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:02.630 align:middle line:84%
It negates-- yes, but
as soon as someone

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:04.070 align:middle line:84%
says you can do
anything you want,

00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:06.823 align:middle line:84%
they think what everyone
else is going to do,

00:47:06.823 --> 00:47:08.740 align:middle line:84%
but they never think
they're going to do that.

00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:09.540 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:10.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Think about it.

00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:11.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:12.590 align:middle line:90%
>> You can do whatever you want.

00:47:12.590 --> 00:47:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to--
the immediate idea--

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:17.870 align:middle line:84%
most people's immediate
idea is, oh, everyone's

00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:19.500 align:middle line:90%
going to do chaos and do that.

00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:20.530 align:middle line:90%
But if there's no lack--

00:47:20.530 --> 00:47:23.000 align:middle line:84%
OK, here, let me take
you through a scenario.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.350 align:middle line:10%
I need clothes, so I'm going
to go to Anthropologie,

00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:29.000 align:middle line:10%
one of Roxie's favorite stores.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000 align:middle line:10%
But I go into that store,
and everything's free.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.500 align:middle line:10%
Now why is everything free?

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:40.260 align:middle line:10%
Because the person that's behind
the counter wants to do that.

00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:43.430 align:middle line:84%
It may not be that person
every time you go there.

00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:45.380 align:middle line:84%
It's a person that
wants to experience

00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:47.630 align:middle line:84%
that co-created
reality and that now,

00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:50.270 align:middle line:84%
and it can be for
that one split minute.

00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:51.440 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:55.010 align:middle line:84%
So that person is there in
that co-created reality.

00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:56.600 align:middle line:90%
It's not one big Earth.

00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:57.690 align:middle line:90%
It's just that reality.

00:47:57.690 --> 00:48:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Roxie goes to that store, gets
and picks out her blue jeans

00:48:00.830 --> 00:48:02.250 align:middle line:90%
and a top, and that's it.

00:48:02.250 --> 00:48:03.980 align:middle line:90%
And it's free, and she leaves.

00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:05.960 align:middle line:84%
Now that person
that gets to work

00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:09.338 align:middle line:84%
there is working there for free,
because they want to do it.

00:48:09.338 --> 00:48:10.880 align:middle line:84%
It's not a chore,
and it's not a job,

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:12.920 align:middle line:84%
and they have no
lack, once again,

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:15.400 align:middle line:84%
because when they go
to the grocery store,

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:17.350 align:middle line:84%
everything in the grocery
store is for free.

00:48:17.350 --> 00:48:18.150 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:19.920 align:middle line:84%
Because the person
that made this stuff

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:20.980 align:middle line:90%
is doing it for free.

00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:21.780 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Because they have
no lack either.

00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:26.020 align:middle line:84%
The truck driver that
brought the idea will

00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:28.360 align:middle line:84%
teleporters and some
now, but the truck driver

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:31.870 align:middle line:84%
that drove it there wants to
be and experience the idea

00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:33.180 align:middle line:90%
of being a truck driver.

00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And the stock person
wants to do it.

00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:36.400 align:middle line:84%
It won't be the same
version next time

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:38.150 align:middle line:84%
around, because it's
one Earth that you're

00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:39.510 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE] in that time.

00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:41.260 align:middle line:10%
So you get the version
of the truck driver

00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:42.635 align:middle line:10%
bringing the stuff
to that store,

00:48:42.635 --> 00:48:45.100 align:middle line:10%
and the stock person putting
it on the shelves for you

00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:48.290 align:middle line:10%
to go buy, or the, let's
see, the Anthropologie

00:48:48.290 --> 00:48:51.550 align:middle line:10%
clerk going into that store,
and picking the stuff off there.

00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:53.380 align:middle line:84%
That's there because
of the stocker

00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:55.450 align:middle line:90%
and because of the what?

00:48:55.450 --> 00:48:56.260 align:middle line:90%
Truck driver.

00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:57.845 align:middle line:90%
And there's the manufacturer.

00:48:57.845 --> 00:49:00.220 align:middle line:84%
They want to do it, because
there's no lack, because they

00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:02.080 align:middle line:84%
go over, and they got
their house built for free,

00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:04.497 align:middle line:84%
because the carpenters wanted
to build the house for free,

00:49:04.497 --> 00:49:05.620 align:middle line:90%
because that's their joy.

00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:07.180 align:middle line:90%
They want to do it.

00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:08.590 align:middle line:90%
They want to experience it.

00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And the carpenters--
guess what they get to do.

00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:11.960 align:middle line:10%
They get to go home
to their house,

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:13.050 align:middle line:10%
and their electricity is free.

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:13.780 align:middle line:90%
Their food is free.

00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:14.580 align:middle line:90%
Their car is free.

00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:16.390 align:middle line:84%
Their gas is free,
because there's no lack,

00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:18.760 align:middle line:84%
because everyone is
doing the structural idea

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:23.485 align:middle line:84%
of a co-created idea world on
individual split second Earths

00:49:23.485 --> 00:49:25.320 align:middle line:90%
of their highest joy.

00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:27.970 align:middle line:84%
When there's no lack,
there's no crime,

00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:30.250 align:middle line:90%
because you don't need the idea.

00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:34.900 align:middle line:10%
Lack is what the idea inspired,
the idea of I have less than.

00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:38.180 align:middle line:84%
I need to get more to keep
myself safe and secure.

00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:41.050 align:middle line:84%
The egoic structure of
the self does one thing.

00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:42.640 align:middle line:90%
It preserves.

00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:46.190 align:middle line:10%
The ego is there to protect you.

00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:49.570 align:middle line:84%
It understands that, because
its first idea of fear

00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:51.100 align:middle line:90%
is separation.

00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:53.260 align:middle line:90%
They're taking care of me.

00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:54.850 align:middle line:90%
They're feeding me.

00:49:54.850 --> 00:49:59.080 align:middle line:84%
My idea of my parents-- doesn't
matter if it's maternal or any

00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:01.450 align:middle line:90%
kind of idea--

00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:03.490 align:middle line:84%
parents or godparents
or you were

00:50:03.490 --> 00:50:04.700 align:middle line:90%
raised by your grandmother.

00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:07.990 align:middle line:84%
You-- whatever you
coveted idea as a parent.

00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:10.180 align:middle line:84%
When you are born,
you are being fed,

00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:13.360 align:middle line:84%
and we're echoing Bashar
here, Darryl Anka Bashar.

00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:17.350 align:middle line:84%
You're getting fed a
steady diet of beliefs

00:50:17.350 --> 00:50:20.150 align:middle line:90%
that are a billion years old.

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And you're getting fed a steady
diet of food, so you're like,

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:24.930 align:middle line:90%
oh, my god, you're feeding me.

00:50:24.930 --> 00:50:25.730 align:middle line:90%
You're clothing me.

00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And you're believing
that system.

00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:30.520 align:middle line:90%
That system is what you covet.

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:32.198 align:middle line:84%
You don't know anything
until you covet,

00:50:32.198 --> 00:50:33.490 align:middle line:90%
because you have a blank slate.

00:50:33.490 --> 00:50:34.570 align:middle line:90%
You're not connected.

00:50:34.570 --> 00:50:36.240 align:middle line:90%
You just see and start to covet.

00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:37.630 align:middle line:90%
What a great journey.

00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:41.560 align:middle line:10%
And then understanding the
ego is building up what is

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:44.200 align:middle line:10%
and what is not unfamiliar.

00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:46.180 align:middle line:10%
Oh, my gosh, you're
something different.

00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:47.458 align:middle line:10%
Then I don't understand.

00:50:47.458 --> 00:50:49.750 align:middle line:10%
And if I don't understand,
I have to defend against it,

00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:51.700 align:middle line:10%
protect myself against it.

00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:55.170 align:middle line:10%
That protection idea is a
coveting idea from lack.

00:50:55.170 --> 00:50:55.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:57.470 align:middle line:10%
>> That lack births idea--

00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:58.270 align:middle line:10%
I got to rob.

00:50:58.270 --> 00:50:59.010 align:middle line:10%
I got a steal.

00:50:59.010 --> 00:50:59.620 align:middle line:10%
I got to do this.

00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:00.420 align:middle line:10%
I got to do that.

00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:02.620 align:middle line:10%
And of course, it
births and breeds itself

00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:06.490 align:middle line:10%
in many idea, different idea,
categorized criminals and such,

00:51:06.490 --> 00:51:08.400 align:middle line:10%
and that idea, but
that's moving too.

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:10.370 align:middle line:10%
There's a whole other timeline.

00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:12.210 align:middle line:10%
We can go down that,
but not in this map.

00:51:12.210 --> 00:51:16.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I often make the
analogy of nature and how

00:51:16.210 --> 00:51:19.360 align:middle line:84%
things in our woods and nature
and animal and plant kingdoms

00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:20.920 align:middle line:90%
sort of move.

00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:22.680 align:middle line:90%
And there's no idea of lack.

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:24.770 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, they just express
themselves in the way

00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:25.570 align:middle line:90%
that they do.

00:51:25.570 --> 00:51:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And there's no-- you don't see
the squirrel going and robbing

00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:32.180 align:middle line:90%
the grasshoppers.

00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:32.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:33.820 align:middle line:90%
>> You know, maybe they--

00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:34.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Because they all have--

00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>> They might have some nut
arguments here and there, but--

00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:37.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:38.270 align:middle line:90%
>> But--

00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:40.510 align:middle line:84%
>> And you know what's cool
is you don't see the squirrel

00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:41.770 align:middle line:90%
telling the tree how to grow.

00:51:41.770 --> 00:51:42.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:51:42.570 --> 00:51:43.727 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:51:43.727 --> 00:51:44.810 align:middle line:90%
That's the better analogy.

00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:48.100 align:middle line:90%
>> You like that one.

00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:51.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's hard for us to
conceptualize a reality

00:51:51.850 --> 00:51:54.760 align:middle line:84%
of the truck driver
wanting to drive the truck,

00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:56.810 align:middle line:84%
because we've been
so brainwashed into--

00:51:56.810 --> 00:51:57.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:51:57.610 --> 00:51:58.930 align:middle line:84%
That's a job, and you have
to do that to make a living.

00:51:58.930 --> 00:51:59.680 align:middle line:90%
>> You have to be a doctor.

00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:00.680 align:middle line:90%
You have to be a lawyer.

00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:02.940 align:middle line:84%
You are the only jobs that
exist in this reality.

00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:03.880 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the way.

00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:04.465 align:middle line:90%
>> Because it pays.

00:52:04.465 --> 00:52:06.048 align:middle line:84%
>> Parents want their
kids to succeed,

00:52:06.048 --> 00:52:08.470 align:middle line:84%
because the parents are
afraid of two things--

00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:10.780 align:middle line:84%
failure to the mirror
that they didn't raise

00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:12.790 align:middle line:90%
very good children, A, and B--

00:52:12.790 --> 00:52:13.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Survival.

00:52:13.590 --> 00:52:16.563 align:middle line:84%
>> --that they may have to help
that child beyond a certain

00:52:16.563 --> 00:52:18.730 align:middle line:84%
point, and if they perceive
themselves a known lack,

00:52:18.730 --> 00:52:20.772 align:middle line:84%
then they're going to see
themselves more lackful

00:52:20.772 --> 00:52:23.072 align:middle line:84%
if the child's not going
to be a doctor or a lawyer.

00:52:23.072 --> 00:52:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And also their own
well-being in the future.

00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:26.080 align:middle line:84%
Who's going to
take care of them?

00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:26.880 align:middle line:10%
So we need--

00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:28.678 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, yeah,
but the thing is--

00:52:28.678 --> 00:52:30.220 align:middle line:10%
don't get mad at
yourselves for this.

00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:33.550 align:middle line:10%
No one get mad at yourself,
because you pick the most epic

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:37.630 align:middle line:10%
journey to choose and understand
this beauty of what it

00:52:37.630 --> 00:52:39.762 align:middle line:10%
is to remember that you're God.

00:52:39.762 --> 00:52:41.043 align:middle line:90%
And it's so cool.

00:52:41.043 --> 00:52:42.460 align:middle line:84%
So don't kick
yourself in the ass,

00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:43.630 align:middle line:90%
because you're already God.

00:52:43.630 --> 00:52:44.820 align:middle line:90%
It's just a fractal.

00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:48.610 align:middle line:84%
The personality you suit,
you don, this outfit you don,

00:52:48.610 --> 00:52:51.130 align:middle line:84%
and through your lifetimes,
you're changing outfits,

00:52:51.130 --> 00:52:52.510 align:middle line:90%
becoming who you are.

00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:53.500 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:56.090 align:middle line:84%
So don't get mad at the fractal
for doing this or doing that.

00:52:56.090 --> 00:52:57.770 align:middle line:84%
Just understand, oh,
I bought into that.

00:52:57.770 --> 00:52:58.990 align:middle line:90%
Now I don't want to buy into it.

00:52:58.990 --> 00:52:59.770 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:52:59.770 --> 00:53:01.687 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for servicing me,
because without that,

00:53:01.687 --> 00:53:04.020 align:middle line:10%
I'm not who I am here and now.

00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:05.570 align:middle line:90%
And that's all there is.

00:53:05.570 --> 00:53:06.370 align:middle line:90%
Make sense?

00:53:06.370 --> 00:53:07.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Makes sense.

00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:07.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Love it.

00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:12.050 align:middle line:84%
So while we have
Sylvester here, can I--

00:53:12.050 --> 00:53:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:12.850 --> 00:53:18.293 align:middle line:84%
>> --ask where-- and, again,
going back to the Ocyphius

00:53:18.293 --> 00:53:19.460 align:middle line:90%
question about the oversoul.

00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:20.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Where I exist.

00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:26.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Where and how and realms
and these sorts of definitions,

00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:27.100 align:middle line:10%
I guess.

00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:28.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Well--

00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:29.110 align:middle line:10%
>> If that's--

00:53:29.110 --> 00:53:29.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:30.120 align:middle line:90%
>> If that's even definable.

00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Sylvester, right now, is
talking as a thunderous idea

00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:33.810 align:middle line:90%
of one.

00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:36.130 align:middle line:90%
And I have a million selves--

00:53:36.130 --> 00:53:38.050 align:middle line:84%
I'll just keep it at a
low number-- within me,

00:53:38.050 --> 00:53:40.900 align:middle line:84%
Sylvester, a million
different expressions.

00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:44.650 align:middle line:84%
But I was one expression of
an idea of an expression.

00:53:44.650 --> 00:53:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And I expressed myself through
this idea timeline, this idea

00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:52.150 align:middle line:84%
non-timeline, this density, this
dimension, this non-dimension,

00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:55.240 align:middle line:84%
this interdimension,
this string dimension.

00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And I grew and evolved
myself, Sylvester,

00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:01.720 align:middle line:84%
to become this idea
in this here and now.

00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And through that, I'm
part of that connection

00:54:04.090 --> 00:54:06.070 align:middle line:90%
to co-create with that of Roxie.

00:54:06.070 --> 00:54:08.920 align:middle line:84%
I have an Earth fractal
named Sylvester on Earth

00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:10.870 align:middle line:84%
right now, being a
human, growing up,

00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:13.122 align:middle line:84%
who's about four years old
right now, four and 1/2.

00:54:13.122 --> 00:54:14.300 align:middle line:90%
How old are you?

00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:17.380 align:middle line:90%
Hm, checking in with myself.

00:54:17.380 --> 00:54:18.180 align:middle line:90%
Three and 1/2.

00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:18.980 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:20.950 align:middle line:84%
So the name, Sylvester,
comes from this child?

00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:21.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:22.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Because that was
conceivable and easy for Roxie

00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:25.320 align:middle line:90%
to understand.

00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:26.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Understand.

00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:29.890 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, and I know there's
romantic names out there.

00:54:29.890 --> 00:54:32.020 align:middle line:90%
Give me a-- give me a name.

00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:33.060 align:middle line:90%
Scales.

00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:33.860 align:middle line:90%
That's one name.

00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:35.470 align:middle line:90%
That's Alpha.

00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:37.660 align:middle line:84%
That's another name
of the higher selves.

00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:38.770 align:middle line:90%
Fire or Ocyphius.

00:54:38.770 --> 00:54:39.570 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:54:39.570 --> 00:54:41.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm Sylvester.

00:54:41.010 --> 00:54:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And there's different
ideas of that.

00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:44.440 align:middle line:90%
We have Chuck in here.

00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:45.430 align:middle line:90%
We have Buford.

00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:46.010 align:middle line:90%
He's a fairy.

00:54:46.010 --> 00:54:46.810 align:middle line:90%
He's right there.

00:54:46.810 --> 00:54:47.700 align:middle line:90%
What's up, B?

00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:48.500 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:50.830 align:middle line:90%
So that idea is here too.

00:54:50.830 --> 00:54:54.670 align:middle line:84%
All of this is for
Roxie to express.

00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Roxie behind Roxie
is all that is.

00:54:57.790 --> 00:55:00.160 align:middle line:84%
Roxie using the
energy of co-creation

00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:03.070 align:middle line:84%
to express her understanding
of herself through this.

00:55:03.070 --> 00:55:04.040 align:middle line:90%
Roxie's evolving.

00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:04.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm evolving.

00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:05.500 align:middle line:90%
You're evolving.

00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:06.970 align:middle line:84%
Tom's evolving, and all
of you out there-- you

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:09.580 align:middle line:84%
choose the moment of now of
this co-creation in this one

00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:14.470 align:middle line:84%
little idea particle of
information are evolving.

00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:16.570 align:middle line:90%
>> So through this evolution--

00:55:16.570 --> 00:55:17.740 align:middle line:90%
>> The idea, who am I--

00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:19.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm just this big idea.

00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:22.000 align:middle line:84%
Just leave it at that,
because there's just too many

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:26.560 align:middle line:84%
definitions that would be
[COUGHING] equally valid

00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:28.170 align:middle line:90%
and non-valid in another now.

00:55:28.170 --> 00:55:28.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:55:28.970 --> 00:55:29.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Go ahead.

00:55:29.770 --> 00:55:33.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And as we're evolving into
these different expressions

00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:36.430 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves, we
drop the labels.

00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:39.307 align:middle line:84%
We sort of merge into
a greater, larger--

00:55:39.307 --> 00:55:40.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Nothing and everything.

00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:43.690 align:middle line:84%
>> --consciousness
of expression.

00:55:43.690 --> 00:55:45.760 align:middle line:84%
>> You'll always be an
individual singularity.

00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:50.590 align:middle line:84%
So I want you all out there,
too, to imagine the idea entity

00:55:50.590 --> 00:55:53.200 align:middle line:90%
that you are behind the eyes.

00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:54.880 align:middle line:90%
That's who you are.

00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:56.520 align:middle line:90%
Roxie is Roxie.

00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:57.820 align:middle line:90%
Roxie is not Sly.

00:55:57.820 --> 00:55:59.260 align:middle line:90%
Roxie is not Roman.

00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:02.720 align:middle line:84%
Roxie is Roxie, expressing
Roxie right now.

00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:06.430 align:middle line:84%
Roxie is understanding
what it is to be Roxie.

00:56:06.430 --> 00:56:08.440 align:middle line:84%
The energy that
expresses Roxie is

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:12.190 align:middle line:84%
what Roxie truly is in the
individual idea of the whole.

00:56:12.190 --> 00:56:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>> But now Roxie is bringing
in these other expressions.

00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:15.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:16.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Of Sly and--

00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:19.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Because she accepted an
idea of herself to go down

00:56:19.070 --> 00:56:19.870 align:middle line:90%
a journey.

00:56:19.870 --> 00:56:21.220 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:24.290 align:middle line:84%
It's not a right or a wrong
or a purpose or a non-purpose.

00:56:24.290 --> 00:56:26.730 align:middle line:84%
Roxie is on a rode ride,
and gets to play with it.

00:56:26.730 --> 00:56:28.630 align:middle line:84%
So she gets to
experience this portion

00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:32.683 align:middle line:84%
of reality called humanity
through her individual art.

00:56:32.683 --> 00:56:33.850 align:middle line:90%
And that's what she's doing.

00:56:33.850 --> 00:56:35.530 align:middle line:90%
She understands the game.

00:56:35.530 --> 00:56:36.740 align:middle line:90%
The game is exactly that.

00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:37.540 align:middle line:90%
It's a game.

00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:40.300 align:middle line:84%
It's a game of understanding
yourself to expand yourself,

00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:42.980 align:middle line:90%
and you get to do this forever.

00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And getting to
share her expressions--

00:56:45.490 --> 00:56:46.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:47.780 align:middle line:84%
>> --with what we're
doing right now.

00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:48.220 align:middle line:90%
>> She loves it.

00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>> With everybody who's
going to be watching.

00:56:49.150 --> 00:56:52.480 align:middle line:84%
>> It rocks her world, just
breathes life into her to do--

00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:53.620 align:middle line:90%
to be able to do this.

00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And through this idea,
she gets to understand

00:56:55.900 --> 00:57:00.700 align:middle line:84%
channeling in a different way,
a more out of the ordinary idea

00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:01.840 align:middle line:90%
of channeling.

00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:03.790 align:middle line:84%
But that idea is an
expression, and then

00:57:03.790 --> 00:57:06.360 align:middle line:84%
other channelers express,
and other channelers express.

00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden, we
have, in this small idea-- you

00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:11.560 align:middle line:84%
said it earlier--
small idea, awakened

00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:14.370 align:middle line:84%
world, of a whole
bunch of channelers.

00:57:14.370 --> 00:57:20.060 align:middle line:10%
But then disclosure comes, and
everyone goes, what's going on?

00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:22.374 align:middle line:84%
And all these
channelers are ready,

00:57:22.374 --> 00:57:26.080 align:middle line:84%
are ready to be the
lighthouses to offer

00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:28.280 align:middle line:90%
an idea of what's going on.

00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:29.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>> It's perfect.

00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:57:32.310 --> 00:57:33.880 align:middle line:90%
No, that's beautiful.

00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:39.520 align:middle line:84%
I think that's-- looking very
much forward to that day.

00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:41.160 align:middle line:84%
Getting back to the
disclosure topic--

00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:42.660 align:middle line:84%
and maybe we could
close with this--

00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:45.030 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:48.430 align:middle line:90%
>> We all know we--

00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:50.750 align:middle line:84%
you and I know and
several other people now

00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:53.660 align:middle line:84%
are just feeling it's very
close, right around the corner.

00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:55.368 align:middle line:84%
We're already sort of
in this disclosure.

00:57:55.368 --> 00:57:56.168 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:57:56.168 --> 00:57:58.765 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, what we're doing
today is a form of disclosure.

00:57:58.765 --> 00:57:59.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:57:59.590 --> 00:58:01.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Expression.

00:58:01.930 --> 00:58:08.480 align:middle line:84%
What can others do who may be
viewing this to tap into this--

00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:11.080 align:middle line:90%
to help move this forward.

00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:14.550 align:middle line:10%
>> Humanity is going to
evolve with or without you.

00:58:14.550 --> 00:58:16.930 align:middle line:10%
The more intention
you put in out

00:58:16.930 --> 00:58:20.260 align:middle line:10%
of lack, out of an approach
to the moment out of lack

00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:24.580 align:middle line:10%
that they need to know, and
you take on a status vibration

00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:26.140 align:middle line:10%
standpoint of being--

00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:28.600 align:middle line:10%
people are in trouble
I need to help--

00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:31.710 align:middle line:10%
then you're only putting out
a vibration that you are,

00:58:31.710 --> 00:58:34.900 align:middle line:10%
let's say, a preacher, and
they are your congregation

00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:36.700 align:middle line:10%
that is in peril.

00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And they're not,
because everything

00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:41.080 align:middle line:84%
is an individual
world in that perfect

00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:46.040 align:middle line:84%
now as an idea of the
self-expressed, period.

00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:48.310 align:middle line:84%
So in the now between
now and disclosure

00:58:48.310 --> 00:58:50.800 align:middle line:84%
that's going to happen, once
again, with or without you

00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:54.790 align:middle line:84%
on all the worlds that
are happening right now,

00:58:54.790 --> 00:58:59.590 align:middle line:84%
you put out, in that
idea, love for yourself.

00:58:59.590 --> 00:59:01.900 align:middle line:90%
Worry about it not.

00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:05.680 align:middle line:84%
Choose your joy now,
whatever you want to do.

00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:08.340 align:middle line:84%
Know that it's going to
happen in that perfect now.

00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:13.030 align:middle line:84%
Surprise yourself when it's
going to happen by being now.

00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:14.985 align:middle line:90%
So to help, be yourself.

00:59:14.985 --> 00:59:17.360 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to be part of
it in one way or the other,

00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:20.620 align:middle line:84%
that opportunity is only
going to come sooner

00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:22.120 align:middle line:90%
if you don't think about it.

00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:23.020 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:59:23.020 --> 00:59:25.960 align:middle line:84%
Because intention is
based off of the past.

00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:28.780 align:middle line:10%
If I need to do something,
that means I have to think.

00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:30.070 align:middle line:90%
And Bashar said it best.

00:59:30.070 --> 00:59:30.970 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Bashar.

00:59:30.970 --> 00:59:31.780 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:33.130 align:middle line:90%
Back in I think '86--

00:59:33.130 --> 00:59:34.410 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember in that idea.

00:59:34.410 --> 00:59:36.880 align:middle line:90%
Well, Roxie can.

00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:39.500 align:middle line:90%
It was like I think 1987.

00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:40.630 align:middle line:90%
He said this.

00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:44.230 align:middle line:84%
You literally do not have
to think on this planet.

00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And that just scares
the shit out of people.

00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:49.510 align:middle line:84%
You don't, because you're
already the natural state

00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:50.410 align:middle line:90%
of being of love.

00:59:50.410 --> 00:59:52.690 align:middle line:84%
So if you let your natural
state, by not thinking,

00:59:52.690 --> 00:59:56.110 align:middle line:84%
thinking is blinders, based
off of the past of experience

00:59:56.110 --> 00:59:59.270 align:middle line:84%
to formulate a probable future
of security out of lack.

00:59:59.270 --> 01:00:02.350 align:middle line:10%
Now if you let it go,
then you're only what?

01:00:02.350 --> 01:00:03.400 align:middle line:90%
Love.

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:06.910 align:middle line:90%
No intention is the unfiltered--

01:00:06.910 --> 01:00:08.770 align:middle line:84%
kingdom comes--
kingdom of heaven

01:00:08.770 --> 01:00:10.470 align:middle line:90%
lies within, that kind of idea.

01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:12.880 align:middle line:90%
The inside bursts the outside.

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:14.740 align:middle line:84%
So if your natural
state of living is love,

01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:16.030 align:middle line:84%
and you're putting out
love, because you're not

01:00:16.030 --> 01:00:18.460 align:middle line:84%
running intention of fear
upon your realities of now

01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:20.950 align:middle line:84%
with your focused ideas,
the only thing you get back

01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:22.867 align:middle line:84%
in the mirror-- therefore,
if you don't think,

01:00:22.867 --> 01:00:24.745 align:middle line:84%
you're only going to
get a better reality.

01:00:24.745 --> 01:00:25.870 align:middle line:90%
Everything that come-- why?

01:00:25.870 --> 01:00:27.580 align:middle line:90%
It's a holodeck.

01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:28.605 align:middle line:90%
The money will come.

01:00:28.605 --> 01:00:29.480 align:middle line:90%
The people will come.

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:30.445 align:middle line:90%
The food will come.

01:00:30.445 --> 01:00:31.320 align:middle line:90%
>> The ETs will come.

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:32.707 align:middle line:90%
>> Everything's going to come.

01:00:32.707 --> 01:00:33.790 align:middle line:90%
They're all going to come.

01:00:33.790 --> 01:00:35.830 align:middle line:84%
So if you just be
yourself in the now,

01:00:35.830 --> 01:00:38.080 align:middle line:90%
choose what you like to do.

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:39.100 align:middle line:90%
Take a chore.

01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:40.390 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do a chore.

01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:43.300 align:middle line:84%
Then don't do the chore
until the chore is no longer

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:46.240 align:middle line:90%
a chore in that now.

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Action upon ideas of fear,
even frustration or obligation,

01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:55.408 align:middle line:90%
creates that next now as that.

01:00:55.408 --> 01:00:56.950 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
do a chore, but you

01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:58.158 align:middle line:90%
force yourself to do a chore.

01:00:58.158 --> 01:00:58.990 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:00:58.990 --> 01:01:01.330 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not going
to get done without me.

01:01:01.330 --> 01:01:02.440 align:middle line:90%
Stop it.

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:06.280 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it will, in
the now, perfectly.

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:08.650 align:middle line:84%
Trust the idea of
the individual god

01:01:08.650 --> 01:01:11.590 align:middle line:84%
that you are right above
you, in you, around you,

01:01:11.590 --> 01:01:13.360 align:middle line:90%
is you, and you.

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Trust that God, and watch your
idea of vibrational holodeck

01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:22.040 align:middle line:90%
illusion around you shift.

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:25.400 align:middle line:90%


01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:29.660 align:middle line:10%
Give yourself an idea memory,
you already did the dishes.

01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:30.680 align:middle line:90%
That one's fun.

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:31.820 align:middle line:90%
Shit, I did the dishes.

01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:32.750 align:middle line:90%
When did I do those?

01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:33.755 align:middle line:90%
Ah, who care?

01:01:33.755 --> 01:01:34.555 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:01:34.555 --> 01:01:35.355 align:middle line:90%
Wow, OK.

01:01:35.355 --> 01:01:36.510 align:middle line:90%
Because it's a holodeck.

01:01:36.510 --> 01:01:37.310 align:middle line:90%
Right.

01:01:37.310 --> 01:01:38.110 align:middle line:90%
It's a light show.

01:01:38.110 --> 01:01:40.190 align:middle line:10%
You're bending light to
give you a frequency--

01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:43.130 align:middle line:10%
that's truly translated
only through electricity

01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:44.520 align:middle line:10%
right up here.

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:45.570 align:middle line:10%
It's not real.

01:01:45.570 --> 01:01:47.277 align:middle line:10%
It's what your
senses say is real.

01:01:47.277 --> 01:01:48.360 align:middle line:10%
But it's a hell of a ride.

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:49.640 align:middle line:10%
What an illusion we got.

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:50.690 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

01:01:50.690 --> 01:01:53.380 align:middle line:84%
So in the idea to
increase the repetitivity

01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:57.200 align:middle line:84%
of an overall collective being
loved, which only encourages

01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:02.810 align:middle line:84%
the speeding up of disclosure,
be yourself in the now.

01:02:02.810 --> 01:02:06.320 align:middle line:84%
Choose only what you
choose in that idea world.

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:09.080 align:middle line:84%
Your bubble radiates to
the collective whole, love.

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:11.810 align:middle line:84%
That idea signal
comes off of me.

01:02:11.810 --> 01:02:15.170 align:middle line:84%
Just say me and you
send a signal of love.

01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:17.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean that--
interpret it as love.

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:20.180 align:middle line:84%
I interpret it as
something else, a choice.

01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:22.100 align:middle line:84%
Instead of-- I get
the same version

01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:24.290 align:middle line:90%
of fear in this idea world.

01:02:24.290 --> 01:02:28.670 align:middle line:84%
Then no one else around me gives
me anything at all except fear.

01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:31.080 align:middle line:90%
I think reality is that.

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:35.270 align:middle line:84%
But you come along, Reuben,
and you choose yourself

01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:36.260 align:middle line:90%
in the moment of love.

01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:37.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

01:02:37.070 --> 01:02:39.210 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't want to do
the old status quo.

01:02:39.210 --> 01:02:42.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to choose my
self-worth, my love for myself.

01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:46.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm worthy, because I
was chosen to exist.

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:49.550 align:middle line:84%
So if God chose me to
exist, the creator chose me,

01:02:49.550 --> 01:02:50.960 align:middle line:90%
I must have a pretty good in.

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:52.520 align:middle line:90%
So I've got that going for me.

01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:55.250 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to, in this
unworthy idea human,

01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:56.810 align:middle line:90%
go ahead and choose myself.

01:02:56.810 --> 01:02:59.960 align:middle line:84%
So I choose myself,
and then Reuben

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:04.010 align:middle line:84%
serves Roxie, because Reuben
chose a vibration of love,

01:03:04.010 --> 01:03:08.720 align:middle line:84%
and Roxie gets the
reflection other than fear.

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:11.000 align:middle line:10%
So now Roxie has a choice.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.340 align:middle line:10%
So you've serviced as the
lighthouse without servicing.

01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:15.140 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:16.120 align:middle line:90%
>> You didn't try.

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:16.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>> You followed your joy.

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:19.750 align:middle line:90%
It's built in.

01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:22.130 align:middle line:84%
Give and take is
unconditional love.

01:03:22.130 --> 01:03:23.190 align:middle line:90%
It's already built in.

01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:25.023 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to give
enough to get enough.

01:03:25.023 --> 01:03:27.020 align:middle line:90%
That's bullshit.

01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Trump that idea, and
go with what you are

01:03:29.210 --> 01:03:30.260 align:middle line:90%

01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:32.420 align:middle line:84%
Choose your highest self
in the best idea manner

01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:34.820 align:middle line:84%
that you can in each
individual now, and only

01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:37.718 align:middle line:84%
be the light to
others that are lost.

01:03:37.718 --> 01:03:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And then I get to see another
version of reality that's

01:03:40.010 --> 01:03:43.130 align:middle line:84%
not the same as status quo
as the past nows of that what

01:03:43.130 --> 01:03:45.793 align:middle line:84%
it is, because if I'm an
asshole to the mirror,

01:03:45.793 --> 01:03:48.210 align:middle line:84%
because the mirror's an asshole
to me, all I'm going to be

01:03:48.210 --> 01:03:49.440 align:middle line:90%
is an ass.

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:51.480 align:middle line:84%
But if I get someone
who's nice to me,

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:54.300 align:middle line:84%
who changes me, and gives
me hope within myself,

01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:56.730 align:middle line:84%
even hope implies
doubt, but that's still

01:03:56.730 --> 01:03:58.980 align:middle line:90%
hope for that lost child.

01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:00.900 align:middle line:84%
So you give them
that love, and you

01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:03.360 align:middle line:84%
allow them to play in the
garden that you provided

01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:05.490 align:middle line:84%
of unconditional love, so
they can see themselves

01:04:05.490 --> 01:04:06.290 align:middle line:90%
in a new way.

01:04:06.290 --> 01:04:08.730 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have that choice,
because no one believed

01:04:08.730 --> 01:04:13.410 align:middle line:84%
in good, in themselves,
the love for themselves.

01:04:13.410 --> 01:04:14.570 align:middle line:90%
They always chose fear.

01:04:14.570 --> 01:04:15.370 align:middle line:90%
Make sense?

01:04:15.370 --> 01:04:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:17.220 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's epic.

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:18.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:19.230 align:middle line:90%
>> The way it works is epic.

01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:22.020 align:middle line:84%
So you serve as Roxie,
because you chose something

01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:23.910 align:middle line:84%
in the now, and
that now is love,

01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:25.890 align:middle line:84%
and now that will
give disclosure

01:04:25.890 --> 01:04:28.418 align:middle line:90%
an idea of speeding up.

01:04:28.418 --> 01:04:30.210 align:middle line:84%
It'll happen, because
more and more bubbles

01:04:30.210 --> 01:04:32.730 align:middle line:84%
co-create, and a larger
idea of co-creation

01:04:32.730 --> 01:04:34.788 align:middle line:84%
in that 40 idea
vibrational Earth,

01:04:34.788 --> 01:04:36.330 align:middle line:84%
and it's just going
to sweep through,

01:04:36.330 --> 01:04:37.980 align:middle line:84%
and everyone's
going to go, cool.

01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:40.660 align:middle line:90%

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And there's going to be so many
wonderful played out worlds

01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:53.620 align:middle line:84%
and this and that, and
you just gotta-- oh.

01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:55.690 align:middle line:90%
So to help it, be yourself.

01:04:55.690 --> 01:04:58.670 align:middle line:84%
Choose yourself, your joy,
your now for yourself.

01:04:58.670 --> 01:04:59.540 align:middle line:90%
Love yourself.

01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:02.080 align:middle line:84%
You can't be selfish
in your own universe.

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:05.500 align:middle line:10%
And just rock your individual
singularity bubble of reality,

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:08.590 align:middle line:10%
and whoever chooses to get
on board with your world

01:05:08.590 --> 01:05:10.940 align:middle line:10%
is just going to be love.

01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:12.702 align:middle line:10%

All right.

myself, we say adone,
