The path of my
journey has taken me

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.380 align:middle line:84%
to Sedona, Arizona
several times.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And every time I leave, I find
myself making plans to return.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.430 align:middle line:84%
It was one of the
first discoveries

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.030 align:middle line:84%
I made during my research
into the ET subject matter.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Sure, it was a hard
one to swallow.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.739 align:middle line:84%
I remember going to
an ET meetup group

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.680 align:middle line:84%
at the Flying Saucer
Cafe in Santa Monica.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.420 align:middle line:84%
Some of the experts
there said that they

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.330 align:middle line:84%
had spoken to several
abductees who claimed to have

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.610 align:middle line:90%
seen these children on ships.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.230 align:middle line:84%
They said they
were teaching them

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.430 align:middle line:84%
how to do mundane daily tasks,
like go grocery shopping

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.080 align:middle line:90%
and wash dishes.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, at the time, I
thought it was ridiculous.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.270 align:middle line:84%
But several years
into my research,

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.380 align:middle line:84%
now I know it to be
more true than not.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.110 align:middle line:84%
In fact, all of the
extra dimensional beings

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.720 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed so
far have all confirmed

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.500 align:middle line:84%

existence of hybrid children.

thought, I guess.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.528 align:middle line:90%
>> Career path?

00:02:53.528 --> 00:02:55.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it kind of
is a career path.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.750 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, it's my
passion path, I guess more so.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're making
a career out of it.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.335 align:middle line:84%
It's a career out of
it, but it's just,

00:03:02.335 --> 00:03:05.720 align:middle line:84%
I guess, my dedication
in this life.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's not what I
would have expected.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And it started
with doing a bunch

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.760 align:middle line:84%
of healing, different
trainings that I was doing--

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.190 align:middle line:90%
like I told you earlier--

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.400 align:middle line:84%
doing different past
life stuff, Earthbound

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.120 align:middle line:84%
spirits, medium ship, of
those kind of things--

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.140 align:middle line:90%
angels, guides.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And a part of that
was abduction.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I was cool with
all the other inter-dimensional

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.400 align:middle line:90%
stuff, but not--

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is helping other
people with their past lives.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.940 align:middle line:90%
So I would channel that through.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.030 align:middle line:84%
So I would, like, connect
with their other lives

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.280 align:middle line:84%
and bring that through, or
connect with their guides

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.590 align:middle line:90%
and communicate from them--

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.360 align:middle line:90%
those kinds of things.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Before we jump ahead,
can you just tell me,

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.030 align:middle line:84%
how did you stumble upon
that work in itself?

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.132 align:middle line:84%
Because that realm, it's
not common for people to--

00:03:59.132 --> 00:04:00.590 align:middle line:84%
it's becoming more
common, I guess.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.500 align:middle line:90%
But what led you into that path?

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>> One, being in Los Angeles.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.150 align:middle line:90%
So that opens up that door.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.870 align:middle line:84%
Two-- you know, it was right
after I got out of college.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And then I went immediately
into, like, advertising,

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.000 align:middle line:90%
big time corporate advertising.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And just like really dove
into the corporate world.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.510 align:middle line:10%
And then after that experience,
as well as, like, boyfriends

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.240 align:middle line:10%
and stuff, I just went so deep
into something energetically

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.460 align:middle line:10%
that I wasn't, that
I just catapulted

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.240 align:middle line:10%
to another extreme of I'm
going, I need to, like,

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.930 align:middle line:10%
look at what I really
am passionate about,

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.100 align:middle line:10%
and look at what my gifts are.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And, like, fix my
own personal stuff.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.360 align:middle line:84%
Like, why am I experiencing
certain things?

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>> And when you say
deep in something you

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.808 align:middle line:84%
weren't, that's the
corporate world.

00:05:02.808 --> 00:05:04.600 align:middle line:84%
>> The corporate world
and stuff like that.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So you were doing
the 9:00 to 5:00--

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:12.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, 24 hour iPhone as
the pillow kind of thing.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Getting those
frequencies as you sleep.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Getting those.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.465 align:middle line:84%
>> And then that felt not right,
so then that's the catapult

00:05:21.465 --> 00:05:22.340 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.377 align:middle line:84%
So you went the other direction,
the opposite of 9:00 to 5:00--

00:05:25.377 --> 00:05:26.460 align:middle line:90%
the opposite of corporate.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.920 align:middle line:90%
OK, gotcha.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And even as a kid, I just
was very attuned to, like,

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.130 align:middle line:90%
I loved fairies.

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.660 align:middle line:90%
I loved nature.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.580 align:middle line:90%
I can sense certain things.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.550 align:middle line:84%
I could definitely feel a
lot more going on with people

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.760 align:middle line:90%
than they knew themselves.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And I had those
extra sensitivities.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And then over the years and
years and years of schooling,

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.790 align:middle line:84%
they started to dwindle,
and dwindle, go away.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And then once I hit the
extreme of then going corporate

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.600 align:middle line:84%
after all the schooling,
it was just so far,

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.360 align:middle line:90%
that I knew exactly where to go.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.340 align:middle line:84%
I was like, let's
go back to nature.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.500 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to
my natural self.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And at that time,
too, my dad was

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.920 align:middle line:84%
heavy into the metaphysical
community in LA.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.650 align:middle line:84%
So he was going to
Bashar channelings.

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And he was doing
channeling-like stuff himself.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:25.407 align:middle line:84%
And then he was connected
with a shaman in Los Angeles,

00:06:25.407 --> 00:06:26.990 align:middle line:84%
and we were doing
family constellation

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.570 align:middle line:84%
work, which heals family
traumas that are passed down.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.020 align:middle line:90%
And so he was in that.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And I was dabbling
and I knew about it.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.600 align:middle line:10%
But once I had gone
to such an extreme,

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.840 align:middle line:10%
I went, OK, well, I need to
look more at like, who I am,

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.710 align:middle line:10%
and where is this originating
from, like, in my lineage.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.620 align:middle line:84%
Why am I creating
certain challenges, like,

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.150 align:middle line:90%
in relationships?

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.430 align:middle line:84%
What is the source of
my motivations in life?

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
working with a shaman.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And I worked with
another clairvoyant too.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And I just started learning
all that they were doing.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And then I could see that I
had these sensitivities too.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.810 align:middle line:84%
Once I could see them
doing all of that stuff,

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.915 align:middle line:90%
I went, oh, I can do that too.

00:07:11.915 --> 00:07:14.290 align:middle line:84%
But it was so natural, that
I didn't know I was doing it.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:15.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Got you.

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:19.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So then I went, hmm,
well, let's dive into that.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And so then I did a
different healing training.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, I
didn't believe fully--

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:29.060 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have the visceral
experience of other lives,

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.130 align:middle line:84%
like other simultaneous
incarnations.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:34.020 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really believe
in Earthbound spirits.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.800 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't, like--
intellectually,

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.207 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't matched
with my experience.

00:07:39.207 --> 00:07:40.790 align:middle line:84%
So that was one of
the primary reasons

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.130 align:middle line:84%
that I went to do
the training, was

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:47.720 align:middle line:84%
to see if it
actually hit to have

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.520 align:middle line:84%
an experience with
these different segments

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.160 align:middle line:84%
that people just flippantly,
like, throw around.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.360 align:middle line:90%
Like, oh, my past life.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.390 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going, no.

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:02.210 align:middle line:84%
How does that relate
to this here now?

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:03.590 align:middle line:90%
And how do you know?

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:05.580 align:middle line:84%
Like, where's the
knowingness behind that?

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.580 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to know
that for myself

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.140 align:middle line:84%
before I just went
around just saying stuff.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And so then at that training,
I experienced crazy things that

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:17.450 align:middle line:90%
were--

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even backed
up by like Google--

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:24.260 align:middle line:84%
certain things I was channeling
of different, like, spirits and

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.550 align:middle line:90%
crazy things that were just--

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>> When you say
backed up by Google,

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:27.700 align:middle line:90%
what do you mean by that?

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.780 align:middle line:84%
You would Google it later after
you've had the experience?

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, after I had the
experience, it was, like,

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:34.880 align:middle line:84%
what I had brought through was
actually backed up by, like,

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.020 align:middle line:84%
historically in Google, like,
different things that happened.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you describe how?

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:43.039 align:middle line:84%
You got us going
here, for example?

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:47.660 align:middle line:84%
>> For example, we were staying
in a retreat center in San

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:48.500 align:middle line:90%
Diego.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And it, itself, had kind
of interesting energies.

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:55.370 align:middle line:84%
And that day, out of
the two week thing,

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:57.610 align:middle line:84%
we had worked with
Earthbound spirits

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:59.930 align:middle line:84%
and worked with people
that had passed.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And so that night,
my roommate and I

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:03.260 align:middle line:90%
were both going back and forth.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And she was from England,
so she was telling me

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.930 align:middle line:84%
about all the ghosts in
all the castles in England

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:11.920 align:middle line:84%
that she would work
with and stuff.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.640 align:middle line:90%
And so we're just dialoguing.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:14.870 align:middle line:90%
And the door was open.

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:16.730 align:middle line:90%
And the energy was open.

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:20.460 align:middle line:84%
We were kind of like calling
it in, I guess you could say.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And then I can perceive, I could
feel beings walk into the room.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And it was three little
girls that I perceived.

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time
I felt that, she

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.690 align:middle line:90%
looked in the same direction.

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:36.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I knew that
something was going on.

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And we both are going oh,
like, something just happened.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:40.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:44.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And so then, at that moment,
we were like, OK, this is it.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.250 align:middle line:90%
Like, something's going on.

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:48.050 align:middle line:90%
And so I got out my pendulum.

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:49.380 align:middle line:90%
And she's channeling too.

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.560 align:middle line:84%
So both of us together
were going back and forth.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.830 align:middle line:10%
And what came
through, through me--

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:56.450 align:middle line:10%
that I could hear from them--

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:58.040 align:middle line:10%
is that there were
three little girls

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.710 align:middle line:10%
that had been murdered
on this property

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:05.210 align:middle line:10%
by this religious
group, by this, like--

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:07.880 align:middle line:10%
I guess he was some kind
of bishop or something

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.350 align:middle line:10%
that ran a center.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:13.100 align:middle line:90%
And he murdered them.

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And they just were
stuck in this dimension,

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:22.220 align:middle line:84%
because if it's an abrupt ending
or if it's unfinished, then

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:23.960 align:middle line:84%
of course, you
kind of stay bound

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.060 align:middle line:90%
to this until it's complete.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:30.490 align:middle line:84%
Or if you have a drug overdose,
or you get in a car accident,

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:33.920 align:middle line:84%
those kinds of
things lead to where

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.750 align:middle line:84%
those beings need
extra assistance

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:38.000 align:middle line:90%
to move into the light.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And so we worked with
these little girls.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Your other friend from
England, she was there too?

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Simultaneously getting
the same downloads?

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:46.575 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, same downloads.

00:10:46.575 --> 00:10:51.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So you were able to confirm
with her later the same

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:52.230 align:middle line:90%
information?

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:53.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And then at the same time, too,
so we sent them into the light.

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.380 align:middle line:90%
We assisted them.

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And then, I got on
my phone on Google,

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.160 align:middle line:90%
and they gave me the year.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:06.810 align:middle line:84%
They gave that it was some kind
of religious guy that did it.

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.770 align:middle line:84%
We knew the location,
three little girls.

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And I Googled it, and
it was, like, on Google.

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Like, three little
girls murdered

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.250 align:middle line:90%
by this guy at this location.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:19.120 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, oh.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.540 align:middle line:84%
So that was like
my first experience

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:24.120 align:middle line:84%
of getting the
information and then

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.950 align:middle line:84%
having it instantly
validated to reinforce.

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:27.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Instantly.

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:28.550 align:middle line:90%
Google.

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:30.010 align:middle line:90%
We can do that now on the phone.

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:31.140 align:middle line:84%
You didn't even wait
till you got home.

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:31.975 align:middle line:90%
You went right on the phone.

00:11:31.975 --> 00:11:33.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Right on the phone.

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:34.860 align:middle line:90%
I was like, OK.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:35.700 align:middle line:90%
Am I crazy?

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.390 align:middle line:90%
So it was instantly validated.

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:38.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:38.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:39.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:42.630 align:middle line:90%
So hence, the Google validation.

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:43.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Google validation.

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:44.447 align:middle line:90%
>> That explains that.

00:11:44.447 --> 00:11:47.300 align:middle line:90%


00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:53.180 align:middle line:84%
So that led you into
dabbling into healing others.

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:56.720 align:middle line:84%
You said, assisting others
with alien abductions?

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:02.270 align:middle line:84%
So that was one baby
sliver of the two weeks.

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:05.510 align:middle line:84%
It was like an afternoon
out of the two weeks.

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:09.570 align:middle line:90%
And I thought it was crazy.

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:13.640 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, I was
open, because I had to be open.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.580 align:middle line:84%
That was my mission, was
to be open to understand.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Open, meaning transparent,
telling friends and family

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:20.090 align:middle line:90%
and the world?

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:22.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Open in the way of like,
I was open to believing it.

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:25.750 align:middle line:84%
I was open to acknowledging
that that was their experience.

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:26.940 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:29.697 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, after you've had that
experience, how could you not?

00:12:29.697 --> 00:12:30.094 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:30.094 --> 00:12:30.894 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:30.894 --> 00:12:34.460 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, it was a
different segment,

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:37.370 align:middle line:84%
but it all fits
into the same thing.

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people in
the spiritual community

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:43.355 align:middle line:84%
don't translate over to
extraterrestrials, sometimes.

00:12:43.355 --> 00:12:45.480 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of extraterrestrial
people don't translate

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:51.920 align:middle line:90%
into other realms and things.

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Which is, for me, I found
very hard to understand

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:57.980 align:middle line:90%
those people.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.200 align:middle line:90%
Because it's like, if it's one--

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.748 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you're going to
let your brain leak out,

00:13:02.748 --> 00:13:04.040 align:middle line:90%
you might as well just let it--

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:04.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Go all the way.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.290 align:middle line:90%
>> --just go full.

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:10.740 align:middle line:84%
Full disclosure, full peanut
butter, go all the way in.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:11.540 align:middle line:90%
Might as well.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm with you on
all of that, yeah.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Because when you throw
out all scientific logic,

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:21.728 align:middle line:84%
for one thing, why not throw
it out for the other stuff?

00:13:21.728 --> 00:13:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>> You've got to be open
to throwing everything out.

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:27.060 align:middle line:90%
And it just spins and spirals.

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.300 align:middle line:84%
But the abduction thing
was the last thing

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:31.685 align:middle line:84%
I was going to throw
out, which you'd think

00:13:31.685 --> 00:13:32.810 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of people, it is.

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's meaning the
hardest thing for you to--

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Acknowledge.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>> --acknowledge that
that's the truth.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.080 align:middle line:90%
>> So ghost, you've got that.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Ghost, past lives, good.

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:43.700 align:middle line:90%
Angels, great.

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.530 align:middle line:90%
Fairies, awesome.

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:46.400 align:middle line:90%
Aliens, no.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Mermaids?

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes!

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes on mermaids
before alien abductions.

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:51.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:52.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:53.060 align:middle line:90%
OK, never mind.

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:53.860 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.620 align:middle line:90%


00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:57.865 align:middle line:90%
>> I really like mermaids.

00:13:57.865 --> 00:13:59.990 align:middle line:84%
>> I figured you would,
that's why I brought it up.

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:04.430 align:middle line:90%


00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:05.620 align:middle line:90%
So then, aliens.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:07.070 align:middle line:90%
>> So, aliens.

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:11.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Aliens, in essence,
aliens, or alien abductions?

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.190 align:middle line:90%
Was it the abduction phenomenon?

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:14.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Abduction.

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:14.910 align:middle line:90%
I was fine.

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:18.990 align:middle line:84%
See, yet again, it's
like star family is OK.

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:20.910 align:middle line:90%
Alien abductions isn't.

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's nice having had my
own belief dot disconnect,

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:29.730 align:middle line:84%
because now I can see where
it is for other people, which

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:32.180 align:middle line:90%
is just programming.

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:35.430 align:middle line:84%
So in another part
of the training,

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.330 align:middle line:90%
we had talked about star beings.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.810 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, you have other
lives from Sirius and Pleiades.

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:42.960 align:middle line:90%
And I was good with that.

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, that
sounds really cool.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:45.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm into that.

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And then it's like,
alien abduction?

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:48.090 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:51.630 align:middle line:84%
So I definitely
had a disconnect.

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:55.470 align:middle line:84%
But then as I started
doing this and working

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:59.070 align:middle line:84%
with these different clients,
I would have almost all

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:01.950 align:middle line:90%
of them were abductees.

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:05.048 align:middle line:84%
And then I contacted
the different people

00:15:05.048 --> 00:15:06.090 align:middle line:90%
that I was trained with--

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Male and female?

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.010 align:middle line:90%
Or was it--

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:09.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Male and female.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And I contacted the other
women I was trained with.

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And I said, are you
getting abductees?

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:18.000 align:middle line:90%
And they were like, no.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Like, uh, why am I getting
all the abductees, you know?

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.560 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.940 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing in my, like,
ego or anything that wanted to.

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.700 align:middle line:84%
But it was resonance
for some reason.

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Just to back up for a second,
you said you were working with

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:37.260 align:middle line:90%
these people.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.240 align:middle line:84%
What did you call
yourself, I guess?

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.560 align:middle line:90%
A spiritual healer?

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:44.180 align:middle line:90%
Or did you have a business card?

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.810 align:middle line:90%
>> I had a business card.

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:47.530 align:middle line:90%
I was a healer, I guess.

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:48.430 align:middle line:90%
So I was a healer.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:51.810 align:middle line:84%
I did different shamanic
work, trauma release,

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:52.850 align:middle line:90%
different stuff.

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And then, more of the
metaphysical things too.

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:57.270 align:middle line:84%
So it was just like
the full spectrum

00:15:57.270 --> 00:15:58.680 align:middle line:90%
of whatever was needed.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.060 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, gotcha.

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:01.290 align:middle line:90%
>> So I was healer.

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:06.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And then you had other, I
guess, coworkers, co-healers,

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.900 align:middle line:84%
that were also using the
same modalities to help other

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:10.710 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And that was colleagues
that you could consult with.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:16.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Got it.

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and none of
them had had this--

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:19.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And none of them
had had an abduction.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.023 align:middle line:84%
>> None of them were
getting abducted.

00:16:21.023 --> 00:16:23.910 align:middle line:84%
>> But had they heard of the
abduction phenomenon prior?

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:24.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:24.840 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And you had heard of
it, too, from movies?

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that, and it was
part of the healing training.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it was?

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, just like
a small segment.

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:34.290 align:middle line:90%
So it was acknowledged.

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:35.490 align:middle line:90%
And there was a checking.

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:37.163 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of like
a checklist of what

00:16:37.163 --> 00:16:38.580 align:middle line:84%
could be out of
alignment, or what

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:42.580 align:middle line:84%
could be the origin of
discomfort or trauma.

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And right there is, like,
implants, like alien abduction.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And so I'd have to go through it
every time, and every time that

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:51.930 align:middle line:90%
came up.

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:55.450 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, hmm,
it's coming up.

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:57.030 align:middle line:90%
I need to look at this.

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.870 align:middle line:90%
And so I did.

00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:59.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:00.510 align:middle line:90%
In what way?

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>> In the way that, well,
my dad was simultaneously

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:09.060 align:middle line:90%
in the conspiracy avenue.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And he was like,
there are aliens.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:11.790 align:middle line:90%
There's evidence.

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:13.069 align:middle line:90%
There's science.

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'm on this metaphysical,
like, healing side, being like,

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.630 align:middle line:84%
there's people saying
they're abducted.

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:20.319 align:middle line:84%
>> The government's
covering it up.

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:21.138 align:middle line:90%
It's a big thing.

00:17:21.138 --> 00:17:22.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I've been down that path.

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:23.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:27.510 align:middle line:84%
But it was good, because
there was the science evidence

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:30.420 align:middle line:84%
aspect, and then
there was me, like,

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:34.140 align:middle line:84%
having the
experiential situations

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.770 align:middle line:90%
going on with these clients.

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:38.400 align:middle line:84%
So we were, like, comparing and
contrasting notes, you know?

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.650 align:middle line:84%
He would be like, well, I
watched this abduction video

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:42.270 align:middle line:84%
where they were
taking eggs and semen.

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And then the person
would be like, yeah.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:47.140 align:middle line:90%
I saw myself on the table.

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:48.720 align:middle line:90%
And so I had no context.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And it was just what these
people were telling me.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And so it was two worlds
kind of converging

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.200 align:middle line:90%
to support this new idea.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:02.220 align:middle line:84%
>> About how long ago was
this, I guess, in day and age?

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:07.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess, this was
about four years ago,

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:08.730 align:middle line:90%
four or five years ago.

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:09.530 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:11.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:14.280 align:middle line:84%
>> So enough information
is out there,

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.320 align:middle line:84%
or had been out
there at that time,

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:20.430 align:middle line:84%
to kind of put the
puzzle pieces together.

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And you had different aspects
of the puzzle pieces, I see.

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.310 align:middle line:90%
So what happened after that?

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:29.160 align:middle line:84%
How did you help
these people who

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:34.727 align:middle line:84%
claim to have abductions
and implants too?

00:18:34.727 --> 00:18:36.060 align:middle line:90%
Did they claim to have implants?

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:36.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.230 align:middle line:84%
>> So how would you
go about helping them?

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we were told the
greater story of the Zetas.

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.830 align:middle line:90%
>> From--

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:50.010 align:middle line:84%
>> From the woman that was
putting this on, she had that

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:53.740 align:middle line:84%
perspective via Lisa Royal and
different people that she had

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:54.540 align:middle line:90%
studied.

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:55.498 align:middle line:90%
So there was the Zeta--

00:18:55.498 --> 00:18:59.960 align:middle line:84%
>> The woman who trained you
in the healing modalities?

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:00.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:01.560 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.480 align:middle line:84%
So you actually got
kind of a certification

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.490 align:middle line:90%
from her and stuff?

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:05.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:06.120 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, I see.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:09.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And so she had this
perspective of going, OK,

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.220 align:middle line:90%
the Grays were this.

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't have
emotion, so there was this.

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And then it caused
trauma in people.

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:20.370 align:middle line:84%
So we kind of had the
objective perspective

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:24.330 align:middle line:84%
as well as at that time, then,
I started listening to Bashar

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:25.500 align:middle line:90%
on the subject.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And he said the same thing,
parallel reality humans.

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.220 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know
what they were doing,

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:32.440 align:middle line:84%
soul agreements-- you
know, the different things.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:37.530 align:middle line:84%
So I went at it more from
a trauma perspective,

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:41.220 align:middle line:84%
rather than trying to cope
with the idea of aliens.

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.800 align:middle line:84%
It was like, OK,
this was a trauma.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And it kind of feels like
maybe a sexual trauma.

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:49.800 align:middle line:84%
It's like, how can
we look at that?

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And part of it, in any
kind of healing modality,

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:56.370 align:middle line:84%
is just acknowledgment,
just for it to be spoken.

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And then that energy
is, like, released.

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And so that was probably
like the biggest first step.

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't go into
it too much at that time.

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:08.040 align:middle line:84%
I went into more of the
other avenues that were up,

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.680 align:middle line:84%
but just acknowledging it and
going through it in the session

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.060 align:middle line:90%
was what I did.

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.927 align:middle line:84%
>> And by just bringing that
up and acknowledging it,

00:20:15.927 --> 00:20:18.510 align:middle line:84%
did you see a transformation in
the people that you're working

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:18.880 align:middle line:90%
with?

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:19.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Would they have memories
that they would recall?

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:23.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:24.760 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.240 align:middle line:90%
What was that like?

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, it was interesting,
because as you know with

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:37.790 align:middle line:84%
the abductees, it's like, it's
someone's personal experience.

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:38.700 align:middle line:90%
And that is powerful.

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:42.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And a lot of times, our
sexual organs and our body

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.950 align:middle line:90%
parts are very personal to us.

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:48.620 align:middle line:84%
So when those areas get
violated, it hits home.

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:49.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:50.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:54.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And so for me, it was just,
like, compassion and going,

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:56.340 align:middle line:90%
whoa.

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:59.820 align:middle line:84%
It just solidified
that reality for them--

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:01.590 align:middle line:90%
because it wasn't my reality--

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:02.910 align:middle line:90%
was real.

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And so it just brought that
to a deeper place in me.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:06.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:07.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:11.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And you worked with enough
people to verify that they

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.060 align:middle line:90%
weren't making it up.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:16.140 align:middle line:90%
And that's the thing.

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:18.690 align:middle line:84%
No one wants to make up
that they were abducted.

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:20.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that this
is, like, said enough.

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:24.210 align:middle line:84%
There's no catalyst
of popularity

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:26.105 align:middle line:84%
that is going to come
from saying that.

00:21:26.105 --> 00:21:27.070 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree.

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:28.765 align:middle line:90%
I've spoken to--

00:21:28.765 --> 00:21:30.140 align:middle line:84%
I think I mentioned
earlier, I've

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:34.530 align:middle line:84%
spoken to probably
over 100 contactees.

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:37.590 align:middle line:84%
Mix match, some
abductees, experiencers,

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:40.842 align:middle line:84%
contactees, there's
whole subcategories

00:21:40.842 --> 00:21:42.390 align:middle line:90%
of that whole batch.

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's very hard for
people to admit anything.

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's not
something you want to--

00:21:52.000 --> 00:22:01.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even government people
who have high level positions

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:04.180 align:middle line:84%
and have everything
in the world to lose

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:08.140 align:middle line:90%
by saying something like that.

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And they're very brave,
I think, the ones

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:13.140 align:middle line:84%
that do come forward
and speak of it.

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:14.560 align:middle line:90%
And they're very reluctant.

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:16.630 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them that
have kept secrets

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:22.030 align:middle line:90%
for 20, 30, 40, 50 years old.

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:24.610 align:middle line:90%
So no, I will emphasize.

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And we're emphasizing that
here on film to the public,

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:31.060 align:middle line:84%
people don't want to usually
talk about this stuff.

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:33.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:38.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So you said until that time,
you hadn't associated with

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:40.930 align:middle line:90%
a personal experience.

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:42.300 align:middle line:90%
Then what happened?

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Then, I had to
honor the fear.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.960 align:middle line:84%
Because I was like
OK, well, I might not

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.040 align:middle line:90%
have personal experience.

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:51.640 align:middle line:84%
But am I fearful
of this idea of ETs

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.930 align:middle line:84%
coming and taking
me out of my bed?

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:56.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, sure.

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:59.260 align:middle line:84%
It was a hypothetical
situation, still.

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And then I watched
"The Fourth Kind".

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And "The Fourth
Kind" changed it all.

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.870 align:middle line:90%
>> In a positive, negative way?

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:09.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Surprisingly, a positive way.

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:13.640 align:middle line:84%
Because the show
completely freaked me out.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:16.330 align:middle line:84%
So you would think that it would
have repelled me even farther

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:17.560 align:middle line:90%
from looking at it.

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:20.230 align:middle line:90%
But I'm strange.

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And so then, after
watching it, I

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.440 align:middle line:84%
knew about the idea
of hybrid children.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And so then I went to my
room and I just asked, like,

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:35.740 align:middle line:84%
with my full openness--
like, full heart--

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:38.920 align:middle line:84%
I will go down whatever
road this leads me.

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:41.140 align:middle line:90%
Do I have hybrid children?

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And well, actually, before
that, it was through the healing

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.710 align:middle line:84%
stuff, it showed that
you could be abducted

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:55.870 align:middle line:84%
in another life that was, like,
kind of simultaneous to now,

00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:57.010 align:middle line:90%
as well as this life.

00:23:57.010 --> 00:24:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked first, do I have
hybrid kids from another life?

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:03.620 align:middle line:84%
Still kind of, like,
pushing it away.

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:05.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Without asking the
question directly.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And then I was
just like through it.

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:12.220 align:middle line:84%
>> And just for people who are
watching who may not understand

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:13.540 align:middle line:90%
this, who would you ask?

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:16.700 align:middle line:90%
Is this like a prayer to God--

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a good question.

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:19.450 align:middle line:90%
>> --or to the universe?

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:21.033 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
people have different

00:24:21.033 --> 00:24:23.990 align:middle line:90%
labels for their belief system.

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:26.960 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just curious in how
would you present that.

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:27.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:33.130 align:middle line:84%
So by that time for me, I
had a pretty clear attunement

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:37.830 align:middle line:84%
to many streams of
different beings.

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:41.970 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, I'm like, I had a
very clear awareness of what

00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:45.480 align:middle line:84%
an angel felt like, or
what a guide felt like,

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:49.380 align:middle line:84%
or what an ancestor felt like,
these different frequencies

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:50.520 align:middle line:90%
of asking.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And within the healing
work that I did,

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:57.630 align:middle line:84%
it was all about creating
a real visceral experience

00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:00.930 align:middle line:84%
of your inter-dimensional
support team that you have.

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:03.510 align:middle line:84%
So, like, everyone
has guardian angels.

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:04.493 align:middle line:90%
Everyone has guides.

00:25:04.493 --> 00:25:05.910 align:middle line:84%
>> When you say
inter-dimensional,

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:07.170 align:middle line:84%
that could also be
extra-dimensional?

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:07.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:11.070 align:middle line:84%
>> So just these
otherworldly beings?

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:13.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Otherworldy beings, yeah.

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And so I cultivated that really
strong communication conduit

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:22.980 align:middle line:84%
to my own guidance system,
as well as my higher self.

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:26.070 align:middle line:84%
So it would be my guidance
system and my higher self

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:27.450 align:middle line:90%
that I'd be asking.

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And probably, for
this question, I

00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:31.720 align:middle line:84%
was probably asking
the source itself.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.320 align:middle line:90%
Like, all right, let's have it.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.900 align:middle line:84%
>> All of you guides,
and the big cheese.

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:37.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.980 align:middle line:90%
Is this the case?

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:42.340 align:middle line:90%
>> And what was your answer?

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>> The biggest yes I
have ever received.

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.960 align:middle line:90%
Like, it just hit me so hard.

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.260 align:middle line:90%
And I just started bawling.

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And it opened this
emotional conduit in me

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:57.250 align:middle line:84%
that I don't think I had had
this emotional an experience.

00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:02.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And up until this, you hadn't
had any conscious of sightings

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:05.490 align:middle line:84%
or lost time or
abduction-type things?

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:07.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Not that I remembered.

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:11.940 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that was sticky
that I could kind of look back

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:19.440 align:middle line:84%
to was when I was, like,
just after elementary school

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.800 align:middle line:84%
pubescent, I kept on having
this really strong feeling

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.950 align:middle line:90%
that I was pregnant a lot.

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:27.090 align:middle line:90%
And I was a virgin.

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And so that stuck
with me my whole life,

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:35.050 align:middle line:84%
because I would always
say it to my mom.

00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And she would say
that I was strange.

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And really, like, no,
you're not pregnant.

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:42.832 align:middle line:90%
>> You're only pubescent.

00:26:42.832 --> 00:26:44.473 align:middle line:90%
How could you be pregnant?

00:26:44.473 --> 00:26:45.390 align:middle line:90%
You're just pubescent.

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:49.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.760 align:middle line:90%
So that stuck.

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.460 align:middle line:90%
That was, like, there.

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>> So that was always
there, even before you asked

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:56.580 align:middle line:90%
the question?

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:58.330 align:middle line:84%
It was a little kind
of, that was strange.

00:26:58.330 --> 00:26:59.580 align:middle line:90%
>> That was strange.

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And looking back
on it now, I mean,

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.910 align:middle line:84%
a lot of different
memories have come back up.

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:07.110 align:middle line:84%
But another thing that is
strange that I haven't even

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:11.560 align:middle line:84%
put together really, until this
past year, is from about age 8

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:16.650 align:middle line:84%
to age 12, I would create
these really large families

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:18.030 align:middle line:90%
of paper dolls--

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:23.610 align:middle line:84%
like children and parents of
all different shapes and sizes.

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And my cousin and I would create
little videos of these families

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:30.180 align:middle line:90%
in these different scenarios.

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And just the way that we did
it was not just like playing.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.420 align:middle line:84%
Like, there was some kind
of an intimate relationship.

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And there were way too
many kids and certain style

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.030 align:middle line:84%
that both of us
were coming from.

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:48.000 align:middle line:90%
It was very odd and interesting.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.180 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like that
was remembrance

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:56.160 align:middle line:84%
and a bringing through of things
I had seen on the ship that

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.930 align:middle line:90%
was coming through.

00:27:57.930 --> 00:27:59.410 align:middle line:90%
>> So you asked the question.

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:02.070 align:middle line:84%
You got a big knock
on the head, yes.

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Immediately, did
memories and visions

00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:07.320 align:middle line:84%
start pulling through
of experiences?

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Or how did you start to
come to that realization?

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.210 align:middle line:84%
What was the
validation, I guess?

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:13.710 align:middle line:84%
If you got a yes,
I'm sure there had

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:15.030 align:middle line:90%
to be some sort of validation.

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:19.850 align:middle line:84%
The validation-- I guess
this is almost an answer

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:24.060 align:middle line:84%
to your question-- but
was I could hear them.

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Could hear the kids?

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:28.950 align:middle line:90%
>> So the yes was from the kids.

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:30.000 align:middle line:90%
And I could hear them.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.080 align:middle line:90%
And it was a portal.

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And it was an energy
stream from certain beings

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:36.480 align:middle line:84%
that I had never
heard from before.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And so the full building of
the spectrum of all the beings

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:44.580 align:middle line:84%
that I was connected
to validated, like,

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:49.470 align:middle line:84%
my communication
and my confidence

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:51.570 align:middle line:90%
with these certain beings.

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:54.990 align:middle line:84%
So by the time these kids
started talking, I'm going,

00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:56.160 align:middle line:90%
that's a new branch.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.500 align:middle line:90%
Like, this is a new energy.

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.120 align:middle line:90%
This is a new thing.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And so that was validating based
on all the other things that

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:10.350 align:middle line:84%
had built up my confidence
in this healing extrasensory

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:11.460 align:middle line:90%
arena.

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:12.610 align:middle line:90%
>> So what happened next?

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:15.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, after that, you
got hit in the head.

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:16.690 align:middle line:90%
>> After that?

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Then you started
hearing these voices.

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Did you communicate
back with them?

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:24.780 align:middle line:90%
Did you have conversations?

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:32.200 align:middle line:84%
>> For the next,
probably five months,

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:36.340 align:middle line:84%
I had to sleep on it for
five months, pretty much.

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:38.730 align:middle line:90%
I knew that it was true.

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:41.530 align:middle line:84%
But I was not ready to
go forward or do anything

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:42.330 align:middle line:90%
with that.

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Like, it was just sitting kind
of, like, dormant, waiting

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:50.320 align:middle line:90%
to like burst to another level.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.680 align:middle line:84%
So I just kind of
sat with it and let

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.210 align:middle line:90%
it digest for that long.

00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:55.170 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:57.270 align:middle line:84%
Was there any more
communication then?

00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:58.320 align:middle line:90%
Or, you just shut it off.

00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.820 align:middle line:90%
You're like, OK, I got this.

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:00.870 align:middle line:90%
And it's enough.

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:01.910 align:middle line:90%
Let me sit on this.

00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Or, I guess, did you sit on
it with more downloads, or no?

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:08.160 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:10.985 align:middle line:90%
No, I just sat with it.

00:30:10.985 --> 00:30:12.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Didn't ask any
more questions?

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't ask.

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:15.560 align:middle line:84%
That was the only
question that needed

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:16.860 align:middle line:90%
to be asked at that moment.

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:18.455 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, gotcha.

00:30:18.455 --> 00:30:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And then what happened
after the five months?

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:21.240 align:middle line:90%
What decided?

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I went to a Bashar
session, a live Bashar.

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:25.118 align:middle line:90%
And I got called.

00:30:25.118 --> 00:30:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And that was the first
time that I had ever

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:28.800 align:middle line:90%
talked to Bashar live.

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>> When you got called,
what does that mean?

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:35.610 align:middle line:84%
>> In live sessions, they
draw names, and I got drawn.

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:39.690 align:middle line:84%
I think I got drawn
first or something crazy.

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:41.185 align:middle line:90%
And I went up.

00:30:41.185 --> 00:30:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And I already knew the answer,
do I have hybrid children?

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.360 align:middle line:90%
I knew that.

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:47.140 align:middle line:90%


00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:48.990 align:middle line:90%
But he validated it.

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And then he proceeded--
and it's funny.

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:54.560 align:middle line:90%
It's on YouTube, this video.

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.040 align:middle line:90%
And I hadn't heard it for years.

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And I heard it probably
six months ago.

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:00.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Maybe we'll cut to a little--

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:03.240 align:middle line:84%
if it's OK, I'll cut to that and
so the audience can see that.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:06.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:10.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm really excited about this.

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:13.050 align:middle line:10%
>> As are we.

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:14.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect.

00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:15.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it is.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.210 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, I have a few questions.

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:18.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:22.950 align:middle line:84%
>> So one of my questions
is there are, as you said,

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:26.280 align:middle line:90%
five hybrid races.

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:29.340 align:middle line:84%
But you've talked briefly
on one of your transmissions

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:34.380 align:middle line:84%
about a sixth that doesn't
have a necessary civilization

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:36.900 align:middle line:90%
because they're wanderers?

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:37.740 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no, no.

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:39.032 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you please explain that?

00:31:39.032 --> 00:31:41.610 align:middle line:84%
>> The wanderers are a different
group of entities altogether

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:45.060 align:middle line:84%
that may touch in now and then
to different civilizations,

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:47.580 align:middle line:84%
remaining relatively
loosely connected through

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:51.510 align:middle line:84%
their incarnations, simply as
gatherers of information that

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:54.250 align:middle line:84%
aid and assist in a
variety of projects,

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:58.230 align:middle line:84%
including the idea of
contact, including the idea

00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:middle line:90%
of the hybridization program.

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:03.720 align:middle line:84%
But they are not, themselves,
the sixth hybrid race.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:07.440 align:middle line:84%
Earth will be the
sixth hybrid race.

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And you are in the process now
of taking the hybridization

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:14.880 align:middle line:84%
that you already are and
transforming it into something

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.650 align:middle line:90%
even more different.

00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:20.380 align:middle line:84%
The Earth shall eventually
become the sixth hybrid race.

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And once the Earth
has created itself

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:27.840 align:middle line:84%
to be the sixth hybrid race,
then all six hybrid races

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:31.170 align:middle line:84%
will again blend
into a new form that

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:34.140 align:middle line:84%
will be the seventh hybrid
race, unlike anything you

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:36.270 align:middle line:84%
have ever seen, unlike
anything that has ever

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:38.160 align:middle line:90%
existed within creation.

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And it will be expressed
in a very different way

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:44.310 align:middle line:84%
of inter-dimensionality
that will be-- well,

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:46.590 align:middle line:84%
I'll just put it in your
old-fashioned terms--

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:47.750 align:middle line:90%
mind-blowing.

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:51.250 align:middle line:90%


00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:53.020 align:middle line:90%
>> That's very cool.

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:53.820 align:middle line:90%
I mean, hot.

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:54.620 align:middle line:90%
It's very hot.

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:57.640 align:middle line:90%


00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:00.000 align:middle line:84%
We have young people here
that have that term, cool.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, we understand.

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:02.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:07.185 align:middle line:84%
So, am I interacting with
any of these hybrid races?

00:33:07.185 --> 00:33:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Am I going to be
working with them?

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:09.940 align:middle line:90%
>> You are.

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:11.430 align:middle line:90%
>> In what way?

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:13.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I cannot spill
all your beans.

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect.

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:17.730 align:middle line:10%
>> But you will find that
you have some connection

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:20.850 align:middle line:10%
to the children to some
degree, that will be returned

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:25.590 align:middle line:10%
to your planet eventually, and
take up residence in certain

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:30.330 align:middle line:10%
enclaves that will be safe
places for them to acclimatize

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:35.040 align:middle line:10%
to your reality, and allow your
reality to get used to them

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.120 align:middle line:10%
as well.

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:38.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Specific
geographic locations?

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:39.198 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:33:39.198 --> 00:33:40.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Exciting.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Do they have anything to do with
the chakra points of the Earth?

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:50.330 align:middle line:84%
>> In some senses, you will find
that the vibrations that exist

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:54.190 align:middle line:84%
in those vortices you call
chakra points upon the Earth

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:57.320 align:middle line:84%
are that which will allow
for certain balances to occur

00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:00.110 align:middle line:84%
and the overall vibration of
your planet that will allow

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:05.270 align:middle line:84%
for easier acclimatization
of the hybrid children

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:06.530 align:middle line:90%
to your world.

00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:09.570 align:middle line:90%
So it is involved, yes.

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:10.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:12.830 align:middle line:90%
Do I have any hybrid children?

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:13.730 align:middle line:90%
>> You have a few.

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:14.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.550 align:middle line:84%
Can I know anything
more about them?

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:17.350 align:middle line:90%
>> You can.

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:20.300 align:middle line:90%
>> What can I know?

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:23.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Why not ask them?

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:24.110 align:middle line:90%
>> I will.

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:25.239 align:middle line:90%
I will continue to.

00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:26.039 align:middle line:90%
I have.

00:34:26.039 --> 00:34:29.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Allow yourself to go
into now meditations.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.219 align:middle line:10%
Understand that the beginning of
this process we have initiated

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:36.949 align:middle line:10%
this day of your time,
will aid and assist

00:34:36.949 --> 00:34:39.620 align:middle line:10%
in the acceleration of
energy on your planet

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:43.670 align:middle line:10%
in a very specific
frequency that will make it

00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:48.320 align:middle line:10%
much easier for all
of you, when you

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:51.199 align:middle line:10%
go into the proper state
that is representative

00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:54.770 align:middle line:10%
of your excitement of your
balance of your piece,

00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:59.870 align:middle line:10%
to allow you to perceive and
receive and experience greater

00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:03.020 align:middle line:10%
forms of contact between
the hybrid children,

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:05.480 align:middle line:10%
between other
civilizations and yourself.

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:10.520 align:middle line:84%
This declarations vibration
is specifically tuned

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:13.490 align:middle line:84%
to be capable of
increasing your ability

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:18.260 align:middle line:84%
to be a receiving antenna for
the particular frequencies that

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:23.210 align:middle line:84%
are germane to the idea of
contact in all its forms.

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:25.340 align:middle line:90%
So take advantage of that.

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:26.750 align:middle line:90%
Ride that wave.

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:28.340 align:middle line:90%
Be in that state.

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Even reading the
declaration to yourself,

00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:35.480 align:middle line:84%
going into a meditative
state after reading it,

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.780 align:middle line:84%
will put you at the
proper frequency domain

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:42.980 align:middle line:84%
to receive more communication,
more understanding, and more

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:45.350 align:middle line:84%
awareness of all the
different phases that

00:35:45.350 --> 00:35:47.820 align:middle line:90%
are involved in contact.

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:48.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:50.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for
that permission slip.

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:51.334 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:51.334 --> 00:35:53.772 align:middle line:90%


00:35:53.772 --> 00:35:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>> How did you feel
after all that?

00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:59.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it was really
interesting, because I asked,

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:01.560 align:middle line:84%
do they have any
messages for me?

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, why
don't you ask them?

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:06.290 align:middle line:90%
So it was interesting.

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So looking back at
that now, it's just like--

00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm like, holy--

00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow, this is so funny.

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:11.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:12.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Like, he knew, kind of.

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>> He knew.

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:16.710 align:middle line:90%
He's like, we talk every night.

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:18.580 align:middle line:90%
You're in.

00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:19.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:20.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:22.320 align:middle line:84%
>> You found out you
have hybrid children.

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.600 align:middle line:90%
You're part of this program.

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:27.840 align:middle line:90%
What is the program, if you can?

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:28.820 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:31.410 align:middle line:90%
>> The program.

00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:35.280 align:middle line:84%
It's a program designed
to help wake up humanity.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, the program designed
to help wake up humanity.

00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:47.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And, connect earth with
its greater other aspects,

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:49.300 align:middle line:90%
its galactic family.

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:53.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's to merge galactic
family with the Earth family,

00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:54.910 align:middle line:90%
as well as wake up humanity.

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And all those are waking
up humanity, that process.

00:36:57.850 --> 00:37:00.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's a
multi-level-type program.

00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:01.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:04.870 align:middle line:90%
There's many reasons to it, yes.

00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:06.760 align:middle line:90%
>> And one of them, which--

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:08.320 align:middle line:84%
like I said, is the
first time I even

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:11.760 align:middle line:84%
heard it put it that way,
to help wake up humanity.

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And I can totally
see that happening.

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:19.790 align:middle line:84%
But usually, it's perceived
in a negative context.

00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:20.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:24.010 align:middle line:84%
It starts with like
the understanding

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:27.490 align:middle line:84%
of maybe a negative context
through the abduction program,

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:30.340 align:middle line:84%
which most people
know about, which

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:34.510 align:middle line:84%
is a connection of
the Zeta reticuli,

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:38.170 align:middle line:84%
which is a parallel
reality human,

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:43.120 align:middle line:84%
and also is part of our
original DNA strand in us,

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:44.200 align:middle line:90%
which is kind of freaky.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:47.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's like they're
taking themselves,

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:50.680 align:middle line:84%
because it's themselves
in another dimension,

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:54.070 align:middle line:84%
as well as we have
that genetics in us.

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:55.960 align:middle line:90%
So it's like taking family.

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:59.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's much more
intertwined and at home

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:03.430 align:middle line:84%
than seems to be some, like,
beings like from another world,

00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:05.230 align:middle line:90%
being like, ah.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:06.830 align:middle line:90%
It's closer to home.

00:38:06.830 --> 00:38:09.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, but many aspects.

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:13.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's multi-dimensional as far
as them being an aspect of us

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:14.890 align:middle line:90%
having their DNA.

00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:16.100 align:middle line:90%
It's not just one thing.

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:17.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:20.170 align:middle line:90%


00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:21.150 align:middle line:90%
So within that--

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:22.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Within that program--

00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:25.885 align:middle line:84%
>> --within that program,
within all of that stuff--

00:38:25.885 --> 00:38:27.640 align:middle line:90%
>> --intergalactic contact.

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:29.050 align:middle line:90%
>> --that's going to wake us up.

00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:31.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's going
to jostle people.

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:36.350 align:middle line:10%
That's going to set off every
trigger of the ego perceivable.

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:37.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it has.

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:42.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you talk to any of
the thousands of abductees--

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:46.090 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of thousands,
and estimated millions--

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:48.970 align:middle line:84%
then, it's rocked
some worlds out there.

00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:51.688 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, definitely
rocks some worlds.

00:38:51.688 --> 00:38:53.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Sounds like your world
was rocked a little bit, too.

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:54.910 align:middle line:10%
>> Rocked my world.

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:57.350 align:middle line:90%
Changed my world.

00:38:57.350 --> 00:39:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And in the program,
which is commonly known,

00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:07.930 align:middle line:84%
semen and eggs, genetic material
is taken from these abductees.

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And that is meant to create
other beings meant to create

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:14.680 align:middle line:90%
the five hybrid civilizations--

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:17.770 align:middle line:84%
five different hybrid
civilizations-- as well as

00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:21.490 align:middle line:84%
the hybrid children, also
known as the freelancers.

00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And these particular
kids are the ones

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:25.060 align:middle line:90%
going to be coming to Earth.

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:28.900 align:middle line:84%
So it's five civilizations
that have their own planets,

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:33.310 align:middle line:84%
have evolved on, as well as
these kids coming to Earth.

00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And all this has taken place in,
give or take, about a 100 year

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.540 align:middle line:90%
period of Earth time.

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:40.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:44.120 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, when you
say it in that sense,

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:48.790 align:middle line:84%
so I've heard Bashar mention
five different hybrid races.

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:53.180 align:middle line:84%
Until now, I didn't even piece
it together-- hybrids from us,

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:53.980 align:middle line:90%
from humans.

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:59.080 align:middle line:84%
So humanity is
responsible for kind

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:06.340 align:middle line:84%
of igniting five other
civilizations on other planets?

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:07.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:08.350 align:middle line:90%
They each have their own planet.

00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:09.808 align:middle line:84%
>> They each have
their own planet.

00:40:09.808 --> 00:40:13.670 align:middle line:90%
And so, wow, humans.

00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:15.547 align:middle line:90%
>> We're their ancestors.

00:40:15.547 --> 00:40:16.630 align:middle line:10%
>> And we don't even know.

00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:17.590 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:21.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Our DNA is
seeding these others,

00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:25.600 align:middle line:84%
which makes you kind of think
how many other civilizations

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:26.800 align:middle line:90%
seeded humanity?

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:31.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I like that tie-in.

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:38.140 align:middle line:84%
>> And if so, were those races
even aware or conscious that

00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:41.860 align:middle line:84%
they were seeding another
civilization at the time?

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:45.790 align:middle line:84%
So that's the big
question you always

00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:49.330 align:middle line:84%
see on "Ancient Aliens"
are we're aliens.

00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:50.950 align:middle line:90%
You know, where do we come from?

00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:53.650 align:middle line:90%
The missing DNA chromosome.

00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:56.400 align:middle line:84%
We had a genetic
leap from the apes.

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:57.200 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.930 align:middle line:90%
Where did that come from?

00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:00.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:01.840 align:middle line:90%
We're hybrids.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And distinguishing that-- I
guess at this moment, is good--

00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:08.890 align:middle line:84%
is that we're all
hybrids, and that it's

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:15.700 align:middle line:84%
a part of the greater galactic
story that we seed each other--

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:18.520 align:middle line:84%
that we seed consciousness,
that we seed beings.

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:23.200 align:middle line:84%
So say, the abduction program
taken just in that context,

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.050 align:middle line:90%
it might seem weird.

00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:27.880 align:middle line:84%
But in a greater context, it's
like, well, who seeded us?

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And with that, to my
knowledge or what I've gotten,

00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:36.700 align:middle line:84%
is that there's seven different
extraterrestrial genetics that

00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:40.090 align:middle line:84%
are involved in
the seeding of us.

00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:43.680 align:middle line:90%
And they have then gone forward.

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And so we have those
lineages in us.

00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's why our
genetic material

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:52.840 align:middle line:84%
is awesome for the
Grays to utilize

00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:55.900 align:middle line:84%
in creating the hybrid
civilizations, as well

00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:57.580 align:middle line:90%
as the hybrid children.

00:41:57.580 --> 00:41:58.720 align:middle line:90%
>> So you mentioned Grays.

00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:02.960 align:middle line:84%
Let's just kind of
identify that a little bit.

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Grays, meaning, is that the
typical term for the beings

00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:09.980 align:middle line:90%
from the Zeta reticuli?

00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:10.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:14.650 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's mostly these
beings that you see in movies.

00:42:14.650 --> 00:42:17.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, big eyes, big heads.

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:18.310 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot different kinds.

00:42:18.310 --> 00:42:21.160 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's ones that are
super negatively-oriented, ones

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:24.390 align:middle line:84%
that have worked
with the government.

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:26.780 align:middle line:84%
There's a few different
kinds, different timelines.

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>> So we can say--

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:29.840 align:middle line:90%
and I'm glad you mentioned that.

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:33.130 align:middle line:84%
So we see these Gray
beings, doesn't necessarily

00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:36.940 align:middle line:84%
mean just like with humans,
we have different color skin

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:38.980 align:middle line:90%
humans.

00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Not all the Grays-- even
though they may be grayish--

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:44.080 align:middle line:90%
are there some brown Grays?

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:46.600 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that they're
all pretty gray.

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:50.380 align:middle line:84%
But they could have
different same motivations

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:52.990 align:middle line:90%
or different energies.

00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:56.620 align:middle line:84%
So there are some that are,
like, incredibly benevolent.

00:42:56.620 --> 00:43:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
some that have really

00:43:00.310 --> 00:43:04.060 align:middle line:84%
taken a turn based on
this hybrid program,

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:08.140 align:middle line:84%
and come to a little bit
more of a balanced place.

00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So you think initially,
the ones before they engaged

00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:19.760 align:middle line:84%
into this hybridization
program, were maybe not as nice?

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:22.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there they're
fifth dimensional beings,

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:23.800 align:middle line:90%
but they're negatively-oriented.

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:25.930 align:middle line:90%
So they have all the technology.

00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:28.810 align:middle line:84%
They have of the
genetic know-how.

00:43:28.810 --> 00:43:29.950 align:middle line:90%
They have all of that.

00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:31.510 align:middle line:84%
But they are
negatively-oriented,

00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:33.710 align:middle line:90%
and they're more hive mentality.

00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And so at the beginning
of the program,

00:43:35.770 --> 00:43:37.930 align:middle line:90%
it was a lot more intense.

00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:41.740 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know how to work
with humans because they

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:44.680 align:middle line:84%
genetically modified their
emotions out of themselves.

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:49.510 align:middle line:84%
But through this program,
we sparked something in them

00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:54.480 align:middle line:84%
that made them, to the
best of their ability,

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:56.970 align:middle line:84%
understand more of
the emotional body,

00:43:56.970 --> 00:43:58.650 align:middle line:84%
and start to
understand how to work

00:43:58.650 --> 00:44:05.640 align:middle line:84%
with us in a way that doesn't
completely freak us out.

00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:10.500 align:middle line:84%
>> So probably, the abductions
that are happening now are less

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:14.130 align:middle line:84%
aggressive, a little more
compassionate than maybe some

00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:18.010 align:middle line:84%
of the abductions that were
happening 10 or 20 years ago,

00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:18.810 align:middle line:90%
in the early days.

00:44:18.810 --> 00:44:23.850 align:middle line:84%
In the Benny and Barney
Hill, the Whitney Strieber

00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:27.520 align:middle line:84%
and some of these early records
that we have of this happening.

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:28.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:29.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:30.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:32.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there still bad
ones out there, you think?

00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:33.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:35.130 align:middle line:90%
>> When we say bad?

00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:39.040 align:middle line:84%
You know, I mean like ones
that aren't as compassionate,

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:40.328 align:middle line:90%
I would say, like that.

00:44:40.328 --> 00:44:42.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And for the most part, most
of the Zeta reticuli have died

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:43.670 align:middle line:90%
off.

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:47.880 align:middle line:84%
That's why there was an
urgency to do this, you know.

00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:53.150 align:middle line:90%
Because they couldn't reproduce.

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And so they needed
a way to continue on

00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:00.870 align:middle line:84%
in a way that was continuing
on with them, which is us,

00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:02.100 align:middle line:90%
in a different way.

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:04.550 align:middle line:90%
So, yes.

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:05.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.690 align:middle line:90%


00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:13.820 align:middle line:84%
So we've got more than five,
or around five races out there

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:17.360 align:middle line:84%
with humans kind of
helping to seed that.

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:18.330 align:middle line:90%
What's the next steps?

00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:19.380 align:middle line:90%
Where do we go from here?

00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:21.350 align:middle line:90%
>> The next steps.

00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:27.800 align:middle line:84%
The next steps are that
there's many different possible

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:30.350 align:middle line:84%
timelines of what
is going to happen.

00:45:30.350 --> 00:45:34.310 align:middle line:84%
So then we get into more of
the timeline metaphysical

00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:40.100 align:middle line:84%
probability of someone's
personal incarnational choice.

00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And through that,
there's timelines.

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Because right now is when the
Grays split off from human.

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:50.210 align:middle line:84%
This is like us right
now, in the future,

00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:54.560 align:middle line:84%
in a certain timeline
became a Gray.

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Genetically modified
ourselves, went underground

00:45:57.050 --> 00:46:01.590 align:middle line:84%
in underground tunnels and,
like, evolved in a certain way,

00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:04.010 align:middle line:84%
with focus on the
intellect versus emotion.

00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:06.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Did they say why they went
to the underground tunnels?

00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:09.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, because they started
destroying the planet too much.

00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:12.950 align:middle line:84%
But my personal opinion is
that it's like the government

00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:14.840 align:middle line:90%
underground scenario.

00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:18.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of future
government ended up

00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:19.910 align:middle line:90%
becoming that.

00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:23.180 align:middle line:90%
It's my own kind of take on it.

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:24.660 align:middle line:90%
>> So, Grays are humans?

00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:28.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but just mutated
humans from a different parallel

00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:30.880 align:middle line:90%
reality Earth.

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:33.155 align:middle line:84%
So it's not necessarily
like this Earth, you know?

00:46:33.155 --> 00:46:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you go
out to outer space,

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.820 align:middle line:84%
you end up bumping
into Earth again?

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Could be, in a
future timeline.

00:46:40.310 --> 00:46:43.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's all so
intertwined, you know?

00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:45.750 align:middle line:84%
>> It's kind of starting to
make sense to me a little bit.

00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:47.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm seeing different things.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm hearing different things.

00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:51.215 align:middle line:84%
But we'll let the audience
decide if it makes sense

00:46:51.215 --> 00:46:52.510 align:middle line:90%
to them or not.

00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:55.220 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, that
totally makes sense.

00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:57.230 align:middle line:84%
You know, you have the
whole Denver airport

00:46:57.230 --> 00:47:00.290 align:middle line:84%
big underground
tunnel thing, with all

00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:04.890 align:middle line:84%
the craziness and
underground dulce.

00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And you have all of
this stuff, you know?

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And George Bush buying up
all the mountains in Europe

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:16.510 align:middle line:84%
and, like, building
caves and caverns.

00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:21.150 align:middle line:84%
So I can see how
humanity could have gone,

00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:23.220 align:middle line:84%
or still, I guess,
could go that direction.

00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:24.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.500 align:middle line:10%
And then the other one,
the other direction--

00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:27.500 align:middle line:10%
>> The other direction--

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:30.120 align:middle line:10%
>> --which is my
direction, my focus,

00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:36.240 align:middle line:10%
I would say your focus too,
is the complete and utter

00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:38.580 align:middle line:10%
transformation into
the fifth dimension,

00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:44.340 align:middle line:10%
and the shifting of Earth
to a healed space and, like,

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:47.190 align:middle line:10%
a united humanity and oneness.

00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:49.990 align:middle line:90%
And galactic contact.

00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:51.300 align:middle line:90%
So that is the other timeline.

00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:52.980 align:middle line:90%
>> So they kind of saw.

00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Since they lived that
timeline, they kind of saw,

00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:57.772 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is what happens
if we make these choices

00:47:57.772 --> 00:47:58.980 align:middle line:90%
and we live in this timeline.

00:47:58.980 --> 00:47:59.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:05.070 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's go back, and let's
tell ourselves a different

00:48:05.070 --> 00:48:06.360 align:middle line:90%
story.

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And let's create a
different future,

00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:11.130 align:middle line:84%
because living in
underground tunnels

00:48:11.130 --> 00:48:14.310 align:middle line:84%
because the world's too
toxic to live in, sucks.

00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:15.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:16.440 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't end up working.

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:48:19.770 --> 00:48:22.710 align:middle line:84%
>> It hits me really deep
to think that the most kind

00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:24.960 align:middle line:84%
of negative-- like, it's
like, oh, the government, oh,

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:25.940 align:middle line:90%
Monsanto--

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:29.220 align:middle line:84%
that they end up
going so far down

00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:34.220 align:middle line:84%
into the depths of
darkness, that they end up

00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:37.460 align:middle line:84%
coming back full
circle, which is

00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:41.630 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful exercise in, like,
darkness to light, you know?

00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And a different
perspective on looking

00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:46.730 align:middle line:84%
at this simultaneous
government that we see.

00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:50.390 align:middle line:84%
All of the realities are,
like, all jumbled right now.

00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll
start breaking off.

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:54.320 align:middle line:90%
But right now, it's like, OK.

00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:55.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, wow.

00:48:55.770 --> 00:48:56.570 align:middle line:90%
The chemtrails.

00:48:56.570 --> 00:49:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Like, you end up saving me,
like, in a different version,

00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:00.860 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And so it puts it
into perspective.

00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:06.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:09.285 align:middle line:84%
Many different perspectives,
but yes, a perspective.

00:49:09.285 --> 00:49:10.660 align:middle line:84%
>> It puts it into
a perspective.

00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:12.202 align:middle line:84%
>> It does put it
into a perspective.

00:49:12.202 --> 00:49:14.780 align:middle line:90%
You have a little mothy thing.

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:16.450 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:17.620 align:middle line:90%
It's your friend.

00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:18.420 align:middle line:90%
Hi, friend.

00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:19.850 align:middle line:84%
OK, now you can
come say hi to me.

00:49:19.850 --> 00:49:20.720 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:23.380 align:middle line:84%
I just got attacked by
the same mothy thing.

00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:24.510 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:26.240 align:middle line:90%
Daniel?

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:27.890 align:middle line:90%
Do we just keep going?

00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:29.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:31.220 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>> That'll be fun B-roll.

00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:36.320 align:middle line:84%
So getting back to
the hybrid children--

00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:39.380 align:middle line:84%
because that's your
focus right now--

00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:45.230 align:middle line:84%
can you tell us how that
started, and where are we at?

00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:48.800 align:middle line:84%
Catch us up to speed with
the whole children project.

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:52.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, how it started was
through the mixing of the DNA

00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:54.230 align:middle line:90%
in the abduction program.

00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:57.320 align:middle line:84%
So they would use
the human genetics,

00:49:57.320 --> 00:50:01.130 align:middle line:84%
and then mix it with the Gray
genetics, do their stuff,

00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:03.800 align:middle line:84%
and then create
these kids from that.

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:05.495 align:middle line:84%
And there's been
different generations.

00:50:05.495 --> 00:50:09.410 align:middle line:84%
The first ones were very
sickly and didn't make it.

00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:13.650 align:middle line:84%
The later ones did make
it and are thriving.

00:50:13.650 --> 00:50:15.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And what was the
reason for not making it?

00:50:15.770 --> 00:50:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>> The reason for not making
it was the lack of humanity.

00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:23.164 align:middle line:90%
>> The lack of humanity?

00:50:23.164 --> 00:50:24.890 align:middle line:84%
>> The lack of
nurture, you know?

00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:31.550 align:middle line:84%
It's this idea that science
and genetics, and even

00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:33.260 align:middle line:84%
their energetic
know-how of, like,

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:38.720 align:middle line:84%
creating an energetic template
vessel for incarnation,

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:41.010 align:middle line:90%
they could do all of that stuff.

00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:44.300 align:middle line:84%
But when it came down
to it, these kids

00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:46.820 align:middle line:84%
couldn't make it
because of a lack

00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:52.450 align:middle line:84%
of this missing link of
love, of, like, emotion

00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:53.410 align:middle line:90%
and of connection.

00:50:53.410 --> 00:50:56.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So literally, they went
so far in their intellect,

00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:59.380 align:middle line:84%
that their lack
of emotions has--

00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:02.380 align:middle line:90%


00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:05.390 align:middle line:84%
it's like the missing link
that they still, even that far

00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:08.210 align:middle line:84%
advanced, even
that far evolved--

00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:11.270 align:middle line:84%
thousands, if not millions
of years in the future--

00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:14.860 align:middle line:84%
they're missing
the one component

00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:17.920 align:middle line:90%
that we all know creates life.

00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:19.110 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter--

00:51:19.110 --> 00:51:20.590 align:middle line:90%
>> --what planet.

00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:23.110 align:middle line:84%
>> --what planet we're in,
what religion I guess you are,

00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:26.110 align:middle line:84%
from what part of
humanity you're from.

00:51:26.110 --> 00:51:29.230 align:middle line:84%
But we all know in
every movie, that's

00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:32.560 align:middle line:84%
the big lesson in everything
in all of our stories,

00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:35.440 align:middle line:84%
and our religions, and
our science fiction.

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:36.770 align:middle line:90%
Everything is love.

00:51:36.770 --> 00:51:39.130 align:middle line:90%
It's all about love.

00:51:39.130 --> 00:51:42.055 align:middle line:90%
So that's the missing link.

00:51:42.055 --> 00:51:43.180 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the missing link.

00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:44.430 align:middle line:90%
>> --that they have forgotten.

00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:46.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:47.530 align:middle line:90%
And the human mothers--

00:51:47.530 --> 00:51:51.660 align:middle line:84%
there were some human mothers
amongst the fearful scenario

00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:54.490 align:middle line:84%
of being abducted--
could maintain

00:51:54.490 --> 00:51:59.740 align:middle line:84%
this love for their
alien mutated child.

00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And nurture them to the degree
that they could thrive--

00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:08.090 align:middle line:84%
well, could survive, and
then eventually thrive.

00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:11.200 align:middle line:90%
And so that altered the race.

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:13.360 align:middle line:90%
And it also altered--

00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:16.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that was a big
shift, I think, even

00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:21.130 align:middle line:84%
in the human collective,
to be able to love.

00:52:21.130 --> 00:52:24.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it is your offspring,
but to love something alien,

00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:25.530 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:52:25.530 --> 00:52:28.390 align:middle line:84%
and it's this mixing
that's happening.

00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And much of this is happening
in the sub and unconscious.

00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:35.320 align:middle line:90%
It's like hidden away memories.

00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:39.130 align:middle line:84%
But it is shifting
and now translating

00:52:39.130 --> 00:52:42.490 align:middle line:84%
into the collective
consciousness

00:52:42.490 --> 00:52:43.655 align:middle line:90%
in a really powerful way.

00:52:43.655 --> 00:52:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm just going to
mention something.

00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:47.800 align:middle line:84%
So actually, I
recently saw TED Talks

00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:51.520 align:middle line:84%
of this autistic boy
who-- or at least, he

00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:53.350 align:middle line:90%
was diagnosed with autism.

00:52:53.350 --> 00:52:56.380 align:middle line:90%
And he got over his autism.

00:52:56.380 --> 00:53:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And I'll put a link
into this video here.

00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:05.650 align:middle line:10%
But he actually was able to
overcome his autism by love--

00:53:05.650 --> 00:53:06.890 align:middle line:10%
his parents loving him.

00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:11.770 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't any kind of superfood
or anything that they gave him.

00:53:11.770 --> 00:53:14.950 align:middle line:10%
He says, I got
over the hardships

00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:19.910 align:middle line:10%
I had because of my
parents taking the time

00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:21.860 align:middle line:10%
to spend the time with
me, and be with me,

00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:24.380 align:middle line:10%
and nurture me, and love me.

00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:29.650 align:middle line:10%
And that's what healed these
autistic traits that he had.

00:53:29.650 --> 00:53:30.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Jeez.

00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And there's
videos of him, like--

00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:33.380 align:middle line:90%
it was hardcore.

00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:34.310 align:middle line:90%
It was messed up.

00:53:34.310 --> 00:53:37.560 align:middle line:84%
So I'll put that link in
here too, for you guys.

00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:38.360 align:middle line:90%
>> That's amazing.

00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:39.110 align:middle line:90%
>> So it makes sense.

00:53:39.110 --> 00:53:39.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:42.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's great.

00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:45.140 align:middle line:84%
So now, these
children are thriving.

00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:48.690 align:middle line:90%
And what's going on?

00:53:48.690 --> 00:53:49.620 align:middle line:90%
What are they saying?

00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, so now, they're
energetically and physically

00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:59.190 align:middle line:84%
connected to their
parents, which are us--

00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:00.750 align:middle line:90%
who are us.

00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And it is their sole motivation
to telepathically just inundate

00:54:08.010 --> 00:54:13.000 align:middle line:84%
us with these memories, and to
connect with us and dream time,

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:20.250 align:middle line:84%
and to also just implant in
us this reality that we've

00:54:20.250 --> 00:54:21.960 align:middle line:90%
chosen to go towards.

00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:25.530 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK, go more
in this direction.

00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:26.830 align:middle line:90%
Go more in this direction.

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:30.090 align:middle line:84%
So they're really,
right now, our guides--

00:54:30.090 --> 00:54:30.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, OK.

00:54:30.990 --> 00:54:34.280 align:middle line:90%
>> --back to ourselves.

00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:37.750 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I'm just thinking
about the first humans

00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:42.610 align:middle line:84%
to arrive on Earth, if
they came to this planet

00:54:42.610 --> 00:54:44.830 align:middle line:90%
in a similar-type fashion.

00:54:44.830 --> 00:54:47.140 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if there was
that kind of connection

00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:52.840 align:middle line:84%
to their home world that
they had to come in and--

00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:55.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm just trying
to imagine trying

00:54:55.900 --> 00:54:57.880 align:middle line:90%
to bring it home, in some way.

00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:02.440 align:middle line:84%
So if we can imagine
Earth and humans,

00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:05.020 align:middle line:84%
these first hybrid
humans being here

00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:08.230 align:middle line:84%
and still having,
energetically, their parents

00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:11.440 align:middle line:84%
off world on another planet,
and how that connection would

00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:15.370 align:middle line:84%
happen, it doesn't seem that
far out when you start to think

00:55:15.370 --> 00:55:17.115 align:middle line:90%
of it in those aspects.

00:55:17.115 --> 00:55:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and it
is close to home.

00:55:18.490 --> 00:55:20.320 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we're in Sedona.

00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:24.120 align:middle line:84%
But the Phoenix
Lights '97, right?

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Shalanaya mother
ship came over--

00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Wait, Shala--

00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Shalanaya.

00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:30.600 align:middle line:90%
That's the first hybrid race.

00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And they'll be the
first ones to land.

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:33.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:35.470 align:middle line:84%
>> The first hybrid race,
but the hybrid kids will be

00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:40.600 align:middle line:90%
the first to contact beings.

00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And the hybrid kids
are on that ship.

00:55:44.890 --> 00:55:47.650 align:middle line:84%
Like, some of them live
on that actual ship.

00:55:47.650 --> 00:55:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And then Shalanaya
ships have actually

00:55:50.050 --> 00:55:54.830 align:middle line:84%
been seen on this property
by one of my good friends.

00:55:54.830 --> 00:56:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And so the kids, I mean,
they're right there, you know?

00:56:00.010 --> 00:56:05.328 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's like they're
on an airplane or something.

00:56:05.328 --> 00:56:08.480 align:middle line:90%
Ah, behind the tree.

00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:10.453 align:middle line:90%
I can picture.

00:56:10.453 --> 00:56:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Peeking around
the corner, hey.

00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:12.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:56:12.670 --> 00:56:13.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Go back to bed.

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:14.294 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:56:14.294 --> 00:56:15.210 align:middle line:90%


00:56:15.210 --> 00:56:17.220 align:middle line:90%
How does this story end?

00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:21.060 align:middle line:84%
>> The story ends, well,
kind of how it begins.

00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:23.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can see how it
ends by the trajectory of how

00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:27.480 align:middle line:84%
it has started, which
goes back to that Bashar

00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:33.990 align:middle line:84%
session, that first one, that
I was told that I confirmed

00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:36.220 align:middle line:90%
that I had hybrid kids.

00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And after that session,
about three hybrid moms

00:56:39.450 --> 00:56:41.070 align:middle line:90%
came up to me.

00:56:41.070 --> 00:56:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And they already knew
that they had kids.

00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, it
was very, like, whisper

00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:51.180 align:middle line:84%
in the back of a Bashar session
about having hybrid kids.

00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:53.850 align:middle line:84%
It was very, like,
tucked away and not

00:56:53.850 --> 00:56:57.840 align:middle line:90%
really outspoken about this.

00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:00.755 align:middle line:84%
And there were maybe
like different abductees

00:57:00.755 --> 00:57:01.650 align:middle line:90%
who knew about it.

00:57:01.650 --> 00:57:05.370 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't like a
known out there thing.

00:57:05.370 --> 00:57:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And that next day,
one of the hybrid moms

00:57:09.150 --> 00:57:11.610 align:middle line:84%
showed me her
session with Bashar,

00:57:11.610 --> 00:57:13.580 align:middle line:84%
with which Anima
came through, who

00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:16.450 align:middle line:90%
I showed you the picture today.

00:57:16.450 --> 00:57:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And when I listened
to that session

00:57:19.410 --> 00:57:22.770 align:middle line:84%
in which hybrid kids
come through Anima,

00:57:22.770 --> 00:57:25.020 align:middle line:84%
and then Anima is
the assimilation

00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:31.320 align:middle line:84%
specialist, something in the
transmission of that video,

00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:35.070 align:middle line:84%
I was having full,
like, Kundalini

00:57:35.070 --> 00:57:38.880 align:middle line:84%
shakes and emotional,
like, breakdown just, like,

00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:40.260 align:middle line:90%
feeling this video.

00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:41.430 align:middle line:90%
Like, there was a resonance.

00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:43.722 align:middle line:90%
Something opened in me.

00:57:43.722 --> 00:57:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And that night, I went through
this whole-- the experience,

00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:50.130 align:middle line:84%
I said, going
Essassani and such.

00:57:50.130 --> 00:57:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And pretty much
after that video,

00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:57.690 align:middle line:84%
it became very clear
that my soul's dedication

00:57:57.690 --> 00:58:02.640 align:middle line:84%
was to make the
hybrid children known.

00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And so for the rest
of that summer,

00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:07.410 align:middle line:90%
I didn't do anything else.

00:58:07.410 --> 00:58:09.720 align:middle line:90%
I stopped all other work.

00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And I just started
creating the hybrid website

00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:14.640 align:middle line:90%
for the community.

00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And I started
connecting with my kids,

00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:18.630 align:middle line:84%
because I couldn't
connect with anyone else.

00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:20.547 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know that
I was going to connect

00:58:20.547 --> 00:58:21.790 align:middle line:90%
other people to their kids.

00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:23.110 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know that.

00:58:23.110 --> 00:58:25.800 align:middle line:84%
All I was starting
with was, like, OK.

00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:27.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm the parent.

00:58:27.110 --> 00:58:29.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start
connecting with my children.

00:58:29.310 --> 00:58:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted a space to
be made for other parents

00:58:34.890 --> 00:58:39.750 align:middle line:84%
to have this be known, and
for it to be findable-- like,

00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:42.840 align:middle line:90%
for it to be known in that way.

00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And then later, I
found out that I

00:58:44.970 --> 00:58:49.350 align:middle line:84%
was designed to do that,
because of that Bashar video

00:58:49.350 --> 00:58:52.770 align:middle line:84%
that he talked about, that there
would be those online platforms

00:58:52.770 --> 00:58:53.928 align:middle line:90%
that people would come to.

00:58:53.928 --> 00:58:56.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Little did you know, you
would be the one who's kind

00:58:56.220 --> 00:58:58.345 align:middle line:84%
of planting the seed there,
wasn't it a little bit?

00:58:58.345 --> 00:58:59.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Right, right.

00:58:59.770 --> 00:59:00.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:02.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:59:02.370 --> 00:59:03.660 align:middle line:90%
So then, it started.

00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:10.050 align:middle line:10%
And then, the first month, it
was like 100 unique visits.

00:59:10.050 --> 00:59:11.340 align:middle line:90%
>> 100 unique visits?

00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:12.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Per month, to the website.

00:59:12.550 --> 00:59:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see.

00:59:13.350 --> 00:59:15.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Just very, very small.

00:59:15.570 --> 00:59:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And within a year,
it hit 20,000.

00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:24.150 align:middle line:84%
So in one year, hybrid alien
children went to 20,000.

00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:25.260 align:middle line:90%
And now--

00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:26.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Is this the Facebook page?

00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:27.735 align:middle line:90%
>> This is the website.

00:59:27.735 --> 00:59:29.250 align:middle line:90%
>> The actual website, OK.

00:59:29.250 --> 00:59:31.272 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's like
exponential growth.

00:59:31.272 --> 00:59:32.980 align:middle line:10%
>> I'll put a link in
here for everybody,

00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:34.410 align:middle line:10%
so they can see that.

00:59:34.410 --> 00:59:35.310 align:middle line:10%
Insert link.

00:59:35.310 --> 00:59:36.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:39.780 align:middle line:10%
So it's the exponential growth
has been the fascinating thing

00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:43.200 align:middle line:10%
for me to watch,
and how a few emails

00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:44.610 align:middle line:10%
trickle in here and there.

00:59:44.610 --> 00:59:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And then it's just like,
I'm inundated every day

00:59:48.850 --> 00:59:50.110 align:middle line:90%
with people messaging me.

00:59:50.110 --> 00:59:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And so the wake up
process and the next step,

00:59:53.470 --> 00:59:57.130 align:middle line:84%
as you were asking, is that
people are going to remember.

00:59:57.130 --> 00:59:59.420 align:middle line:84%
People are going to have
dreams about these kids.

00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:02.800 align:middle line:84%
People are going to have
memories about all of this.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:08.510 align:middle line:84%
Know the next stages of moving,
of the assimilation of moving

01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:09.970 align:middle line:90%
to these sacred sites.

01:00:09.970 --> 01:00:11.950 align:middle line:84%
All of this
information is coming

01:00:11.950 --> 01:00:13.700 align:middle line:90%
and is already happening.

01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:15.640 align:middle line:90%
And I see these people.

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:19.510 align:middle line:84%
It's amping up in the collective
in such a big and powerful way.

01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:23.710 align:middle line:84%
It's really fun and crazy
for even me to watch.

01:00:23.710 --> 01:00:25.730 align:middle line:84%
Like, I didn't know
where this was going.

01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:28.000 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm just kind of--

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm the driver, but I'm
also like the observer.

01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

01:00:34.350 --> 01:00:36.880 align:middle line:90%
It's great to acknowledge that.

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:39.610 align:middle line:84%
So your work right
now is in addition

01:00:39.610 --> 01:00:42.550 align:middle line:84%
to working with
your own children,

01:00:42.550 --> 01:00:46.900 align:middle line:84%
you're kind of this
conduit, this go-to person

01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:51.360 align:middle line:90%
for people to connect.

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And how do you explain
your work in that sense?

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:57.240 align:middle line:84%
How do you help people connect
with their hybrid children?

01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I help them
connect by, I guess,

01:01:01.530 --> 01:01:06.390 align:middle line:84%
you can picture it as like a
cord, like a plug-in cord--

01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:08.250 align:middle line:90%
that, like, I have the cord.

01:01:08.250 --> 01:01:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And I just, like,
plug it in to them.

01:01:11.490 --> 01:01:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, I was
given the cord.

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's a kind of
a hard cord to find

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:17.940 align:middle line:84%
because it's deeply
buried in the subconscious

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:19.230 align:middle line:90%
and unconscious.

01:01:19.230 --> 01:01:22.020 align:middle line:90%
So I just connect it.

01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:25.440 align:middle line:84%
So there's an energetic
cording that I connect,

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:30.120 align:middle line:84%
that is more of like
a astral activity.

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:32.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't do it consciously,
but it just happens.

01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:36.330 align:middle line:90%
And then I also bring through--

01:01:36.330 --> 01:01:39.540 align:middle line:84%
I get the clairvoyant
image of the child.

01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:43.740 align:middle line:84%
Or they talk to me through
all the different senses

01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:44.700 align:middle line:90%
that I perceive.

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And I deliver whatever messages,
deliver about their essence,

01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:50.140 align:middle line:90%
deliver their image--

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:52.140 align:middle line:84%
whatever the parent
needs to know that's

01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:55.110 align:middle line:84%
going to benefit them in the
next stage of their connection

01:01:55.110 --> 01:01:56.710 align:middle line:90%
with their child.

01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:58.320 align:middle line:90%
That's what I bring through.

01:01:58.320 --> 01:01:59.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And for every person, it's a
different message, I assume.

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:02.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:05.580 align:middle line:84%
It's very different,
and it could be things

01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:08.750 align:middle line:84%
that they might
not want to hear.

01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:12.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, for example,
has anybody not received

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.420 align:middle line:90%
the information very well?

01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:18.330 align:middle line:84%
In what case when you say,
not what they want to hear?

01:02:18.330 --> 01:02:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I guess, maybe
that wasn't even accurate.

01:02:24.130 --> 01:02:25.860 align:middle line:90%
Because every person--

01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:30.720 align:middle line:84%
I've probably done about
50 in the past few years.

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And every person
has completely--

01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:36.520 align:middle line:84%
like, it's really hit
them on a very deep level.

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:39.690 align:middle line:90%
And they've all resonated.

01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:41.910 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the not what
they want to hear

01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:48.210 align:middle line:84%
is the shifting that they need
to do to be able to meet them.

01:02:48.210 --> 01:02:51.690 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not like you can
just stay at your 9:00 to 5:00

01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:55.560 align:middle line:84%
job, like, chowing down
on a burger, and, like,

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:58.530 align:middle line:84%
they're going to move into
your house in the neighborhood.

01:02:58.530 --> 01:03:01.770 align:middle line:84%
>> So, explain, for example,
what are some of the shifts

01:03:01.770 --> 01:03:03.137 align:middle line:90%
that need to take place?

01:03:03.137 --> 01:03:05.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of the shifts that
need to take place are,

01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:09.480 align:middle line:84%
one is for the human parents
to follow their excitement--

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:12.450 align:middle line:84%
to, like, really align
themselves with their passion.

01:03:12.450 --> 01:03:14.520 align:middle line:84%
Because only in
that state will they

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:18.750 align:middle line:84%
be able to shift to where
they can actually meet them.

01:03:18.750 --> 01:03:25.030 align:middle line:84%
So one is the transition to
having them be more themselves,

01:03:25.030 --> 01:03:27.180 align:middle line:90%
which is a lot.

01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:30.660 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, it could be
visiting certain places,

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:33.360 align:middle line:84%
that they need to go visit
certain places to make

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:34.410 align:middle line:90%
a certain connection.

01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:36.990 align:middle line:84%
They might need to
go to a sacred site.

01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:41.790 align:middle line:84%
They might need to move
to a different place.

01:03:41.790 --> 01:03:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And the children actually
come through and say this?

01:03:44.490 --> 01:03:45.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, in some cases.

01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:48.960 align:middle line:90%


01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:51.960 align:middle line:84%
I use my own filter
in the way of knowing

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:53.100 align:middle line:90%
how much is too much.

01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:55.470 align:middle line:84%
Because the kid would
push them all the way.

01:03:55.470 --> 01:03:58.160 align:middle line:90%
The kid is like, go, you know?

01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:00.660 align:middle line:84%
>> You look at the person and
you're like, where they're at.

01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, OK,
are they resonating

01:04:02.310 --> 01:04:03.227 align:middle line:90%
with this information?

01:04:03.227 --> 01:04:04.870 align:middle line:84%
Or are they are they
taking steps back?

01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:05.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:09.120 align:middle line:84%
So I give as much as
is going to be helpful.

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:11.520 align:middle line:84%
Because if say, like,
give up your whole life

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:13.497 align:middle line:90%
and go to Tibet--

01:04:13.497 --> 01:04:16.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Then they're going to throw
the whole out not listen to any

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:16.515 align:middle line:90%
of it.

01:04:16.515 --> 01:04:17.315 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

01:04:17.315 --> 01:04:18.580 align:middle line:90%
And the kid understands that.

01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And I have dialogues
with them too.

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:26.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Do they knock on your
door afterwards and say,

01:04:26.050 --> 01:04:27.300 align:middle line:90%
why didn't you tell them this?

01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:27.900 align:middle line:84%
Or, why didn't you
tell them that?

01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And then you say,
well, because this.

01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:30.105 align:middle line:90%
And they say, oh, OK.

01:04:30.105 --> 01:04:31.530 align:middle line:90%
Do you do have those kind of?

01:04:31.530 --> 01:04:32.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Kind of, yeah.

01:04:32.110 --> 01:04:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>> The kind of
conversation, how it goes?

01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:33.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:36.210 align:middle line:90%
So I'll give you a scenario.

01:04:36.210 --> 01:04:38.070 align:middle line:90%
One of my childhood friends--

01:04:38.070 --> 01:04:41.460 align:middle line:84%
well, our families
were friends, I

01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:43.890 align:middle line:84%
met him maybe once
when I was, like, five.

01:04:43.890 --> 01:04:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And I never met
him, but we always

01:04:45.330 --> 01:04:47.370 align:middle line:84%
knew about each
other-- similar age.

01:04:47.370 --> 01:04:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And he's an artist
too, very creative.

01:04:50.550 --> 01:04:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And finally, there was something
when this hybrid children

01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:54.600 align:middle line:90%
thing started.

01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:56.910 align:middle line:84%
It was like, you need
to go back to Utah

01:04:56.910 --> 01:05:03.920 align:middle line:84%
and connect with this guy that
I had never met in person.

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:06.000 align:middle line:90%
And so we connected.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And within 10 minutes, he starts
telling me about these things--

01:05:11.970 --> 01:05:14.430 align:middle line:84%
abduction experiences that
started happening right

01:05:14.430 --> 01:05:15.630 align:middle line:90%
when he hit puberty.

01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:17.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, OK.

01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:18.580 align:middle line:90%
I knew that.

01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And I very quickly
heard and felt

01:05:21.870 --> 01:05:24.990 align:middle line:84%
that he had these hybrid
kids, and that we particularly

01:05:24.990 --> 01:05:26.160 align:middle line:90%
had hybrid kids together.

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And we were just
friends and stuff,

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:30.620 align:middle line:84%
but they used our genetic
material together.

01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And so then I told him about
the hybrid kids and stuff.

01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:37.320 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't tell him
that I felt that yet.

01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:38.820 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't time.

01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:40.350 align:middle line:90%
And so I went back to LA.

01:05:40.350 --> 01:05:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And I actually channeled the
kids that I saw that were ours.

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:46.720 align:middle line:90%
And there was a boy and a girl.

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And then I went back
two weeks later,

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and he said that since
he had been around me,

01:05:51.610 --> 01:05:54.760 align:middle line:84%
he had been having these
experiences at night where

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:59.170 align:middle line:84%
these two kids would come
and knock on his door.

01:05:59.170 --> 01:06:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And every night
that week, his dog

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:05.360 align:middle line:84%
had been needing
to go out at night.

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And he would go into
this kind of dream state.

01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And these kids, like,
who he was terrified of,

01:06:13.930 --> 01:06:15.170 align:middle line:90%
would just knock on his door.

01:06:15.170 --> 01:06:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And he had these dreams
of, like, pushing the door

01:06:17.770 --> 01:06:20.770 align:middle line:84%
shut as these kids
were trying to get in.

01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And it was like,
no, don't come in.

01:06:23.410 --> 01:06:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And at that same time right
before I knew that in LA,

01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:28.390 align:middle line:90%
I tried to tune into the kids.

01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And they were like, we don't
need to be with you, Mom.

01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:32.810 align:middle line:84%
Like, we need to
take care of Dad.

01:06:32.810 --> 01:06:33.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

01:06:33.610 --> 01:06:35.950 align:middle line:90%
>> So all of this was happening.

01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And like, it was
confirmed by him.

01:06:37.690 --> 01:06:40.843 align:middle line:84%
So there are some people
that, they're just like--

01:06:40.843 --> 01:06:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>> They're not ready for it.

01:06:42.010 --> 01:06:43.060 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:43.900 align:middle line:90%
No, you know?

01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:49.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, after our session,
it's a lot to throw on you.

01:06:49.930 --> 01:06:55.040 align:middle line:84%
It's like all day yesterday,
I kept talking to Daniel--

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:57.740 align:middle line:84%
my cameraman here--
about, like, yeah.

01:06:57.740 --> 01:06:59.982 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I don't know if
I'm ready for real kids

01:06:59.982 --> 01:07:01.190 align:middle line:90%
here in this third dimension.

01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:04.560 align:middle line:90%
But I might be ready for--

01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:05.360 align:middle line:90%
>> --for an alien.

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:06.782 align:middle line:90%
>> --for an alien kid.

01:07:06.782 --> 01:07:08.240 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:10.730 align:middle line:90%
As crazy as that sounds.

01:07:10.730 --> 01:07:15.140 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I guess most people
would kind of the other way

01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:17.090 align:middle line:90%
around.

01:07:17.090 --> 01:07:21.080 align:middle line:84%
Even if you had regular
kids on this dimension,

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:24.433 align:middle line:84%
even contemplating another
kid, that's like a major--

01:07:24.433 --> 01:07:25.350 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a major thing.

01:07:25.350 --> 01:07:27.710 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a thing
that you just, like--

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:30.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't need that
worry/responsibility.

01:07:30.650 --> 01:07:32.920 align:middle line:84%
But it sounds like
these kids can kind of

01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:33.920 align:middle line:90%
take care of themselves.

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:37.790 align:middle line:84%
If they're guiding us along,
they're more of the parents,

01:07:37.790 --> 01:07:45.680 align:middle line:84%
and we're the kids,
in many aspects.

01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:50.010 align:middle line:90%
But do they have basic needs?

01:07:50.010 --> 01:07:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Do they need to
be potty trained?

01:07:51.630 --> 01:07:54.700 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:57.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Their caretakers, the
other ETs that they're with,

01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:00.420 align:middle line:90%
they're taking care of them.

01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:03.400 align:middle line:84%
>> They're getting them up
to speed with how to lift up

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:04.210 align:middle line:90%
the toilet seat.

01:08:04.210 --> 01:08:05.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:06.500 align:middle line:90%
They're being trained for Earth.

01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:08.080 align:middle line:90%
That's their classroom.

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:12.460 align:middle line:84%
So they don't go to school, they
go to, like, Earth 101, yeah.

01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:15.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Which I've actually talked
to several abductees who--

01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:19.232 align:middle line:90%
>> --the classroom?

01:08:19.232 --> 01:08:20.649 align:middle line:84%
>> --or even, yeah,
the classroom.

01:08:20.649 --> 01:08:22.390 align:middle line:90%
And they're on ships.

01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And they see classrooms
where they're

01:08:25.390 --> 01:08:28.120 align:middle line:84%
teaching them how to buy
stuff at the supermarket.

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:34.149 align:middle line:84%
And it's like-- and I heard that
like three to five years ago,

01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:38.240 align:middle line:84%
abductees talking about
this and having the same.

01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:40.622 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just one, but
several of these abductees

01:08:40.622 --> 01:08:41.830 align:middle line:90%
saying, hey, I was on a ship.

01:08:41.830 --> 01:08:43.029 align:middle line:90%
And I saw that too.

01:08:43.029 --> 01:08:44.710 align:middle line:90%
And that's so bizarre.

01:08:44.710 --> 01:08:46.279 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

01:08:46.279 --> 01:08:47.710 align:middle line:84%
It means there's
something coming.

01:08:47.710 --> 01:08:48.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:49.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:53.140 align:middle line:84%
So it looks like all the dots
are getting connected here.

01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:54.100 align:middle line:90%
Something's coming.

01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:54.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:55.620 align:middle line:84%
>> So is that what's
going to happen?

01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:56.703 align:middle line:90%
Are they going to join us?

01:08:56.703 --> 01:08:59.740 align:middle line:84%
You said they're in another
dimension on another planet.

01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:01.340 align:middle line:90%
Are they going to join us here?

01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:02.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, they are.

01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:03.182 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the grand plan.

01:09:03.182 --> 01:09:07.210 align:middle line:84%
The Freelancers are going
to join us on Earth.

01:09:07.210 --> 01:09:10.540 align:middle line:84%
So the other civilizations,
they're on their civilizations.

01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:15.609 align:middle line:84%
But there were kids that were
held out of time, in a sense.

01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:16.990 align:middle line:90%
So they're not aging.

01:09:16.990 --> 01:09:19.960 align:middle line:84%
They're just, like,
held in time--

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:24.970 align:middle line:84%
continuing on, but they're going
to be inserted into our reality

01:09:24.970 --> 01:09:26.710 align:middle line:90%
when the time is right.

01:09:26.710 --> 01:09:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And they will be introduced
to Earth as our children.

01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And they will be the
first step and conduit

01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:40.689 align:middle line:84%
into contact with
other civilizations.

01:09:40.689 --> 01:09:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, which makes it a
little easier on humanity

01:09:44.590 --> 01:09:49.300 align:middle line:84%
if there's an actual
alien that is part human--

01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:50.200 align:middle line:90%
>> --and their child.

01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:51.160 align:middle line:90%
>> --and their child.

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:52.120 align:middle line:90%
>> --and is a child.

01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:52.569 align:middle line:90%
>> --and is a child.

01:09:52.569 --> 01:09:54.520 align:middle line:84%
So you're not going to
blow it out of the sky,

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:55.990 align:middle line:84%
or we're being
attacked by aliens!

01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:58.230 align:middle line:90%
How can kids be attacking us?

01:09:58.230 --> 01:09:59.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:02.490 align:middle line:84%
Unless they're maybe perceived
through a negative filter,

01:10:02.490 --> 01:10:04.860 align:middle line:84%
which would be the
Black Eyed children.

01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, I'm glad you
brought that up.

01:10:07.450 --> 01:10:09.520 align:middle line:84%
Because I was thinking
of bringing that up,

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:13.130 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't want to bring any
negativity into this session.

01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:15.850 align:middle line:90%


01:10:15.850 --> 01:10:17.290 align:middle line:90%
So, Black Eyed children.

01:10:17.290 --> 01:10:19.180 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:20.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I mean--

01:10:20.110 --> 01:10:22.360 align:middle line:84%
>> People can go online and
search all the Black Eyed

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:23.160 align:middle line:90%
children stuff.

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:25.990 align:middle line:90%
But what is your interpretation?

01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:30.070 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it is my belief
that Black Eyed children are

01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:34.240 align:middle line:84%
a hybrid children perceived
through a negative ego filter.

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:39.190 align:middle line:84%
There could be some
freak creepy children

01:10:39.190 --> 01:10:41.530 align:middle line:84%
coming into this dimension
or something that

01:10:41.530 --> 01:10:42.920 align:middle line:90%
are Black Eyed children too.

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:45.475 align:middle line:84%
But after hearing that
experience with the guy

01:10:45.475 --> 01:10:47.350 align:middle line:84%
that I just told you
about, that the kids are

01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:51.260 align:middle line:84%
knocking on his door, and he
perceived their eyes as black--

01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:54.400 align:middle line:90%
like black kind of scary eyes--

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:56.980 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going, OK, I
know where his ego is at.

01:10:56.980 --> 01:11:00.340 align:middle line:84%
He does not want
to look at this.

01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And then he is then perceiving
them as super creepy

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:05.690 align:middle line:90%
and super scary.

01:11:05.690 --> 01:11:09.570 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm going, yeah.

01:11:09.570 --> 01:11:12.360 align:middle line:84%
Like, I'm thinking
that that is--

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So the Black Eyed children
aren't necessarily negative,

01:11:15.210 --> 01:11:17.370 align:middle line:84%
it's the people who are
perceiving them have those

01:11:17.370 --> 01:11:21.210 align:middle line:84%
negative projections
that are giving to them.

01:11:21.210 --> 01:11:24.360 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, they're
telling the world,

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.838 align:middle line:84%
I don't want you
to open the door.

01:11:25.838 --> 01:11:26.880 align:middle line:90%
They're going to come in.

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to kill
you and cut you to pieces,

01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:33.352 align:middle line:90%
and put you in the freezer.

01:11:33.352 --> 01:11:35.080 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:38.550 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, so don't do it.

01:11:38.550 --> 01:11:40.200 align:middle line:90%
Don't open the door.

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Even though they're like
kind of cute and they need

01:11:44.910 --> 01:11:50.250 align:middle line:84%
help, and they're super
pysch, and everything else.

01:11:50.250 --> 01:11:51.430 align:middle line:90%
But they need your blood.

01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:11:52.230 --> 01:11:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>> They're going
to suck you dry.

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:54.594 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

01:11:54.594 --> 01:11:56.470 align:middle line:90%


01:11:56.470 --> 01:11:59.627 align:middle line:84%
Because that's how, typically,
the Black Eyed children

01:11:59.627 --> 01:12:00.960 align:middle line:90%
are perceived, in a lot of ways.

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>> They are.

01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And maybe there are
creepy, like-- you know,

01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:09.380 align:middle line:84%
there are dark energies and
spirits that I've worked with.

01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:12.030 align:middle line:84%
>> You think of maybe a few in
the first batch didn't quite go

01:12:12.030 --> 01:12:12.480 align:middle line:90%
a certain way?

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:13.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Maybe.

01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:14.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they dropped them off.

01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, let's just
make this a horror show.

01:12:17.190 --> 01:12:19.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, let's just throw
them back at the parents.

01:12:19.930 --> 01:12:20.730 align:middle line:90%
Let's not deal.

01:12:20.730 --> 01:12:22.313 align:middle line:84%
So even up in the
craft, they're like,

01:12:22.313 --> 01:12:24.380 align:middle line:90%
we can't deal with these kids.

01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:26.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Genetic experiment
went wrong.

01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:29.670 align:middle line:90%
>> We gotta drop those humans--

01:12:29.670 --> 01:12:33.690 align:middle line:84%
yeah, especially the ones
that really aren't accepting

01:12:33.690 --> 01:12:34.860 align:middle line:90%
this information very much.

01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:38.070 align:middle line:84%
Let's just give
them a little taste.

01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Maybe.

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:40.240 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:41.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my goodness.

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:41.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Who knows?

01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:45.130 align:middle line:90%


01:12:45.130 --> 01:12:45.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:12:45.930 --> 01:12:49.200 align:middle line:84%
I like that perspective on
the Black Eyed children.

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:50.940 align:middle line:90%
It kind of makes sense.

01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:53.550 align:middle line:84%
So this other guy
you're talking about,

01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:56.650 align:middle line:84%
his perception was kind of the
standard Black Eyed children

01:12:56.650 --> 01:12:57.450 align:middle line:90%
perception?

01:12:57.450 --> 01:12:57.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it was.

01:12:57.940 --> 01:12:59.128 align:middle line:90%
That's how he described it.

01:12:59.128 --> 01:13:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>> But you, at the same
time, were getting direct

01:13:01.170 --> 01:13:07.140 align:middle line:84%
communication from them saying,
we just want to communicate.

01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:11.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And like, darling
energies, you know?

01:13:11.850 --> 01:13:12.940 align:middle line:90%
Like, really sweet.

01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And I know dark
energies, you know?

01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:18.730 align:middle line:84%
I used to clear
poltergeists in houses.

01:13:18.730 --> 01:13:21.220 align:middle line:90%
Like, I'm OK with that energy.

01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:23.230 align:middle line:90%
And if it was that, that's cool.

01:13:23.230 --> 01:13:24.680 align:middle line:90%
I'd honor that, you know?

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:25.960 align:middle line:90%
But it isn't.

01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:28.300 align:middle line:84%
But in some cases,
maybe, you know?

01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:29.800 align:middle line:90%
Like we said, it's a little--

01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, and even if it is,
I think you can transmute it

01:13:33.460 --> 01:13:34.540 align:middle line:90%
in a sense by--

01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:37.260 align:middle line:84%
again, we create
our own realities

01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:39.100 align:middle line:84%
with wherever we
project on whatever it

01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:39.980 align:middle line:90%
is we're going to do.

01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:41.397 align:middle line:84%
So if we're going
to project that,

01:13:41.397 --> 01:13:43.510 align:middle line:84%
we're going to create
that in our own heads,

01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:45.130 align:middle line:90%
even if it's not really that.

01:13:45.130 --> 01:13:46.150 align:middle line:90%
And same thing.

01:13:46.150 --> 01:13:48.400 align:middle line:84%
It could be totally negative,
and you can transmute it

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:50.270 align:middle line:90%
to something positive.

01:13:50.270 --> 01:13:51.730 align:middle line:90%
And that's a good thing.

01:13:51.730 --> 01:13:54.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't see anything negative
with transforming the negative

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:55.030 align:middle line:90%
into positive.

01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:55.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:13:55.830 --> 01:13:59.740 align:middle line:84%
>> So even if these demon
kids, black eyes, fangs,

01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:00.970 align:middle line:90%
and blood sucking--

01:14:00.970 --> 01:14:03.860 align:middle line:84%
even if you did show
love and compassion,

01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:08.540 align:middle line:84%
you can still transmute
it into something lovely.

01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:09.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:12.370 align:middle line:90%
>> So there is no negative.

01:14:12.370 --> 01:14:14.072 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's negative,
you can still

01:14:14.072 --> 01:14:15.280 align:middle line:90%
transmute it into a positive.

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:19.870 align:middle line:84%
So whichever scenario you go
down, why not open your arms

01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:22.000 align:middle line:90%
and give these kids a big hug?

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.590 align:middle line:90%
>> And a cup of juice.

01:14:26.590 --> 01:14:27.970 align:middle line:90%
>> And a cup of juice.

01:14:27.970 --> 01:14:29.050 align:middle line:90%
A cup of juice.

01:14:29.050 --> 01:14:30.010 align:middle line:90%
Every child--

01:14:30.010 --> 01:14:31.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I was going to
say glass of milk,

01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:33.373 align:middle line:90%
but we're going away from--

01:14:33.373 --> 01:14:35.040 align:middle line:84%
we're going to go
with a glass of juice.

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:36.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Glass of juice.

01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:38.080 align:middle line:90%
Not from concentrate.

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:39.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Not from concentrate, fresh.

01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Fresh juice.

01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:41.260 align:middle line:90%
>> We can do that.

01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:44.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Non-pasteurized, very good.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:44.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Organic.

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:46.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Organic juice.

01:14:46.210 --> 01:14:47.060 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:47.860 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a lot
of information,

01:14:52.330 --> 01:14:55.960 align:middle line:90%
and a lot to chew on.

01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, we can
go into details--

01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:00.580 align:middle line:90%
which we have a lot.

01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:02.180 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know.

01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:03.530 align:middle line:90%
I think the sun's going down.

01:15:03.530 --> 01:15:06.442 align:middle line:84%
It might be a good
place to wrap this up.

01:15:06.442 --> 01:15:07.650 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much, Bridget.

01:15:07.650 --> 01:15:10.440 align:middle line:90%
This was awesome information.

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'd love to continue to
see how this develops in maybe

01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:17.250 align:middle line:84%
future episodes, if you
have more information

01:15:17.250 --> 01:15:18.720 align:middle line:90%
and everything's coming through.

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:19.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Sounds great.

01:15:19.570 --> 01:15:20.730 align:middle line:90%
>> We'd love to see more of you.

01:15:20.730 --> 01:15:21.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Ruben.

01:15:21.570 --> 01:15:22.487 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome, Thank you.
