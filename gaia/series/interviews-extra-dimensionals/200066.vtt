00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:03.670 align:middle line:90%


00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.040 align:middle line:10%
>> All of you can transmute
the dark to some degree.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, we are not saying
that you can be with one

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.070 align:middle line:90%
who is demonically possessed.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.020 align:middle line:84%
You have to be a
little careful when

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.640 align:middle line:84%
you are an activist for
consciousness on this planet.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.090 align:middle line:84%
The fear can become
you and suck you in.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:39.335 align:middle line:90%


00:01:39.335 --> 00:01:41.460 align:middle line:84%
The reason none of you
should be afraid of the dark

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.385 align:middle line:90%
is because the dark exists.

00:01:43.385 --> 00:01:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And if you are afraid of the
dark, it has power over you.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.690 align:middle line:90%


00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.450 align:middle line:84%
This is where those
who wake up no longer

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.310 align:middle line:84%
see the human experience
as all that there is.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.780 align:middle line:84%
There is a universal
energy field

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.855 align:middle line:84%
that is far bigger than any
of those focused feelings.

00:02:02.855 --> 00:02:15.990 align:middle line:90%


00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.090 align:middle line:90%
So here we are again.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.090 align:middle line:10%
Hey.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.510 align:middle line:10%
thanks for being here
and being part of this.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.440 align:middle line:10%
Last time we spoke, we
were in your backyard.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.240 align:middle line:10%
>> We were.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.200 align:middle line:10%
>> And now you have this
awesome new office in Malibu.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, which we love.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.370 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, we've just moved in.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.170 align:middle line:10%
So, yeah.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.880 align:middle line:84%
It's been almost a year
since we spoke last time.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's crazy
how time flies.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:37.940 align:middle line:90%
Congratulations on the office.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:38.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:39.630 align:middle line:90%
>> And on this book.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is-- tell us a little
bit about it, Energy Speaks.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.130 align:middle line:84%
So Energy Speaks is a collection
of channeled material.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.530 align:middle line:10%
And it has 15 chapters in it.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.520 align:middle line:10%
And it's taken from 15 years
of channeling publicly.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And so there are topics
like the power of women, sex

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.200 align:middle line:84%
and sexual energy, loving
money, the art of receiving,

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.350 align:middle line:84%
the essence of relationships,
the mastery of sleep.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.410 align:middle line:10%
So it kind of just
takes a really broad map

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.700 align:middle line:10%
of things that affect us
and influence us every day

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.390 align:middle line:10%
and what are the energetics
that underpin those and how can

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.240 align:middle line:10%
we best live with them.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.485 align:middle line:84%
So we've edited it
very carefully so

00:03:20.485 --> 00:03:22.860 align:middle line:84%
that it's digestible, because
a lot of channeled material

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.360 align:middle line:90%
can be very dense.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.530 align:middle line:90%
So there are exercises.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.910 align:middle line:90%
There are affirmations.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.760 align:middle line:84%
So that you can really
experience the book

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.870 align:middle line:90%
rather than just read it.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:31.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, nice.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And it-- you said it's
mostly channeled material?

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's mostly channeled.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.440 align:middle line:90%
I share my story.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And then, in a kind of
big opening chapter,

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.900 align:middle line:84%
I talk about how
this happened for me.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.080 align:middle line:84%
Regina Meredith, who we
know and love from Gaia,

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.707 align:middle line:84%
she's done a brilliant
forward for the book.

00:03:48.707 --> 00:03:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And I believe there is one
chapter in there called

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Radical Expression, which came
from a workshop I delivered

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.210 align:middle line:90%
rather than channeled material.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.760 align:middle line:90%
But it's 85, 90% channeled.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.530 align:middle line:10%
>> And did you go back--

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.585 align:middle line:10%
how did you reference
this material?

00:04:04.585 --> 00:04:06.360 align:middle line:84%
What was it, like,
on old audio tapes?

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.580 align:middle line:84%
It was-- all of
it was originally

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.972 align:middle line:90%
delivered in audio form.

00:04:09.972 --> 00:04:12.180 align:middle line:84%
But then it was interesting
with the editing process,

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.960 align:middle line:84%
because you kind of
re-channel it in a way.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.570 align:middle line:84%
There were things that we
added and things that I moved.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.370 align:middle line:84%
But I had very
clear instruction.

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.260 align:middle line:84%
Like, if I was trying
to remove something

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.510 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't
feel like it worked,

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.190 align:middle line:90%
I would occasionally hear, no.

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.410 align:middle line:84%
So it was like, OK, oh,
that's meant to be there.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.440 align:middle line:84%
But then equally, if I felt
like in the written form

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.060 align:middle line:90%
it needed some expansion--

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.990 align:middle line:84%
because tone of
voice is one thing,

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.170 align:middle line:84%
but the written
word is different--

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.980 align:middle line:84%
there would be information
about how to do that.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Or I would literally
re-channel the material.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.160 align:middle line:90%
So it was cool.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.470 align:middle line:84%
It was an opportunity to create
this ultimate addition of all

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.890 align:middle line:90%
of those chapters.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's-- where
can people find it?

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's published
by New World Libraries.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.410 align:middle line:84%
So in the US and in
Canada, it's in stores

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.150 align:middle line:90%
like Barnes and Nobles.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.610 align:middle line:84%
It's on Amazon all
over the world.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's in bookstores
around the world.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.522 align:middle line:90%
But it's available online.

00:05:06.522 --> 00:05:07.980 align:middle line:84%
You can find it
through my website.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.188 align:middle line:84%
And the one coolest thing
about going through my site

00:05:10.188 --> 00:05:13.860 align:middle line:84%
is the day it released, which
was a little over a month ago,

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.520 align:middle line:84%
Regina and I sat here and did
a 70 minute interview where

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.440 align:middle line:84%
she interviewed me
for maybe 30 minutes,

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.140 align:middle line:84%
and then she interviewed
the Zs for 40.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.700 align:middle line:10%
>> And if you go to my website,
you can watch that whole 70

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.040 align:middle line:10%
minute thing for free if you--

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.960 align:middle line:10%
it's on the home page,
so LeeHarrisEnergy.com.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, I was just
going to ask you.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:33.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.930 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:34.800 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>> So today, we're going to
get into some channeling.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:37.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And get a whole
slew of questions.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Probably many of the Zs
have already answered.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.160 align:middle line:84%
But just to get
it in this format,

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.110 align:middle line:84%
in my format for my
show, Interview with Ed.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully
that's cool for you.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:49.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>> And-- what's your process
for getting into channeling?

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.750 align:middle line:90%
>> It normally takes me--

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the shortest
time is about 20 seconds,

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.300 align:middle line:84%
up to a minute or two,
just to kind of go quiet.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:08.160 align:middle line:84%
Basically to shift from my
own brain to let them in.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.850 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it just
takes me a moment.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:10.380 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:10.670 align:middle line:90%
When you're ready.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:11.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.390 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:12.190 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:30.180 align:middle line:90%


00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.350 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:32.150 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.950 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.180 align:middle line:84%
A pleasure to be
speaking with you,

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.420 align:middle line:84%
you who are the steward
of this communication

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.730 align:middle line:90%
field that you are creating for.

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Even though your shows
and conversations

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.210 align:middle line:84%
with your extra
dimensionals are designed

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.660 align:middle line:84%
to be somewhat informative
and expansive, what

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.640 align:middle line:84%
you are creating through
what you are doing

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.270 align:middle line:84%
is an extraordinary
communication field

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.480 align:middle line:84%
that all who tap into
it and experience it

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.460 align:middle line:90%
can experience for themselves.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.590 align:middle line:84%
So in many ways, it is
somewhat telepathic.

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.010 align:middle line:84%
But it is expansive in
terms of communication

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:13.490 align:middle line:84%
and people's ability to
receive of this communication

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.110 align:middle line:90%
for themselves.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.920 align:middle line:10%
You are, shall we say, opening
the veil for those who already

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.020 align:middle line:10%
know that the veil
need not be there

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.440 align:middle line:10%
and that is a wonderful thing.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And we are very happy
to be part of it.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And we commend you for
your adventurous spirit.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.720 align:middle line:84%
I-- some people tend to
say I'm kind of out there,

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.460 align:middle line:84%
but the more out there
we're going, it seems,

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.830 align:middle line:84%
the out there is
becoming the norm.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>> What we see in you is you
are an electrical current.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And adventure is a
way that you have

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.750 align:middle line:84%
been able to run your
high electricity.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And that is an activating
force for others.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:57.020 align:middle line:10%
So you cannot necessarily
walk around the world,

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.990 align:middle line:10%
going up activating
everybody that you meet.

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:03.970 align:middle line:84%
But you can use that electrical
energy like any good creator

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:08.720 align:middle line:84%
and bottle it and use it to
ignite worlds and portals

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.970 align:middle line:84%
that others can
interact with in order

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:14.670 align:middle line:84%
to have what we would call
a hit of the electricity.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:17.660 align:middle line:84%
Which is what you are now doing
at this stage of your life.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And that is a wonderful way to
experience both your purpose

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.840 align:middle line:90%
and your life on Earth.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.100 align:middle line:90%
>> And absolutely.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.490 align:middle line:90%
I am following my joy.

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:27.330 align:middle line:90%
I love this work.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.360 align:middle line:90%
I love these conversations.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.490 align:middle line:84%
Connecting in this way,
sharing it with the world.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And I love what you just said
about the veil not being there,

00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:38.210 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:42.870 align:middle line:84%
So we have this idea of--
even me, in my terminology,

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.120 align:middle line:90%
I always talk about this veil.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And that it's-- but even
almost talking about it creates

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:47.900 align:middle line:90%
the wall.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.645 align:middle line:84%
And you just got a whole
new download perspective,

00:08:50.645 --> 00:08:52.270 align:middle line:84%
just the opening of
what you just said.

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:53.340 align:middle line:90%
So thank you so much.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the veil makes
the world a little dull,

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.180 align:middle line:90%
does it not?

00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And those who have not yet been
able to see beyond the veil

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:04.280 align:middle line:84%
or experience beyond
the veil can also

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.500 align:middle line:84%
be somewhat disappointing
in frequency

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.530 align:middle line:84%
to the human beings who have
already gone beyond the veil.

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:12.560 align:middle line:84%
That is not us judging
people on Earth.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.370 align:middle line:84%
It is more that those of you who
are seekers, those of you who

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:20.510 align:middle line:84%
are here to remember the
breadth of your experience

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:24.380 align:middle line:84%
as a human being, can get a
little dulled if you are not,

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.960 align:middle line:84%
shall we say, igniting
that for others

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.320 align:middle line:84%
or experiencing it
enough in yourselves.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And for many of
you, the two things

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:38.240 align:middle line:84%
are the same in that you use
your purpose and your work

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.510 align:middle line:84%
and your mission on the planet
to both ignite that veil

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:45.330 align:middle line:84%
and be beyond the
veil at the same time.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:46.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:46.930 align:middle line:90%
Well said.

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:49.340 align:middle line:90%
Well said.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Just for our listeners
and for myself,

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:57.290 align:middle line:84%
and I know this is hard to
put into words, perhaps,

00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:04.820 align:middle line:84%
but going beyond the veil
into your veil, your realm,

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.740 align:middle line:84%
is there a way to
put words to this?

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:10.580 align:middle line:84%
In my series, I talk about
densities and dimensions.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.700 align:middle line:84%
Is there a specific
density or dimension

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:21.320 align:middle line:84%
that the Zs reside in, or that
we can use to define the Zs.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.050 align:middle line:84%
How do we put those in a nice
pretty box for our listeners?

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:27.710 align:middle line:84%
>> We can put it slightly
differently for you,

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:30.260 align:middle line:84%
although we would say
that we are a collective.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.560 align:middle line:84%
So as we explained to
Lee many years ago,

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.010 align:middle line:90%
we are a group of 88 entities.

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:40.560 align:middle line:84%
But we are not always, shall
we say, glued to each other.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.070 align:middle line:84%
So if we were human
beings, it does not

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:46.370 align:middle line:84%
mean that we are always a
group of 88 humans moving

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:49.160 align:middle line:84%
around the world,
constantly together.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.980 align:middle line:84%
We are in telepathic
communication with each other.

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And that is how our
entity field is created.

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:59.270 align:middle line:84%
But we all have slightly
different purposes.

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:02.300 align:middle line:84%
I am the spokesperson
for the group, Zachary.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.990 align:middle line:84%
But I am, if you like,
channeling myself.

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:07.670 align:middle line:90%
So Lee is channeling me.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And I am channeling
the consciousness

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.900 align:middle line:90%
of our group field.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:16.070 align:middle line:84%
What I would also illustrate
to you is that where we reside

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:19.130 align:middle line:84%
is a little hard
to describe for us.

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:21.950 align:middle line:84%
For where we reside
is the universe.

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And to us, where
humans are residing

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:28.130 align:middle line:84%
at this point in human
history, which is 2019,

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:32.400 align:middle line:84%
is in a very closed off
part of the universe.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.270 align:middle line:84%
Earth, with all of its color
and dimensional vibrance,

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:40.710 align:middle line:84%
is very cloaked and
shielded from what we call

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:44.580 align:middle line:90%
the universe or the multiverse.

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:47.880 align:middle line:84%
So it is not so much
describing where

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.420 align:middle line:84%
we are that is going to
be as satisfying to you

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:55.380 align:middle line:84%
as helping those who are
perhaps still finding

00:11:55.380 --> 00:12:00.930 align:middle line:84%
their way with this concept,
explaining where you all are.

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:05.110 align:middle line:84%
Which is in a very cloaked
and veiled part of reality.

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And you have approximately
no more than about

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:13.020 align:middle line:84%
20 more years before
that veil is--

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:14.130 align:middle line:90%
we will say-- shattered.

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:17.100 align:middle line:84%
Not to be dramatic,
for we do not

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:20.910 align:middle line:84%
see negative impact with
this, but shattered forever.

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:21.963 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:12:21.963 --> 00:12:23.880 align:middle line:84%
You actually went right
into my next question.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.670 align:middle line:84%
I was going to ask,
what does humanity

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:32.040 align:middle line:84%
look like from your perspective
or through the eyes of the Zs.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.470 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, through
the filter of Lee.

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:36.750 align:middle line:84%
You sort of gave us a
little taste of that.

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:38.650 align:middle line:84%
Could you go into
any more depth.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:44.920 align:middle line:84%
For example, maybe even
sensations or perceptions, or I

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.720 align:middle line:84%
don't know, what
kind of senses would

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:53.040 align:middle line:84%
be used from a collective
energy or from the Zs?

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:56.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we do not need to use
our senses in quite the same

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.860 align:middle line:90%
way, for we are all connected.

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:02.850 align:middle line:84%
If you imagine diagonal,
horizontal, and vertical lines,

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:05.550 align:middle line:84%
that is how we
are all connected.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:10.500 align:middle line:84%
So in that sense, we are,
to some degree, individual.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.020 align:middle line:84%
But we are not individual
in the way that you all are.

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:16.440 align:middle line:84%
So in the way that you are
all in these fixed the bodies

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:20.250 align:middle line:84%
and your souls have become
tethered to these bodies,

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:23.160 align:middle line:84%
yes, you can merge and
share with each other,

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:27.660 align:middle line:84%
but there is a limit to how much
that merging can take place.

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:30.420 align:middle line:10%
From our perspective,
we can, shall we say,

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:34.500 align:middle line:10%
disappear completely, meaning
we can become one with the 88

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.810 align:middle line:10%
and have no sense of identity.

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And even the identity that
is speaking to you right now

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.150 align:middle line:90%
is in a mirror.

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:48.810 align:middle line:84%
So I, as Zachary, do not
exist in actuality, the way

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:53.460 align:middle line:84%
that Lee would be perceived
to exist in actuality to you.

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.100 align:middle line:84%
Or you as Rubin
would be perceived

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.800 align:middle line:84%
to exist in actuality
to someone else.

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And yet this is
where humanity is

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:05.470 align:middle line:84%
far closer to our perspective
than many believe.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:09.090 align:middle line:84%
For as those of you who have
had awakened experiences,

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:13.320 align:middle line:84%
where you have been able to feel
yourself as part of everything,

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.680 align:middle line:84%
you, too, can attest
to the realization

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.650 align:middle line:84%
that everything is everything
and everyone is everyone.

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:21.630 align:middle line:90%
And it is a hall of mirrors.

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:24.480 align:middle line:90%
And that is universal light.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.460 align:middle line:84%
When you are in
universal light, you

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.850 align:middle line:84%
are able to see very far
down and through the Hall

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.250 align:middle line:84%
of Mirrors, so that you
can see how everything

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:34.230 align:middle line:90%
connects to everything else.

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:36.360 align:middle line:84%
The tricky part
for human beings is

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.160 align:middle line:84%
when they are living
fully in the density

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.470 align:middle line:90%
of their form and their story.

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:44.130 align:middle line:84%
It is a little bit like
watching a 2D movie when

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:46.420 align:middle line:90%
you have a 5D movie available.

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And we are aware at
the moment that 3D

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:52.170 align:middle line:84%
is as far as you have
all been invited to go.

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:54.150 align:middle line:84%
But imagine if your
movies were full

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:58.320 align:middle line:84%
blown sensory experiences,
where you are walking through

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.780 align:middle line:90%
and immersed in a story.

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:05.010 align:middle line:84%
That is, you know to be a
story, but is happening to you

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:05.970 align:middle line:90%
as if it were real.

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, that is how we see you
humans from our perspective.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:13.440 align:middle line:84%
So we see that you
have enormous color.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.370 align:middle line:90%
And we would call it intensity.

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And you have this
deep intensity,

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.630 align:middle line:84%
because you are so
embedded into finding

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:23.640 align:middle line:90%
your way with energy currents.

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:28.140 align:middle line:84%
You have to work hard to
let your energy light up.

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:31.410 align:middle line:84%
Whereas for us, we
are freer of form.

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:32.910 align:middle line:90%
We can take form.

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:37.320 align:middle line:84%
But we are not built into
form the way a human being is.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:40.920 align:middle line:84%
So from our perspective,
it is quite fascinating

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.950 align:middle line:84%
to witness those of you
who are experiencing

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:46.200 align:middle line:90%
yourselves in such dense form.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.710 align:middle line:84%
It makes everything a lot slower
for you than it does for us.

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:53.100 align:middle line:10%
But as we have said before
many times, thorough Lee,

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:56.070 align:middle line:10%
it is a wonderful experience
to be a human being, even

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:57.660 align:middle line:10%
on the earth at this time.

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.940 align:middle line:84%
Which we understand can
look like a horror show

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:01.860 align:middle line:90%
to some of you at times.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.660 align:middle line:84%
But from our
perspective, you are

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.150 align:middle line:90%
all energy experiencing form.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:09.840 align:middle line:84%
And you all know this
in your deepest hearts,

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.870 align:middle line:90%
your deepest soul, knowing.

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:15.540 align:middle line:84%
But the gift of
being on Earth is

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:19.710 align:middle line:84%
that you get to temporarily
forget it for a while.

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:25.560 align:middle line:84%
>> So almost like how we watch
movies in a way where we're not

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.890 align:middle line:84%
part of the movie, but we get
to emotionally connect to it

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:32.150 align:middle line:84%
in a-- if it's a riveting,
you know, good story,

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:34.490 align:middle line:84%
we can connect to the
movies, but we're still sort

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:38.440 align:middle line:84%
of watching a play
or a stage or a film.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.638 align:middle line:84%
And the characters
aren't necessarily us,

00:16:40.638 --> 00:16:41.930 align:middle line:90%
but we can empathize with them.

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:44.750 align:middle line:84%
Is that a similar
type experience

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:46.490 align:middle line:90%
that you're experiencing?

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:48.560 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, on
multidimensional levels.

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.440 align:middle line:84%
But just to put
it into reference?

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.020 align:middle line:84%
>> We do not experience
that so much,

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:58.460 align:middle line:84%
for we enjoy our interactions
with all of you in form.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:01.110 align:middle line:90%
But it is a smaller world.

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:06.619 align:middle line:84%
So for us, especially as we
are not incarnate at this time,

00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:10.529 align:middle line:84%
we are experiencing ourselves as
part of consciousness and part

00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:11.329 align:middle line:90%
of energy.

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:14.839 align:middle line:84%
But we are witnessing
you experiencing yourself

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:16.550 align:middle line:90%
as part of form.

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:19.069 align:middle line:84%
The role that many of us
in this collective have

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:21.030 align:middle line:90%
is energy balancing.

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:25.220 align:middle line:84%
So we are assigned,
several of us,

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:28.160 align:middle line:84%
to bring balance
to certain points

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.350 align:middle line:90%
on the earth and other planets.

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:32.310 align:middle line:90%
That is our role.

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:35.960 align:middle line:84%
There are others among us who
have other specifics, too.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:40.100 align:middle line:84%
But these specific piece that
you are requesting to know

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:43.340 align:middle line:84%
relates directly to the earth
and balance of this time.

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:48.470 align:middle line:84%
For Earth's role in the universe
is very important right now.

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:51.740 align:middle line:84%
There are many who will
say that Earth is, shall we

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:58.260 align:middle line:84%
say, turbulent or a little
bit of a volcano in waiting.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:02.300 align:middle line:84%
That is not actually how we see
what is taking place on Earth.

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:05.060 align:middle line:84%
Earth is actually doing
a full circle right now

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:08.750 align:middle line:84%
and about to come to
a 360 degree turn.

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:13.820 align:middle line:84%
Much of your ancient
prophecies is seen as past.

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And yet we would say
those were foundations

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:20.910 align:middle line:84%
laid about the future that are
about to become the present.

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:23.310 align:middle line:84%
So this is why consciousness
is rising on the planet.

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:27.440 align:middle line:84%
It is, in a way, like all
of you who are incarnate,

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:32.390 align:middle line:84%
have rewound yourselves as souls
and gone backwards in order

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:35.120 align:middle line:90%
to walk to the point of now.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.810 align:middle line:84%
We say this not to try and be
obtuse or speak in riddles,

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:42.090 align:middle line:84%
but this is part of the problem
with linear time on Earth,

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:42.890 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And why so many of you struggle
with it, the more you wake up.

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:47.750 align:middle line:84%
For linear time
does not make sense.

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:53.540 align:middle line:84%
That is simply a marker that the
as yet unawake human lives by.

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:55.370 align:middle line:84%
And there is great
value in that.

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:58.460 align:middle line:84%
So we are not denigrating
living by linear time.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:00.740 align:middle line:84%
But once you have
awakened to the fact

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:02.340 align:middle line:84%
that you are part
of the universe,

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:04.430 align:middle line:84%
you are here is a
very alive soul.

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And that your human
body is the overlay

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:11.020 align:middle line:84%
that you are experiencing your
life as a soul through right

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:11.820 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:14.120 align:middle line:84%
Then linear time
starts to collapse.

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And the future that you
are all walking into,

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:18.890 align:middle line:84%
the seeds of which,
the map for which

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:22.310 align:middle line:84%
has been laid for many thousands
of years on the planet,

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:26.210 align:middle line:84%
and as evidenced in your
sacred sites and many

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:28.790 align:middle line:84%
of the architects' plans
and prophecies that

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:32.390 align:middle line:84%
have been laid down and
available for you for so long.

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:34.430 align:middle line:84%
You are coming to
this culmination point

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:36.350 align:middle line:84%
in human history,
which will take

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:39.440 align:middle line:90%
place between 2030 and 2050.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And that will be when
your whole world opens up

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.900 align:middle line:90%
as a human planet.

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And that is also why there is
such an intensity at this time.

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Because the veil is being,
shall we say, burned open.

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And that can be challenging,
as the frequencies assimilate

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.580 align:middle line:84%
with all of you as
human beings, especially

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:04.760 align:middle line:84%
for those of you who are the
early adopters of that message

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:07.670 align:middle line:90%
and that energy.

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:14.810 align:middle line:84%
>> So our past and the future
and this point of the now--

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:18.620 align:middle line:84%
almost, the way we view the
past and the future, those lines

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.560 align:middle line:84%
are becoming merged
in a sense, as well?

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:22.680 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:23.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And what we would
say is it is a little

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:30.500 align:middle line:84%
like the earth was put into cryo
sleep for 1,000 years or so.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And we would say that from
the 1940s period onwards,

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:41.510 align:middle line:84%
your universal interaction has
become stronger, because you

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:44.030 align:middle line:90%
are coming out of cryo sleep.

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:48.470 align:middle line:84%
Cryo sleep is-- another
way of putting it,

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:51.590 align:middle line:84%
it really means that you
have been somewhat separate

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:54.650 align:middle line:84%
from your universal origins
for quite some time.

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:56.690 align:middle line:84%
But that you have
been reawakened

00:20:56.690 --> 00:21:02.420 align:middle line:84%
with your universal source
point in this last 60, 70

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:03.380 align:middle line:90%
years on the planet.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:05.220 align:middle line:90%
And that is set to grow.

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:06.920 align:middle line:84%
It is not that there
wasn't evolution

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.390 align:middle line:90%
during the cryo sleep.

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:12.080 align:middle line:84%
But the evolutionary
cycle of human beings

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.730 align:middle line:84%
was very slow, from
our perspective.

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:21.260 align:middle line:84%
So there was no need for us or
for you to interact with beings

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:23.030 align:middle line:90%
who were not of the earth.

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:25.760 align:middle line:84%
Even though there has
always been some contact,

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:28.220 align:middle line:84%
it is in the last
50, 60 years that you

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:31.870 align:middle line:84%
have seen an this rise
of interdimensional

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:35.770 align:middle line:84%
and galactic contact with
the Earth once again.

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:37.750 align:middle line:84%
For the earth is coming
back to the point

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:40.300 align:middle line:84%
of origin, which is
where you left off

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:43.180 align:middle line:90%
before cryo sleep began.

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>> With-- and was this
awakening with the atomic bomb.

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:49.510 align:middle line:90%
Did that have a major influence?

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:50.740 align:middle line:90%
>> It is a part of it.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:54.550 align:middle line:84%
But we actually have
evidence that there

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:57.580 align:middle line:84%
were many other bombs
that you were not

00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:00.790 align:middle line:84%
aware of that were taking
place underground that

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:02.110 align:middle line:90%
were part of The Awakening.

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:07.900 align:middle line:84%
In a way, they were signals
to put Earth back on the map.

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:10.270 align:middle line:84%
It is not that
Earth was forgotten.

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:13.960 align:middle line:84%
It is simply that the merging
of galactic consciousness

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:17.724 align:middle line:84%
and earthly consciousness
separated for a while

00:22:17.724 --> 00:22:21.920 align:middle line:84%
while humans went
through their evolution.

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And now you are
back at the point

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.470 align:middle line:84%
where the merging
of consciousness

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:30.940 align:middle line:84%
between Earth and galactic
knowledge is very important.

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:35.620 align:middle line:84%
>> What was the purpose
of this cryo sleep?

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:36.640 align:middle line:90%
If there was one?

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:41.230 align:middle line:84%
>> There was no purpose, other
than it was always going to be

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:42.460 align:middle line:90%
thus.

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:45.250 align:middle line:84%
Different species and
planets go through what

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:49.480 align:middle line:84%
we would call accelerated
periods and slower periods.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And so it was always
by design to see

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:55.690 align:middle line:84%
how humanity would
progress if left

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:58.900 align:middle line:90%
to its mostly own resources.

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.750 align:middle line:10%
And what was noticed
is that while there

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:05.950 align:middle line:10%
was some evolution had taken
place on the planet, when you

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:08.770 align:middle line:10%
were brought back into
the fold, as it were,

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:10.900 align:middle line:10%
with universal
energies and contact

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:14.590 align:middle line:10%
started to be made
again in a bigger way,

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:17.320 align:middle line:10%
there were a few alarm bells.

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:20.170 align:middle line:84%
Earth had been
somewhat quarantined.

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And what was clear was certain
energies on your planet

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:30.130 align:middle line:84%
had moved quite hard into
the heart of darkness.

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And there were
certain implications

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.340 align:middle line:84%
that if they were allowed to
carry on with their plans,

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:38.740 align:middle line:84%
there would be consequences
universally, not

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:40.240 align:middle line:90%
just for the Earth.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:44.050 align:middle line:84%
So this was something
that has slowed down

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:45.940 align:middle line:84%
the progress of what
many of you would like

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:50.380 align:middle line:84%
to refer to as disclosure,
or people becoming more aware

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:52.690 align:middle line:90%
of their galactic origins.

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:56.170 align:middle line:84%
For dealing with
neutralizing some

00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:59.380 align:middle line:84%
of that potential
negative force has taken

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:02.230 align:middle line:90%
a lot longer than was expected.

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:06.130 align:middle line:84%
So the cryo sleep was
always going to happen.

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And we use that term,
for we understand

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:09.790 align:middle line:84%
that that is how
many of you have

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:12.950 align:middle line:84%
come to understand it through
your science fiction stories.

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:15.610 align:middle line:84%
Many of which are
based in truth.

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:19.480 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't necessarily
a punishment or anything

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:20.290 align:middle line:90%
negative.

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:23.560 align:middle line:84%
It was simply that
that was the plan.

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:29.230 align:middle line:84%
But when the contact was made
again, what was found on Earth

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:31.390 align:middle line:84%
was a little different
to what was expected.

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And we would say that those
dark energies are still

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:36.370 align:middle line:90%
being diminished now.

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:39.340 align:middle line:84%
It is what has slowed down
the progress of the people's

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:43.480 align:middle line:84%
readiness to reembrace
their galactic heritage--

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:48.860 align:middle line:84%
the distraction and the
constriction of earthbound war.

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:54.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And once these energies
are subdued or transformed,

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:58.070 align:middle line:84%
then we can reconnect with
our galactic families?

00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.870 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:59.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:01.203 align:middle line:84%
They do not all
need to disappear.

00:25:01.203 --> 00:25:02.870 align:middle line:84%
They just need to be
somewhat minimized.

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And we would say between
1980 and your now, about 40%

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:13.090 align:middle line:84%
of progress has been made,
which is why we are forecasting

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:18.190 align:middle line:84%
to you that you have around 20
more years for these energies

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:22.330 align:middle line:84%
to minimize and the
consciousness energies to grow.

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:24.790 align:middle line:84%
That is why more and more
people are awakening.

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:27.040 align:middle line:84%
They do not necessarily
need to be told

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.480 align:middle line:90%
about their galactic origins.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And even if they
were told that, it

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:32.230 align:middle line:84%
would be hard for many
of them to swallow.

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:35.250 align:middle line:84%
But what is undeniable is what
they are beginning to feel.

00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:38.260 align:middle line:10%
For as more people are
coming back to their expanded

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:40.540 align:middle line:10%
consciousness, they
realize that what

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:43.210 align:middle line:10%
they've been told about
being a human being

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:45.370 align:middle line:10%
is a very limited lie.

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:46.700 align:middle line:90%
And that is OK.

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:49.480 align:middle line:84%
That was always going to be
part of the game for the souls

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.400 align:middle line:90%
who chose to incarnate.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:55.870 align:middle line:84%
But that is why those who have
been incarnated since contact

00:25:55.870 --> 00:26:01.000 align:middle line:84%
started to come again from
the 1940s and 50s onwards

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.520 align:middle line:90%
in great strength--

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.820 align:middle line:84%
those who have incarnated
after that time

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:09.010 align:middle line:84%
have come here to be
bridge generations.

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And they were born onto a planet
that was experiencing a higher

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:14.890 align:middle line:90%
galactic frequency.

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And so they are a little
less alarmed by the idea

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:20.690 align:middle line:84%
that they are anything
other than that.

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:21.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:26.440 align:middle line:84%
So is it almost,
as we transmute,

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:29.890 align:middle line:84%
is it almost an exponential
or like an avalanche,

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:31.450 align:middle line:84%
a snowball type
effect, where it just

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:32.930 align:middle line:90%
keeps going faster and faster?

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:33.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:36.590 align:middle line:84%
You will see around
10 years from now,

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:42.000 align:middle line:84%
so 2029, that the world will
be a much more conscious place.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.480 align:middle line:90%
But war will still exist.

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.440 align:middle line:84%
So at that point, the
polarization between those

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.770 align:middle line:84%
who stand for
expansion and oneness

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:55.300 align:middle line:84%
and those who want to
limit, control, and cause

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:59.890 align:middle line:84%
a reduction in people,
in thinking, in feeling,

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:03.220 align:middle line:84%
that polarity will be strong
around a decade from now.

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:04.713 align:middle line:90%
Even stronger than it is now.

00:27:04.713 --> 00:27:06.130 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that many of you

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:10.270 align:middle line:84%
are reacting to in recent
years is your sudden awareness

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:12.340 align:middle line:90%
of the increase in polarity.

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:14.860 align:middle line:84%
We will say that will
take even more shape

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:17.080 align:middle line:90%
and form over the next decade.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:20.080 align:middle line:84%
But you do not need
to, shall we say,

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:21.700 align:middle line:90%
concern yourselves with that.

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:23.080 align:middle line:90%
It is an inevitability.

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.930 align:middle line:84%
It is like trying to
stop a seven-year-old

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:27.910 align:middle line:90%
from becoming a 17-year-old.

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:30.640 align:middle line:84%
You cannot stop the body from
going through the teenage

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:31.440 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.590 align:middle line:84%
That is what it
is designed to do.

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:37.300 align:middle line:84%
So there is an inevitability to
this time that you are all in.

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:42.190 align:middle line:84%
But what we will say is that
it is around a decade to two

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:46.060 align:middle line:84%
from now that you will have
even more evidential help

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:49.780 align:middle line:84%
on the planet from sources
that you might not even

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:52.810 align:middle line:90%
think of the Earth.

00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:56.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we have this beautiful
help right now from the Zs

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.000 align:middle line:84%
and many others in
this form and fashion.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And Lee doing his work
with transformation.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.680 align:middle line:90%
So, much appreciated.

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>> You also have many
in physical form.

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:10.150 align:middle line:84%
They are just not
easily recognizable

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:13.975 align:middle line:90%
or are less often visible.

00:28:13.975 --> 00:28:18.280 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the significance
of the number 88?

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:22.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this is a
unity number for us.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.810 align:middle line:90%
What it does for us--

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:27.460 align:middle line:84%
and the reason that the balance
of the 88 works for us-- is it

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:30.190 align:middle line:90%
creates a balance spiral.

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:36.160 align:middle line:84%
One of the jobs that we have,
unlike other, shall we say,

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:40.870 align:middle line:84%
channeled entities or beings,
is to thoroughly create

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:42.250 align:middle line:90%
balance on the planet.

00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:46.690 align:middle line:84%
So every channel
has specific roles.

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Some are a little
more scientific.

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:51.340 align:middle line:84%
Some are a little
more galactic history.

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:54.420 align:middle line:84%
Lee being a strong
empath and intuitive.

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:59.530 align:middle line:84%
It was the right vessel for
us to bridge with in order

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:03.730 align:middle line:84%
to help bring balance to
those who are here to help

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:05.040 align:middle line:90%
bring balance to the planet.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:09.310 align:middle line:84%
So those who are interested
in listening to him

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:13.960 align:middle line:84%
or us through him are those
who are also balancing forces.

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And so we as a
group of 88, because

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:23.080 align:middle line:84%
of the formation of the 88,
it is stabilizing for us.

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:26.080 align:middle line:84%
If we were to lose
a few connections,

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:28.878 align:middle line:84%
it would shift us
in different ways.

00:29:28.878 --> 00:29:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And there have been
times where we have not

00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:33.460 align:middle line:84%
been able to make full
contact with all 88.

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And the messages
have not been, shall

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:38.080 align:middle line:84%
we say, as grounded
in the frequencies

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.910 align:middle line:90%
that they deliver to the earth.

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:45.250 align:middle line:84%
So we have a very strong
focus on staying connected

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:49.480 align:middle line:84%
as a group, even if some of us
are off in other dimensions,

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.800 align:middle line:90%
doing other things.

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.900 align:middle line:84%
We have an agreement
to always leave

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:55.720 align:middle line:84%
a piece of our
sonic architecture,

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:59.560 align:middle line:84%
for we exist very much in
sound and sonic architecture

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:01.870 align:middle line:84%
with each other
and with the group.

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:04.180 align:middle line:84%
So it means that certain
members of our group

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:06.880 align:middle line:90%
can be quite stretched at times.

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:10.060 align:middle line:84%
But they are stretched
only because they

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:13.000 align:middle line:84%
are willing and agreeing
to leave an anchor point

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.980 align:middle line:90%
within our group of 88.

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:18.050 align:middle line:84%
For that is how we
maintain our balance.

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And if we were to dramatically
lose too many numbers

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:26.020 align:middle line:84%
from the 88, then Lee would
have to start a new contract.

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:30.490 align:middle line:84%
That is not foreseen, for part
of the reason that none of us

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:35.080 align:middle line:84%
are formed in the way that
you know form is to make sure

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.260 align:middle line:84%
that we are able to keep
traveling and moving so that we

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:40.330 align:middle line:90%
can preserve our connection.

00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:44.860 align:middle line:84%
If we were in form at
this time or too dense,

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:49.930 align:middle line:84%
we might be finding it difficult
to move with the changes.

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:53.950 align:middle line:84%
So that is why we stay in
this agreement with our group

00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:56.140 align:middle line:90%
and with Lee at this time.

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:59.780 align:middle line:84%
>> So like a sonic
or frequency family?

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:00.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And 2014 is a year that
there was a possibility

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:06.550 align:middle line:90%
for dissolution to take place.

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:08.500 align:middle line:84%
And there was a choice
for Lee to stop.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And it was something he
thought about consciously.

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:14.500 align:middle line:84%
But actually, what happened
was, a new level of commitment

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:16.240 align:middle line:90%
was made in 2015.

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And so we were able
to become stronger.

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:23.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Was that also not just
a personal Lee choice,

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:30.160 align:middle line:84%
but perhaps a collective energy
timeline choice for humanity?

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.230 align:middle line:84%
>> He thought it was
a personal Lee choice,

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:36.520 align:middle line:84%
the way that humans tend
to experience things.

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:39.040 align:middle line:84%
But actually, what
was going on was

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.270 align:middle line:84%
there were different
contracts up for,

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:44.350 align:middle line:84%
shall we say, grabs
with other human beings.

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:48.910 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, all of you play a
role in the puzzle of earth.

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And as one person moves
out of their role,

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:55.330 align:middle line:84%
another person can move in
and occupy or fill that space.

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:59.440 align:middle line:84%
There was another-- who we do
expect in three or four years

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:02.560 align:middle line:84%
will be holding a certain
energy point on the planet--

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:05.290 align:middle line:84%
who was primed to
take Lee's place.

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And at the time,
he was not sure he

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:10.480 align:middle line:84%
could continue to stabilize
his body's energy in the way

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.890 align:middle line:90%
that he needed to.

00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:14.470 align:middle line:84%
So his personal
choice, Lee's, was

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:16.870 align:middle line:84%
to consider giving
up channeling.

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And he considered
it very strongly.

00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:23.560 align:middle line:84%
But instead, he doubled
down on his commitment

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:26.260 align:middle line:84%
and changed his own
consciousness and frequency

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:29.060 align:middle line:84%
and his own life in
order to continue.

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:33.100 align:middle line:84%
So it is to say that in
three or four years, when

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:36.510 align:middle line:84%
this other being, who is in
many ways a mirror of Lee,

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:41.020 align:middle line:84%
steps up to the plate with his
commitment of what he might

00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:43.930 align:middle line:84%
bring to the planet, there
will be an opportunity for Lee

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:48.720 align:middle line:84%
to step off to the side and hold
a different space for people.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Is Lee aware of this person?

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:54.550 align:middle line:84%
>> He is not until he is sitting
listening to this now this is

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:56.090 align:middle line:84%
the first that Lee
has heard of it,

00:32:56.090 --> 00:33:00.910 align:middle line:84%
which is why channeling can be
uncomfortable for the human.

00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that-- we'll let
Lee unpack that himself.

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:05.990 align:middle line:84%
>> We will say that this
being is much younger.

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:09.700 align:middle line:84%
At this time, this being
is only 23 years old.

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And at that time,
this being was 18.

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And so when this
young man is 26, 27,

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:22.720 align:middle line:84%
then he will be more primed and
ready to hold energetic space

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.100 align:middle line:90%
for a group of people.

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:28.000 align:middle line:84%
It would not have served
his development before now.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.920 align:middle line:84%
But we would like
to point this out--

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.360 align:middle line:84%
all of you are connected
to people in this way,

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.660 align:middle line:84%
it is not something you
are always aware of.

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:37.000 align:middle line:90%
You may never meet these people.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.790 align:middle line:84%
But in much the
same way that you

00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:43.000 align:middle line:84%
would like to have relationship
break ups with people,

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.270 align:middle line:84%
you are deeply connected to
that person's next partner,

00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:49.180 align:middle line:84%
even though you may not meet
that person's next partner

00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:51.830 align:middle line:84%
until you learn of
their existence.

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:54.790 align:middle line:84%
But you as a soul are already
vibrating in harmony with them.

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:57.460 align:middle line:84%
So as you step
out, they step in.

00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And the contract is
never just your decision.

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:03.460 align:middle line:84%
You may think you are leaving a
toxic or difficult relationship

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:05.440 align:middle line:90%
because you've had enough.

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:08.199 align:middle line:84%
That is partly the point
you have to get to.

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:10.330 align:middle line:84%
But also, the next
circumstances have

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:13.179 align:middle line:84%
to line up for the person
you are leaving to.

00:34:13.179 --> 00:34:16.699 align:middle line:84%
And that is what can
facilitate the flow of energy.

00:34:16.699 --> 00:34:18.610 align:middle line:84%
So this is how you
are all more deeply

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:21.699 align:middle line:84%
connected than any of you
perceive or understand,

00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:24.182 align:middle line:90%
often, on a day to day basis.

00:34:24.182 --> 00:34:25.239 align:middle line:90%
>> Fascinating.

00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Is the idea of this other
person taking over--

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:32.590 align:middle line:84%
is it not possible
for Lee to continue

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:36.340 align:middle line:84%
this work and the other person
simultaneously to do the work?

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:38.260 align:middle line:90%
Or is it more--

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:40.460 align:middle line:84%
is that how this
works in general?

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:43.179 align:middle line:84%
>> It can be at that point that
there are different things.

00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:47.380 align:middle line:84%
But where Lee's timeline is
going is expansion, also.

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:49.540 align:middle line:84%
So it is not that
Lee would ever have

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:51.760 align:middle line:90%
to lose his connection with us.

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.040 align:middle line:84%
That will always remain
true for him, personally.

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And that is one
thing that he was

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:58.780 align:middle line:84%
deeply aware of when he was
wondering about stepping down

00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:00.520 align:middle line:90%
from the public role.

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:04.180 align:middle line:84%
But we do see Lee
as someone who is

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:07.060 align:middle line:84%
an energy bridge and an
energy holder for others.

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And that will be part of
his path all of his life.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:13.120 align:middle line:84%
In fact, all of the things
he has done since childhood

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:17.320 align:middle line:84%
have been, by design, him
creating energy worlds

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:21.500 align:middle line:84%
and energy impulses for others
to experience themselves

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:22.300 align:middle line:90%
through.

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:25.790 align:middle line:84%
Or an aspect of themselves
that they are yet to birth.

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:28.250 align:middle line:84%
That is part of
his human design.

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And we do not see
that changing for him

00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:33.720 align:middle line:90%
until well into his 60s.

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm sure Lee's
going to enjoy a lot of this

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.120 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:39.260 align:middle line:84%
He is actually a little
uncomfortable about it.

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:40.060 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:42.540 align:middle line:84%
>> But that is for
him to deal with.

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:45.010 align:middle line:84%
>> We will move on to
some next subjects.

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:50.490 align:middle line:90%


00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:52.580 align:middle line:90%
>> You know, it's kind of a gem.

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:56.360 align:middle line:84%
It's funny, I don't know whether
Josh Brolin lives here or not,

00:35:56.360 --> 00:36:00.050 align:middle line:84%
because his dad and
Barbra Streisand

00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:01.780 align:middle line:90%
live on the next road.

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:04.280 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know whether he comes
down here and sees his dad,

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:06.930 align:middle line:90%
or--

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:07.737 align:middle line:90%
the unit's here.

00:36:07.737 --> 00:36:08.570 align:middle line:90%
But I see him a lot.

00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:11.470 align:middle line:90%


00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:14.920 align:middle line:90%
His role was awesome.

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:18.280 align:middle line:84%
>> And it was kind
of very moving.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:20.890 align:middle line:90%
>> For a not very nice villain.

00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:21.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:24.492 align:middle line:84%
Which I find
interesting, which is--

00:36:24.492 --> 00:36:26.700 align:middle line:84%
you know, we're finally
going to get to our villains.

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:30.570 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing that-- we're seeing
their perspectives, instead

00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:33.540 align:middle line:84%
of just being
stereotypical bad guy.

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:34.622 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:34.622 --> 00:36:39.890 align:middle line:90%


00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:40.690 align:middle line:90%
Great story.

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:43.602 align:middle line:90%


00:36:43.602 --> 00:36:44.435 align:middle line:90%
Good to have layers.

00:36:44.435 --> 00:36:56.480 align:middle line:90%


00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:01.880 align:middle line:84%
>> The idea of integrating
the dark and the dark side--

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.520 align:middle line:90%
or the dark and the light--

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:05.750 align:middle line:90%
instead of pushing away.

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:08.400 align:middle line:84%
This is a topic that Lee's
covered, many other schools

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.930 align:middle line:84%
or teachers now are covering,
to sort of embrace the light.

00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:13.460 align:middle line:84%
Could you could you talk
about that for a little bit?

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, all of you can
transmute the dark to some

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:16.940 align:middle line:90%
degree.

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, we are not
saying that you can

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:21.470 align:middle line:84%
be with one who is
demonically possessed

00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:24.290 align:middle line:84%
and literally open your
energy field to them

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:27.170 align:middle line:84%
and hope that it goes away
and that you are safe.

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:29.150 align:middle line:90%
For there are degrees.

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:32.570 align:middle line:84%
But all of you are capable
of neutralizing the dark

00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:33.740 align:middle line:90%
with your own light.

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:36.500 align:middle line:90%
This is true for you yourselves.

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is true for
you toward others.

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:41.540 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
there are many who--

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:44.490 align:middle line:84%
we will use the example
of addiction here.

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:46.190 align:middle line:10%
And there are many
who have suffered

00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:48.620 align:middle line:10%
through their
addiction or reliance

00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:52.460 align:middle line:10%
on substances to, we
would say, activate

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:55.550 align:middle line:10%
the dark inside themselves
over and over again.

00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:59.240 align:middle line:84%
The irony is that people believe
that those who become addicted

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:04.070 align:middle line:84%
to substances are trying
to escape their life

00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:08.110 align:middle line:84%
and they absolutely do not
want to manifest the dark.

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:11.090 align:middle line:84%
But what we would say is they
become addicted to the crash

00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:12.310 align:middle line:90%
more than the high.

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And so whatever
the substances that

00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:15.980 align:middle line:84%
gives them temporary
relief is not really

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:17.180 align:middle line:90%
what they're seeking.

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:20.030 align:middle line:84%
They are seeking to
deeply feel the dark.

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:22.910 align:middle line:10%
So many who have
manifested addictions

00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:25.190 align:middle line:10%
have done this to
get deeply in touch

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:26.720 align:middle line:10%
with the darkness
they feel and they

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:28.670 align:middle line:10%
are terrified of in the world.

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:32.620 align:middle line:10%
Their sensitivity is such that
they feel this darkness just

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:33.590 align:middle line:10%
at their perimeter.

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:40.430 align:middle line:84%
That them imbibing a substance
or using a certain act

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:44.270 align:middle line:84%
to repeatedly escape and
try and create a high--

00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:46.640 align:middle line:84%
it is a little bit
like a bungee jump.

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:50.060 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they take the jump and
there is some temporary relief

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:51.020 align:middle line:90%
or some high.

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:53.660 align:middle line:84%
But then they are going to
spring back the other way just

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:55.570 align:middle line:90%
as fast, if not faster.

00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:59.060 align:middle line:84%
So what we would
point out here is

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:00.680 align:middle line:84%
those who have
managed to recover

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:04.010 align:middle line:84%
from addictive tendencies,
even if they still

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:06.200 align:middle line:84%
notice they have impulses,
but they have learned

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:08.490 align:middle line:90%
how to not act upon them.

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:11.600 align:middle line:84%
They have learned to transmute
the dark inside themselves.

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:14.930 align:middle line:84%
They have learned to live with
a certain level of darkness

00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:15.860 align:middle line:90%
inside themselves.

00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:19.250 align:middle line:84%
But become a master of
not bouncing into it.

00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:22.290 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, you can do the
same with other people.

00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:26.000 align:middle line:84%
You can be unaffected by the
darkness in another being

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.910 align:middle line:84%
or another person
because you are so locked

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:33.990 align:middle line:84%
into your own energy field and
impermeable by heavy darkness

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.790 align:middle line:90%
from others.

00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:36.830 align:middle line:84%
Because you have come
to understand who

00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:39.330 align:middle line:84%
you are and you have
explored yourself.

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:42.140 align:middle line:84%
But there are those who
are capable of choosing

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:45.500 align:middle line:84%
to merge with their lover,
their friend, their family

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:48.350 align:middle line:84%
member, for a moment
while they are in darkness

00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:51.170 align:middle line:84%
and giving them a little
bit of a lift, a little bit

00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:53.300 align:middle line:90%
of a transmission of light.

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.160 align:middle line:84%
Not at their own
expense, for that

00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:59.570 align:middle line:84%
can drain people, but enough
light to share with another so

00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:01.670 align:middle line:84%
that that person
can remember to walk

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:03.140 align:middle line:90%
toward the light in themselves.

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:05.120 align:middle line:10%
You sometimes call
these people healers,

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:07.052 align:middle line:10%
those who do it in big ways.

00:40:07.052 --> 00:40:08.510 align:middle line:10%
And then, of course,
all of you are

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:11.010 align:middle line:10%
doing it all of the
time with each other.

00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:13.580 align:middle line:84%
So the reason we
bring this up is

00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:16.430 align:middle line:84%
to say, the reason none of you
should be afraid of the dark

00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:17.990 align:middle line:90%
is because the dark exists.

00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And if you are afraid of the
dark, it has power over you,

00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:22.130 align:middle line:84%
whether that is
in another person

00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:23.970 align:middle line:90%
or whether that is in yourself.

00:40:23.970 --> 00:40:27.080 align:middle line:84%
We fully understand the fear
of the dark, for many of you

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:29.570 align:middle line:84%
have seen that it is dark
energy and dark forces that

00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:33.500 align:middle line:84%
lead people to do
destructive or abhorrent acts

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:36.440 align:middle line:84%
toward other humans that can
cause more suffering pain

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:37.280 align:middle line:90%
and grief.

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:40.880 align:middle line:84%
But this is where those
who wake up no longer

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:44.920 align:middle line:84%
see the human experience
as all that there is.

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:47.780 align:middle line:10%
And they understand that
beyond suffering, beyond pain,

00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:50.900 align:middle line:10%
beyond fear, there
is a universal energy

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:55.070 align:middle line:10%
field that is far bigger than
any of those focused feelings.

00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:57.830 align:middle line:10%
That does not mean that
all enlightened souls

00:40:57.830 --> 00:41:03.080 align:middle line:10%
can completely be void to
grief or pain or suffering.

00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:06.350 align:middle line:84%
But it is more that they
can notice that experience

00:41:06.350 --> 00:41:09.800 align:middle line:84%
as it moves through them without
thinking they have become it.

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Which leads us
back to addiction.

00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:14.960 align:middle line:84%
Addiction is when you are
re-triggering the dark fully

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:16.070 align:middle line:90%
through you.

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:18.840 align:middle line:84%
You think you are
causing yourself relief.

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:22.370 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, you are plunging
yourself back into darkness.

00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
same with those who

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:28.010 align:middle line:84%
are addicted to studying
fear, conspiracy in the world.

00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:30.770 align:middle line:84%
They are actually so
focused on the dark forces

00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:32.570 align:middle line:84%
that they have
forgotten the light.

00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:34.970 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be
a little careful

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:38.960 align:middle line:84%
when you are an activist for
consciousness on this planet,

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:41.660 align:middle line:84%
for the fear can
become you and suck you

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:45.560 align:middle line:84%
in in a way that makes it
very hard for you to transmute

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:49.040 align:middle line:84%
the amount of fear that you
are focused on or absorbing.

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.560 align:middle line:84%
So it is a very fine
and delicate balance.

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.720 align:middle line:84%
But to conclude
our answer to you,

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:57.930 align:middle line:84%
we would say you need not
be afraid of the darkness

00:41:57.930 --> 00:41:59.190 align:middle line:90%
because it exists.

00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:00.990 align:middle line:84%
It existed the
day you were born.

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:03.600 align:middle line:84%
And for most of you,
a good dose of it

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:05.760 align:middle line:84%
will still be here
the day you die.

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:09.870 align:middle line:84%
Instead, it is learning where
to place your energetic focus,

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:13.590 align:middle line:84%
your mental focus, and the
focus of your energy field

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:15.720 align:middle line:90%
as much of the time as you can.

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And that is what can
carry many people

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:22.950 align:middle line:84%
through difficult circumstances
or very difficult dense places.

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:26.040 align:middle line:84%
Sure, you have to work
harder in those moments.

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.440 align:middle line:84%
But if you know
how to do the work

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:31.740 align:middle line:84%
and how to focus yourself
and the importance of it,

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:35.310 align:middle line:84%
you are able to carry yourself
through to a place that

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:37.940 align:middle line:90%
has a clearer vibration.

00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:40.620 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's not about
eliminating the dark, so to say,

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:45.780 align:middle line:84%
but just focusing on more light
or more of what serves you

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:46.590 align:middle line:90%
in a positive way.

00:42:46.590 --> 00:42:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Darkness is part of humanity.

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:50.010 align:middle line:90%
It is part of the DNA.

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:53.550 align:middle line:84%
We are not saying that is a
good thing or a pleasing thing.

00:42:53.550 --> 00:42:57.390 align:middle line:84%
But it is part of the world
that you have all been on.

00:42:57.390 --> 00:42:59.910 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about the
evolution of consciousness

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:02.730 align:middle line:84%
right now, it is a
very slow process.

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:07.830 align:middle line:84%
It will keep going for
years, decades to come.

00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And you are all seeing a
certain lightning happening.

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:14.220 align:middle line:84%
But it is a little
bit like trying

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:19.200 align:middle line:84%
to continue to build
more levels on a building

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:21.670 align:middle line:84%
while blowing up the
basement at the same time.

00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:23.820 align:middle line:84%
The basement is
actually the foundation

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:26.550 align:middle line:84%
that the penthouse
is built upon.

00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:29.130 align:middle line:84%
So you are building
more penthouses

00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:31.830 align:middle line:84%
and trying to clear out your
basement right now in terms

00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:33.690 align:middle line:90%
of your acts of consciousness.

00:43:33.690 --> 00:43:36.650 align:middle line:84%
But they are all
connected to each other.

00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:39.360 align:middle line:10%
And so we would say to any
who are listening to this

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:42.840 align:middle line:10%
and perhaps confused
about what we are saying,

00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:46.200 align:middle line:10%
once you make peace with the
fact that there is darkness,

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:49.050 align:middle line:10%
and there is suffering
on this planet,

00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:52.290 align:middle line:10%
you really begin to
access your power,

00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:56.420 align:middle line:10%
for you are no longer in fight
or resistance to what is.

00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And then that means you
can start to dance with it,

00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:03.480 align:middle line:84%
maneuver around it, and
maneuver yourself into a place

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:07.140 align:middle line:84%
that you can breathe, even if
you are afraid that there might

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:09.430 align:middle line:90%
be an oxygen leak in the room.

00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:11.760 align:middle line:90%
>> And go deeper, so to say.

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:13.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Deeper and more expanded.

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:16.410 align:middle line:84%
For again, when you
go into the energy

00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:18.600 align:middle line:84%
field of universal
consciousness,

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:21.382 align:middle line:84%
it is far bigger than
the human energy field.

00:44:21.382 --> 00:44:23.340 align:middle line:84%
There are many of you
who have experienced this

00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:26.730 align:middle line:84%
through meditation or your
own awakened experiences.

00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:30.150 align:middle line:84%
Certain drugs have
induced this state

00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:33.205 align:middle line:90%
of oneness for certain people.

00:44:33.205 --> 00:44:34.830 align:middle line:84%
It does not work for
everybody, though.

00:44:34.830 --> 00:44:37.570 align:middle line:84%
We should add that caveat,
for we know many of you

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:38.370 align:middle line:90%
are disappointed.

00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:41.440 align:middle line:84%
You have tried the same
drugs that work for others

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:44.850 align:middle line:84%
and they haven't worked for you,
these shamanic substances that

00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:49.150 align:middle line:84%
can induce a moment of
high sensory living.

00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:53.415 align:middle line:84%
I'm working on a ayahuasca
documentary at the moment.

00:44:53.415 --> 00:44:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And yes, it's
definitely good for some

00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.800 align:middle line:84%
and not good for
others, I've noticed.

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:00.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Like everything
on the planet,

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.630 align:middle line:90%
for you are all so unique.

00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:02.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:03.990 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:07.890 align:middle line:84%
Could you tell us what is
the purpose of the ego?

00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:08.820 align:middle line:90%
The human ego?

00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>> We cannot tell you so much
what the purpose of the ego is.

00:45:12.590 --> 00:45:14.520 align:middle line:84%
For instead, we would
have to say what is

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:16.290 align:middle line:90%
the purpose of the human being.

00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:18.450 align:middle line:90%
The two are so intertwined.

00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:22.630 align:middle line:84%
In many ways-- we will give
you one way of looking at it.

00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:28.680 align:middle line:84%
The soul is, shall we say,
drilled into the human body.

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:30.540 align:middle line:90%
And that is the ego.

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:35.760 align:middle line:84%
So for those of you who are free
of human ego, human identity,

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:41.090 align:middle line:84%
human drive, human function,
then you would feel very

00:45:41.090 --> 00:45:44.532 align:middle line:84%
and, shall we say,
non-committal to being a human

00:45:44.532 --> 00:45:45.490 align:middle line:90%
and being on the Earth.

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:48.960 align:middle line:84%
You would feel it is all
completely an illusion.

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:50.820 align:middle line:84%
Which, of course, to
some degree, it is.

00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:52.440 align:middle line:10%
But that's not really the point.

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:54.600 align:middle line:10%
You don't come to Earth
to rise above Earth.

00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:57.300 align:middle line:10%
You come to Earth
to be part of Earth

00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:59.880 align:middle line:10%
as you are rising in
your own frequency,

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:03.930 align:middle line:10%
and offering that rising
frequency to others as you go.

00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:05.730 align:middle line:84%
So that as a whole,
the Earth can

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:08.370 align:middle line:84%
rise, rather than you have
a separatist experience

00:46:08.370 --> 00:46:11.170 align:middle line:84%
of disassociating from
everyone on the planet.

00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:12.300 align:middle line:90%
You may as well be dead.

00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:15.480 align:middle line:10%
It would be far nicer for you
than just simply meditating

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:18.210 align:middle line:10%
and levitating out of
your body, while watching

00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:20.350 align:middle line:10%
all this madness around you.

00:46:20.350 --> 00:46:24.960 align:middle line:84%
So the ego is the part
of not only you as a soul

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:28.430 align:middle line:84%
and the specific human
lessons for the ego,

00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:31.590 align:middle line:84%
it contains encoding
from your other lifetimes

00:46:31.590 --> 00:46:35.640 align:middle line:84%
and what some of you call karma,
which is often misunderstood.

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:38.820 align:middle line:84%
Karma can be used
as destiny, too.

00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Many times, karma is only seen
as lessons needed to learn.

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:46.350 align:middle line:84%
We would say karma is very
much a piece of architecture

00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:47.550 align:middle line:90%
for the human being.

00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:49.890 align:middle line:84%
It is part of your
destiny map, what

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:52.640 align:middle line:84%
it is that you came back to
experience in the human body

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:54.650 align:middle line:84%
this time, that
you pre-programmed

00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:55.910 align:middle line:90%
before your birth.

00:46:55.910 --> 00:47:00.350 align:middle line:10%
So the ego is how these soul
pins into the human body.

00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:03.030 align:middle line:10%
But the ego comes from
two different places.

00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:05.270 align:middle line:84%
It comes from your
own soul and it

00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:09.770 align:middle line:84%
comes from all of the
ancestral wounds and joys

00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:12.920 align:middle line:84%
and expansive parts of
humanity and the limited parts

00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:17.490 align:middle line:84%
of humanity that you interact
with before you are even born.

00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:19.880 align:middle line:84%
So you have an
ancestral ego that

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:21.620 align:middle line:90%
comes through your family line.

00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
a very strong ego

00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:27.050 align:middle line:84%
that forms within the
first two to three years

00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:29.150 align:middle line:90%
of your life as a human being.

00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:32.210 align:middle line:84%
That is highly influenced
by where you are born.

00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:34.370 align:middle line:84%
The people you are
around, and the energy

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:36.770 align:middle line:90%
that is going on at that time.

00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:40.550 align:middle line:84%
This is why those who are born
straight after war, in areas

00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:42.530 align:middle line:84%
where war has just
taken place, have

00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:44.930 align:middle line:84%
a very different
nervous system to those

00:47:44.930 --> 00:47:48.410 align:middle line:84%
who are decades away from
the last war in the area

00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:49.940 align:middle line:90%
they were born.

00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:53.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And what types in
the nervous system--

00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:55.190 align:middle line:84%
can you go a little
deeper into that?

00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:56.630 align:middle line:90%
>> We would say highly wired.

00:47:56.630 --> 00:48:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And those people who tend to
thrive with their highly wired

00:48:00.350 --> 00:48:06.360 align:middle line:84%
nervous systems are ones who
go into provider, healer roles.

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And those who
suffer are the ones

00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:11.210 align:middle line:84%
who are unconscious
of what they absorbed,

00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:13.490 align:middle line:84%
the amount of fear
and anxiety that

00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:15.800 align:middle line:90%
is actually running their ego.

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:17.780 align:middle line:84%
So there are many who
are highly productive

00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:21.230 align:middle line:84%
and believe that they are
highly productive because they

00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:23.460 align:middle line:84%
like to be productive
and help the world.

00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:25.370 align:middle line:10%
But if they really
were able to look

00:48:25.370 --> 00:48:27.193 align:middle line:10%
under the hood of
their energy body,

00:48:27.193 --> 00:48:29.360 align:middle line:10%
they would see that they
have an ego that is written

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:31.730 align:middle line:10%
with an underlying anxiety.

00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:35.630 align:middle line:84%
Equally, you can be born
to a parent who is still

00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:38.570 align:middle line:84%
running that high nervous
system post a war,

00:48:38.570 --> 00:48:40.820 align:middle line:84%
and imbibe it from
them, if you were

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:42.620 align:middle line:90%
very bonded with that parent.

00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:44.630 align:middle line:84%
But what we would
like to point out here

00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:47.180 align:middle line:90%
is there is never a mistake.

00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:50.060 align:middle line:84%
Often, we see some
people annoyed at what

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:51.710 align:middle line:90%
they have imbibed or become.

00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And yet the truth is,
there is no mistake

00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:57.210 align:middle line:90%
here with what you experience.

00:48:57.210 --> 00:48:59.790 align:middle line:84%
We understand there are great
differences between experiences

00:48:59.790 --> 00:49:00.590 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:49:00.590 --> 00:49:04.040 align:middle line:84%
There are some who are very
lucky in the kinds of energies

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:07.820 align:middle line:84%
they are born into and the
privilege that their life gives

00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:09.350 align:middle line:90%
them versus others.

00:49:09.350 --> 00:49:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And so it can seem
very unfair to you

00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:14.930 align:middle line:84%
that one person is born into
great suffering and poverty

00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:17.870 align:middle line:84%
and difficulty and
another person is not.

00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:21.410 align:middle line:84%
But we do assure you that
all souls are aware of where

00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:23.270 align:middle line:90%
they are going on the planet.

00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And it is not
necessarily that a soul

00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:28.130 align:middle line:84%
who goes into a suffering
reality or a very

00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:31.430 align:middle line:84%
broken culture at a
very difficult time

00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:33.830 align:middle line:84%
in that culture's
earthly history

00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:35.600 align:middle line:90%
is necessarily being punished.

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Often, they are
choosing to go there,

00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:41.420 align:middle line:84%
because they are strong
enough and brave enough

00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:43.310 align:middle line:84%
that they want to
go into those times.

00:49:43.310 --> 00:49:47.360 align:middle line:84%
So you must be
careful about judging

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:50.330 align:middle line:84%
who ends up in a very
difficult life circumstance

00:49:50.330 --> 00:49:52.940 align:middle line:84%
and who ends up in a very
good one as being anything

00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:55.190 align:middle line:84%
to do with that
person's character

00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:56.660 align:middle line:90%
before they incarnated.

00:49:56.660 --> 00:50:00.730 align:middle line:90%


00:50:00.730 --> 00:50:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>> We humans are fascinated
with this idea of war, crisis,

00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:08.960 align:middle line:90%
and just drama.

00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:11.530 align:middle line:90%
Is there-- what is the purpose?

00:50:11.530 --> 00:50:13.000 align:middle line:90%
Or why do we create crisis?

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>> We would like to say
humans did not create war.

00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:21.050 align:middle line:84%
War was implanted on the
planet and humans are still

00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:24.290 align:middle line:84%
in the aftershock
of war and drama.

00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:27.740 align:middle line:84%
So the activated nervous
system of a human being

00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:30.840 align:middle line:84%
tells the human being that
the human being is alive.

00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:33.260 align:middle line:84%
So this is why those
who like to feed the war

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:36.710 align:middle line:84%
agenda on your planet like
to create entertainment,

00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:38.000 align:middle line:90%
stimulation.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And even the way that
they, shall we say,

00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:43.400 align:middle line:84%
designed certain
places that you would

00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:45.530 align:middle line:90%
like to go in large crowds.

00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:50.390 align:middle line:10%
It's designed to upset the
balance of the expanded soul

00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:55.590 align:middle line:10%
and instead feed on the egoic
nervous system and activate it.

00:50:55.590 --> 00:50:57.860 align:middle line:10%
And so many human
beings have not yet

00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:01.010 align:middle line:10%
realized they don't
really like drama or war.

00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:02.570 align:middle line:90%
Many have.

00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:05.120 align:middle line:10%
But others are just
stuck in a cycle

00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:08.720 align:middle line:10%
of re-triggering their
adrenaline over and over,

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:11.720 align:middle line:10%
because that is what they
have become infected with.

00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:14.750 align:middle line:10%
And other things that they
are doing in their life,

00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:17.000 align:middle line:10%
imbibing in their
life, and things they

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.870 align:middle line:10%
are being exposed to
keep them in that state.

00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:24.470 align:middle line:84%
So we would say that
war is a parasite.

00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:27.410 align:middle line:84%
It is an infection that
exists on your planet

00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:30.170 align:middle line:84%
that many humans
are infected with.

00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:32.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Is adrenaline a parasite?

00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:33.343 align:middle line:90%
Or is that separate?

00:51:33.343 --> 00:51:34.143 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:51:34.143 --> 00:51:35.990 align:middle line:84%
Adrenaline is a part
of the human system.

00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And originally, it was
designed to keep you safe

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:41.510 align:middle line:84%
and allow you to accelerate
at times that you

00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:42.530 align:middle line:90%
needed to accelerate.

00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:45.290 align:middle line:84%
But as many of the
earthly dangers

00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:49.370 align:middle line:84%
have minimized for a great
deal of the population,

00:51:49.370 --> 00:51:52.460 align:middle line:84%
your adrenaline has been
co-opted by those who

00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:55.790 align:middle line:90%
have decided to enslave you.

00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:59.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Myself being somewhat
of a adrenaline junkie,

00:51:59.470 --> 00:52:04.190 align:middle line:84%
being a stunt man and seeking
out these experiences--

00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:05.690 align:middle line:90%
I love amusement parks.

00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:09.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm just wondering, is
that tied into that war

00:52:09.110 --> 00:52:10.520 align:middle line:90%
parasite in a sense.

00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:13.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Not in your case, for
you love electrical energy.

00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And even in your
case, your interest

00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:19.075 align:middle line:84%
in what we would call
an adrenaline and war

00:52:19.075 --> 00:52:20.450 align:middle line:84%
is something that
you have always

00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:23.930 align:middle line:84%
enjoyed illustrating to
people as much as being in.

00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:28.130 align:middle line:84%
It is why you as a performer
and a person of this Earth who

00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:31.190 align:middle line:84%
has wanted to bring these
electrified experiences

00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:35.660 align:middle line:84%
to others have always enjoyed
the structure and architecture

00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:39.860 align:middle line:84%
around which you can build
those experiences for others.

00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:42.270 align:middle line:84%
We would say that
you, of course,

00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:46.520 align:middle line:84%
like all human beings have some
allegiance to, shall we say,

00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:48.320 align:middle line:84%
the science of
war, in your case.

00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:49.910 align:middle line:90%
Not the emotion of war.

00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:51.620 align:middle line:84%
In your case, the
science of war is

00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:54.110 align:middle line:84%
interesting to you
because of your times

00:52:54.110 --> 00:52:55.880 align:middle line:90%
in past as a warrior.

00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And that war is your
purpose in other lives.

00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:02.090 align:middle line:84%
So you have memories of
that encoded into you.

00:53:02.090 --> 00:53:06.200 align:middle line:84%
But you are very interested
in helping bring consciousness

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:09.710 align:middle line:84%
to the energy of war in
this time in your life.

00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And the side of
strategic war that

00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:18.140 align:middle line:84%
is not so much about hurting
others, as about, shall we say,

00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:20.840 align:middle line:84%
balancing and
defending yourself.

00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:24.950 align:middle line:84%
So your own relationship to war
has changed a lot in this life

00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:26.092 align:middle line:90%
that you are in.

00:53:26.092 --> 00:53:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And you are one of
the people who is here

00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:31.730 align:middle line:84%
to help bring a harmonization
around conflict, energy,

00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:34.370 align:middle line:90%
and drama, and fight.

00:53:34.370 --> 00:53:37.850 align:middle line:84%
But like many, you need
to be fully embodied

00:53:37.850 --> 00:53:41.660 align:middle line:84%
in that world in order to be one
of the people to illuminate it.

00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:45.110 align:middle line:84%
It is why many who
work in spirituality

00:53:45.110 --> 00:53:48.680 align:middle line:84%
have had other lifetimes,
where they have been in,

00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:52.310 align:middle line:84%
shall we say, more
indoctrinated religious roles,

00:53:52.310 --> 00:53:55.100 align:middle line:84%
where they, too,
were indoctrinated.

00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:56.660 align:middle line:84%
But they were also
helping others

00:53:56.660 --> 00:53:59.570 align:middle line:84%
to indoctrinate
themselves in ways

00:53:59.570 --> 00:54:02.597 align:middle line:84%
that were not allowing their
true spirit to come through.

00:54:02.597 --> 00:54:04.430 align:middle line:84%
Instead, they were
giving all of their power

00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:07.280 align:middle line:84%
away to the religion
or the organization.

00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:13.310 align:middle line:84%
So you see, many of you come
back each time to liberate,

00:54:13.310 --> 00:54:15.650 align:middle line:84%
often, the area that
you were previously

00:54:15.650 --> 00:54:17.100 align:middle line:90%
a part of the problem.

00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:19.910 align:middle line:90%
In a way, being the solution.

00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:22.400 align:middle line:84%
So we would say at this
point, your interest in war

00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:24.440 align:middle line:84%
is purely scientific
and strategic.

00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:25.830 align:middle line:90%
It is not emotional.

00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And from childhood, you were
actually a sensitive child.

00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:32.000 align:middle line:84%
It is part of the
cognitive dissonance

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.400 align:middle line:90%
that you experience in yourself.

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.620 align:middle line:84%
You have always felt
like there are so

00:54:36.620 --> 00:54:38.540 align:middle line:84%
many different
aspects inside you

00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:41.000 align:middle line:84%
and they do not
always call correlate.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.910 align:middle line:84%
In some ways, you didn't
understand the extremes

00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:45.380 align:middle line:90%
inside your psyche.

00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:48.530 align:middle line:84%
But to bring it back to
what we said to you earlier,

00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:51.810 align:middle line:84%
this is why you like
the electric experience.

00:54:51.810 --> 00:54:55.040 align:middle line:10%
For to you, that
electricity opens you

00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:57.290 align:middle line:10%
and that electricity
is a force that

00:54:57.290 --> 00:54:59.510 align:middle line:10%
can open you beyond
what we would

00:54:59.510 --> 00:55:03.380 align:middle line:10%
call the human ego
or particularly fear.

00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:06.170 align:middle line:84%
So you have always engaged
adrenaline as a way

00:55:06.170 --> 00:55:10.040 align:middle line:84%
to go beyond fear and to
use it as a great teacher.

00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:13.730 align:middle line:84%
So like anything, when you are
conscious of what you are doing

00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:15.170 align:middle line:84%
and you are applying
consciousness

00:55:15.170 --> 00:55:18.400 align:middle line:84%
to your experiment, it
can be a wonderful thing.

00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:20.900 align:middle line:84%
We will say that all of you are
quite lucky in this time you

00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:21.360 align:middle line:90%
are living it.

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:23.277 align:middle line:84%
We know you do not believe
us, for many of you

00:55:23.277 --> 00:55:27.080 align:middle line:84%
look at your political and
environmental situation right

00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:29.010 align:middle line:90%
now and think that it is dire.

00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:32.930 align:middle line:84%
But you are all living
in such a time where

00:55:32.930 --> 00:55:35.090 align:middle line:84%
more of you on the
planet than ever

00:55:35.090 --> 00:55:38.660 align:middle line:84%
before have freedom like
you have never known.

00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you are also
becoming more aware

00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:44.690 align:middle line:84%
of the lack of freedom that
is encoded into your planet.

00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:47.510 align:middle line:90%
So it is a bit of a catch-22.

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:51.260 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of the luxury of
experience that many of you

00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:54.350 align:middle line:84%
have, the times that
you are living in

00:55:54.350 --> 00:55:57.740 align:middle line:84%
are incredibly comfortable
compared to anything

00:55:57.740 --> 00:56:00.740 align:middle line:84%
that most of you have
ever known before.

00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:01.540 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree.

00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:02.000 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.130 align:middle line:84%
We are definitely in
some interesting times

00:56:04.130 --> 00:56:07.040 align:middle line:90%
and relationships.

00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:09.710 align:middle line:90%


00:56:09.710 --> 00:56:13.270 align:middle line:84%
We have-- and a big part
of our human experience

00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:14.940 align:middle line:90%
is relationships.

00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:16.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'd say almost all
of the human experience

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:17.740 align:middle line:90%
is relationships.

00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:23.060 align:middle line:84%
Do the Zs, in your experience,
experience relationships

00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:25.850 align:middle line:84%
in the way we have
partners or marriages?

00:56:25.850 --> 00:56:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>> No, because we do not need
to, for we are not living with

00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:31.250 align:middle line:90%
boundaries.

00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:34.140 align:middle line:84%
We are able to
merge and move out.

00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that you
would see on your planet that

00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:40.250 align:middle line:84%
would become a little more
commonplace if you were living

00:56:40.250 --> 00:56:42.530 align:middle line:84%
more tribally is there
would be far less focus

00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:44.030 align:middle line:90%
on romantic relationships.

00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:45.980 align:middle line:84%
In many ways,
romantic relationships

00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:49.460 align:middle line:84%
is a story that you are
all sold that traps you.

00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:50.630 align:middle line:90%
Now, many go beyond it.

00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Many see the gift
in the companionship

00:56:53.570 --> 00:56:57.390 align:middle line:84%
of what we would call long-term
romantic relationship.

00:56:57.390 --> 00:57:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And there are many spiritual
gifts and lessons and healings

00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:02.460 align:middle line:90%
that can come through that.

00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:05.570 align:middle line:84%
But many of you have
been sold down the river

00:57:05.570 --> 00:57:07.550 align:middle line:84%
with this romantic
relationship story.

00:57:07.550 --> 00:57:09.930 align:middle line:90%
And it sets you up for failure.

00:57:09.930 --> 00:57:12.710 align:middle line:10%
You are shown these movies
time and time again,

00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:15.290 align:middle line:10%
where somebody finds
their perfect person

00:57:15.290 --> 00:57:17.570 align:middle line:10%
and becomes blind to
everyone else around them.

00:57:17.570 --> 00:57:20.540 align:middle line:10%
And makes their importance less.

00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:22.310 align:middle line:10%
So what we would say
is if you were all

00:57:22.310 --> 00:57:24.530 align:middle line:10%
living more tribal
and communally,

00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:28.190 align:middle line:10%
the importance of the
one would disappear.

00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:30.920 align:middle line:10%
We will also add
to this, though.

00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:33.830 align:middle line:10%
And it is important
for us to add this.

00:57:33.830 --> 00:57:37.890 align:middle line:84%
In much the same way that a
human being who has a child

00:57:37.890 --> 00:57:39.980 align:middle line:84%
and gets the
experience of oneness

00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:42.500 align:middle line:84%
that they might not
get any other way--

00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:45.230 align:middle line:84%
they are devoted to
this little being.

00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:47.540 align:middle line:84%
They become more selfless
than they have ever

00:57:47.540 --> 00:57:50.540 align:middle line:84%
been in their life, because
they will pour everything they

00:57:50.540 --> 00:57:51.980 align:middle line:90%
can into this little being.

00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we know there are
some parents who are negligent.

00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:56.690 align:middle line:84%
But we are speaking
about the majority who

00:57:56.690 --> 00:58:00.080 align:middle line:84%
parent and have an
awakening inside their heart

00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:02.870 align:middle line:84%
and that devotional body
that they have never

00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:05.990 align:middle line:84%
had for another being before
that child comes along.

00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:07.820 align:middle line:84%
Equally, some people
experience this

00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:10.650 align:middle line:90%
through romantic relationships.

00:58:10.650 --> 00:58:13.310 align:middle line:90%
And that is very important.

00:58:13.310 --> 00:58:16.850 align:middle line:84%
It is a portal that
opens in that person

00:58:16.850 --> 00:58:19.340 align:middle line:84%
that the rest of Earth
is not mirroring.

00:58:19.340 --> 00:58:22.550 align:middle line:84%
The rest of humanity, the
collective, is not mirroring.

00:58:22.550 --> 00:58:26.720 align:middle line:84%
So in that way, these
single focus relationships--

00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:31.130 align:middle line:84%
or if you have many children,
or perhaps you have many lovers,

00:58:31.130 --> 00:58:34.940 align:middle line:84%
these multi-focus
devotional relationships--

00:58:34.940 --> 00:58:36.020 align:middle line:90%
are important.

00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:40.760 align:middle line:84%
Because they allow you to devote
yourself and twin yourself

00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:44.270 align:middle line:84%
and merge with another in a
way that your society is not

00:58:44.270 --> 00:58:46.790 align:middle line:84%
encouraging the rest of you
to do the rest of the time.

00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And it is not to beat
yourself up about.

00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:53.270 align:middle line:84%
It is simply the culture
of your world at this time

00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:56.150 align:middle line:84%
that you are not seen
as a collective of 88.

00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:57.650 align:middle line:90%
That is quite strange.

00:58:57.650 --> 00:59:00.140 align:middle line:10%
And in fact if any of
you were to go on record

00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:02.210 align:middle line:10%
and say, well, I am
in a collective of 88

00:59:02.210 --> 00:59:04.590 align:middle line:10%
and we all live together
on the same land,

00:59:04.590 --> 00:59:06.080 align:middle line:10%
there would be all
kinds of labels

00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:08.580 align:middle line:10%
slapped on you, like
commune, weird, cult.

00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:09.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:13.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Whereas from our perspective,
that is a beautiful truth.

00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:17.750 align:middle line:84%
So we do feel that many
of your communes or cults

00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:19.390 align:middle line:90%
have been given very bad names.

00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And we aren't talking
about the ones where

00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:24.380 align:middle line:84%
there is toxic behavior
or somebody lording

00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:26.510 align:middle line:90%
power over others abusively.

00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:29.390 align:middle line:84%
We are speaking about
the skepticism with which

00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:31.100 align:middle line:90%
these groups are viewed.

00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And yet, you can understand
from the perspective

00:59:34.460 --> 00:59:38.120 align:middle line:84%
we are sharing why those
groups are so quick to defend

00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:39.680 align:middle line:90%
what they are exploring.

00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:44.030 align:middle line:84%
For what they are exploring is
oneness within the humanity.

00:59:44.030 --> 00:59:47.700 align:middle line:84%
So we will tell
you this, though.

00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:50.720 align:middle line:84%
It is not that there is anything
going wrong on Earth right now.

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:54.590 align:middle line:84%
I think when we are aware
of the things that we say

00:59:54.590 --> 00:59:56.300 align:middle line:84%
and how they can
ripple, many of you

00:59:56.300 --> 01:00:00.230 align:middle line:84%
can get angry you are not
living communally or tribally.

01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:02.100 align:middle line:84%
This is how the Earth
was meant to be.

01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And the single focus that
many of you have at this time

01:00:06.170 --> 01:00:10.820 align:middle line:84%
is so directly experienced
by you and for you,

01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:13.640 align:middle line:84%
because you are not
living communally.

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:16.520 align:middle line:10%
That is what we mean
by the joy of Earth

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:20.210 align:middle line:10%
is to be in this egoic
body and this singular form

01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:24.470 align:middle line:10%
and get to have this very
responsive experience that you

01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:25.760 align:middle line:10%
have as a human.

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:28.040 align:middle line:10%
That is very different when
you are out of the body.

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:31.700 align:middle line:84%
You are no longer, shall we
say, nailed in to the egoic body

01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:32.960 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:36.620 align:middle line:84%
So many of you want
to die so that you

01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:38.450 align:middle line:90%
can experience that oneness.

01:00:38.450 --> 01:00:40.820 align:middle line:84%
We would challenge you and
say, it is very easy for you

01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:42.050 align:middle line:90%
to die as human beings.

01:00:42.050 --> 01:00:43.440 align:middle line:90%
You can die in an instance.

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:45.380 align:middle line:84%
If you are still
here, get curious

01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:49.200 align:middle line:84%
about why you are and start to
explore oneness in your life

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:50.000 align:middle line:90%
now.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.470 align:middle line:90%
Because it will be good for you.

01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And it will be good
for the planet.

01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And those of you who are annoyed
at the lack of oneness, that

01:00:56.450 --> 01:00:58.310 align:middle line:84%
is because it is
your job to create it

01:00:58.310 --> 01:00:59.720 align:middle line:90%
for yourselves and for others.

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:01.640 align:middle line:84%
So get on with it,
is what we would say

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:03.470 align:middle line:90%
to you, if you are not dead.

01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>> So there is almost,
it sounds like,

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:08.150 align:middle line:90%
a responsibility to being human.

01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:14.650 align:middle line:90%
To embody this reality fully.

01:01:14.650 --> 01:01:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we don't have a
lot of time for resistance.

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:20.060 align:middle line:84%
We understand that
resistance is part of life.

01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:22.160 align:middle line:84%
And sure, you can all
have moments in the day

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:23.840 align:middle line:84%
where you are a
little bit resistant.

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:25.910 align:middle line:84%
But if someone is
running resistance

01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:29.940 align:middle line:84%
about their life
for 3, 6, 12 months,

01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:32.630 align:middle line:84%
we think it's very important
for that person to wake up.

01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:34.850 align:middle line:84%
It is very different
if you are traumatized,

01:01:34.850 --> 01:01:36.890 align:middle line:84%
if you are recovering
from horrific events.

01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:38.060 align:middle line:90%
That is grief.

01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:38.960 align:middle line:90%
That is trauma.

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:42.140 align:middle line:84%
That is something that puts
you into a depressed state

01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:43.988 align:middle line:90%
until you are ready to return.

01:01:43.988 --> 01:01:46.280 align:middle line:84%
But if you are just resistant,
if you have been moaning

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:48.560 align:middle line:84%
about the state of the
world for a very long time

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:50.790 align:middle line:84%
and you are still
alive, we tell that you

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:52.040 align:middle line:90%
were missing the point.

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:53.330 align:middle line:90%
You're still alive.

01:01:53.330 --> 01:01:55.010 align:middle line:90%
You're not supposed to die yet.

01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Which means you are supposed to
discover a new level of living.

01:01:59.030 --> 01:02:01.040 align:middle line:84%
We would say to
you, are you willing

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:04.940 align:middle line:84%
to roll up your sleeves, get
vulnerable, and uncomfortable,

01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:06.740 align:middle line:90%
and figure out what that is?

01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:12.050 align:middle line:84%
Or are you enjoying the misery
of sitting in resistance to

01:02:12.050 --> 01:02:14.060 align:middle line:90%
and judgment of your world?

01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:16.070 align:middle line:84%
For from our
perspective, that is

01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:18.560 align:middle line:84%
one of the most uncomfortable
positions any of you

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:20.430 align:middle line:90%
can be in as human beings.

01:02:20.430 --> 01:02:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So if someone is going
through some hard times

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:26.900 align:middle line:84%
and they're deep in it, but
they're still in this reality,

01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:29.538 align:middle line:84%
then there is a
purpose for that?

01:02:29.538 --> 01:02:30.830 align:middle line:90%
>> There is a purpose for that.

01:02:30.830 --> 01:02:34.610 align:middle line:84%
As we have said, it
is very easy to die.

01:02:34.610 --> 01:02:37.460 align:middle line:84%
As a human being, you
have many exit points

01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:39.110 align:middle line:90%
programmed through your life.

01:02:39.110 --> 01:02:43.490 align:middle line:84%
Most people have anywhere
between 30 and 40 as a minimum,

01:02:43.490 --> 01:02:47.240 align:middle line:84%
meaning these are points that
are pre-programmed before you

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:50.648 align:middle line:84%
even incarnate where you
have the chance to exit.

01:02:50.648 --> 01:02:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
ways you can exit.

01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:53.840 align:middle line:90%
You can die in your sleep.

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:55.520 align:middle line:90%
You can manifest an accident.

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:58.860 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is that is
going to serve not just you,

01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:00.710 align:middle line:84%
but especially those
you leave behind.

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Your death is far less about
you yourself and far more about

01:03:05.570 --> 01:03:09.530 align:middle line:84%
what is needed to impact the
world that is left behind.

01:03:09.530 --> 01:03:13.190 align:middle line:84%
For example, the-- we
will go back in time

01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:17.030 align:middle line:84%
to the death of Princess
Diana in England.

01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:20.030 align:middle line:84%
She was designed
to do two things--

01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:22.910 align:middle line:84%
to access and open
people's hearts in England,

01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:25.430 align:middle line:84%
for the hearts were
a little stuffy.

01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:28.310 align:middle line:84%
But her sudden
and dramatic death

01:03:28.310 --> 01:03:30.770 align:middle line:84%
was such a shock
wave to people who

01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:33.140 align:middle line:84%
had a heart connection
with her that it

01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:35.420 align:middle line:84%
created an enormous
heart field in England.

01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:41.330 align:middle line:84%
But it also was one of
the many incidences that

01:03:41.330 --> 01:03:45.350 align:middle line:84%
raised questions in people's
mind about circumstances

01:03:45.350 --> 01:03:49.490 align:middle line:84%
and about the whys of certain
happenings in the world.

01:03:49.490 --> 01:03:51.450 align:middle line:90%
And were they legitimate.

01:03:51.450 --> 01:03:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And so there are so many
reasons that somebody

01:03:56.630 --> 01:04:00.920 align:middle line:84%
without that level of fame will
die at the time and in the way

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.030 align:middle line:90%
that they die.

01:04:02.030 --> 01:04:04.850 align:middle line:84%
It is because they have a
contract with a group of people

01:04:04.850 --> 01:04:08.690 align:middle line:84%
who will mourn and grieve and
be affected by their loss.

01:04:08.690 --> 01:04:12.290 align:middle line:84%
And the timing is
designed in accordance

01:04:12.290 --> 01:04:13.340 align:middle line:90%
with that whole group.

01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:17.690 align:middle line:84%
As we were saying earlier, if
you are going to exit or exit

01:04:17.690 --> 01:04:21.470 align:middle line:84%
from somebody's life, there is
a chain of events that is lining

01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:23.900 align:middle line:90%
up in a way that you cannot see.

01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:26.030 align:middle line:84%
But that you are
deeply connected to.

01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:28.340 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, none of you
are ever operating

01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:32.090 align:middle line:84%
in a bubble, which is why
the myth of human isolation

01:04:32.090 --> 01:04:33.380 align:middle line:90%
is a myth.

01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:36.020 align:middle line:84%
None of you are
isolated here yet.

01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:38.270 align:middle line:84%
You can feel deep
loneliness when

01:04:38.270 --> 01:04:42.740 align:middle line:84%
you feel disconnected from
source, other human beings.

01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:46.280 align:middle line:10%
Or you have what we would
call community wounds.

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:50.390 align:middle line:10%
People in your life who did
not help you with bonding

01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:53.330 align:middle line:10%
and attachment and interaction.

01:04:53.330 --> 01:04:56.690 align:middle line:10%
Or specific people,
perhaps in your later life,

01:04:56.690 --> 01:04:59.360 align:middle line:10%
that dented your
trust of other humans

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:03.850 align:middle line:10%
in a way that makes you
step back from the world.

01:05:03.850 --> 01:05:05.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, finally, what--

01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:10.700 align:middle line:84%
from the Zs, what would
be the greatest truth,

01:05:10.700 --> 01:05:13.670 align:middle line:84%
the greatest truth that you
could share with humanity?

01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:16.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what we would say
that the greatest truth that we

01:05:16.190 --> 01:05:19.670 align:middle line:84%
could share with humanity is
that each of you hold a great

01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:23.450 align:middle line:84%
truth within you that has to
be revealed to become actual.

01:05:23.450 --> 01:05:28.370 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, human beings are
creating reality as you go.

01:05:28.370 --> 01:05:34.010 align:middle line:84%
We know from monitoring how
many of you think and feel

01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:38.000 align:middle line:84%
about your world, it can seem
a little bit like you are here

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.290 align:middle line:90%
experiencing Earth.

01:05:39.290 --> 01:05:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And yes, Earth is a playground
and life is an experiment.

01:05:43.490 --> 01:05:46.400 align:middle line:84%
But you are influencing
the experiment, too.

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:51.050 align:middle line:84%
So it is not so much that you as
a poor limited human being can

01:05:51.050 --> 01:05:53.210 align:middle line:90%
only do so much with your soul.

01:05:53.210 --> 01:05:55.290 align:middle line:90%
Your souls are very powerful.

01:05:55.290 --> 01:05:58.880 align:middle line:84%
So the great truths that
each of you uncover--

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:01.620 align:middle line:90%
you leave in this world.

01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:03.740 align:middle line:84%
Whether it is that
you uncover a level of

01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:07.430 align:middle line:84%
love that no one in
your immediate vicinity

01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:10.100 align:middle line:84%
has ever witnessed at the
level that you radiated.

01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:14.990 align:middle line:84%
So for example, when
you die, Rubin, there

01:06:14.990 --> 01:06:17.580 align:middle line:84%
will be someone in your
midst who will say,

01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:20.450 align:middle line:84%
I have never seen or felt
peace the way I felt it

01:06:20.450 --> 01:06:22.040 align:middle line:90%
when I was around Rubin.

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:26.600 align:middle line:10%
So you birthed the truth of
peace in yourself at a level

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:30.290 align:middle line:10%
that someone else is now going
to have as not only a marker

01:06:30.290 --> 01:06:32.690 align:middle line:10%
point, but an aim.

01:06:32.690 --> 01:06:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And they will start to
work in their own life

01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:38.390 align:middle line:84%
to recreate that
feeling that they would

01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:39.740 align:middle line:90%
get when they were with you.

01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:42.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, you are not in the picture
to generate or encourage it

01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:43.910 align:middle line:90%
for them.

01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:46.760 align:middle line:10%
So we would say the greatest
truth that all of you

01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:50.870 align:middle line:10%
are here to experience is
the one you will create.

01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:53.780 align:middle line:84%
We know that is not a very
satisfying answer, of course.

01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:56.870 align:middle line:84%
You wish we could tell
you that Saturn was purple

01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:59.960 align:middle line:84%
and that teleportation is
just around the corner.

01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:01.610 align:middle line:84%
We would say it is
not too far off.

01:07:01.610 --> 01:07:03.050 align:middle line:84%
But certainly for
many of you, you

01:07:03.050 --> 01:07:05.660 align:middle line:90%
may not see it in your lifetime.

01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:09.230 align:middle line:84%
But what we will say
is the greatest truth

01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:12.080 align:middle line:84%
has so often been something
that humans have been asked

01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:14.670 align:middle line:90%
to focus outside themselves.

01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And yet from our perspective,
the gift of being human

01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:23.150 align:middle line:84%
and a human at this highly
creative, highly revolutionary,

01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:26.840 align:middle line:84%
highly innovative time
that you are living in,

01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:31.460 align:middle line:84%
is that you are going to get to
create great truths inside you

01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:33.290 align:middle line:90%
and plant them on Earth.

01:07:33.290 --> 01:07:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And others will take the
seeds you have planted,

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:38.660 align:middle line:84%
multiply them, run them
through their system,

01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:40.760 align:middle line:90%
add their truth to it.

01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:44.150 align:middle line:84%
The greatest truth is that you
are all creating consciousness

01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:45.830 align:middle line:90%
as you go.

01:07:45.830 --> 01:07:48.290 align:middle line:84%
The greatest disappointment
about that truth

01:07:48.290 --> 01:07:51.110 align:middle line:84%
for many who want
to see consciousness

01:07:51.110 --> 01:07:52.880 align:middle line:84%
appear in the outside
world and they

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:55.610 align:middle line:84%
feel like they are
waiting to see it.

01:07:55.610 --> 01:07:56.720 align:middle line:90%
Don't wait.

01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:57.990 align:middle line:90%
Create.

01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:59.840 align:middle line:10%
That is the truth
for so many of you

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:02.960 align:middle line:10%
who are interested in
these kinds of messages

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:04.400 align:middle line:10%
and discussions.

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:09.200 align:middle line:84%
You are creators looking
to see what fertilizer you

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:12.260 align:middle line:84%
can gather from these
kinds of conversations.

01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:15.590 align:middle line:84%
For the consciousness you
are creating on Earth.

01:08:15.590 --> 01:08:21.050 align:middle line:84%
From our perspective, that is
the miracle of being human.

01:08:21.050 --> 01:08:21.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

01:08:21.950 --> 01:08:23.630 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so much
for sharing the wisdom

01:08:26.430 --> 01:08:30.350 align:middle line:84%
and for the collective
of 88, the Zs.

01:08:30.350 --> 01:08:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And-- is it Zachary,
the one who is--

01:08:33.350 --> 01:08:36.439 align:middle line:84%
>> The lead
spokesperson is Zachary.

01:08:36.439 --> 01:08:38.840 align:middle line:84%
But we are a group
consciousness.

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:44.390 align:middle line:84%
So we would like to extend our
thanks to you for facilitating

01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:46.819 align:middle line:90%
such a clear transmission.

01:08:46.819 --> 01:08:51.350 align:middle line:10%
For with any
channeling, the ability

01:08:51.350 --> 01:08:54.380 align:middle line:10%
for the channeler and
the channeled entities

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:58.580 align:middle line:10%
to give information is all
dependent on the frequency

01:08:58.580 --> 01:09:01.439 align:middle line:10%
of the merge between
the channeler,

01:09:01.439 --> 01:09:03.529 align:middle line:10%
the channeled entities,
and the listener.

01:09:03.529 --> 01:09:08.330 align:middle line:10%
So thank you for creating such
a vast, circular space that

01:09:08.330 --> 01:09:12.140 align:middle line:10%
is very clear for this level of
communication to come through.

01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for the
work that not just you

01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:18.090 align:middle line:84%
are doing as a communication
steward on the planet,

01:09:18.090 --> 01:09:21.020 align:middle line:84%
but that all who are
listening and watching this

01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:24.319 align:middle line:84%
are equally doing
in their lives.

01:09:24.319 --> 01:09:27.020 align:middle line:84%
It will pay dividends
in the years to come.

01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And for those of you
who are, shall we say,

01:09:29.270 --> 01:09:32.420 align:middle line:84%
wanting to see a
brighter future,

01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:35.937 align:middle line:84%
the earth will always
have its areas of disease,

01:09:35.937 --> 01:09:37.520 align:middle line:84%
for those of you who
are going to live

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:40.700 align:middle line:84%
a standard human
lifetime in Earth years.

01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:44.960 align:middle line:84%
But you will see as you go
through your lives, more

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:48.319 align:middle line:84%
and more consciousness appearing
on the planet that will not

01:09:48.319 --> 01:09:50.990 align:middle line:84%
just be an amorphous
thing, it will

01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:54.380 align:middle line:84%
start to feed into the
actions that are taken.

01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And the way that the
new Earth is built

01:09:57.390 --> 01:09:59.010 align:middle line:90%
will be highly influenced.

01:09:59.010 --> 01:10:02.280 align:middle line:84%
So create consciousness
wherever you go.

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:05.460 align:middle line:90%
That is the joy of being human.

01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:06.900 align:middle line:90%
In peace and in love.

01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:09.858 align:middle line:90%


01:10:09.858 --> 01:10:11.337 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:10:11.337 --> 01:10:20.211 align:middle line:90%


01:10:20.211 --> 01:10:21.060 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:23.567 align:middle line:90%


01:10:23.567 --> 01:10:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Did you go anywhere on that or
were you just in the back seat?

01:10:26.150 --> 01:10:27.410 align:middle line:10%
>> Kind of in the backseat.

01:10:27.410 --> 01:10:30.810 align:middle line:10%
But it was interesting.

01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:31.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:32.820 align:middle line:90%
It was cosmic.

01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:33.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:34.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Cosmic?

01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:34.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:36.080 align:middle line:90%
There were different--

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:38.970 align:middle line:84%
I notice when I channel,
there are different purposes

01:10:38.970 --> 01:10:39.770 align:middle line:90%
with channeling.

01:10:39.770 --> 01:10:43.250 align:middle line:84%
Like, you might be
channeling on a certain topic

01:10:43.250 --> 01:10:44.180 align:middle line:90%
for a certain group.

01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:48.590 align:middle line:10%
And it's very earthbound,
very emotion focused.

01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:52.430 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, this one
was quite galactic

01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:54.680 align:middle line:10%
and universal, which,
you know, is great.

01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:57.950 align:middle line:10%
Is very-- I learnt some stuff
that I've never heard them talk

01:10:57.950 --> 01:10:58.970 align:middle line:10%
about before.

01:10:58.970 --> 01:10:59.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

01:10:59.470 --> 01:10:59.910 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

01:10:59.910 --> 01:11:00.350 align:middle line:10%
Definitely.

01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:00.880 align:middle line:10%
Thank you.

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:01.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:02.080 align:middle line:10%
Thank you.

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:03.186 align:middle line:10%
Thank you.

01:11:03.186 --> 01:11:06.074 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

01:11:06.074 --> 01:11:08.300 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:09.670 align:middle line:90%
That's a wrap for the interview.

01:11:09.670 --> 01:11:10.470 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:14.920 align:middle line:90%


01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>> The single focus that many
of you have at this time is

01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:23.110 align:middle line:84%
so directly experienced
by you and for you,

01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:26.950 align:middle line:84%
because you are not
living communally.

01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:30.010 align:middle line:84%
We mean by the
joy of Earth to be

01:11:30.010 --> 01:11:33.040 align:middle line:84%
in this egoic body
and this singular form

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:37.270 align:middle line:84%
and get to have this very
responsive experience that you

01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:38.343 align:middle line:90%
have as a human.

01:11:38.343 --> 01:11:40.510 align:middle line:84%
That is very different when
you are out of the body.

01:11:40.510 --> 01:11:46.680 align:middle line:90%


01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:49.050 align:middle line:84%
We would challenge you and
say it is very easy for you

01:11:49.050 --> 01:11:50.280 align:middle line:90%
to die as human beings.

01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:52.260 align:middle line:84%
