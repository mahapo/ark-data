[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.994 --> 00:01:49.630 align:middle line:90%


00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:50.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.373 align:middle line:90%
Hello, dear.

00:01:51.373 --> 00:01:53.415 align:middle line:84%
This is the 9th Dimensional
Pleiadian Collective.

00:01:53.415 --> 00:01:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And it is a pleasure
and an honor

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.660 align:middle line:84%
to have the opportunity
to connect with you.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.630 align:middle line:84%
So in our short
time today we think

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.940 align:middle line:84%
we're going to cover a pretty
lengthy, or pretty substantial

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:06.810 align:middle line:90%
amount of ground.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.449 align:middle line:90%
So we're very, very excited.

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:10.450 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for the
opportunity to connect.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.610 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for being here with us.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.100 align:middle line:10%
Yes, a number of questions on
a number of different levels.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.048 align:middle line:90%
But this may be right into it.

00:02:25.048 --> 00:02:26.340 align:middle line:90%
Out of left field a little bit.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.000 align:middle line:84%
But can you explain
reincarnation,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.130 align:middle line:84%
and the mechanism, and
why does that work?

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in part the
question is flawed.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.910 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:39.710 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:40.530 align:middle line:90%
>> And here's why.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.690 align:middle line:10%
Because you are you're
asking the question

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.010 align:middle line:10%
from a third dimensional
standpoint in which you

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.120 align:middle line:10%
are looking at
time as a constant,

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.390 align:middle line:10%
where there is a
linear progression.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.730 align:middle line:10%
And it's not.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.350 align:middle line:10%
Time is an illusion.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.370 align:middle line:10%
And it's simply a
marker for events.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.570 align:middle line:10%
So when you all think
of reincarnation,

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.030 align:middle line:10%
you think, all right,
well, I have a lifetime

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.190 align:middle line:10%
that started in 1000 BC.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And then I had another one
in, say, the 1700s, and then

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.240 align:middle line:90%
another one in the early 1900s.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.650 align:middle line:90%
And then here I am today.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.230 align:middle line:84%
So you think there is
a linear progression.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.430 align:middle line:90%
And really there isn't.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.350 align:middle line:84%
Because what you
consider to be the past

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.450 align:middle line:84%
or what you consider
to be the future

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.000 align:middle line:90%
is all going on concurrently.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And so what you are choosing to
do is take your soul's essence

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.080 align:middle line:84%
and harness it, focus it
to a specific now moment.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And by doing that as
you enter into 3D,

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.220 align:middle line:84%
you create a physical
structure for yourself.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.600 align:middle line:90%
All right, you create the body.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.100 align:middle line:90%
And you incarnate, if you will.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.070 align:middle line:84%
But that part of you,
that soul's essence,

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.770 align:middle line:84%
can also then
project itself out,

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.460 align:middle line:84%
fracture itself out
into other lifetimes

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.360 align:middle line:90%
in order to have experience.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.200 align:middle line:84%
So one of the greatest
issues for you all

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.000 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to your
sense of progression,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.370 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to your
sense of deservedness

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.130 align:middle line:84%
when you talk about
karma, is that you

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.620 align:middle line:84%
think that you have
to start at the bottom

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.390 align:middle line:90%
and work your way up.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.820 align:middle line:90%
There is this idea of hierarchy.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.959 align:middle line:84%
And because you're playing
in a game of duality,

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.440 align:middle line:84%
because you've entered into
a dimension in which you

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.340 align:middle line:84%
have light, dark, positive,
negative, male, female.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.410 align:middle line:90%
You've got both extremes.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.090 align:middle line:84%
You can't have one
without the other,

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.280 align:middle line:84%
because of the
nature of the game.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.710 align:middle line:84%
When you fracture down
into this dimension,

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.750 align:middle line:84%
you have oneness,
which is happening up

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.070 align:middle line:90%
at the source level.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And then as soon as you enter
into dimensional structure,

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.170 align:middle line:84%
you have some level of
separation, some polarity.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And when you get to
3D, the polarities

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.680 align:middle line:90%
are pretty far apart.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.280 align:middle line:84%
So you have hierarchy
all the way down

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.840 align:middle line:84%
through the
dimensional structure.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.960 align:middle line:84%
Here, you really get
sucked into the idea of it.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.000 align:middle line:84%
But there is an aspect
of you that is already

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.500 align:middle line:90%
part of source energy.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.090 align:middle line:84%
You already are one with
all that is and ever will be

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.400 align:middle line:90%
and with the infinite.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.210 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that if
you come down here,

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.520 align:middle line:84%
and you have a
lifetime in which you

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.120 align:middle line:84%
play the dark end of the
spectrum, that the next life

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.070 align:middle line:84%
you are condemned or punished
to take a step back and have

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.090 align:middle line:84%
a harder life, or
that you are then

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.500 align:middle line:84%
going to have to play a
particular role that may not

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.120 align:middle line:90%
be so pleasant.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.500 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't really work that way.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.630 align:middle line:84%
At the soul level you say, all
right, I'm going to go down,

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.220 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
play the perpetrator,

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.990 align:middle line:84%
so that somebody else
can play the victim.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.810 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't have
one without the other.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And you have that
vibrational experience.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And then you say, all right,
well, now I understand.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And now I want to try it again
from a different perspective.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.480 align:middle line:84%
So let's play the
victim this time.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.460 align:middle line:84%
And you will contract
with other beings

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.800 align:middle line:84%
and oftentimes the same beings
to play that opposite role so

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.670 align:middle line:90%
that each gets a turn.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And this could be
going on concurrently

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.040 align:middle line:84%
as you structure your lifetimes
and the kinds of vibrations

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.170 align:middle line:90%
that you want to experience.

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:18.100 align:middle line:84%
So you also choose
times in history,

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.060 align:middle line:84%
if you will, that
suit your needs.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.550 align:middle line:84%
So it is possible for you
to have a future life first

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.280 align:middle line:84%
and then put yourself
back in time,

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:35.070 align:middle line:84%
as it were, to put yourself in
a setup in which the conditions

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.740 align:middle line:84%
are right for, say, your
oppression, if you will,

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.870 align:middle line:90%
if you want to play a victim.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:45.210 align:middle line:90%
So it's not neat and tidy.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.550 align:middle line:84%
We're giving you
more of an expanded

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.130 align:middle line:90%
perspective of what it is.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.440 align:middle line:84%
We could give you
the linear answer.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.340 align:middle line:84%
But we don't want to
do that any longer.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.090 align:middle line:84%
We want to shatter your
version of reality in a sense.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.020 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to leave
you feeling overwhelmed.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.480 align:middle line:84%
But we do want to break
you out of the box.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So in that sense,
having that information,

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.130 align:middle line:84%
the whole karmic wheel that's
talked about in Buddhism

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:18.590 align:middle line:84%
and other religions, is that
just a misunderstanding then

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:20.150 align:middle line:90%
of how karma works?

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:21.740 align:middle line:90%
Or is karma even real?

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.430 align:middle line:90%
Or how does that--

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:24.230 align:middle line:90%
can you--

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.360 align:middle line:84%
>> In a sense, we
would say it is real.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.658 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to
your idea of karma,

00:07:28.658 --> 00:07:30.200 align:middle line:84%
there is a lot of
manipulation that's

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.740 align:middle line:84%
gone on in the
explanation of it.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.780 align:middle line:90%
And it was used to control.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.130 align:middle line:84%
Because there was a lot
of violence going on.

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:43.310 align:middle line:84%
So from the human 3D
level, from the ego level,

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:45.750 align:middle line:90%
this is how it was interpreted.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.570 align:middle line:84%
But because you're
down in density,

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.120 align:middle line:84%
and you're playing
this game of separation

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:54.560 align:middle line:84%
or the illusion of
separation, you still

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.170 align:middle line:84%
want to present yourselves
with some of the concepts.

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:59.960 align:middle line:84%
So giving the information to
yourselves in the best way

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.580 align:middle line:84%
that you can process
it from this level.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.010 align:middle line:84%
So we would say when you
think of the karmic wheel,

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:07.880 align:middle line:84%
it is a story or
a version that is

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.430 align:middle line:84%
the best that you can process
from that third dimensional

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:11.450 align:middle line:90%
mental level.

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:12.960 align:middle line:90%
Is it how things really work?

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.020 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.700 align:middle line:84%
It's as close as you
can get from the process

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.280 align:middle line:90%
of the linear mind.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.460 align:middle line:90%
>> So if time is--

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.930 align:middle line:84%
you just explained
time is an illusion.

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And kind of all of these lives
are happening simultaneously,

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:32.090 align:middle line:84%
would it be safe
to say that what

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:34.010 align:middle line:84%
we're learning in this
lifetime right now

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:38.150 align:middle line:84%
is affecting prior lifetimes
or future lifetimes?

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:39.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And not only your lifetimes, but
also all life in the universe.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is in part why it's
such a special time that you

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.500 align:middle line:84%
are going through,
this particular period.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.930 align:middle line:84%
Because there is so much
growth that is happening.

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And you are really having to
learn and work with compassion

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.550 align:middle line:84%
and how you learn and
work with compassion

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:05.150 align:middle line:84%
is sent off to all life
throughout the universe.

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And the information
is a game changer.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Why we say this is
because Earth is

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:17.030 align:middle line:84%
kind of a melting pot
for galactic issues.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:22.970 align:middle line:84%
Earth is unlike any other planet
in your system, in your galaxy,

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:23.810 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:27.140 align:middle line:84%
It's a grand experiment in which
genetic material from thousands

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:32.780 align:middle line:84%
of worlds was deposited
in order to play out

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.440 align:middle line:84%
some of the galactic
issues on a smaller scale.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And along with all
this genetic material

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.300 align:middle line:84%
are all the
emotional components,

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.970 align:middle line:84%
all the things that
you have experienced

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:45.260 align:middle line:90%
in all of those lifetimes.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And we call Earth the
planet of emotion.

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:51.200 align:middle line:84%
So you've got a huge
range to work with.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And it is, in a sense,
a blessing and a curse

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:58.730 align:middle line:84%
in that you have many
emotions to kind of sequence

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:02.390 align:middle line:84%
together in order to get your
way out of the lower densities,

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:04.100 align:middle line:84%
in order to elevate
your consciousness.

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:08.510 align:middle line:84%
But also because
they are so extreme,

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:13.740 align:middle line:84%
you also can fall into the trap
of getting stuck, in a sense.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.840 align:middle line:84%
So as you have those
experiences of the positive

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:28.520 align:middle line:84%
and the negative in this realm,
you hold a lot more compassion.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.180 align:middle line:84%
Because all of you have had
those times where you felt

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:36.470 align:middle line:84%
that lower resonance, that lower
frequency, that lower emotion.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And you know that it can feel
really challenging and really

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:40.410 align:middle line:90%
hard.

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:44.660 align:middle line:84%
So the way that you experience
compassion and the intensity

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:49.250 align:middle line:84%
of that particular frequency
is so much stronger

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:52.640 align:middle line:84%
than it is experienced
in the higher realms

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.880 align:middle line:84%
that you actually are
teaching the rest of us

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.680 align:middle line:84%
throughout the entire
universe, including

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.610 align:middle line:84%
the higher realms, how
to experience compassion

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:04.200 align:middle line:90%
with more depth.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.300 align:middle line:90%
>> I understand.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's sometimes hard
for humans to kind of wrap

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:08.410 align:middle line:90%
their mind around.

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:10.550 align:middle line:84%
Because again, you have
this hierarchical idea

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:14.895 align:middle line:84%
that beings in the higher
dimension are better than.

00:11:14.895 --> 00:11:15.770 align:middle line:90%
We're just different.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:18.150 align:middle line:84%
We're just playing
in another game.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.150 align:middle line:84%
We're just playing with
a different set of rules

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.470 align:middle line:84%
and having a different
kind of experience.

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:24.870 align:middle line:84%
But remember, as we
said at the beginning,

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.620 align:middle line:84%
we are all part of
source energies.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And as such, you are able
to access that information

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.050 align:middle line:90%
at any time.

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:38.660 align:middle line:84%
It's never something that is
separate or kept from you.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.780 align:middle line:84%
You limit it from yourself
as you play down in the game

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.150 align:middle line:90%
in order to play the game.

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>> From a Pleiadian point or
point of view or perspective,

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:50.820 align:middle line:90%
can it--

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:56.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it must be comical how
us humans get so emotionally

00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:02.910 align:middle line:84%
attached and involved into
our emotions and our stories.

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:04.780 align:middle line:90%
Is that-- do you find that?

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we wouldn't
necessarily say comical.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:09.330 align:middle line:84%
But we would say
it's fascinating.

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.520 align:middle line:90%
We're fascinated by it.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And we don't always
understand it.

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is a lot of the work
that you will do at night

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.520 align:middle line:90%
when you're out of your bodies.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.430 align:middle line:84%
You are educating
the rest of us.

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.610 align:middle line:84%
You will have meetings
with different groups

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:27.840 align:middle line:90%
that you work with.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.122 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they are
groups in other lifetimes

00:12:30.122 --> 00:12:32.580 align:middle line:84%
that have an awareness of the
experiment of the game that's

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:33.480 align:middle line:90%
going on on Earth.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And you may be part of
that species or part

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.230 align:middle line:90%
of that energetic collective.

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And so they'll review
the day with you.

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And they'll look at
it and say, you know,

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:50.670 align:middle line:84%
you had this opportunity to
completely alter your course

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:53.980 align:middle line:84%
and bring a lot more
joy into your life.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And we don't really understand
why you didn't take it.

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:58.080 align:middle line:90%
It seems so easy.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.757 align:middle line:84%
And you explain to them,
well, because in that moment,

00:13:00.757 --> 00:13:02.340 align:middle line:84%
I was gripped with
this horrible fear.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:03.180 align:middle line:90%
Well, what's going to happen?

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:04.000 align:middle line:90%
What about money?

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:04.870 align:middle line:90%
What about security?

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:06.390 align:middle line:90%
What about safety?

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And they don't
necessarily understand

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:11.670 align:middle line:84%
looking at it from a slightly
more logical perspective.

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:13.470 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot
of explanation that

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:18.660 align:middle line:84%
goes on to teach about
this frequency of emotion.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, in that sense--

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.950 align:middle line:84%
and from my
understanding, I guess,

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.220 align:middle line:90%
this is all part of the--

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:28.320 align:middle line:84%
you mentioned the
great experiment.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.140 align:middle line:84%
This experiment--
correct me if I'm wrong--

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:35.160 align:middle line:84%
is this choice to have
forgotten where we come from

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:39.880 align:middle line:84%
and who we are and incarnate
in this world as it is.

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- yes, the
great question is, why?

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:43.590 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:44.770 align:middle line:90%
Why have we done this?

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:46.350 align:middle line:90%
Why have we've forgotten this?

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:47.840 align:middle line:90%
And what are we doing here?

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:48.640 align:middle line:90%
Is that it?

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.100 align:middle line:90%
Is that why we're here?

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:57.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the sole purpose
for any incarnational or any

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:01.055 align:middle line:84%
vibrational
experience, meaning--

00:14:01.055 --> 00:14:02.430 align:middle line:84%
we don't want to
say incarnation.

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Because it's more
than just incarnating.

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:08.940 align:middle line:84%
Because that term means
literally taking on form.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:12.270 align:middle line:84%
But it's about
experience, period.

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:13.380 align:middle line:90%
It's about exploration.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.570 align:middle line:90%
It's about curiosity.

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And the game itself,
the 3D game--

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:20.700 align:middle line:84%
and we're not talking
just about Earth,

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:23.490 align:middle line:84%
but we're talking about the
third dimensional game--

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:27.720 align:middle line:84%
it was created because
we all wanted to.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.210 align:middle line:84%
We thought, well,
wouldn't it be interesting

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:34.020 align:middle line:90%
if we could forget who we are.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.360 align:middle line:84%
Because from our
level, and frankly,

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.100 align:middle line:84%
from the fifth
dimensional level and up,

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:41.520 align:middle line:84%
we have an awareness that we
are part of source energy.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.280 align:middle line:84%
We have an awareness that
we can perceive ourselves

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.530 align:middle line:84%
as an individuated
consciousness as well

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:48.850 align:middle line:90%
as collective consciousness.

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:49.730 align:middle line:90%
And it's a choice.

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:51.600 align:middle line:84%
But we'll always
have that awareness.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:57.180 align:middle line:84%
So it is a different game
when you think, well,

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:58.950 align:middle line:90%
what if I didn't know that?

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:01.770 align:middle line:84%
How would that change my
vibrational experience?

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:05.440 align:middle line:84%
How would that change
the choices that I make?

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.992 align:middle line:84%
And so this is in part
why the game was set up.

00:15:07.992 --> 00:15:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And it is an
illusion, because it's

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:13.290 align:middle line:90%
impossible to have separation.

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And so as you came down through
the descension process--

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:20.740 align:middle line:90%
and it was a descension process.

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:24.170 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't that you had to start
your incarnational process

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:28.380 align:middle line:84%
at the 3D level and
work your way back up.

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.633 align:middle line:84%
As you came down and
said, all right, well,

00:15:30.633 --> 00:15:31.800 align:middle line:90%
let's create this structure.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.210 align:middle line:90%
Let's create this game.

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:34.440 align:middle line:90%
Let's enter into it.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.450 align:middle line:84%
It was very
difficult for you all

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:39.653 align:middle line:90%
to hold that lower resonance.

00:15:39.653 --> 00:15:41.070 align:middle line:84%
You kept remembering
that you were

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:43.590 align:middle line:84%
part of the collective energy
and that you could easily

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:44.710 align:middle line:90%
manipulate your reality.

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And so out of the
dimensional game you go.

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:49.680 align:middle line:90%
So the mind was set up.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:54.120 align:middle line:84%
The ego was set up to create
repetitive programs of thought

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.930 align:middle line:84%
in order to hold you
into the illusion.

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And so now as you spiral down,
the illusion, the programs,

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:07.080 align:middle line:84%
the habits, they get stronger
and stronger as you are denser.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:10.350 align:middle line:84%
All right, so as you go back
up, it's the exact opposite.

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:12.840 align:middle line:90%
You remember more and more.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
whole point of the ego

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:19.290 align:middle line:84%
is to allow you the
illusion of the game,

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:24.750 align:middle line:84%
to have a different perspective
of a vibrational experience.

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>> This different
perspective on--

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:30.660 align:middle line:84%
it seems the denser
it gets, or--

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:33.300 align:middle line:84%
maybe I'm not using the right
terminology, but the more

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.980 align:middle line:90%
negative side of things--

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:38.640 align:middle line:90%
it does seem self-destructive.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:42.090 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've heard
stories of Atlantis

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:46.710 align:middle line:84%
or other civilizations here
on Earth or otherwise that

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:50.580 align:middle line:90%
end up destroying themselves.

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Is it because they're
listening to the ego too much?

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:56.670 align:middle line:90%
They're too dense?

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:58.240 align:middle line:90%
Is that a possibility?

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, so right now you're
moving through a sector

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:02.910 align:middle line:84%
of space that has high
vibrational energy that

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:08.230 align:middle line:84%
supports you to elevate
your consciousness.

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:11.819 align:middle line:84%
It's a sector of space
that sometimes you

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:14.579 align:middle line:84%
refer to as the photonic
band or the photonic belt.

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:17.069 align:middle line:84%
It's got high
vibrational signatures

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:20.550 align:middle line:84%
that help you to integrate
all the lessons that you

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:22.500 align:middle line:90%
learned through your cycle.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And it kind of prepares
you for the next step

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.790 align:middle line:84%
up, the next cycle as
you're spiraling up.

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:33.060 align:middle line:84%
So with Atlantis, there
were many of the same issues

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:35.070 align:middle line:90%
that you're working on now.

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And you wanted to give it a
whirl kind of as a test run

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:39.930 align:middle line:90%
to see, how can we process?

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:42.000 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the
hurdles we're going to have?

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.250 align:middle line:84%
Because remember,
time doesn't exist.

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And the higher part of
you, the higher self

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:52.540 align:middle line:84%
that is the one projecting
into these different periods,

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:53.340 align:middle line:90%
it knows.

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:56.200 align:middle line:90%
It has that greater perspective.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.710 align:middle line:90%
And so yes, it was a trial run.

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And there are many things
that get played out again.

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:06.540 align:middle line:84%
A lot of issues around
genetic manipulation,

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:10.170 align:middle line:84%
a lot of issues about
inner technology

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:12.990 align:middle line:90%
versus outer technology.

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.820 align:middle line:84%
Some issues around
artificial intelligence,

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:18.390 align:middle line:84%
although a lot of those issues
are coming from other star

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:20.160 align:middle line:90%
systems as well.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.070 align:middle line:84%
So they're getting triggered
and activated again.

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:26.460 align:middle line:84%
Cloning is another
one that happens

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.980 align:middle line:90%
to reoccur from Atlantis.

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And you're learning
how to integrate.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:33.100 align:middle line:84%
You're learning how to release
some of the past trauma,

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:33.900 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:34.700 align:middle line:90%
We'll say past.

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.260 align:middle line:84%
We'll use past
and future for you

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:38.890 align:middle line:90%
throughout our conversation.

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:43.950 align:middle line:90%
But it prepared you.

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's information
that you can

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:48.870 align:middle line:84%
access to say,
all right, this is

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:51.930 align:middle line:84%
where following this
particular frequency led to.

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:54.450 align:middle line:84%
So that you don't have
to recreate it again

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:56.700 align:middle line:90%
if you don't want to.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the beings
at that time--

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:01.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure there were some
survivors from Atlantis,

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.400 align:middle line:90%
were there not?

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, many.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>> So if they remembered that
experience moving forward,

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:15.805 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't they obviously try to
avoid making the same mistakes?

00:19:15.805 --> 00:19:18.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there was also the
awareness that you were going

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.700 align:middle line:90%
to fall into a period of sleep.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:24.173 align:middle line:84%
All right, the vibration
was spiraling down.

00:19:24.173 --> 00:19:26.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And these beings were
aware of this at this time.

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:27.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, some.

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And so there were things
that were put into place.

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:36.270 align:middle line:84%
There were recordings
of information

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:38.250 align:middle line:90%
that were put into crystals.

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And many of you are
remembering that-- ah, wait,

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.790 align:middle line:90%
I had a lifetime in Atlantis.

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And I feel really drawn
to work with crystals,

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.370 align:middle line:84%
or I feel really drawn to
work with grids, or the Earth.

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:53.190 align:middle line:84%
Or there are bits and
pieces of information.

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:54.930 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps it's science related.

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:57.030 align:middle line:84%
There may be something
about biology.

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:59.190 align:middle line:84%
Or there may be
something about working

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:02.610 align:middle line:84%
with sound that you feel
drawn to from that lifetime.

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And many of you
who have incarnated

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.570 align:middle line:84%
into this particular
frame who were,

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:12.540 align:middle line:84%
shall we say, among
the first to awaken,

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:14.670 align:middle line:84%
you've had lifetimes
in Atlantis.

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And so you are re-initializing
some of those programs

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.160 align:middle line:84%
and memories so
that you can move

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:30.690 align:middle line:84%
beyond that level of distraction
into a more harmonious result.

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So other than these physical
structures, and crystals, and--

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.990 align:middle line:84%
I guess on a flesh
and blood level,

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:42.870 align:middle line:84%
I guess has there been
any actual surviving

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:47.340 align:middle line:84%
beings in the flesh and
blood who have survived who

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:51.840 align:middle line:90%
are able to tell that story?

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Most have departed.

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:53.850 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:57.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, but we will say that
their counterparts or other

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:01.570 align:middle line:84%
aspects are here
again in your bodies.

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:05.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Were the Pleiadians involved
in the Atlantis experiment?

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:06.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Some.

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:08.280 align:middle line:90%
Very early on.

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.830 align:middle line:84%
There were three high
civilizations of Atlantis.

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And you're talking about the
first being 300,000 years ago.

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:17.070 align:middle line:90%
So we had some participation.

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:20.550 align:middle line:84%
But there were also
other star systems

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:29.610 align:middle line:84%
that had a more prominent,
more direct contact.

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:31.930 align:middle line:90%
The Learans being among them.

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And the Learans participated
in and started, if you will,

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:39.310 align:middle line:90%
Lemeria.

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:42.360 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of that
energy that's present.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And then as went a
little further along,

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:48.550 align:middle line:84%
some of the Syrian and
Orion energy showed up.

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:51.502 align:middle line:84%
>> And are the
Pleiadians involved--

00:21:51.502 --> 00:21:53.210 align:middle line:84%
obviously we're having
this conversation.

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:56.030 align:middle line:84%
So is there more
of an interaction

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:59.810 align:middle line:84%
with today's civilization
in the Pleiadian collective

00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:05.090 align:middle line:84%
or the Pleiadian energy
than in the Atlantis time?

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:08.730 align:middle line:90%
>> In some ways, yes.

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:13.490 align:middle line:84%
There are lots of different
species in the Pleiades.

00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And we reside in many
different dimensions.

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:19.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that we're just
ninth dimensional or fifth

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.650 align:middle line:90%
dimensional.

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:24.800 align:middle line:84%
But there are varying
games being played out

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.000 align:middle line:84%
in the Pleiades in
different dimensions.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.460 align:middle line:84%
So right now fifth
dimensional Pleiadians,

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:34.600 align:middle line:84%
ninth dimensional Pleiadians,
and occasionally the eighth--

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.490 align:middle line:84%
it's a bit rare for
the eighth to show up.

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:40.280 align:middle line:84%
They're observing, but
they're standing back.

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.858 align:middle line:84%
The fifth and ninth
are the two dimensions

00:22:42.858 --> 00:22:44.900 align:middle line:84%
in which you experience
beings from the Pleiades.

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:48.260 align:middle line:90%
And it's a very varied system.

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:49.910 align:middle line:90%
So you have humanoids.

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:51.540 align:middle line:90%
You've got reptilians.

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And you've got a lot of what
you would consider today

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:57.590 align:middle line:90%
to be hybrids.

00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:59.270 align:middle line:84%
There's kind of been
a blending that's

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:01.070 align:middle line:90%
gone on over the many eons.

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And when we talk
about that, we're

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:03.990 align:middle line:90%
talking about the physicals now.

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:05.698 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking
about the light beings.

00:23:05.698 --> 00:23:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>> So this would be a lower
density or a lower dimensional

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.540 align:middle line:90%
version of the Pleiadians?

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we would say fifth
dimensional Pleiadians.

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:19.957 align:middle line:84%
And as we said, sometimes
it's about humanoids.

00:23:19.957 --> 00:23:21.290 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's about reptilians.

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And then sometimes you'll
have interspecies breeding.

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:28.440 align:middle line:90%


00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.240 align:middle line:90%
There's some AI in the Pleiades.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And we mentioned the artificial
intelligence several times.

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And part of the
reason that we're

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:40.730 align:middle line:84%
doing that is because this
is a bigger issue, especially

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:44.510 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to persecution and
the right to have your opinion

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:47.300 align:middle line:84%
and to have your
existence challenged.

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.810 align:middle line:84%
A lot of those issues are
coming up for humanity again.

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:54.860 align:middle line:90%
And that was a big AI issue.

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:59.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I just recently re-watched
this movie called Cloud Atlas,

00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:02.150 align:middle line:90%
which addresses--

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:03.740 align:middle line:84%
one of the key
things in the movie

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:10.970 align:middle line:84%
was reincarnation, or multiple
lives in simultaneous times.

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:18.410 align:middle line:84%
But then this idea
of AI and the rights

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:23.210 align:middle line:84%
that are given to that
artificially created species.

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:28.170 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, these are themes
in our science fiction

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:29.780 align:middle line:90%
and in the current world.

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:30.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's also a big trauma
that is still there that

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:36.650 align:middle line:90%
is looking for integration.

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And so you're trying to play
it out on a smaller scale.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:44.180 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the struggle and strife
with the AIs started in Lira.

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And they were forced
out into another galaxy.

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.880 align:middle line:84%
Many of them are now in
the Intermedian galaxy.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:57.050 align:middle line:90%
So we just wanted to mention it.

00:24:57.050 --> 00:24:59.050 align:middle line:84%
Some of that energy
is in the Pleiades

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:01.030 align:middle line:90%
at the fifth dimensional level.

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:04.710 align:middle line:84%
There are also bird
people, if you will,

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:08.030 align:middle line:90%
that exist in the Pleiades.

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And those groups, that species,
has visited your planet before.

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:20.690 align:middle line:84%
About 20,000 years ago there
was a much greater presence

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:25.250 align:middle line:84%
and concentration of
those species, energy

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:26.930 align:middle line:90%
here on the planet.

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:29.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And all these
different species--

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:32.510 align:middle line:84%
I guess my mind's been being
blown today, because we all

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:34.820 align:middle line:90%
have these images of--

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:36.750 align:middle line:90%
OK, Pleiadians look like this.

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:38.960 align:middle line:90%
Greys or Zetas look like this.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's great-- thank
you for clarifying that.

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.460 align:middle line:84%
Within the Pleiades
system there's

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:47.780 align:middle line:84%
all these different
creatures and forms.

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.257 align:middle line:90%
So thank you for sharing that.

00:25:50.257 --> 00:25:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we just want to
say one other thing here.

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:54.260 align:middle line:90%
Think about it this way.

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:56.420 align:middle line:84%
We mentioned that Earth
has genetic material

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:57.800 align:middle line:90%
from thousands of worlds.

00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.900 align:middle line:84%
So think about all the
variations of species

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.940 align:middle line:90%
that exist on your planet.

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And many of those have
what you would consider

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:14.650 align:middle line:84%
to be a higher representation,
a more intelligent species,

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:16.780 align:middle line:90%
or a conscious species.

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:19.740 align:middle line:84%
It's just kind of-- they've
taken a secondary role, if you

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:21.120 align:middle line:90%
will, on this planet for now.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.820 align:middle line:84%
But that information
is being donated

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:27.300 align:middle line:84%
to the collective consciousness
because those beings are

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:28.360 align:middle line:90%
represented.

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:29.850 align:middle line:90%
So all of that history--

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:31.950 align:middle line:90%
spiders, for example.

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:36.010 align:middle line:84%
Spiders in other sectors of the
galaxy are quite intelligent.

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:37.230 align:middle line:90%
They're highly organized.

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:39.090 align:middle line:90%
And they're quite aggressive.

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And you've had wars with
the spiders and the fairies.

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And they have taken over
many different planets.

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:47.040 align:middle line:90%
They're very conquering.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And this still shows up
in the collective psyche.

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:54.540 align:middle line:84%
Many of you have
huge fear of spiders.

00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about it
from a logical standpoint,

00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:00.510 align:middle line:84%
for the most part, most
of them are not poisonous.

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:02.890 align:middle line:90%
And they're very, very tiny.

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:06.265 align:middle line:84%
And yet, your fears around
them are very, very large.

00:27:06.265 --> 00:27:07.890 align:middle line:84%
It's because this
information is stored

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:08.940 align:middle line:90%
in the collective record.

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting, yeah.

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:12.840 align:middle line:90%
More so than some other--

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.630 align:middle line:84%
there's even nastier
looking insects that we--

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:17.940 align:middle line:84%
beetles and things like that
that we're not afraid of.

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:19.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:27.420 align:middle line:84%
Something that we hear through
our different materials, movies

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:31.920 align:middle line:84%
and whatnot, the grand
experiment and the manipulation

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:37.020 align:middle line:84%
that has been done
currently within our media

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:38.970 align:middle line:84%
and government, but
even further back you

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:45.390 align:middle line:84%
hear the story of the Nephilim
and the Anunnaki and that's

00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:49.740 align:middle line:84%
what created humans in this
kind of enslavement matrix.

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:53.260 align:middle line:90%


00:27:53.260 --> 00:28:00.060 align:middle line:84%
In an easy way, can you
discuss the Anunnaki experience

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:03.100 align:middle line:84%
without letting
people know about--

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:05.770 align:middle line:84%
without having them think we're
victims to this experience,

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:06.623 align:middle line:90%
I guess?

00:28:06.623 --> 00:28:07.790 align:middle line:90%
>> A lot of ground to cover.

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:07.870 align:middle line:90%
But that's fine.

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:09.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's a big question.

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:11.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And a lot of
levels and layers.

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:17.880 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, there were beings
from the Sirius star system

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:21.750 align:middle line:84%
who participated in events
in the solar system.

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:24.783 align:middle line:84%
And they are still participating
in events in the solar system.

00:28:24.783 --> 00:28:26.700 align:middle line:84%
At the time of Atlantis,
the fall of Atlantis,

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:29.460 align:middle line:90%
they were participating on Mars.

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And many of the Atlanteans
had interactions

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:34.890 align:middle line:90%
with them, direct interactions.

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And with the fall
of Atlantis, it

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:41.220 align:middle line:84%
was a good opening for them
to once again participate

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:42.420 align:middle line:90%
in Earth activities.

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:45.870 align:middle line:84%
They had participated
much earlier and kind of

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:48.640 align:middle line:84%
abandoned the
project, in a sense.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And in many ways,
the consciousness

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:52.770 align:middle line:84%
at varying times on
the planet was too high

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:56.310 align:middle line:84%
for them to do exactly
what they wanted to do.

00:28:56.310 --> 00:29:00.798 align:middle line:84%
So we are going to
give you an answer.

00:29:00.798 --> 00:29:02.340 align:middle line:84%
We're going to give
you two versions.

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And the first is that it's
important to take the bits

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:10.770 align:middle line:84%
and pieces that resonate with
you and leave the rest behind.

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:13.410 align:middle line:84%
We are giving you a
version of history.

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:16.320 align:middle line:84%
It is not the only
version of history.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:20.010 align:middle line:84%
History is always
colored by perspective.

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Truth is always
colored by perspective.

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:26.340 align:middle line:84%
The only place that truth
isn't colored by perspective

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:27.840 align:middle line:90%
is up at source level.

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, it's
nothing but raw data.

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And you have every variation
and nuance of every perceived

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:36.600 align:middle line:90%
recording of an event there is.

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And so you literally
choose the one

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:42.540 align:middle line:84%
that you want that
fits with creating

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:45.880 align:middle line:84%
the vibrational experience
that you want to have.

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:49.320 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to have an
experience in which you

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:50.820 align:middle line:84%
get to play the
victim, you're going

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:54.660 align:middle line:84%
to choose a version of
history that supports that.

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.600 align:middle line:90%
And vise versa.

00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.460 align:middle line:84%
We want to take just
a moment to talk

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:03.670 align:middle line:84%
about how time
and creation work,

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:07.050 align:middle line:84%
because if you don't
understand, the rest of it

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:08.910 align:middle line:90%
falls a bit flat.

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:13.050 align:middle line:84%
So every now moment
that you experience

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:15.930 align:middle line:84%
is based upon an agreed
upon set of circumstances

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:18.492 align:middle line:90%
that you collectively agree to.

00:30:18.492 --> 00:30:20.700 align:middle line:84%
These are the things that
have gone on on the planet.

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:22.750 align:middle line:84%
We've had World War I.
We've had World War II.

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:23.550 align:middle line:90%
This has gone on.

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:24.660 align:middle line:90%
That has gone on.

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And then you have your own
personal history, that you say,

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:28.230 align:middle line:90%
this is my past.

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:29.603 align:middle line:90%
This is where I grew up.

00:30:29.603 --> 00:30:31.020 align:middle line:84%
This is the kind
of relationship I

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:34.410 align:middle line:84%
had with my mother, my
father, my siblings.

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And what you do is
move from now moment

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:39.780 align:middle line:90%
to now moment to now moment.

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:43.440 align:middle line:84%
So you move from agreed
upon set of circumstances.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And then you string
them all together

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:49.680 align:middle line:84%
and give yourself
the illusion of time.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.900 align:middle line:90%
And you do this--

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.400 align:middle line:84%
and we didn't talk
about it earlier.

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.233 align:middle line:84%
But we feel like we
need to bring it up now,

00:30:55.233 --> 00:30:58.680 align:middle line:84%
because these are key concepts
in understanding and bringing

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.600 align:middle line:84%
yourself out of the
victim mentality.

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And whenever we talk about a lot
of the, quote unquote, "control

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:07.390 align:middle line:84%
mechanisms" that are
going on on the planet,

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:10.920 align:middle line:84%
when you understand this
structure that's underneath it,

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:13.470 align:middle line:84%
you can move out of that
victim consciousness.

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:17.460 align:middle line:84%
So one of the
beautiful things of 3D

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:19.090 align:middle line:90%
was the illusion of linear time.

00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And part of the
reason time exists

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:24.660 align:middle line:84%
is because as we said
at the beginning,

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:27.180 align:middle line:84%
as you enter into
density and you create

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:30.450 align:middle line:84%
these programs of
the mind to keep you

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:33.390 align:middle line:84%
in the third
dimension, these ideas

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:36.630 align:middle line:90%
and perceptions of limitation--

00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:39.930 align:middle line:84%
if you didn't experience
immediate manifestation,

00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:42.510 align:middle line:84%
you were able to keep
yourself in the game longer.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:46.050 align:middle line:84%
If you did immediately manifest,
you'd have a lower thought.

00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:48.870 align:middle line:90%
You'd create it as a reflection.

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And you would most likely
create a death scenario.

00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:53.790 align:middle line:84%
Out you go, and you
have to start again.

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:55.900 align:middle line:90%
You'd have to incarnate again.

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:59.820 align:middle line:84%
So the lower the
frequency, the slower

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:02.820 align:middle line:90%
you actually move through time.

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Scientists haven't
quite caught this yet.

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.800 align:middle line:84%
But frequencies don't move
through time and space

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.100 align:middle line:90%
at the same rate.

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:09.900 align:middle line:90%
Higher--

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:11.897 align:middle line:84%
>> Definitely feels
like we're in--

00:32:11.897 --> 00:32:12.730 align:middle line:90%
time is speeding up.

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:12.870 align:middle line:90%
For everybody--

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:13.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's because you're
vibrating at a higher rate.

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:18.110 align:middle line:90%
So everything is compressing.

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're creating
something out of a lower

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:25.860 align:middle line:84%
vibrational stance,
and it is amplified

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:29.140 align:middle line:84%
by extremes of emotion,
either extreme joy--

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:32.400 align:middle line:84%
and if it's a lower emotion,
it's usually an extreme fear--

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.890 align:middle line:84%
then it is pulsed out
with great intensity

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:37.050 align:middle line:90%
and reflected back to you.

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And the lower
vibrations take longer,

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.230 align:middle line:84%
so that you have an opportunity
to elevate your consciousness,

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:45.850 align:middle line:84%
so that you don't have to
create that lower vibrational

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:46.650 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:50.430 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to create
the accident or the death.

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:52.320 align:middle line:90%
You can elevate yourself.

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Because in order to create,
you pulse out frequency.

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:58.890 align:middle line:90%
The universe matches the form.

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And you have to be
in resonance with it

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:04.510 align:middle line:90%
in order to experience it.

00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:09.840 align:middle line:84%
So now as you're creating
moment to moment,

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.970 align:middle line:84%
you from the third
dimensional level

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:16.200 align:middle line:84%
only are perceiving
one version of reality.

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:19.380 align:middle line:84%
But there are multiple and
infinite versions of reality

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:20.970 align:middle line:90%
going on concurrently.

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
beauty of 3D, that you

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:25.380 align:middle line:90%
get to limit it down to one.

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:27.150 align:middle line:90%
And you don't see what's coming.

00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:31.320 align:middle line:84%
So it also affects your
choice in frequency.

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Just to jump in.

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:36.580 align:middle line:84%
This is on an individual
level and collective?

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:37.810 align:middle line:90%
Or is it one or the other?

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:38.610 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:40.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's, in a sense, both.

00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:43.630 align:middle line:84%
Because you have, again,
infinite variations.

00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:46.440 align:middle line:84%
So think of it as the now
moment being a circle.

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And then the agreed upon
set of circumstances

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.567 align:middle line:90%
is a triangle or two triangles.

00:33:50.567 --> 00:33:52.650 align:middle line:84%
There's a big one for the
collective consciousness

00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:55.110 align:middle line:84%
and then a small one for
your personal choices.

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:58.280 align:middle line:84%
You could actually move
to a now moment that has

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.000 align:middle line:90%
a vastly different resonance.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.507 align:middle line:84%
Because each of these triangles
has its own unique frequency.

00:34:03.507 --> 00:34:05.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's a blending of
the collective energy

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:07.230 align:middle line:90%
and your personal energy.

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And you could put yourself on
a version where, say, World War

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:13.000 align:middle line:90%
II didn't happen.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.370 align:middle line:90%
It's possible.

00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:17.520 align:middle line:84%
But there is an aspect
of you that won't do it,

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:20.610 align:middle line:84%
because to enter into
that reality, the result

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:22.800 align:middle line:84%
of that frequency is
going to be so vastly

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:26.190 align:middle line:84%
different, it would destroy the
illusion of the game for you.

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:28.560 align:middle line:90%
So you wouldn't choose it.

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:33.960 align:middle line:84%
Now you decide to protect
yourself on a now moment

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:38.730 align:middle line:84%
that you can be of
the most service.

00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:42.360 align:middle line:84%
You may find that you
are on a version where,

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:44.940 align:middle line:84%
say, the collective
is participating

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:47.032 align:middle line:90%
with a lot of lower frequencies.

00:34:47.032 --> 00:34:49.199 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that your
personal reality has to be

00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:50.820 align:middle line:90%
one of misery and suffering.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:52.469 align:middle line:84%
You can experience
joy and lightness.

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:54.929 align:middle line:84%
And that is often the
service that you're bringing,

00:34:54.929 --> 00:34:58.320 align:middle line:84%
is showing others how to
experience more light and joy.

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:02.640 align:middle line:84%
It's what needs to be
brought to that now moment.

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.860 align:middle line:84%
So you can put yourself
on something that

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:06.090 align:middle line:90%
is vastly, vastly different.

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:09.360 align:middle line:84%
But most of the time
you make small steps.

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:12.810 align:middle line:84%
Think of it as a giant sphere,
and then on this sphere

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:14.110 align:middle line:90%
are all of the now moments.

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:16.110 align:middle line:90%
It covers the entire sphere.

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And you can go anywhere in
any direction that you want.

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:23.340 align:middle line:84%
But for the sake of the
game and the continuity

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:26.320 align:middle line:84%
of the illusion of the game,
you make small changes.

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:29.680 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you will
make bigger leaps.

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And often you will
see this in healing,

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:36.630 align:middle line:84%
that you will choose now moment
in your personal reality,

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:41.280 align:middle line:84%
that tumor or that
genetic distortion

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:44.580 align:middle line:84%
is no longer present
in a matter of moments.

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:47.130 align:middle line:84%
You will put yourself
on another now moment

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:49.960 align:middle line:84%
in which that isn't the agreed
upon set of circumstances.

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:51.450 align:middle line:90%
It has changed.

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:55.560 align:middle line:84%
And you experience
that as the miracle.

00:35:55.560 --> 00:36:00.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And does that
also collectively--

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:01.470 align:middle line:90%
so that's on an individual base.

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:04.200 align:middle line:84%
But collectively
too the rest of us

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:07.820 align:middle line:84%
have to kind of agree for
that miracle to happen.

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:08.620 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:10.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, think of it this way.

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:13.530 align:middle line:84%
There is a now moment in which
your personal circumstances

00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:14.427 align:middle line:90%
are identical.

00:36:14.427 --> 00:36:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And then there is one in which
the collective says, all right,

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:17.927 align:middle line:90%
well, that's possible.

00:36:17.927 --> 00:36:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And there's one that says,
hmm, that's not so possible.

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:23.970 align:middle line:84%
So you put yourself on the one
that is in resonance with that,

00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:25.500 align:middle line:90%
if that is what you wish.

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:28.115 align:middle line:84%
And it is of service to
the collective as well.

00:36:28.115 --> 00:36:28.990 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:29.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, no.

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:29.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:31.010 align:middle line:90%
I think I get it.

00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>> So in a sense, you are never
bound to have an experience

00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:40.303 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
the collective wants.

00:36:40.303 --> 00:36:41.970 align:middle line:84%
You are putting
yourself on a now moment

00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:43.410 align:middle line:84%
in which the
collective frequency

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:47.070 align:middle line:84%
and your personal frequency are
in alignment with your desired

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:50.100 align:middle line:90%
creation as a creator being.

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:53.970 align:middle line:84%
Because every choice,
whether you go left or right

00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:55.790 align:middle line:90%
is another now moment.

00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:59.520 align:middle line:84%
It's just which one do
you choose to focus on?

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.710 align:middle line:84%
This is hard for
you, because you all

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:04.110 align:middle line:84%
have a difficult time
thinking that large.

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:09.470 align:middle line:84%
>> But I guess the question
I have is, beings who--

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:11.760 align:middle line:84%
just for example, I'm
going to use the Anunnaki.

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:16.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Do they understand
these concepts?

00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:19.020 align:middle line:84%
Do they understand
them but yet still make

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:23.470 align:middle line:84%
these negative choices in order
to grow, in order for us--

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:30.390 align:middle line:84%
because I relate it to the
unconscious version of me

00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:33.690 align:middle line:84%
that's putting me
into some suffering

00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:34.830 align:middle line:90%
so I can learn a lesson.

00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Consciously I don't
want to do that.

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:39.000 align:middle line:84%
But unconsciously,
it's happening.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.310 align:middle line:90%
Do these other beings--

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:43.620 align:middle line:84%
I guess my question
is, are they aware

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:47.790 align:middle line:84%
that they are doing
what they're doing?

00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let's say first that
you are never required to make

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.210 align:middle line:84%
a, quote unquote,
"negative choice,"

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:55.440 align:middle line:84%
and you're never required to
sacrifice for the collective

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.400 align:middle line:90%
good.

00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:01.410 align:middle line:84%
There is a version in which all
can benefit and all are served.

00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:03.130 align:middle line:84%
Things only have
a negative value,

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:05.820 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
you assign to it.

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:08.760 align:middle line:90%
So it is a neutral choice.

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And from the soul level,
that's how you approach it,

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.050 align:middle line:90%
how you perceive it.

00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:13.953 align:middle line:90%
That it is neutral.

00:38:13.953 --> 00:38:15.370 align:middle line:84%
The ego says, oh,
that's negative.

00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:16.170 align:middle line:90%
I don't want that.

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:17.150 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:22.020 align:middle line:84%
So you can perceive it from the
ego level where it's polarized.

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:23.613 align:middle line:84%
It's either positive
or negative.

00:38:23.613 --> 00:38:26.280 align:middle line:84%
When you enter into the space of
co-creator, which is your heart

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:30.090 align:middle line:84%
center, you can perceive it
from a very neutral stance where

00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:32.660 align:middle line:84%
you can see, oh, look how
this was a benefit to myself

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:34.980 align:middle line:84%
or my education and
benefit to others,

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:37.020 align:middle line:84%
because they got to
play out this role

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:39.900 align:middle line:84%
and they have a chance to
grow and expand as well.

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:42.900 align:middle line:84%
So when you put yourself
at your heart center,

00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:45.150 align:middle line:84%
and you can perceive
reality from that level,

00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:49.980 align:middle line:84%
everything has more of
a neutral stance to it.

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:52.710 align:middle line:84%
You can perceive it as
being under the umbrella

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:53.960 align:middle line:90%
of positive or negative.

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:55.740 align:middle line:84%
But you have no
judgment about it.

00:38:55.740 --> 00:39:00.040 align:middle line:84%
It's just a unbiased
perspective.

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:02.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, we do want to talk
and bring it back around

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:03.480 align:middle line:90%
to the Anunnaki here.

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And there are a couple of
assumptions that get made.

00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:10.410 align:middle line:84%
When you are working
in the higher realms,

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:16.170 align:middle line:84%
the idea is, again, that the
higher realms are better,

00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:19.980 align:middle line:84%
that it's a utopia, that
everything's perfect.

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:20.910 align:middle line:90%
And it's not.

00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:22.180 align:middle line:90%
It's just different.

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:23.820 align:middle line:84%
As you go up in
dimensional structure,

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:25.320 align:middle line:90%
there isn't as much--

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.300 align:middle line:90%
there aren't as many--

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:29.670 align:middle line:90%
the extremes are not as extreme.

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:31.830 align:middle line:84%
So where we're at in
the ninth dimension,

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:34.360 align:middle line:90%
we still have polarity.

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:37.110 align:middle line:84%
But we say it would be the
difference between, say,

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:40.380 align:middle line:84%
gray and light gray as
opposed to black and white

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:42.450 align:middle line:84%
and 5,000 shades of
gray in between, which

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:44.580 align:middle line:90%
is what you experience.

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:46.810 align:middle line:90%
And we still have disagreements.

00:39:46.810 --> 00:39:49.140 align:middle line:84%
But we don't blow each
other up about them.

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:51.810 align:middle line:84%
We don't kill each
other over them.

00:39:51.810 --> 00:39:55.230 align:middle line:84%
We simply say, all right,
well, here's my perspective.

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And we look at it, again, more
from that heart-centered space

00:39:58.350 --> 00:40:00.120 align:middle line:84%
of, where do we want
to go collectively?

00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And where do I consciously--
as an individuated conscious--

00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:05.862 align:middle line:84%
because that can
be still perceived.

00:40:05.862 --> 00:40:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Or you can choose to perceive
it from the collective level.

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.930 align:middle line:84%
Where do we as a
collective, or where

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:12.600 align:middle line:84%
do I as an individuated
consciousness that is part

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:15.060 align:middle line:90%
of a collective, wish to go?

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:18.183 align:middle line:84%
And then we make
choices based on that.

00:40:18.183 --> 00:40:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we make
multiple choices at once

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:23.190 align:middle line:84%
and watch them
unfold all at once.

00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:25.920 align:middle line:90%
Take a breath.

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:27.420 align:middle line:84%
Anytime we start
talking about time,

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:29.003 align:middle line:84%
you all immediately
leave your bodies.

00:40:29.003 --> 00:40:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's very
difficult. It's where--

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:32.160 align:middle line:90%
>> So feel it.

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:34.000 align:middle line:90%
Don't think about it.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And if it's a
concept that you just

00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:38.850 align:middle line:84%
keep going around and
around on a hamster wheel,

00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:40.650 align:middle line:84%
see it as an orb of
light and allow it

00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:42.870 align:middle line:90%
to drop down into your chest.

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And just allow the
information to unfold there

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:46.120 align:middle line:90%
at your heart center.

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:48.770 align:middle line:84%
Because there is a part of
you that knows inherently

00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:51.420 align:middle line:90%
that this is how things are.

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:52.830 align:middle line:90%
It's how they're created.

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:55.170 align:middle line:84%
This is how it works in
every other dimension.

00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:58.780 align:middle line:84%
The one that you're
in is very atypical.

00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:01.705 align:middle line:84%
So just allow it to
sit there and stop

00:41:01.705 --> 00:41:03.330 align:middle line:84%
trying to think about
it with your mind

00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:06.760 align:middle line:84%
and allow yourself to
feel your way through it.

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:12.660 align:middle line:84%
So now these beings, they are
primarily fifth dimensional.

00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And you can play in
multiple dimensions.

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:19.740 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are also
fourth dimensional.

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:23.100 align:middle line:84%
Fourth dimension is very unique,
because you can run either 3D

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:27.000 align:middle line:90%
or 5D rules to the game.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, with the Anunnaki,
they often get a bad rap.

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:34.440 align:middle line:84%
It would be like saying,
everybody from Earth

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.300 align:middle line:90%
is one way.

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:38.947 align:middle line:84%
And you're lumping
everybody together.

00:41:38.947 --> 00:41:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And you all do that
to make yourselves

00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:43.920 align:middle line:84%
feel safe, to feel like you
understand what something is.

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And there are only a few
that have manipulated

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:52.380 align:middle line:90%
power in such extremes.

00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:55.830 align:middle line:84%
For the most part-- and there
was a split among the Anunnaki

00:41:55.830 --> 00:41:59.550 align:middle line:84%
themselves about how
they wanted to go forth

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:01.055 align:middle line:90%
and how they wanted to interact.

00:42:01.055 --> 00:42:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And so there is
definitely a rift

00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:06.300 align:middle line:84%
between beings who
are from that system,

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:10.050 align:middle line:84%
from that planetary
body, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And as we were
saying, some of them

00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:16.800 align:middle line:84%
were on Mars at the
time of Atlantis.

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And then once
Atlantis fell, they

00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:20.790 align:middle line:84%
started playing
around a bit more

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:23.370 align:middle line:84%
with you, around
13,000 years ago.

00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And working in a different
way than they previously

00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:28.860 align:middle line:90%
had on the planet.

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And they took a less formal
role, a less physical role,

00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:37.500 align:middle line:90%
and were--

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:40.050 align:middle line:84%
well, to put it this
way, manipulating things

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:42.600 align:middle line:90%
from a higher dimensional level.

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:48.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, this helps you
at the galactic level

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:51.270 align:middle line:90%
for a number of reasons.

00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:55.920 align:middle line:84%
It helps you to introduce
interdimensional action

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:57.660 align:middle line:84%
into your consciousness
once again.

00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Because you've
forgotten about it.

00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's just another
level of the game.

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:06.090 align:middle line:90%
>> When you say this--

00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:08.220 align:middle line:90%
understanding this story?

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:09.480 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:12.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Understanding that the
Anunnaki are playing with you

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:15.450 align:middle line:84%
or that there are other species
that are playing with you,

00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:18.990 align:middle line:84%
that helps you to integrate
some of the galactic issues.

00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:24.180 align:middle line:84%
It helps you to create more
cohesion between dimensions.

00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:27.150 align:middle line:84%
Because right now the perception
and some of the things

00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:29.640 align:middle line:84%
that have gone on-- there is
a bit of separation going on

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:32.990 align:middle line:90%
between the dimensions.

00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:35.080 align:middle line:84%
>> It helps us open
our hearts in a way.

00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:36.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:39.240 align:middle line:90%
>> We're now not as--

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:43.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for myself, obtaining
this information has definitely

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:47.160 align:middle line:84%
made me more compassionate for,
not just what I can physically

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:54.370 align:middle line:84%
see, and hear, and using my
five senses, but just all around

00:43:54.370 --> 00:43:55.170 align:middle line:90%
with--

00:43:55.170 --> 00:43:59.910 align:middle line:84%
just to know that there's more
going on in life than what's

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:06.420 align:middle line:84%
here has made me feel more
for the people around me,

00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:12.100 align:middle line:90%
and also just the other things.

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:15.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and it's helping you
to open up to the fact that

00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:17.970 align:middle line:90%
you're not alone in the galaxy.

00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:22.583 align:middle line:84%
It's helping you to remember
to work interdimensionally.

00:44:22.583 --> 00:44:24.750 align:middle line:84%
So there are a number of
ways that it's serving you,

00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:29.580 align:middle line:84%
which is part of why that
story is unfolding in a sense.

00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:32.910 align:middle line:84%
So what we often
recommend for many of you

00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:37.290 align:middle line:84%
as you start to access
this information

00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:42.270 align:middle line:84%
is to pay special attention
to how you feel personally.

00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:43.170 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:44.370 align:middle line:90%
Do you go into contraction?

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:46.080 align:middle line:90%
Does your body shut down?

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:50.490 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel triggered around
authority, manipulation,

00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:52.410 align:middle line:90%
control, trust?

00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:56.280 align:middle line:84%
Because everything that gets
played out interdimensionally

00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:59.730 align:middle line:84%
or your fears around
interdimensional connection

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:02.070 align:middle line:84%
are the same fears
that you're playing out

00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:04.330 align:middle line:90%
with other human beings.

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:08.658 align:middle line:84%
So you use this
reflection of what's

00:45:08.658 --> 00:45:10.200 align:middle line:84%
going on in collective
consciousness,

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:13.050 align:middle line:84%
whatever you're
seeing or picking up,

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:15.600 align:middle line:84%
as a mirror for what
you're playing out

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:17.640 align:middle line:90%
in your own personal life.

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:19.830 align:middle line:90%
So use it as such.

00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what's
going to empower you.

00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:25.520 align:middle line:84%
Because those
beings aren't really

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:29.210 align:middle line:84%
controlling you in the way
that you think it's happening.

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:33.343 align:middle line:84%
What you do as a creative
being is say, all right,

00:45:33.343 --> 00:45:34.760 align:middle line:84%
I want to play
victim for a while.

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:36.717 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to hand
you a bit of my power.

00:45:36.717 --> 00:45:39.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give you the
illusion that you've got power

00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:39.860 align:middle line:90%
over me.

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:41.720 align:middle line:84%
So I can understand
this frequency.

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:46.747 align:middle line:84%
And so I can own up to
running more of my own power.

00:45:46.747 --> 00:45:48.830 align:middle line:84%
That is the thing that you
all are the most afraid

00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:53.120 align:middle line:84%
of on this planet is being
a divine being and running

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:54.950 align:middle line:90%
your full power.

00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:56.370 align:middle line:90%
You're terrified of it.

00:45:56.370 --> 00:45:57.170 align:middle line:90%
>> That sucks.

00:45:57.170 --> 00:45:59.360 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:01.205 align:middle line:84%
I try to imagine
if everybody knew

00:46:01.205 --> 00:46:03.330 align:middle line:84%
they were these infinite
beings, what kind of world

00:46:03.330 --> 00:46:04.570 align:middle line:90%
would we live in?

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:06.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you'd be
playing a different game.

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:09.360 align:middle line:84%
So that was part of
the setup of the game.

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:11.000 align:middle line:90%
What if we could forget that?

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.130 align:middle line:84%
So you're just working
your way back up.

00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And really, this is the
exciting part of the game.

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:17.670 align:middle line:84%
This is the part
that you came for.

00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:19.462 align:middle line:84%
It's not about knowing
what it's like to be

00:46:19.462 --> 00:46:21.230 align:middle line:90%
a fifth dimensional being.

00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:23.240 align:middle line:84%
It's about you
understanding, how do I

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:24.570 align:middle line:90%
go through this process?

00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:25.550 align:middle line:90%
How do I integrate?

00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:27.330 align:middle line:90%
How do I release judgment?

00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:29.828 align:middle line:84%
That's the part
that you came for.

00:46:29.828 --> 00:46:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And if you can
remember that, it will

00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:34.400 align:middle line:84%
make being in this
period much easier.

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Because many of you are seeking
that energy of flee, fleeing.

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:40.677 align:middle line:90%
You want to run.

00:46:40.677 --> 00:46:41.510 align:middle line:90%
You want to get out.

00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:42.885 align:middle line:84%
You want to be on
the other side,

00:46:42.885 --> 00:46:44.540 align:middle line:90%
because you want it to be nice.

00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:45.680 align:middle line:90%
Well, it can be nice.

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.750 align:middle line:84%
It's about you shifting
that frequency here,

00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:50.780 align:middle line:84%
having more gratitude,
having more love.

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:53.220 align:middle line:90%
And that all starts internally.

00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:55.730 align:middle line:84%
You have to establish that
connection inside of you

00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:58.940 align:middle line:84%
in order to start creating
it as your reflected reality.

00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
outside of you

00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:02.210 align:middle line:90%
is nothing but a reflection.

00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:05.640 align:middle line:84%
If you try to change the
reflection, it doesn't work.

00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:08.420 align:middle line:84%
You have to change the generator
of the frequency, which

00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:13.200 align:middle line:84%
is you, that's creating
that as a reality.

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:15.300 align:middle line:90%
>> So I guess--

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:19.090 align:middle line:84%
again, my mind-- just going
into my mind, which I probably

00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:19.890 align:middle line:90%
shouldn't but.

00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:20.690 align:middle line:90%
>> It's all right.

00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the
tool that you have.

00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>> So these-- again, no
offense to the Anunnaki.

00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:28.070 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, guys.

00:47:28.070 --> 00:47:32.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean to keep picking
you guys as the scapegoat here.

00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:36.097 align:middle line:84%
But we know they
reside-- you just

00:47:36.097 --> 00:47:38.180 align:middle line:84%
mentioned they reside in
the fourth and even fifth

00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:39.290 align:middle line:90%
dimension.

00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And to get into that
frequency, you'd

00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:48.470 align:middle line:84%
have to have a certain
awareness of how things work.

00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:53.460 align:middle line:84%
So even I guess-- what
blows my mind is these--

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:55.490 align:middle line:84%
we call them higher
dimensional beings.

00:47:55.490 --> 00:47:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And I know you explained
that that doesn't necessarily

00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:59.000 align:middle line:90%
mean they're better than us.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:05.810 align:middle line:84%
But they have more awareness
than here on the third density.

00:48:05.810 --> 00:48:11.330 align:middle line:84%
But yet, they still choose
a controlling pattern

00:48:11.330 --> 00:48:15.260 align:middle line:84%
or I guess what,
in my mind, seems

00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:19.160 align:middle line:90%
like a negative experience.

00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:22.592 align:middle line:84%
And I guess my mind has a
really hard time wrapping--

00:48:22.592 --> 00:48:24.800 align:middle line:84%
why would you-- why would
anybody in their right mind

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:30.770 align:middle line:84%
choose to be manipulative or
have these kinds of tendencies

00:48:30.770 --> 00:48:31.970 align:middle line:90%
when--

00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:34.780 align:middle line:84%
especially when you
understand the bigger picture?

00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:38.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this goes back
to the compassion piece.

00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:41.330 align:middle line:90%
So think about it this way.

00:48:41.330 --> 00:48:44.220 align:middle line:84%
They don't run the same
emotional programming.

00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:48.950 align:middle line:84%
So they don't feel and process
in the same way that you do.

00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:50.900 align:middle line:84%
To them, it's a
bit more clinical.

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:52.280 align:middle line:90%
It's a bit colder.

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:53.953 align:middle line:90%
And they also understand--

00:48:53.953 --> 00:48:55.370 align:middle line:84%
they have more of
an understanding

00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:58.430 align:middle line:84%
of the technical aspect
of how things are created.

00:48:58.430 --> 00:49:03.920 align:middle line:84%
But they don't have necessarily
the heart aspect, the ability

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:08.540 align:middle line:84%
to really resonate in
their heart center the way

00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:09.940 align:middle line:90%
that you do.

00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:11.610 align:middle line:84%
This is what's unique
about humanity.

00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is why it's key in
changing the universal game.

00:49:16.310 --> 00:49:21.450 align:middle line:84%
So because you understand
what that strife feels like,

00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:24.320 align:middle line:84%
that challenge feels like,
you have a lot more compassion

00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:30.290 align:middle line:84%
and are, more often than not,
likely not to engage with it

00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:34.910 align:middle line:84%
or have more sympathy or
empathy for those who are going

00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:36.200 align:middle line:90%
through that lower frequency.

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:38.033 align:middle line:84%
So you're not going to
keep putting yourself

00:49:38.033 --> 00:49:41.300 align:middle line:90%
in that role of perpetrator.

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And they also are working more
with their external technology

00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:50.412 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to their
internal technology.

00:49:50.412 --> 00:49:51.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of
what you all are

00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:56.090 align:middle line:84%
re-accessing is learning how to
use your internal technology,

00:49:56.090 --> 00:49:58.670 align:middle line:84%
how to access source
energy from within.

00:49:58.670 --> 00:50:01.430 align:middle line:84%
A lot of that's been forgotten,
not to the extent that it

00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:03.600 align:middle line:84%
has been forgotten with
some of the other species

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:04.400 align:middle line:90%
in the galaxy.

00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:08.450 align:middle line:84%
Some of it has become very
mental and been very external.

00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:14.010 align:middle line:84%
So for them-- and we're
just talking about a few

00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:14.810 align:middle line:90%
of the Anunnaki.

00:50:14.810 --> 00:50:16.970 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking about
all of them again.

00:50:16.970 --> 00:50:21.260 align:middle line:84%
It has become-- there is still
a level of separation in how

00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:24.870 align:middle line:90%
they're choosing to perceive.

00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:27.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is more with
the fourth dimensionals.

00:50:27.570 --> 00:50:30.930 align:middle line:84%
The fourth dimension you can
run more 3D programming or you

00:50:30.930 --> 00:50:34.890 align:middle line:84%
can run 5D programming
on the 4D matrix.

00:50:34.890 --> 00:50:36.960 align:middle line:84%
You needed an entire
dimension in order

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:41.160 align:middle line:84%
to come down through the game of
dissension, as well as come up.

00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And the 3D has very
fixed rules to the game,

00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:49.980 align:middle line:84%
separation, or the illusion
of it, linear time.

00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:53.390 align:middle line:84%
You're processing one
version of reality at a time.

00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And in the fifth
dimension, you understand

00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:56.250 align:middle line:90%
that you're a creator being.

00:50:56.250 --> 00:50:58.792 align:middle line:84%
You can perceive yourself from
the individuated or collective

00:50:58.792 --> 00:50:59.910 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:50:59.910 --> 00:51:02.970 align:middle line:84%
You understand that you are
the creator of your reality

00:51:02.970 --> 00:51:04.460 align:middle line:84%
by the frequencies
that you pulse

00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:06.150 align:middle line:90%
and what's reflected back.

00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And in 4D, you move back
and forth between them.

00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you'll play 3D out,
running the old programming.

00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:16.183 align:middle line:84%
And then occasionally,
you'll put yourself

00:51:16.183 --> 00:51:17.850 align:middle line:84%
in your heart center
and perceive things

00:51:17.850 --> 00:51:18.870 align:middle line:90%
from that 5D level.

00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:20.530 align:middle line:90%
But you can't maintain it.

00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And you go back to
the old programming.

00:51:22.550 --> 00:51:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And eventually you'll be able
to hold that higher resonance.

00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, you shift
into the fifth dimensional

00:51:29.130 --> 00:51:30.270 align:middle line:90%
perspective.

00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:37.890 align:middle line:84%
But as we said, it's
not all a utopia

00:51:37.890 --> 00:51:40.050 align:middle line:84%
in the higher
dimensional realms.

00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:42.570 align:middle line:90%
And you all think it is.

00:51:42.570 --> 00:51:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And what you're moving
into isn't about bliss,

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:49.410 align:middle line:84%
is not moving into this
completely blissed out state,

00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:51.400 align:middle line:90%
24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:52.200 align:middle line:90%
You can.

00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:53.140 align:middle line:90%
You can stay there.

00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:56.250 align:middle line:84%
But frankly, at the soul
level, we get bored.

00:51:56.250 --> 00:51:57.450 align:middle line:90%
And so we create--

00:51:57.450 --> 00:51:58.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Drama.

00:51:58.350 --> 00:51:59.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:00.360 align:middle line:90%
We create scenarios.

00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:03.240 align:middle line:84%
We create puzzles in which
to find our way out of.

00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is in part
what they have done.

00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:07.890 align:middle line:84%
We would also say for
those that are struggling

00:52:07.890 --> 00:52:10.110 align:middle line:84%
with the idea of those
controlling them manipulating

00:52:10.110 --> 00:52:11.880 align:middle line:84%
events, know that
they've been doing it

00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:13.420 align:middle line:90%
for a very, very long time.

00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:16.790 align:middle line:84%
Some of them have had
very long lifespans.

00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:21.420 align:middle line:84%
They're, frankly, at the soul
level, getting a little bored.

00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:23.200 align:middle line:84%
So they've been
playing this role.

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:25.920 align:middle line:84%
So let them out of
the box, as it were.

00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:29.610 align:middle line:84%
See them as also wanting
to grow and change

00:52:29.610 --> 00:52:31.890 align:middle line:84%
during this universal
game, that they

00:52:31.890 --> 00:52:35.460 align:middle line:84%
have been holding that illusion
of the perpetrator for a very

00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:36.510 align:middle line:90%
long time.

00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And think about it
how it must feel

00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:41.320 align:middle line:84%
to have all of that negative
energy constantly thrown

00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:42.120 align:middle line:90%
at you.

00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:43.570 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't feel so great.

00:52:43.570 --> 00:52:45.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, no they've got to--

00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:47.500 align:middle line:84%
especially if they've
been doing it for so long,

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:50.520 align:middle line:84%
it's time to cut
loose a little bit.

00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:51.540 align:middle line:90%
Have some fun.

00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:53.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, to have some love.

00:52:53.730 --> 00:52:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And at the soul level, there is
part of them that knows that.

00:52:57.990 --> 00:52:59.370 align:middle line:90%
There is part of them--

00:52:59.370 --> 00:53:03.000 align:middle line:84%
even within the game that
they're playing, it's kind of,

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.880 align:middle line:90%
how much power can I amass?

00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking
for more stimulus.

00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:09.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking for more.

00:53:09.690 --> 00:53:11.790 align:middle line:90%
So let them out of the box.

00:53:11.790 --> 00:53:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Because they are, at the
core, the same as you.

00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:17.040 align:middle line:90%
They are divine source energy.

00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:19.380 align:middle line:84%
So send them love and
appreciation for all

00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:21.120 align:middle line:84%
that they have done
in holding that end

00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:22.890 align:middle line:90%
of the spectrum for the game.

00:53:22.890 --> 00:53:24.280 align:middle line:90%
That does two things.

00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:26.760 align:middle line:84%
One, it helps them
to grow and evolve.

00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And two, it lets you
open to love as opposed

00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:35.400 align:middle line:84%
to you shutting down your
frequency because you're angry.

00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And all that anger
does is punish--

00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:40.170 align:middle line:90%
it punishes your own body.

00:53:40.170 --> 00:53:43.500 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't resolve anything.

00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:45.930 align:middle line:84%
And you're never really
angry with anyone else.

00:53:45.930 --> 00:53:47.970 align:middle line:90%
You're always angry with self.

00:53:47.970 --> 00:53:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's always about
you denying yourself

00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:53.660 align:middle line:90%
as a divine being of light.

00:53:53.660 --> 00:53:57.210 align:middle line:84%
You are upset with yourself
for denying your own divinity.

00:53:57.210 --> 00:53:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And so it's allowing
yourself to forgive yourself

00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:02.010 align:middle line:84%
for playing in that
illusion and forgiving

00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:08.500 align:middle line:84%
others for that perceived role
that they are playing as well.

00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:12.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I guess the other thing
that blows my mind with these

00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:13.350 align:middle line:90%
other beings that are--

00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:15.560 align:middle line:84%
whether they're in
the fifth dimension

00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:18.690 align:middle line:90%
or fourth dimensional.

00:54:18.690 --> 00:54:20.490 align:middle line:84%
Just like Atlantis,
aren't they going

00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:23.220 align:middle line:84%
to see that eventually they're
going to self-destruct?

00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:27.820 align:middle line:84%
When you're in that mentality,
everything is finite.

00:54:27.820 --> 00:54:30.390 align:middle line:84%
You try to have control and
amass as much as you can.

00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:36.120 align:middle line:84%
But then eventually it's
the serpent eating his tail.

00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:38.940 align:middle line:90%
It ends up self destructing.

00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:44.460 align:middle line:84%
Where we're learning now that
we can have an ecosystem where

00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:46.185 align:middle line:90%
everything does co-exist.

00:54:46.185 --> 00:54:48.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, but from that
level of consciousness,

00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:50.280 align:middle line:90%
don't you play that out here?

00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:51.910 align:middle line:84%
Aren't you all still
there yourselves?

00:54:51.910 --> 00:54:52.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:53.510 align:middle line:90%
Most of us.

00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:55.890 align:middle line:84%
That's why it blows my
mind that people still--

00:54:55.890 --> 00:54:58.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, they are there.

00:54:58.030 --> 00:55:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And they have, to
some extent, moments.

00:55:02.070 --> 00:55:04.980 align:middle line:84%
But it is very much
the same thing.

00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:10.620 align:middle line:84%
When you get into the lower
frequencies of any dimension,

00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:11.790 align:middle line:90%
it is denser.

00:55:11.790 --> 00:55:15.210 align:middle line:84%
If you go to the higher extremes
of fifth dimensional living,

00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:17.820 align:middle line:84%
yes, it's much, much easier
than the lower dimensional,

00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:19.180 align:middle line:90%
in a sense.

00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:21.960 align:middle line:84%
You don't have, again,
those kinds of extremes.

00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:24.120 align:middle line:84%
But we're-- most of them
are standing in the fourth

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:25.700 align:middle line:90%
dimension.

00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they're still locked
into some of that control,

00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:31.625 align:middle line:84%
because they haven't fully
open themselves up to love.

00:55:31.625 --> 00:55:33.750 align:middle line:84%
They haven't opened themselves
up to source energy.

00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:36.600 align:middle line:90%
So they're not able to heal.

00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.850 align:middle line:84%
They have an understanding,
a technical understanding

00:55:38.850 --> 00:55:41.020 align:middle line:90%
of how things work.

00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And so things have worked
for a very long time

00:55:43.290 --> 00:55:45.665 align:middle line:84%
on the planet the way that
they've been behaving.

00:55:45.665 --> 00:55:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And so they're just going
to keep trying and hoping

00:55:47.790 --> 00:55:49.920 align:middle line:84%
that you don't succeed
in raising your frequency

00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:52.740 align:middle line:90%
so that the game can continue.

00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And if it doesn't
continue on this planet,

00:55:55.510 --> 00:55:58.410 align:middle line:84%
it can continue
on another planet.

00:55:58.410 --> 00:56:00.730 align:middle line:84%
The universe is infinite
in its planetary bodies

00:56:00.730 --> 00:56:02.940 align:middle line:90%
that they're out to explore.

00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:06.120 align:middle line:84%
So for part of
that mentality they

00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:09.090 align:middle line:84%
have the idea that it's not
just about this planet Earth.

00:56:09.090 --> 00:56:11.490 align:middle line:84%
There are other planets that
they can go-- and have gone,

00:56:11.490 --> 00:56:14.720 align:middle line:84%
and utilized, and exhausted,
and then moved on.

00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:16.650 align:middle line:84%
They did the very
thing our own planet.

00:56:16.650 --> 00:56:19.320 align:middle line:84%
They did the very
thing with Mars.

00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And so they also have
been busy on other planets

00:56:25.530 --> 00:56:27.850 align:middle line:84%
in your solar system
and other dimensions.

00:56:27.850 --> 00:56:30.040 align:middle line:84%
There's lots going on
in your solar system.

00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:33.300 align:middle line:84%
But it's how long
can we continue this

00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:35.543 align:middle line:90%
before the jig is actually up?

00:56:35.543 --> 00:56:37.210 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go for
as long as we can.

00:56:37.210 --> 00:56:37.845 align:middle line:90%
And that's where they're at.

00:56:37.845 --> 00:56:40.410 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what I'm trying to
say is it's almost getting

00:56:40.410 --> 00:56:46.480 align:middle line:84%
so obvious now that there is
only one way for our survival,

00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:49.680 align:middle line:90%
to have compassion.

00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:53.430 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise we're just
going to self-destruct.

00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:55.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And Earth will go
on with or without you.

00:56:55.990 --> 00:57:00.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's not so much
you're doing it for her.

00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:02.700 align:middle line:84%
She will, once again,
regain balance.

00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:06.030 align:middle line:84%
But it's understanding your
connection with everything

00:57:06.030 --> 00:57:10.890 align:middle line:84%
and living in harmonious
balance with the whole.

00:57:10.890 --> 00:57:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And we always say
drama happens when

00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:17.700 align:middle line:84%
you're not paying attention
to get your attention.

00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:20.250 align:middle line:84%
So you are seeing more
and more extremes.

00:57:20.250 --> 00:57:23.070 align:middle line:84%
This is also expected as you
are raising and elevating

00:57:23.070 --> 00:57:24.690 align:middle line:90%
your consciousness.

00:57:24.690 --> 00:57:27.840 align:middle line:84%
The reason we say that is as
you start projecting and working

00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:29.880 align:middle line:84%
with higher frequencies,
anything that

00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:31.860 align:middle line:84%
is unlike that frequency
starts to come up,

00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:33.735 align:middle line:84%
so that it can be
integrated, so that you can

00:57:33.735 --> 00:57:35.650 align:middle line:90%
maintain that higher frequency.

00:57:35.650 --> 00:57:39.840 align:middle line:84%
So again, we'll take you
back to the idea of duality

00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:41.610 align:middle line:90%
where you have light and dark.

00:57:41.610 --> 00:57:46.660 align:middle line:84%
You have them in equal measure
in the dualistic paradigm.

00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:48.780 align:middle line:84%
So as you have
lighter frequencies,

00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:52.470 align:middle line:84%
you will also create some that
are even darker so that you

00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:53.925 align:middle line:90%
have that sort of balance.

00:57:53.925 --> 00:57:56.940 align:middle line:90%


00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And that is also in
part why you might

00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:00.960 align:middle line:84%
be seeing things progressing
and people waking up,

00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:03.270 align:middle line:84%
but you're also seeing
some really lower

00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:06.330 align:middle line:90%
vibrational behaviors going on.

00:58:06.330 --> 00:58:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And again, it just helps so
that the collective can see

00:58:10.770 --> 00:58:13.230 align:middle line:84%
and the collective
can make change.

00:58:13.230 --> 00:58:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And again, we direct you back
to your own personal life.

00:58:16.330 --> 00:58:18.150 align:middle line:84%
What is going on
in your life that

00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:21.030 align:middle line:84%
is drawing that scenario
to your attention?

00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:24.270 align:middle line:84%
We guarantee if something
is in your field,

00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:27.750 align:middle line:84%
even if it seems completely
unrelated to your life--

00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:30.930 align:middle line:84%
meaning you hear a
news story, something

00:58:30.930 --> 00:58:33.120 align:middle line:84%
that's going on in
Africa, or something

00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:34.452 align:middle line:90%
that's going on in Asia.

00:58:34.452 --> 00:58:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And you think,
well, I'm not really

00:58:35.910 --> 00:58:37.350 align:middle line:90%
over there creating that.

00:58:37.350 --> 00:58:39.600 align:middle line:84%
There is a part of you that
is in resonance, otherwise

00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:42.015 align:middle line:84%
that information would
not even cross your mind.

00:58:42.015 --> 00:58:43.140 align:middle line:90%
You wouldn't know about it.

00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:46.710 align:middle line:84%
So when you become conscious and
are really grounded and present

00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:48.400 align:middle line:84%
in the moment, you
can observe that.

00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:50.190 align:middle line:90%
Why have I brought that in?

00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:51.960 align:middle line:84%
If you're walking
down the street,

00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:55.380 align:middle line:84%
and there are all kinds of
things going on in the street,

00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:57.960 align:middle line:84%
but it may be that you're
aware of an argument going on.

00:58:57.960 --> 00:59:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, that is part
of your creation.

00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Because you are in
resonance with it.

00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:04.890 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise it would not be
in your field of perception

00:59:04.890 --> 00:59:06.060 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:09.330 align:middle line:84%
So there is something for you
to observe in that moment.

00:59:09.330 --> 00:59:13.230 align:middle line:84%
Where do I play out that
frequency in my now?

00:59:13.230 --> 00:59:16.380 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to know all
about past lives, future lives.

00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:18.000 align:middle line:90%
We often get asked that.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.110 align:middle line:84%
Am I integrating something
from a past life?

00:59:20.110 --> 00:59:20.910 align:middle line:90%
Is this karmic?

00:59:20.910 --> 00:59:22.110 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter.

00:59:22.110 --> 00:59:24.420 align:middle line:84%
You carry those
fields, those records

00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:26.100 align:middle line:90%
in your energetic field.

00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And as you have a vibrational
experience in the now moment,

00:59:29.490 --> 00:59:31.470 align:middle line:84%
if it is the same
frequency that you

00:59:31.470 --> 00:59:33.990 align:middle line:84%
have in a future or
past life, that lifetime

00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:35.770 align:middle line:90%
starts to vibrate.

00:59:35.770 --> 00:59:37.300 align:middle line:90%
So the amplitude goes up.

00:59:37.300 --> 00:59:40.560 align:middle line:90%
The volume goes up.

00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:42.750 align:middle line:90%
And it gets your attention.

00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:45.120 align:middle line:84%
So everything that
you think you've

00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:49.170 align:middle line:84%
done in a past life or a future
life, look to the now moment

00:59:49.170 --> 00:59:51.090 align:middle line:84%
and say, where am I
playing that out now?

00:59:51.090 --> 00:59:52.980 align:middle line:90%
And you can shift it now.

00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:56.690 align:middle line:84%
As you shift, clear,
and integrate now--

00:59:56.690 --> 01:00:00.660 align:middle line:84%
and what we mean by integrate
is release judgment.

01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:03.360 align:middle line:84%
As you drop your
judgment about it,

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:05.880 align:middle line:84%
you actually help to
heal that other lifetime.

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:08.640 align:middle line:84%
Because that information
gets sent out

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:10.680 align:middle line:84%
to that other aspect
of you who then

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:12.810 align:middle line:84%
has an opportunity,
if they wish,

01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:15.898 align:middle line:90%
to open and run that program.

01:00:15.898 --> 01:00:17.190 align:middle line:90%
Think about it like a computer.

01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:21.870 align:middle line:84%
It's like being sent an email
attachment that can be opened.

01:00:21.870 --> 01:00:23.370 align:middle line:84%
Or they can simply
save the file.

01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:25.190 align:middle line:84%
If they say, you know,
I feel like I want

01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:26.520 align:middle line:90%
to really focus here and now.

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:28.150 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
save that for later.

01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:29.733 align:middle line:84%
And if I can't get
it then, maybe I'll

01:00:29.733 --> 01:00:31.640 align:middle line:84%
go and access that
information later.

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:33.290 align:middle line:90%
But I want to try and do it now.

01:00:33.290 --> 01:00:34.220 align:middle line:90%
You all are very--

01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:38.200 align:middle line:90%


01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:43.300 align:middle line:84%
you all are very excited
and willing to really work

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:44.980 align:middle line:90%
through the puzzle on your own.

01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:48.400 align:middle line:84%
That's where your sense of
satisfaction often comes from.

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:51.900 align:middle line:84%
If somebody put all the
puzzle pieces in place,

01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:54.120 align:middle line:84%
it's not as exciting as
you get to figure it out.

01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:57.140 align:middle line:90%
The discovery for yourself.

01:00:57.140 --> 01:01:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Totally went not too far
off from where I was thinking.

01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:02.560 align:middle line:90%
But I think this--

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:07.210 align:middle line:84%
thank you, this information is
vital and important to kind of

01:01:07.210 --> 01:01:09.310 align:middle line:90%
set the groundwork.

01:01:09.310 --> 01:01:10.810 align:middle line:84%
So hopefully, in
the future we can

01:01:10.810 --> 01:01:13.360 align:middle line:90%
have some more conversations.

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully everybody else
can hear some of this stuff.

01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:19.840 align:middle line:90%
I think it's key to--

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we know that there
are many other questions.

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And there is a
distinct reason why

01:01:24.790 --> 01:01:30.520 align:middle line:84%
we choose to really talk about
time and multiple realities.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.950 align:middle line:84%
Because if you don't
understand that,

01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:34.790 align:middle line:84%
you're at a loss with
the other information.

01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:38.710 align:middle line:84%
You still get stuck in
victim-perpetrator mode.

01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:44.290 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we often break
it down and take you back.

01:01:44.290 --> 01:01:47.920 align:middle line:84%
So we wanted to make sure
that we included that,

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:50.290 align:middle line:84%
for no other purpose
than for you,

01:01:50.290 --> 01:01:54.370 align:middle line:84%
just to help remind you of
that as you move forward.

01:01:54.370 --> 01:01:57.430 align:middle line:84%
Truth-- when you ask
for history and you

01:01:57.430 --> 01:02:00.220 align:middle line:84%
ask what's gone on in
the universal or even

01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:03.790 align:middle line:84%
in the galactic game, it's
always based on perspective.

01:02:03.790 --> 01:02:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And history has been so
manipulated on your planet,

01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:11.260 align:middle line:84%
that for many of you, as you're
seeking your truth about what

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:14.900 align:middle line:84%
history is, you are not going
to find it outside of you.

01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:16.780 align:middle line:84%
You are going to
have to go inside

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:18.460 align:middle line:90%
to get the records for yourself.

01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:20.380 align:middle line:84%
And the records
will change based

01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:23.200 align:middle line:84%
on the frequencies that
you need and your level

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:24.430 align:middle line:90%
of comprehension.

01:02:24.430 --> 01:02:29.020 align:middle line:84%
Because some of
this, it involves

01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:31.660 align:middle line:90%
interdimensional relationships.

01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And for most of you,
you're in your little box.

01:02:36.430 --> 01:02:37.720 align:middle line:90%
And it's too much.

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And it will shatter the
version of your reality.

01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:42.280 align:middle line:84%
So you will take on a
story or a bit of history

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:44.230 align:middle line:90%
that you can digest.

01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:47.410 align:middle line:84%
It's the proverbial telling
a story to a kindergartner

01:02:47.410 --> 01:02:50.810 align:middle line:84%
and then giving the advanced
story to the PhD student.

01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:57.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's about your
own inner development.

01:02:57.070 --> 01:03:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And you got to go inside
to get that information

01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:02.710 align:middle line:84%
and take what resonates as
your own personal truth.

01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:04.060 align:middle line:90%
And that will change.

01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:11.450 align:middle line:84%
Many of you are afraid of
changing your mind to say,

01:03:11.450 --> 01:03:14.550 align:middle line:84%
well, you know, last week
this is what I thought.

01:03:14.550 --> 01:03:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And this week, I don't
think that anymore.

01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And you're afraid to talk
about it with other people.

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And this goes back many times
to past lives and persecution,

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:25.240 align:middle line:84%
or other lifetimes
and persecution.

01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:27.250 align:middle line:84%
But all of you are
growing and changing.

01:03:27.250 --> 01:03:29.028 align:middle line:84%
So your perception
of the truth is also

01:03:29.028 --> 01:03:30.070 align:middle line:90%
going to grow and change.

01:03:30.070 --> 01:03:32.370 align:middle line:84%
Your opinions and what you
think is real and not real

01:03:32.370 --> 01:03:33.370 align:middle line:90%
is also going to change.

01:03:33.370 --> 01:03:39.940 align:middle line:84%
But the mental component of you,
the traditional societal value

01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:42.580 align:middle line:84%
is that if you are changing
your mind all the time,

01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:43.510 align:middle line:90%
you're wishy-washy.

01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And you don't know what
you're talking about.

01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:46.240 align:middle line:90%
You're not grounded and rooted.

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:48.680 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, it is
your own evolution.

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:52.660 align:middle line:84%
So this is in part why many
of you won't talk about it.

01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:56.230 align:middle line:84%
Or if you do talk about
it, it's hard for you

01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:58.600 align:middle line:90%
to change so rapidly.

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:01.805 align:middle line:84%
Because you think, I don't
know what I'm speaking about.

01:04:01.805 --> 01:04:02.930 align:middle line:90%
Well, you do in the moment.

01:04:02.930 --> 01:04:05.290 align:middle line:90%
And that's all that matters.

01:04:05.290 --> 01:04:06.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:09.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you for
helping lay the groundwork.

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:11.170 align:middle line:90%
I think that's very important.

01:04:11.170 --> 01:04:13.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we're happy to
answer questions for you.

01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:16.840 align:middle line:90%
And we'll tell you this.

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:19.630 align:middle line:84%
If there's information that
you want outside of this film

01:04:19.630 --> 01:04:21.640 align:middle line:84%
session, we're
happy to supply you

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:22.990 align:middle line:90%
with that, to facilitate it.

01:04:22.990 --> 01:04:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Because you're going to bring a
new perspective to many people.

01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And we're very
excited about what

01:04:29.590 --> 01:04:33.370 align:middle line:84%
you have to offer in your
own point of service.

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:36.920 align:middle line:84%
You've got a huge
group to support you.

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:38.980 align:middle line:84%
So they're also
asking while we have

01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:40.630 align:middle line:84%
this opportunity that
we're telling you

01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:43.150 align:middle line:84%
that they are to be
of support to you.

01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:44.090 align:middle line:90%
Ask them for it.

01:04:44.090 --> 01:04:44.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:04:44.890 --> 01:04:48.440 align:middle line:84%
>> They're a huge resource for
you and for your own history,

01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:51.310 align:middle line:84%
your own bits and pieces of
information that you are going

01:04:51.310 --> 01:04:52.150 align:middle line:90%
to get.

01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And then from that, you will
formulate your questions

01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:56.710 align:middle line:90%
to get another perspective.

01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:59.260 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot that your own
group has to share with you--

01:04:59.260 --> 01:04:59.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>> --more than you
could possibly imagine.

01:05:01.790 --> 01:05:03.643 align:middle line:90%
And so it's just about--

01:05:03.643 --> 01:05:04.810 align:middle line:90%
it's like going to a friend.

01:05:04.810 --> 01:05:05.992 align:middle line:90%
Who's got the best opinion?

01:05:05.992 --> 01:05:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And some of them you'll
take, some of them you won't.

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:09.640 align:middle line:90%
Which ones are in resonance.

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:14.560 align:middle line:84%
But what's great about that is
that, for all of you, as you

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:18.160 align:middle line:84%
talk it out, you're
able to bring

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:23.950 align:middle line:84%
some of what seems very
ethereal into the denser reality

01:05:23.950 --> 01:05:25.530 align:middle line:90%
by speaking or writing.

01:05:25.530 --> 01:05:27.930 align:middle line:84%
This is often why we
suggest it for many of you.

01:05:27.930 --> 01:05:32.337 align:middle line:90%


01:05:32.337 --> 01:05:34.795 align:middle line:84%
So as you're talking about it,
whether it's with your guide

01:05:34.795 --> 01:05:36.870 align:middle line:84%
and you're writing it
out, or with a friend,

01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:41.630 align:middle line:84%
it can bring clarity and help
you to formulate new questions.

01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:45.700 align:middle line:84%
All right, so we're excited to
see what you create, dear one.

01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:46.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, thank you.

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for being
available to answer

01:05:50.970 --> 01:05:52.080 align:middle line:90%
these questions.

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:54.500 align:middle line:84%
Very important for
myself and whoever

01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:56.270 align:middle line:90%
is going to be watching this.

01:05:56.270 --> 01:05:57.310 align:middle line:90%
>> It's our pleasure.

01:05:57.310 --> 01:05:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:21.227 align:middle line:90%
