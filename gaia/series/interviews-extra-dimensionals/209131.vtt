>> When we understand our
connection with source,

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.980 align:middle line:84%
we actually are
light architects.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.780 align:middle line:84%
When we work in
resonance with the higher

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.990 align:middle line:84%
levels of consciousness, and
they invite the assistance,

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.380 align:middle line:84%
you can use consciousness
and your energies

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.710 align:middle line:84%
and work in unison,
and you can amplify

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.830 align:middle line:84%
what is there, which
may be inactive

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.990 align:middle line:84%
So it depends on
what level and depth

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.210 align:middle line:84%
that you're being
asked to assist

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:54.173 align:middle line:84%

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.180 align:middle line:84%
When we look at
the fractalization,

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.470 align:middle line:84%
we also look at the
sacred geometry,

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.540 align:middle line:84%
and we were looking at
those geometric forms,

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.480 align:middle line:84%
well, you can use all
of these to actually set

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.190 align:middle line:84%
connection lines to different
areas that need the attention.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have to
work in resonance

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.290 align:middle line:84%
and with the mother, the
great mother, or the higher

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.610 align:middle line:90%
levels of consciousness.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.590 align:middle line:84%
When they need something,
they'll tell you.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's when they give you
the actual extra assistance

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.200 align:middle line:84%
in setting these energy lines
for consciousness purpose.

>> The work you're doing with
others is I think so profound

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.820 align:middle line:84%
because you're helping everyone
find that super position,

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:41.620 align:middle line:90%
a sense, right?

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.290 align:middle line:84%
That's what essentially
what quantum navigation is.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:46.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.570 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:47.370 align:middle line:90%
>> It's to--

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Find it within you, because
everything is inside of you.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And unless you work
through the shadows,

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.230 align:middle line:84%
you can't get to that
soft zero point, right?

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.150 align:middle line:90%
When all the--

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And what we did the other
night with the meditations

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.250 align:middle line:90%
and then the--

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.092 align:middle line:84%
navigating the meditation
or explaining and working

00:05:06.092 --> 00:05:08.050 align:middle line:84%
through that and just
describing the archetypes

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:14.560 align:middle line:84%
and describing the challenges
through the meditations,

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.030 align:middle line:84%
you're able to help people
find their map, so to say.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So they can navigate the
quantum reality to then find

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.400 align:middle line:90%
their superposition.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.380 align:middle line:84%
So I'm finding the words for,
what is quantum navigation

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.380 align:middle line:90%
as we're doing this.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.300 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, oh, OK.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.113 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a really beautiful
point because what I found--

00:05:35.113 --> 00:05:37.030 align:middle line:84%
remember, I was talking
about the Daoist yoga.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:42.610 align:middle line:84%
There's a fine line between
mind and consciousness.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And we can't change ourselves
until we see ourselves

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.360 align:middle line:90%
differently.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.070 align:middle line:84%
So we've been contextualized to
be the mind and the character

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.930 align:middle line:90%
and the inner tyrant.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.060 align:middle line:84%
That's the one that really
checks your progress

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.700 align:middle line:84%
and keeps the thumb
on top of you.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:03.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, as you work through those
areas and start to move out

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.880 align:middle line:84%
and into the quantum
more, you usually

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:12.040 align:middle line:84%
find the Navigator as you go
through a lot of shadow work.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.420 align:middle line:84%
You find it through a lot
of deep inner challenges.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And as you get to this
place where you're really

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:24.640 align:middle line:84%
kind of-- like, in
yoga, you've got

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.490 align:middle line:84%
to pay attention to
that point where,

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.100 align:middle line:84%
like you're saving
your hair from fire

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.080 align:middle line:90%
or saving your head from fire.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.790 align:middle line:84%
You're paying that
much attention

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.810 align:middle line:84%
to going in deep
into meditation.

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And if you get to
that still point,

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.780 align:middle line:84%
then the Navigator can begin
to share because you're nice

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.150 align:middle line:90%
and still and quiet.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.780 align:middle line:84%
Then it wants to communicate,
it wants to help.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Navigator knows
it's like our singularity.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:02.230 align:middle line:84%
The job of the singularity
is to take what is rigid,

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:07.270 align:middle line:84%
what is material, and return it
to wave, right, separate wave

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.880 align:middle line:84%
and particle, but reduce
it down even into more.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's reducing entanglements
into superposition.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.250 align:middle line:90%
That's the job.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're talking about the
Navigator as if it's its own

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:21.550 align:middle line:90%
being or consciousness.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:29.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, I propose that a
black hole, the singularity,

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:33.220 align:middle line:90%
is consciousness itself.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.920 align:middle line:84%
So the singularity that's
in the center of our being,

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.040 align:middle line:84%
the center of our heart,
is a representative

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.430 align:middle line:84%
of knowing exactly--
and you have the side

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:45.640 align:middle line:90%
that draws everything in.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.440 align:middle line:84%
When it gets to
the singularity, it

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.520 align:middle line:84%
disassembles any architecture
and returns it back

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.490 align:middle line:84%
into superfluidity
or superposition.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And then it's free to
go out again and be

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:59.650 align:middle line:90%
everywhere and nowhere.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:02.650 align:middle line:90%
So the singularity is conscious.

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And so your Quantum
Navigator is trying

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:11.290 align:middle line:84%
to return your awareness
where we have these belief

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:14.500 align:middle line:84%
systems and these emotions
that are entangled,

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:20.770 align:middle line:84%
it's trying to show you
and give you shadow work

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:26.620 align:middle line:84%
to do by repeating it over
and over until you can see it

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:27.625 align:middle line:90%
in a different light.

00:08:27.625 --> 00:08:29.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Kind of see
through the illusion.

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:30.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:33.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:39.070 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like Morpheus giving Neo
the download so he knows Kung

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:42.700 align:middle line:84%
Fu and all these things,
so getting these codes,

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:46.810 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, to
navigate the matrix.

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:48.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:51.550 align:middle line:84%
So using your metaphor
of "The Matrix,"

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:54.740 align:middle line:84%
it's when Morpheus says to
Neo, stop trying to hit me

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:55.540 align:middle line:90%
and hit me.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, yeah.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:58.570 align:middle line:84%
>> You got to know
you are, right?

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:01.630 align:middle line:90%
So we're changing then.

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:04.720 align:middle line:10%
We're so contextualized
to being in this, right,

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.840 align:middle line:10%
it wants to return
us to the knowledge

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.910 align:middle line:10%
that we are the continuum.

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:15.430 align:middle line:84%
So it will use whatever
metaphor, whatever symbol,

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:21.580 align:middle line:90%
that's specifically your--

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.905 align:middle line:84%
it's familiar to
your inner landscape

00:09:23.905 --> 00:09:25.280 align:middle line:84%
so it'll communicate
in that way.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is sort of
like an archetype.

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:28.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And so the Navigator,
it always is

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:39.630 align:middle line:84%
pointing to the same thing, no
matter what it's trying to use.

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And it uses some amazing
metaphors, archetypes--

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:46.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Synchronicities.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, but it's all
pointing to the same thing.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.910 align:middle line:90%
We're not the character.

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:51.790 align:middle line:90%
We're the--

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:52.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Observer.

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:53.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.155 align:middle line:90%
>> And the character.

00:09:54.155 --> 00:09:56.370 align:middle line:84%
>> The Observer,
character, and the source.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And so, it's always trying
to point to that thing.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And it knows where you're
at, so it's giving you

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.380 align:middle line:90%
metaphors or lessons.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.990 align:middle line:10%
So when we go into the
experience and the meditation

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.900 align:middle line:10%
experience, and I have
the individual's journal.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:16.290 align:middle line:84%
Then when they come back, then
we take turns interpreting.

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:19.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll interpret
for them for a while,

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:27.060 align:middle line:84%
so that they can get a feel
for how their Navigator is

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:34.320 align:middle line:84%
trying to communicate these
quantum qualities that are you.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.160 align:middle line:84%
Like I said about the
egg, the cosmic egg.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.560 align:middle line:84%
When we're ready
to go out of 3D,

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.790 align:middle line:84%
then it starts disassembling
the boundaries.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And, eventually, you're in
the quantum, and it's dark.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we meet that
shaman's death, dark night

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:54.870 align:middle line:90%
of the soul.

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:57.180 align:middle line:90%
And I call it the fugue or the--

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.680 align:middle line:90%
and the crucible.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:04.620 align:middle line:84%
Because we burn away the
shadow issues, and our--

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:07.860 align:middle line:84%
the Navigator doesn't--
won't allow you to pull

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:11.370 align:middle line:84%
your attention away
into distraction.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:14.200 align:middle line:84%
When things hurt, you pay
more attention, right?

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.940 align:middle line:10%
>> So it's like when the pain
and suffering nearly equals

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:24.840 align:middle line:10%
the resistance you
have to awakening,

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:28.350 align:middle line:10%
then something can
change inside you.

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:31.230 align:middle line:10%
You can change from the
architecture of the character

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:35.180 align:middle line:10%
to the quantum being.

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:37.300 align:middle line:90%
So now we can make a difference.

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.260 align:middle line:84%
So in the group, that's
what I tried to do,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:44.510 align:middle line:84%
is just be a
steward for a while.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.750 align:middle line:84%
I asked people when
they're having--

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:48.000 align:middle line:90%
they've been around the block.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.460 align:middle line:90%
You can't get it all in one go.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.640 align:middle line:84%
If you read one book,
it's not going to help.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.950 align:middle line:90%
It's experiential.

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to
go through the fire.

00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:59.190 align:middle line:90%
It can't be here.

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:03.810 align:middle line:84%
It's got to be done in your
naked vulnerability and you

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:08.070 align:middle line:84%
facing the fire in the fugue
when you don't have a landscape

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:09.360 align:middle line:90%
anymore, and it doesn't--

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.160 align:middle line:90%
you don't know which end is up.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And all your issues
are right there.

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.710 align:middle line:84%
As you go through
that, the Navigator

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:24.570 align:middle line:84%
is always so
unconditionally loving.

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:29.940 align:middle line:84%
Never judges you, but shows
you directly in your language

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:34.680 align:middle line:90%
what you're stumbling over.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
try to interpret,

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.690 align:middle line:84%
but everybody gets
experience in interpreting

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:44.310 align:middle line:84%
all these different ways that
the Navigator is communicating.

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:46.470 align:middle line:84%
Until they get to
the point where

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:50.130 align:middle line:84%
they can start to
interpret for themselves.

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:52.740 align:middle line:84%
Then they've got
their own Navigator.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.680 align:middle line:84%
That's your real--
no matter what, you

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.840 align:middle line:90%
move into the infinite void.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.280 align:middle line:90%
How are you going to navigate?

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:03.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, first, you got to know
who and what you are, really.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.340 align:middle line:84%
You've got to know
where source is,

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:08.430 align:middle line:84%
and you got to know that
the Observer is always

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:11.460 align:middle line:84%
trying to communicate
through you, to you,

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:15.310 align:middle line:84%
and navigate you through
your experiences.

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:21.870 align:middle line:84%
>> So, in a sense, you're giving
people a language to understand

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:23.050 align:middle line:90%
their own language?

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:23.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So they can
understand themselves?

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:26.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>> So, as I mentioned before,
I do a lot of similar work with

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.070 align:middle line:84%
Marquette, who's
also in the show,

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:34.560 align:middle line:90%
and the dream council work.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:39.300 align:middle line:84%
Because we look at the
archetypes and the situations

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.440 align:middle line:90%
in our dream work.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.675 align:middle line:90%
These characters that are ours.

00:13:42.675 --> 00:13:45.790 align:middle line:84%
We're creating-- they're
mirrors of who we are.

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And then, we get to
interpret and discover

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.830 align:middle line:84%
different aspects
of ourselves that

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:59.700 align:middle line:84%
are telling us everything we
need to know every night when

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:00.940 align:middle line:90%
we go to bed.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.040 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.230 align:middle line:90%
>> That sounds so similar.

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:05.220 align:middle line:90%
>> It's very similar.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.220 align:middle line:90%
>> If it's done in that pure--

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:11.340 align:middle line:84%
in that understanding of
what pure consciousness

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:18.900 align:middle line:84%
is versus mind, and character,
and the inner tyrant.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Because those
are all filters?

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:26.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Those are all just filters
that are making those--

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:30.032 align:middle line:84%
the Navigator's job really
difficult. Because we're

00:14:30.032 --> 00:14:32.870 align:middle line:84%
>> We listen to the
other form the Navigator.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:36.975 align:middle line:84%
The Navigator, remember, has
that pre-context assistance

00:14:36.975 --> 00:14:37.850 align:middle line:90%
without interference.

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:39.680 align:middle line:84%
So when you're still,
I'll talk to you.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.160 align:middle line:84%
I'll share everything,
but you got to be so still

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.810 align:middle line:90%
and empty that teacup.

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:46.118 align:middle line:90%
Then they can fill it.

00:14:46.118 --> 00:14:48.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is something that
was said the other night.

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:53.240 align:middle line:84%
Lyssa had talked about the
language of the higher self

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.000 align:middle line:84%
like it's a metaphysical
buzzword now.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.927 align:middle line:90%
It's like, my inner self.

00:14:57.927 --> 00:14:59.760 align:middle line:84%
My inner self, my inner
self, my inner self.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:03.590 align:middle line:84%
But, in a sense, the higher
self is the quantum Navigator?

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:04.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:07.400 align:middle line:84%
>> In one way of looking
at what the higher self is.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And I loved how she explained
it, because it was so spot on.

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And if you took off a lot of
the overlay-- because everybody

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:26.880 align:middle line:84%
puts some form of overlay
on it and expectation on it.

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.990 align:middle line:84%
But what really
helps you clarify

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:34.100 align:middle line:84%
what the Navigator is,
or even a higher self,

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:38.130 align:middle line:84%
is the realization of who
and what you really are.

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And that comes over time
of many, many challenges

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:49.640 align:middle line:84%
and the defining between
consciousness and mind.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:53.270 align:middle line:84%
Mind won't define you
always in the character,

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:55.670 align:middle line:84%
whereas consciousness
will always

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:59.540 align:middle line:90%
return you to the beingness.

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:05.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's the one thing that
this work also points out,

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:09.690 align:middle line:84%
and you have to acknowledge--
which is why I think this work

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:10.490 align:middle line:90%
is so advanced.

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:15.080 align:middle line:84%
Is there's not a single
language, universal--

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.320 align:middle line:90%
the universal language is that.

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:21.470 align:middle line:84%
Is that everyone's
language is different.

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:23.900 align:middle line:84%
The saying that I keep going
in, especially recently

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:27.140 align:middle line:84%
and keep going back to, is
the unity and diversity.

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Which is what the
Indigenous say, the ET say,

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:37.010 align:middle line:84%
is the common language
that we all have is

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:38.340 align:middle line:90%
that we're all different.

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And if we can just respect
that we're all different,

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:45.770 align:middle line:84%
and understand that, that's the
one thing that unifies us all.

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, what it
sounds like with this quantum

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:54.800 align:middle line:84%
navigation technique
and work is you're

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.590 align:middle line:84%
letting everybody have
their own language

00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:00.950 align:middle line:84%
to define their
reality and their way.

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:03.770 align:middle line:90%
And that's unifying all of this.

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:05.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.530 align:middle line:90%
Well said.

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:11.700 align:middle line:84%
The quantum Navigator
speaks in universal terms.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:15.589 align:middle line:84%
And so, as you get
a little familiar,

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:18.290 align:middle line:84%
you go around the circle
a number of times.

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:21.079 align:middle line:84%
And like a spiral,
you begin to see

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:29.040 align:middle line:84%
from a much greater overview,
a much expanded view of it.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing that's
common through all of it

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:39.890 align:middle line:84%
is understanding that that
singularity, its main job

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:43.730 align:middle line:84%
is to take what
has been formulated

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:45.980 align:middle line:90%
and move it back into fluidity.

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:49.500 align:middle line:90%
And we are literally everything.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And so, if you understand
those elements,

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:55.910 align:middle line:84%
then you can see how
the language is speaking

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:59.870 align:middle line:84%
universally but in
those archetypal means,

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:04.590 align:middle line:84%
or those hieroglyphic means,
or however it's coming.

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And so, it's fascinating to see
the language of each person's

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.440 align:middle line:84%
quantum Navigator
trying to communicate.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:20.405 align:middle line:84%
Because the one thing that's
really universal is it's--

00:18:20.405 --> 00:18:23.180 align:middle line:90%
and it's patient beyond measure.

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:30.500 align:middle line:10%
But it's wanting us to go
deeper into our unconsciousness.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:35.030 align:middle line:84%
As we go deeper into our shadows
and into our own consciousness,

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.670 align:middle line:84%
then it brightens
everything else up.

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:42.620 align:middle line:10%
Anything that moves inside
of that darkness lights up.

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it OK to take a break?

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:49.190 align:middle line:84%
Not from the interview,
but from the shadow work?

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Can there be a place where you
can just hover and say, OK.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.755 align:middle line:90%
Because it can be--

00:18:57.755 --> 00:18:58.610 align:middle line:90%
it's challenging.

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:02.990 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot of work to face
your demons all the time.

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:04.580 align:middle line:90%
And they're unlimited.

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:06.260 align:middle line:90%
The demons are unlimited.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:10.610 align:middle line:84%
They're never going to end
until we go out of our bodies,

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:15.620 align:middle line:84%
but I guess what I'm asking
is, do you ever get tired?

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:18.740 align:middle line:90%
And do you just take a break?

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:20.780 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:25.160 align:middle line:84%
There's times when you
don't know how you're

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.380 align:middle line:90%
going to make it the next day.

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And part of this
work is showing you

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:38.790 align:middle line:84%
beyond where-- it's almost like
the work of the horse dance.

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:41.520 align:middle line:84%
To go beyond the mind,
get beyond the emotions,

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:46.290 align:middle line:90%
and beyond the body.

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:47.910 align:middle line:90%
And the limitations of the body.

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And there, you
find the true self.

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:56.910 align:middle line:84%
But, at any moment,
there's infinite patience.

00:19:56.910 --> 00:20:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's no
pressure to do it?

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>> The only pressure there is
is coming from the inner tyrant.

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:11.730 align:middle line:84%
>> The inner whip cracker
of yourself saying,

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:13.350 align:middle line:90%
go face those demons.

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:18.390 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's part of
the disassembly process,

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:23.260 align:middle line:84%
is finding out that architecture
that our inner tyrant has over

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:24.060 align:middle line:90%
us.

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:27.090 align:middle line:10%
That keeps us on the hamster
wheel of duty, obligation,

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:30.060 align:middle line:10%
self-sacrifice.

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:33.090 align:middle line:84%
We'll sacrifice ourselves
for what reason?

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:34.980 align:middle line:90%
Who's talking to you?

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Understand what voice that
is that's coming to you.

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:39.490 align:middle line:10%
But this is a process.

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:44.280 align:middle line:10%
This is a long process of
really looking at ourselves

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.080 align:middle line:10%
in such depth and clarity.

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's so great to have
that finesse of seeing

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:53.280 align:middle line:90%
mind and consciousness.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:57.240 align:middle line:84%
When you move into them and
have access to consciousness,

00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:02.790 align:middle line:84%
then you can see where you're
pushing all the buttons,

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:08.640 align:middle line:84%
and you're repeating voices that
you've been Pavlovianly trained

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:14.640 align:middle line:84%
through all of life's dynamics
in this lifetime or another.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.350 align:middle line:84%
That's part of the
process, and that's

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:18.630 align:middle line:84%
what gives us our
deep compassion,

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:21.510 align:middle line:90%
is when we face those things.

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:26.280 align:middle line:90%
We feel in every one the very--

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.510 align:middle line:90%
we're fractals.

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:29.610 align:middle line:90%
Everyone has the same wounds.

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:31.920 align:middle line:84%
They contextualize
it differently,

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:35.580 align:middle line:84%
but our compassion,
and our understanding,

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:39.240 align:middle line:84%
and appreciation
grows to such a degree

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:43.500 align:middle line:90%
that you just have respect.

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And then, you start to have
that patience that the quantum

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:52.140 align:middle line:90%
has, because you understand it.

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:57.010 align:middle line:84%
>> You don't push anybody to
go do this and go do that.

00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:58.740 align:middle line:90%
You don't become a tyrant.

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:02.100 align:middle line:84%
>> You recognize that everybody
has their own process,

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:05.115 align:middle line:90%
and that it's all this divine--

00:22:05.115 --> 00:22:06.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Can I insert something?

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:07.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:11.488 align:middle line:10%
>> Just I don't know why I'm
getting yelled at to talk

00:22:11.488 --> 00:22:14.030 align:middle line:10%
for you to mention this about
what you're just talking about.

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:15.450 align:middle line:10%
>> We need to do--

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:17.070 align:middle line:10%
She's fine.

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:20.570 align:middle line:10%
>> But we have to remember,
we're not the doer in this.

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:23.210 align:middle line:84%
So there are times where
we might have the shovel,

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:24.860 align:middle line:90%
and we're trying to dig into it.

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
there, because the QN

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:31.055 align:middle line:90%
knows it's a waveform.

00:22:31.055 --> 00:22:32.660 align:middle line:90%
So there are times-- right?

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:34.010 align:middle line:90%
So you should talk about that.

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:35.465 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yes.

00:22:35.465 --> 00:22:40.860 align:middle line:84%
You can get obsessive about any
shadow, like the typical male.

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:42.110 align:middle line:90%
I want to get it all done now.

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yes.

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:44.930 align:middle line:90%
That's what I was thinking.

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:52.370 align:middle line:84%
That's why I said that, was
because someone like me who's

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:55.790 align:middle line:84%
obsessive compulsive
in many ways

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:58.250 align:middle line:84%
would want to get those demons
out until there's no demons

00:22:58.250 --> 00:22:59.050 align:middle line:90%
left.

00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And I want to ascend to
the highest plane possible

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:07.520 align:middle line:84%
in this lifetime
tomorrow or tonight.

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.363 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm on it.

00:23:09.363 --> 00:23:11.030 align:middle line:84%
>> We're going to go
meditate right now.

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:13.803 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go leave the
body and go to the next one too.

00:23:13.803 --> 00:23:14.720 align:middle line:90%
>> And then, I'm free.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.595 align:middle line:90%
>> And then I'm free.

00:23:15.595 --> 00:23:19.707 align:middle line:90%


00:23:19.707 --> 00:23:21.290 align:middle line:84%
That's what I meant
by taking a break,

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:24.380 align:middle line:84%
because I know
there's people like me

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:29.630 align:middle line:84%
out there watching this that
are going to quit navigation.

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:32.030 align:middle line:90%
Come on, run!

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:34.040 align:middle line:90%
I need it now.

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:36.355 align:middle line:90%
I need to ascend tomorrow.

00:23:36.355 --> 00:23:37.230 align:middle line:90%
Let's make it happen.

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:38.330 align:middle line:84%
>> I've got a
schedule, you know.

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:39.288 align:middle line:90%
>> I've got a schedule.

00:23:39.288 --> 00:23:43.640 align:middle line:90%
I need enlightenment yesterday.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Because there are
those archetypes there,

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:49.940 align:middle line:90%
we would just--

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:52.130 align:middle line:84%
and then, we'd
burn ourselves out.

00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:53.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:57.260 align:middle line:90%
Not only that, but we--

00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:01.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm male, so I have a
little of that, also.

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:05.510 align:middle line:84%
I have a little Virgo in
there even though I'm Pisces.

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:12.530 align:middle line:84%
But I understand that
wanting to dive right in

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:15.470 align:middle line:84%
and just keep going
until you finish it all.

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:21.380 align:middle line:84%
But, again, we're
looking at our ability

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:26.210 align:middle line:84%
to move to the quantum, past
the mind into the quantum.

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:29.030 align:middle line:84%
In the quantum, that's
where you dump the teacup.

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And when you can dump the
teacup of all your concerns,

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:35.930 align:middle line:84%
and you're sitting
fulfilled, you

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:39.620 align:middle line:84%
can then begin to
determine, am I

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:45.770 align:middle line:84%
getting overly-obsessed
with going and tracking it?

00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, the quantum
Navigator knows when

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:52.550 align:middle line:84%
you need rest, so,
sometimes, it'll there

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:55.250 align:middle line:90%
and shows you the whiz bang.

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:57.320 align:middle line:90%
And it is delicious.

00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:02.951 align:middle line:84%
And then, it gives you time
to work on those things.

00:25:02.951 --> 00:25:08.370 align:middle line:84%
You may just go into the inner
darkness, but when it's dark,

00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:13.100 align:middle line:84%
you put your attention on
feeling deeper, broader,

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:14.900 align:middle line:90%
getting more naked.

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And taking in the quantum and
revitalizing, resuscitating,

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:26.210 align:middle line:84%
and rebalancing yourself from
that quantum perspective.

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And you feel whole, balanced,
and clear, and clean.

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:34.220 align:middle line:90%
When it's ready, it comes.

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:36.540 align:middle line:84%
Because if you go into
the quantum going,

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:39.020 align:middle line:90%
hey, I want to work on this.

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:41.090 align:middle line:90%
Assistance without interference.

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:42.770 align:middle line:90%
You're not still.

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Assistance
without interference.

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:47.840 align:middle line:90%
>> On your own stuff, too.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Working on you has to
be that still place.

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:55.730 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes, we need
a lot of revitalization,

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:57.380 align:middle line:10%
and they're putting--

00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:00.680 align:middle line:10%
they're getting ready to give
you another piece of the puzzle

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:04.580 align:middle line:10%
to show yourself, and you
need what they've given you

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:07.130 align:middle line:10%
processing inside
of you, letting

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:12.560 align:middle line:10%
it ground deep inside you, to
be ready for when they give you

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:16.670 align:middle line:10%
the next piece that adjoins
the previous pieces.

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And it expands the view of
what you need to work on.

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:26.090 align:middle line:84%
So there are those times
when you just need to rest.

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:28.920 align:middle line:84%
>> So in a sense, even if
you wanted to do the work,

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.380 align:middle line:90%
you have to--

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:32.510 align:middle line:90%
it does its own work.

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:34.060 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's teaching us.

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:34.860 align:middle line:90%
Let go.

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:36.390 align:middle line:90%
Let go.

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:39.530 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're
chasing your problems,

00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:41.480 align:middle line:90%
what are you creating?

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:45.993 align:middle line:84%
In a quantum system, what
you propagate populates.

00:26:45.993 --> 00:26:48.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're just going to
create more problems that maybe

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:49.830 align:middle line:90%
don't even need to be worked on.

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:50.630 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:51.830 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:53.690 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense,
the Wim Hof method

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:58.820 align:middle line:84%
has been really helpful for
me in that sense, because--

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:01.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I love that man
and that system.

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Because you can't force it.

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:09.560 align:middle line:10%
You have to gently expose
yourself to the cold.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:10.910 align:middle line:10%
I guess you could.

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:14.360 align:middle line:10%
And I did it, and I
ended up getting sick.

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:17.180 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't until
I just really tuned

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:18.880 align:middle line:90%
in and did a little bit here.

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.630 align:middle line:84%
Then you add another
minute, and then, you

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:22.700 align:middle line:84%
add another minute
or 30 seconds.

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And then, you
slowly add the cold

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:30.410 align:middle line:84%
as your body can take
it without forcing it.

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And then, eventually, over a
period of-- for me, months.

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:37.700 align:middle line:84%
It took months before I could
go for a cold dip in the lake.

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:40.440 align:middle line:84%
But I got there, and
it was like, oh, wow.

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.240 align:middle line:90%
You can do this.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.280 align:middle line:90%
But it is that you can't--

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:47.930 align:middle line:84%
it's finding that it's really
tuning into your body to find

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:51.530 align:middle line:90%
where that push pull is.

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Where you can't just
dive into the cold,

00:27:55.880 --> 00:28:01.160 align:middle line:84%
or there's some bad
things that'll happen.

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:04.340 align:middle line:84%
Like catching a cold, or you
could get hypothermia and die,

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:06.290 align:middle line:90%
I guess, on the worst case.

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:08.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And with the work
with the quantum,

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:12.770 align:middle line:84%
it's constantly sending you into
your darkness without a map,

00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:15.590 align:middle line:90%
without a reference point.

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:17.660 align:middle line:90%
And it feels like no gravity.

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And that feels like the fugue
shaman's death or dark night

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:27.050 align:middle line:84%
of the soul, and the crucible
is constantly burning edges.

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:30.920 align:middle line:84%
So how long can
you stay in that?

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:34.190 align:middle line:90%
And that's our measure.

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:40.280 align:middle line:84%
It's testing our mettle because,
in truth, we are consciousness.

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:43.880 align:middle line:84%
So, eventually,
you're like Daniel.

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:46.050 align:middle line:84%
You can stand in the
middle of the fire,

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:48.200 align:middle line:90%
and it's not burning you.

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:49.520 align:middle line:90%
A biblical reference.

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:56.540 align:middle line:84%
But the quantum is getting
you used to its forces

00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:59.720 align:middle line:84%
until you transform
even those forces.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:02.330 align:middle line:84%
Then it starts showing
you how to see.

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:07.250 align:middle line:84%
It takes non-duality
to see in the dark.

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Darkness is polarized,
because we polarize it.

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:16.130 align:middle line:84%
But if we find
non-duality, and that

00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:20.450 align:middle line:84%
takes a lot of fuguing
before you let go of it

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:23.700 align:middle line:84%
and allow non-duality
to come back together.

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:26.540 align:middle line:84%
Then you get the
diamond clarity.

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:29.990 align:middle line:90%
So you can see in there.

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>> When you said, diamond
clarity, what does that mean?

00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:37.040 align:middle line:84%
The shape of the diamond, or
just clear like a diamond?

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's use the
reference of crystals.

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:42.500 align:middle line:90%
Crystals, quartz crystals.

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:46.070 align:middle line:84%
One of their unique properties
is they can take sunlight,

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:50.900 align:middle line:84%
and whatever is missing within
any of the bands, the frequency

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:54.260 align:middle line:90%
bands, it likes to homogenize.

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:59.180 align:middle line:84%
So it likes to balance light, so
that all the spectrum is equal.

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And then, in a crystal, it
cannot work with infrared

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.970 align:middle line:90%
or ultraviolet.

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:11.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we take a
diamond, in a diamond,

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:13.820 align:middle line:84%
it can take infrared
and ultraviolet,

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:16.070 align:middle line:90%
but it has a unique quality.

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:22.730 align:middle line:84%
Because under the constants of
maximum pressure and maximum

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:26.630 align:middle line:84%
heat, it has forced
all of the electrons

00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:29.280 align:middle line:90%
to move into ultimate alignment.

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:31.910 align:middle line:84%
So there's ultimate
transparency.

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:37.040 align:middle line:84%
So a diamond no longer
polarizes light.

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:41.210 align:middle line:90%
So it's a great metaphor then.

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Going into our darkness
and integrating,

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:48.560 align:middle line:90%
we move into a diamond level.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:51.110 align:middle line:90%
Diamond is non-dualistic.

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:59.120 align:middle line:84%
So it can see both are equal,
polarized spectrum light

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:01.280 align:middle line:90%
and darkness.

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:04.100 align:middle line:84%
They're both equal, and
when we can see that,

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:08.810 align:middle line:84%
we no longer project
anything on either.

00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:10.700 align:middle line:84%
Then, we move into
a non-duality.

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:13.520 align:middle line:90%
Same with looking at ourself.

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:17.570 align:middle line:84%
Our own issues,
our own shadows, we

00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:23.120 align:middle line:84%
have used like a patchwork
quilt of history, identity,

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.460 align:middle line:90%
and personality.

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:25.260 align:middle line:90%
This is good.

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:26.900 align:middle line:84%
This is bad, but
we've stitched them

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:30.860 align:middle line:84%
all together to make up
this history, identity,

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:32.210 align:middle line:90%
and personality.

00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And so, we're good
and bad, and we're

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:38.150 align:middle line:84%
trying to fix and fill all
of those vacant spots where

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:40.580 align:middle line:84%
we see that we're not
quite good enough.

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:44.540 align:middle line:84%
But when you see
the true you, then

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:47.585 align:middle line:84%
you accept all those
patchwork quilts and go, no.

00:31:47.585 --> 00:31:48.710 align:middle line:90%
>> It's just all one quilt.

00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:54.560 align:middle line:84%
>> It's all one, yes, and you
accept all of those shadow

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:58.190 align:middle line:84%
traumas, dramas, pains,
chains, and all those things.

00:31:58.190 --> 00:32:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And they come back
into the non-duality.

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:06.380 align:middle line:84%
So they've finished
their polarization,

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:09.800 align:middle line:84%
because your consciousness
has moved through that

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:12.260 align:middle line:90%
filtering into accepting all.

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:15.335 align:middle line:90%
So you see clearly.

00:32:15.335 --> 00:32:17.240 align:middle line:90%
That's diamond consciousness.

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:20.510 align:middle line:84%
The center of our singularity
is the very same thing.

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:22.115 align:middle line:90%
It is a diamond.

00:32:22.115 --> 00:32:26.930 align:middle line:84%
They have the metaphor
of the eye of the needle.

00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:29.540 align:middle line:84%
The eye of the
needle is so small,

00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:33.200 align:middle line:84%
and it takes non-dualistic
consciousness

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.510 align:middle line:90%
to sit in the center of that.

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:40.190 align:middle line:10%
And you've seen
the geometric form

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:43.920 align:middle line:10%
of the Christ consciousness
grid holding all the other grids

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:44.720 align:middle line:10%
within it.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And the diamond rays coming out
from the center, the diamond

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:52.640 align:middle line:84%
diagonals, represent
the connecting point

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.680 align:middle line:90%
we have with all things.

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:57.530 align:middle line:84%
It's diamond consciousness,
seeing clearly.

00:32:57.530 --> 00:32:59.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:00.698 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:33:00.698 --> 00:33:01.865 align:middle line:90%
So where do we go from here?

00:33:01.865 --> 00:33:06.950 align:middle line:90%


00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:09.650 align:middle line:84%
I guess we'll just keep
doing the work, right?

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And we keep relaxing,
and relaxing into it,

00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:17.840 align:middle line:90%
and releasing--

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:21.830 align:middle line:84%
becoming transparent and
releasing our attachment

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:23.816 align:middle line:90%
to duality.

00:33:23.816 --> 00:33:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And recognizing the shadow as a
tool to get us to these higher

00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:30.260 align:middle line:90%
states.

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:35.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And then, by having
those frequent journeys

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:40.490 align:middle line:84%
into the quantum, you're
rebalancing, reevaluating,

00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:42.270 align:middle line:90%
revitalizing yourself.

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:45.740 align:middle line:84%
So there comes a point
when the quantum, which

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:49.550 align:middle line:84%
is infinitely conscious,
it comes through you.

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:50.930 align:middle line:90%
And it goes, hey, look.

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:52.770 align:middle line:90%
I got a job for you.

00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And so, it sets almost
like a quantum bridge,

00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:58.760 align:middle line:90%
and it puts it out to you.

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:02.820 align:middle line:84%
Hey, here's the next
thing for your journey.

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:05.390 align:middle line:84%
But when you get it
from the quantum,

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:08.600 align:middle line:84%
you know that that bridge,
and opening that door,

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.429 align:middle line:84%
and moving into
that new reality is

00:34:10.429 --> 00:34:12.409 align:middle line:84%
going to be filled
with all the things

00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:16.940 align:middle line:84%
that are just right for
you to challenge yourself

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:18.320 align:middle line:90%
in all the ways you need.

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Almost like a
pregnant mother has

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.199 align:middle line:84%
to go through so
much birthing pains

00:34:24.199 --> 00:34:26.030 align:middle line:84%
to get ready for the
new consciousness

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:28.489 align:middle line:90%
that it's about to birth.

00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:30.920 align:middle line:10%
So the quantum
does the same thing

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:34.610 align:middle line:10%
by offering us these new
ventures in our life.

00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:38.510 align:middle line:10%
Something new, something
different, something unknown.

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a little scary,
because you can't

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:42.989 align:middle line:90%
predict what's going to happen.

00:34:42.989 --> 00:34:46.340 align:middle line:84%
You have to walk into
that new paradigm.

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:47.929 align:middle line:84%
>> Like going after
crystal skulls?

00:34:47.929 --> 00:34:49.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes, yes.

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:52.920 align:middle line:84%
You have such an
interesting life.

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:57.740 align:middle line:84%
I love your stories and
the people you work with.

00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:02.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for helping give
me a map to navigate this crazy

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:03.620 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:06.620 align:middle line:90%
It's so much fun to have.

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:10.220 align:middle line:84%
If I didn't have
the map, I don't

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:14.810 align:middle line:84%
think I'd be brave
enough to go through it.

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:16.940 align:middle line:90%
So it's fun.

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:18.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let's
journey some more,

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:23.840 align:middle line:84%
and go to some power spots,
and read some sacred geometry,

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:28.610 align:middle line:84%
and tie more things
together with all of this.

00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:31.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:36.130 align:middle line:84%
So for the layman,
the other day,

00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:39.280 align:middle line:84%
we were at a quantum
navigation session.

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And we'll show some
elements of that,

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:45.693 align:middle line:84%
but there was a
lot to it to show--

00:35:45.693 --> 00:35:47.110 align:middle line:84%
I can't just show
the whole thing,

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:49.690 align:middle line:84%
because it was a four
or five hour session

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:51.970 align:middle line:84%
when we're all said
and done with it.

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Could you just walk us
through the process?

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And then, perhaps,
give some tips

00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:02.740 align:middle line:84%
for people who may not be able
to come to a session in-person

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:04.510 align:middle line:90%
or access you right away?

00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:09.170 align:middle line:84%
What are some things that people
can do some quantum navigation

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:09.970 align:middle line:90%
at home?

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what would really help
is if a small group of very

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:21.760 align:middle line:84%
dedicated individuals got
together that could really be

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:27.590 align:middle line:84%
vulnerable, and you could
communicate on shadow issues

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:28.390 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:32.140 align:middle line:84%
You can expose your wounds
and your shadows together.

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And you know, and you
trust that you're going

00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:38.200 align:middle line:90%
to be supportive of sharing it.

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:44.960 align:middle line:84%
So, in the beginning of
our evening sessions,

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:49.600 align:middle line:84%
the first thing we try
to do is try to find out

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.670 align:middle line:90%
what repeating issues--

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:53.710 align:middle line:90%
and we meet once a week.

00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:56.290 align:middle line:84%
So we try to find out
what repeating issues have

00:36:56.290 --> 00:36:59.590 align:middle line:84%
you noticed coming
up that bother you?

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:00.520 align:middle line:90%
>> From that week?

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:01.460 align:middle line:90%
>> From that week.

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:02.260 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:05.590 align:middle line:84%
If nothing from that week,
then select or pick a few.

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:07.480 align:middle line:90%
We all share.

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:09.850 align:middle line:84%
>> We've got many
weeks to choose from.

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:10.810 align:middle line:90%
Many issues.

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:12.230 align:middle line:90%
Many weeks of issues.

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:13.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Take me.

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:17.860 align:middle line:90%


00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:19.990 align:middle line:84%
So we start off with that,
sharing those issues.

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:23.712 align:middle line:84%
That gets everybody
onto the same plane.

00:37:23.712 --> 00:37:25.170 align:middle line:84%
>> The vulnerable
plane in a sense?

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:26.935 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, vulnerable plane.

00:37:26.935 --> 00:37:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And that really
sets the groundwork

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:32.320 align:middle line:90%
for doing the meditation work.

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:36.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, I found
particular music that

00:37:36.850 --> 00:37:40.630 align:middle line:84%
helps me move into
that quantum state.

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:44.470 align:middle line:84%
But I've practiced
quite a bit, so let

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:48.250 align:middle line:90%
me give you a few little tips.

00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:51.040 align:middle line:90%
For the, let's say, new person.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:53.558 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're even
new to meditation.

00:37:53.558 --> 00:37:55.600 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you want to
make yourself comfortable.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:00.250 align:middle line:84%
You want to be in
an upright position,

00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:03.850 align:middle line:90%
spine supported and such.

00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And work with this
gently, but begin

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:09.670 align:middle line:90%
to notice rhythmic breathing.

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:13.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, everybody
has their cadence,

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:17.170 align:middle line:84%
so it's good to start
off with a five second--

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:19.750 align:middle line:84%
if this is new to you.
--five second inhale,

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:20.980 align:middle line:90%
five second exhale.

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:23.500 align:middle line:84%
But you want to work
and get it longer,

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:24.760 align:middle line:90%
but you don't want to force.

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:27.550 align:middle line:90%
Never force your breathing.

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:31.210 align:middle line:84%
The reason why you want
to go to eight seconds--

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:33.310 align:middle line:84%
ultimately, you want to
get to an eight seconds,

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:35.680 align:middle line:84%
because the whole
body dynamics works

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.210 align:middle line:90%
on an eight second rhythm.

00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And as you move to the eight
second rhythm nice and low,

00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:43.930 align:middle line:84%
deep down into the
belly breathing,

00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:54.840 align:middle line:84%
it will help then bring the
mind from the dissonance

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:58.410 align:middle line:84%
of the day, the beta
level of consciousness.

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:01.200 align:middle line:84%
By watching that breathing,
getting familiar with it,

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.030 align:middle line:90%
you'll--

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:04.590 align:middle line:84%
at first, it'll be--
the mind will want

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:06.100 align:middle line:90%
to track all over the place.

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:07.860 align:middle line:90%
But you keep inviting it.

00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:08.990 align:middle line:90%
You don't force the mind.

00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:11.370 align:middle line:84%
You just invite it
back to the breathing,

00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:13.270 align:middle line:84%
help the mind stay
on the breathing.

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:17.250 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, when you
relax into the breathing,

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:20.530 align:middle line:84%
then you start to
move out of beta.

00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And you start to notice a
little more coherent energy,

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:26.670 align:middle line:84%
a little more integrated
energy in its alpha.

00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:29.430 align:middle line:84%
Move into the alpha
brainwave states and so on.

00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:32.650 align:middle line:84%
It'll help move you
deeper and deeper.

00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:35.550 align:middle line:90%
So those are doing.

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:38.490 align:middle line:90%
Those are doing processes.

00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And I can give you a list,
and we can place this out

00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:45.210 align:middle line:90%
for those that are interested.

00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:47.370 align:middle line:90%
My wife made this up.

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:53.040 align:middle line:10%
It's really a detailed
list of the steps of moving

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:57.000 align:middle line:10%
from the doer to not doing.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.600 align:middle line:10%
So you want to get so
relaxed in the breathing

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:03.630 align:middle line:10%
that you start to notice
the brainwave changes,

00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:08.040 align:middle line:10%
and you start to move
eventually into not doing.

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:12.770 align:middle line:10%
So from the not doing
stage, this is--

00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:16.770 align:middle line:10%
I took quite a number of
years of doing horse dance

00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:20.880 align:middle line:10%
training to find the
point between the mind

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.860 align:middle line:10%
and the consciousness.

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:25.440 align:middle line:84%
When you go beyond the
mind, beyond the emotions,

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:28.080 align:middle line:84%
there, you'll find
the true self.

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:32.280 align:middle line:84%
So you can do that
if you understand

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:37.620 align:middle line:84%
moving from the doing state
and moving into the beingness

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:39.060 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:42.240 align:middle line:84%
So as you're into
the not doing state,

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:45.150 align:middle line:84%
is you allow your breathing
to move deeper into that.

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:51.460 align:middle line:84%
You get into that not doing
state and just abide there.

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:55.350 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the
stillness like a pond.

00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:58.050 align:middle line:84%
You want the pond and
all the eddy currents

00:40:58.050 --> 00:40:59.670 align:middle line:90%
to come to complete stillness.

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:01.327 align:middle line:90%
So all the turbidity--

00:41:01.327 --> 00:41:02.910 align:middle line:84%
it's a good metaphor
for all the stuff

00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:04.230 align:middle line:90%
in the mind and the emotions.

00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:05.190 align:middle line:90%
--to drop.

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:08.550 align:middle line:84%
When they drop, then you
have a different sense.

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:11.850 align:middle line:84%
That allows you to move into
a heightened sense, where

00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:13.620 align:middle line:90%
you begin to look at--

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:16.740 align:middle line:84%
You can sense
yourself in the chair,

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:22.080 align:middle line:84%
and you can begin to see
yourself, observe yourself.

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:27.720 align:middle line:84%
So this process of moving
from doing to not doing

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:30.690 align:middle line:90%
is essential in the stilling.

00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:34.740 align:middle line:90%
Then abiding in that stilling.

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:39.600 align:middle line:84%
Soon, as you practice-- this
may not happen the first time.

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:43.770 align:middle line:84%
But as you keep going
back there, at some point,

00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:48.240 align:middle line:84%
you begin to hear something
communicating to you.

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Or it'll give you
a vision, or it'll

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:55.920 align:middle line:84%
give you a feeling that's
a heightened sense.

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
beginning of the process

00:41:57.810 --> 00:42:00.690 align:middle line:90%
of learning to tap into that.

00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:01.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Reach the quantum?

00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:02.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:06.660 align:middle line:84%
To reach the quantum to move
into the access of the quantum

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:07.890 align:middle line:90%
Navigator.

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And then, many of the
folks there the other night,

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:16.500 align:middle line:84%
they had these almost
like a dream in a sense.

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Visions and sensations that,
then, they shared after that.

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:30.280 align:middle line:84%
And then, from there, what can
you go-- what happens next?

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, as you go
into meditation,

00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:35.490 align:middle line:84%
choosing your favorite music
that helps you move into that

00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:39.960 align:middle line:84%
very still state and abide
there at least for 30 minutes

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:41.730 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning.

00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:43.290 align:middle line:84%
If you can get to
that point, where

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:49.800 align:middle line:84%
you can stay in that
abiding state of not doing,

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:50.760 align:middle line:90%
this is where--

00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's especially
if you have someone

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:58.210 align:middle line:84%
that has had the experience
of the quantum Navigator.

00:42:58.210 --> 00:43:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And there's books
written on this

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:04.380 align:middle line:84%
that it transfers
in the silence.

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And so, it begins
to communicate to--

00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:13.050 align:middle line:84%
it's your Navigator, but it
spawns the communication.

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:13.920 align:middle line:90%
It makes it faster.

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:15.420 align:middle line:84%
That's why I say,
working in a group

00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:21.998 align:middle line:84%
is really a quicker way of
accessing your own Navigator.

00:43:21.998 --> 00:43:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm a little confused
when you say that.

00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:31.320 align:middle line:84%
So the quantum Navigator
in a group sense

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:33.240 align:middle line:84%
starts to-- there's
connections that

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:37.170 align:middle line:84%
are made there with the group
and the collective archetypal

00:43:37.170 --> 00:43:38.130 align:middle line:90%
experiences?

00:43:38.130 --> 00:43:38.950 align:middle line:90%
Or?

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:44.970 align:middle line:84%
Because we're not the
character, we're the Navigator.

00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:46.690 align:middle line:90%
And the Navigator is--

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a large consciousness?

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:49.350 align:middle line:90%
>> --continuum of consciousness.

00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:55.300 align:middle line:84%
So you have one individual
that's connected with that.

00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:59.410 align:middle line:90%
It starts helping stimulate.

00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:00.370 align:middle line:90%
It makes it easier.

00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:03.460 align:middle line:84%
When two people are meditating
together, all of a sudden,

00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:04.930 align:middle line:90%
you move into deeper say.

00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:06.175 align:middle line:90%
You can feel more.

00:44:06.175 --> 00:44:09.640 align:middle line:84%
It's the same kind of
principle with that.

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:11.150 align:middle line:90%
It's nonverbal.

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:12.670 align:middle line:10%
It just happens.

00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And so, access starts
happening in that case.

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:21.850 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, people will
have them as they

00:44:21.850 --> 00:44:24.580 align:middle line:84%
get familiar with
abiding in that state,

00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:27.100 align:middle line:84%
and the communication starts
to happen with the quantum

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:28.270 align:middle line:90%
Navigator.

00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:32.170 align:middle line:84%
The Navigator will
show you exactly what

00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:35.900 align:middle line:84%
is appropriate for you and
may take you on a journey.

00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:38.620 align:middle line:84%
So there may be a
series of events

00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:42.790 align:middle line:84%
that occur in this
heightened state

00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:51.010 align:middle line:84%
that it impacts you so
viscerally in your being state.

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:53.110 align:middle line:84%
Not in the mind,
in the beingness,

00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:58.000 align:middle line:84%
because you get to feel the
information coming in to you

00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.290 align:middle line:90%
from all over.

00:44:59.290 --> 00:45:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And that really helps
you refine the definition

00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:05.890 align:middle line:90%
between mind and conscious.

00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And consciousness
hits you all over.

00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:10.360 align:middle line:84%
It's like a voice or
a frequency that's

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:12.280 align:middle line:90%
hitting from all directions.

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the mind, it's
pretty familiar with.

00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:18.260 align:middle line:90%


00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:20.930 align:middle line:84%
So when people have
that experience,

00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:26.200 align:middle line:84%
then what we do for the first
five to 10 minutes immediately

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:31.540 align:middle line:84%
when they come back after that
30 minute or 40 minute time

00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:34.270 align:middle line:84%
is begin to journal
everything, every nuance

00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:39.430 align:middle line:84%
that you remember viscerally
in that experience.

00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And then, we can
start to translate

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:47.740 align:middle line:84%
what the communication
was in that case.

00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:52.270 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, the Navigator
is interested in returning

00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:57.220 align:middle line:84%
your consciousness to the whole
of you outside of the character

00:45:57.220 --> 00:46:00.205 align:middle line:90%
or outside of the cosmic egg.

00:46:00.205 --> 00:46:02.800 align:middle line:90%


00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:06.250 align:middle line:90%
Redefine your beingness.

00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And then, do you see if more
of these groups can do this

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:15.040 align:middle line:90%
in their satellites?

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:18.910 align:middle line:84%
Then there would be a collective
bigger quantum navigation thing

00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:20.470 align:middle line:90%
happening over the planet?

00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>> That would be amazing.

00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:24.520 align:middle line:90%
>> The future of this work?

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:26.350 align:middle line:90%
>> That would be amazing, yes.

00:46:26.350 --> 00:46:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Then we're all
syncing up in the same--

00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>> To have that much confidence
in what you're getting,

00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:38.140 align:middle line:84%
and what, and how
to interpret that?

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:42.340 align:middle line:84%
For that purpose
of reminding you?

00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:44.440 align:middle line:90%
Remember, we fell asleep.

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:45.760 align:middle line:90%
We went unconscious.

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:48.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's trying to
awaken you to who

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:51.080 align:middle line:84%
and what you really are
across the continuum.

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:55.840 align:middle line:84%
So when you awaken
to that, no place

00:46:55.840 --> 00:47:00.010 align:middle line:84%
can you be lost anymore, because
the internal navigation is all

00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:01.000 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.330 align:middle line:84%
So once a person finds
that internal navigation,

00:47:04.330 --> 00:47:05.980 align:middle line:90%
they can never be lost.

00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:08.210 align:middle line:84%
You know where to
find it inside you.

00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And wherever the
Navigator takes you--

00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:13.610 align:middle line:84%
and the Navigator will take
you on these most amazing--

00:47:13.610 --> 00:47:19.910 align:middle line:84%
in deeper darkness and have
you meet amazing aspects

00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:20.710 align:middle line:90%
of yourself.

00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And we started this off
somewhat about talking

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:29.950 align:middle line:84%
about all those ETs and how
frightening that was at first.

00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:31.705 align:middle line:90%
The character was so alien.

00:47:31.705 --> 00:47:35.440 align:middle line:90%


00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.670 align:middle line:84%
The quantum wants
to show you, no.

00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:41.110 align:middle line:84%
The whole saying is you--
the whole continuum is you,

00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:42.610 align:middle line:90%
dark and light.

00:47:42.610 --> 00:47:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And when you stop polarizing
it, then you can embrace it all

00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:50.620 align:middle line:84%
and start to steward all those
parts all back into the oneness

00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:52.000 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I was just going to say,
probably these other ET

00:47:54.610 --> 00:48:01.150 align:middle line:84%
civilizations, some of the
lesser density ones probably

00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:05.800 align:middle line:84%
are already born into having
access to the quantum Navigator

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:09.250 align:middle line:84%
as a tool that's
in their society.

00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:13.540 align:middle line:84%
It seems like we've turned
that aspect of our--

00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:18.520 align:middle line:84%
turned it off, and now, we're
moving into a society that

00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:19.900 align:middle line:90%
has access to this now.

00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:22.225 align:middle line:84%
Or is remembering
that we have access.

00:48:22.225 --> 00:48:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>> I have a wonderful
theory about that,

00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:29.030 align:middle line:84%
and that's that
26,000 year cycle.

00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:32.980 align:middle line:84%
So half of the cycle
is in 13,000 years.

00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:36.370 align:middle line:90%
You're under the Galactic disk.

00:48:36.370 --> 00:48:38.950 align:middle line:84%
In the underside of
the Galactic disk,

00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:41.200 align:middle line:84%
that's when we move
into forgetfulness,

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:43.090 align:middle line:90%
into full separation.

00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:49.040 align:middle line:84%
So remember, dark energy,
repulsive and revulsive.

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:52.060 align:middle line:10%
So when we went even
more unconscious

00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:54.370 align:middle line:10%
into full separation,
everything,

00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:57.340 align:middle line:10%
every fractal is scary.

00:48:57.340 --> 00:48:59.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Including the Navigator.

00:48:59.080 --> 00:48:59.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:00.970 align:middle line:90%
Even that.

00:49:00.970 --> 00:49:02.740 align:middle line:90%
Even that.

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:06.100 align:middle line:90%
We fear the God we are.

00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:09.830 align:middle line:84%
So when we return, and we
go through this in stages

00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:10.630 align:middle line:90%
and slowly.

00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And we start waking
up-- and Krishna even

00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:16.120 align:middle line:84%
said, don't try to wake
them up in the Kaliyuga.

00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:18.740 align:middle line:90%
You're wasting your time.

00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:22.330 align:middle line:84%
But as we return to
the Galactic medium,

00:49:22.330 --> 00:49:25.180 align:middle line:84%
and we start moving
above it, then, you

00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:27.190 align:middle line:90%
can't help but remember.

00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:28.270 align:middle line:90%
No, that's me.

00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:29.070 align:middle line:90%
That's me.

00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:31.540 align:middle line:90%
That other is me.

00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And you don't feel the
alienness and the repulsiveness.

00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:40.330 align:middle line:84%
The magnets turn from
repulsion to attraction.

00:49:40.330 --> 00:49:41.320 align:middle line:90%
These are my parts.

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:43.990 align:middle line:84%
>> The other side of
that toroidal field.

00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:46.270 align:middle line:90%
And we remember.

00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:48.970 align:middle line:84%
That's part of the pain,
part of the abandonment.

00:49:48.970 --> 00:49:52.420 align:middle line:84%
Original abandonment is
when we all separated,

00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:54.250 align:middle line:90%
and that was painful.

00:49:54.250 --> 00:49:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And so, now, as we're awakening,
that's the joy of this.

00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Is that we're on that cusp
of beginning to realize we're

00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:05.350 align:middle line:90%
stewarding them back here.

00:50:05.350 --> 00:50:09.940 align:middle line:84%
They're waiting for that
awakening to take place in us.

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Which connects back to the
interview we did with Lyssa

00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:17.860 align:middle line:84%
for the contact work, and how
all of these are just aspects.

00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:21.220 align:middle line:84%
All of this is just,
again, a further reflection

00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:26.260 align:middle line:84%
of remembering our
interconnectedness of who we

00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:29.050 align:middle line:90%
are and coming back together.

00:50:29.050 --> 00:50:30.010 align:middle line:90%
So cool.

00:50:30.010 --> 00:50:30.810 align:middle line:90%
So cool.

00:50:30.810 --> 00:50:33.490 align:middle line:90%
>> So phenomenal.

00:50:33.490 --> 00:50:35.080 align:middle line:90%
Just amazing.

00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:40.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, thank you for
shepherding these modalities

00:50:40.030 --> 00:50:44.980 align:middle line:84%
and offering these tools
to our viewers here.

00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:46.930 align:middle line:84%
To me to having
this conversation.

00:50:46.930 --> 00:50:49.390 align:middle line:84%
To just being a
big part of this.

00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:54.040 align:middle line:84%
I think you're a rather large
cog in this cosmic awakening

00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:55.060 align:middle line:90%
wheel.

00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:56.140 align:middle line:90%
So thank you very much.

00:50:56.140 --> 00:51:00.015 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, thank you so much
for your work, and you're--

00:51:00.015 --> 00:51:01.390 align:middle line:84%
I never told you
this, but you're

00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:03.440 align:middle line:84%
quite an inspiration
to me I watch you.

00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:04.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're meeting
each other here.

00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:07.600 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:08.620 align:middle line:90%
Well, thanks, Ron.

00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:09.040 align:middle line:90%
Big hugs?

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:09.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:13.089 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:51:13.089 --> 00:51:44.810 align:middle line:90%


00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:46.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, that's fun.

00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:50.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I had no idea how you were
going to unravel this thing.

00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:53.190 align:middle line:90%
I was like, sweating.

00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:53.990 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:55.040 align:middle line:90%
I hugged you.

00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:56.763 align:middle line:90%
>> So answer the question.

00:51:56.763 --> 00:51:59.900 align:middle line:90%


00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:01.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Just yes.

00:52:01.070 --> 00:52:02.900 align:middle line:90%
Trying to do the lightness face.

00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:04.200 align:middle line:90%
Who are you?

00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:07.370 align:middle line:90%
I know that first question.

00:52:07.370 --> 00:52:08.810 align:middle line:90%
Deer in my headlights.

00:52:08.810 --> 00:52:10.540 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:19.000 align:middle line:90%
