And first and foremost, I'd
like to know a little bit more

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.510 align:middle line:84%
about Bella the
being and the race

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.390 align:middle line:84%
from what I understand
you come from, the YahYel.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.125 align:middle line:84%

about the race, the YahYel?

Yes, I am a specific
representative

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:59.760 align:middle line:84%
of what I refer to as the hybrid
lineage, the result of what you

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.440 align:middle line:84%
would understand as the gray
human hybrid program, a very

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.290 align:middle line:90%
specific type of gray.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:11.680 align:middle line:84%
I am from a specific,
YahYel race,

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.580 align:middle line:84%
in this way, that is one
of the civilizations that

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:21.820 align:middle line:84%
was created from one type
of human hybrid program.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.980 align:middle line:90%


00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:31.260 align:middle line:84%
The YahYel, simply
enough, is a Hebrew word

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:36.750 align:middle line:84%
derived from a Hebrew word
that means "community"

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:43.450 align:middle line:84%
or "structure," a structure
within where individuals

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:48.150 align:middle line:84%
can shine brightly, a
community of structure that

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.850 align:middle line:90%
shines brightly.

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:59.940 align:middle line:84%
We are, in ways, your ancestors,
for there was a time, as you

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:06.290 align:middle line:84%
would define it, when we
were one race existing

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.750 align:middle line:84%
in fourth density
before what you

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.550 align:middle line:90%
might understand as the fall.

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.060 align:middle line:90%


00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.830 align:middle line:84%
There were those
of us that chose

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:20.300 align:middle line:84%
to stay in this overlay
many, many, many years ago

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.970 align:middle line:90%
as you would define it.

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And then in your more
recent generations,

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:31.400 align:middle line:84%
we were able to
contribute this DNA along

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.450 align:middle line:84%
with the grays and your race and
also be created, you might say,

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.310 align:middle line:90%
in a new way.

Many different versions,
many different timelines,

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.490 align:middle line:84%
many different ways to
be able to hybridized

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:48.890 align:middle line:84%
a hybrid for the
sake of continuing

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:49.940 align:middle line:90%

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.540 align:middle line:84%
This is my spice that
I add to the stew

00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:04.720 align:middle line:84%
to begin to blend more of the
stories, more of my teachers,

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.670 align:middle line:90%
more of our ancestors--

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:11.740 align:middle line:84%
brothers, and sisters,
and children, all

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:17.890 align:middle line:84%
frames into the one
movie into the community

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:21.720 align:middle line:84%
that can lay foundation and
build structure together.

way then, is a term,

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:37.764 align:middle line:84%

of my (SINGS) frequency--

00:08:37.764 --> 00:08:40.309 align:middle line:90%


00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:50.200 align:middle line:84%

within the oversoul of myself,

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.780 align:middle line:84%

forth in this now

00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:03.930 align:middle line:84%
a very precise pinpointed
form of communication

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:13.830 align:middle line:84%
for all of our civilizations
to offer a song,

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:21.260 align:middle line:84%
an echo of the fractal of
the fractal in a precise way.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Does this suffice in this
now as an introduction?

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:30.080 align:middle line:84%
Very good introduction,
thank you.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.380 align:middle line:84%
This echo, so to speak,
is this something then

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:39.350 align:middle line:84%
that Gita, the person, growing
into this channeling state

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:45.150 align:middle line:84%
is resonating with
and bringing--

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.500 align:middle line:84%
>> She resonates
in, you might say.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:49.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Relax in.

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:51.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Relax into this echo.

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:52.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:57.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And by having this
conversation like this are we

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:58.470 align:middle line:90%
playing the song, so to say?

00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:59.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:00.125 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:00.125 --> 00:10:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>> But here's another meaning
in this way for my title,

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:10.190 align:middle line:84%
for the label of my vibration,
is to offer the idea to you all

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:14.660 align:middle line:84%
that you are all
your own Belles.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:19.940 align:middle line:84%
Each and every fractal
of existence, each

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:28.070 align:middle line:84%
and every manifestation
in physicality is a Belle,

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:31.130 align:middle line:84%
resonating within the
echo of consciousness

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:34.760 align:middle line:84%
itself, able to bring
forth its own signature

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.295 align:middle line:90%
song, its own signature story.

00:10:37.295 --> 00:10:39.975 align:middle line:90%


00:10:39.975 --> 00:10:40.850 align:middle line:90%
Does this make sense?

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>> I think so, yeah.

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:45.600 align:middle line:84%
So since you mentioned
density, what density

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.435 align:middle line:90%
does Bella Isabella reside in?

00:10:48.435 --> 00:10:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Bella is the term,
in this way, then,

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:56.180 align:middle line:84%
that I do prefer for
my individualized self,

00:10:56.180 --> 00:11:01.490 align:middle line:84%
for it is still important for
us all to have that type of--

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:02.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Identification.

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:04.890 align:middle line:90%
>> --identification, yes.

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And the Isabelle is
just for fun and also

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:14.540 align:middle line:90%
to be able to relay a message.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.570 align:middle line:84%
I exist in perhaps
what you would

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:22.150 align:middle line:90%
understand as fourth density.

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:27.590 align:middle line:84%
The terms, the labels, the
numbers get a little arbitrary.

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:32.780 align:middle line:84%
They are, in fact, arbitrary
and don't necessarily

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.930 align:middle line:84%
hold weight within
the greater structure,

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:37.310 align:middle line:90%
but all this is just language.

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:38.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:38.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:46.350 align:middle line:84%
But for fun, this is where
we are choosing to describe.

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:51.140 align:middle line:90%


00:11:51.140 --> 00:12:00.320 align:middle line:84%
I am residing in an
overlay of fourth density.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:06.560 align:middle line:84%
This is the dream
realm, simply enough.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:14.060 align:middle line:90%
This is your elementals realm.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:20.560 align:middle line:84%
This is where most of the
consciousness of your plants,

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:25.160 align:middle line:84%
and animals, and
minerals truly reside.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:32.030 align:middle line:84%
This is just beyond
the corner of your eye.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:36.920 align:middle line:84%
This is where your
civilization is headed.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.560 align:middle line:90%


00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:49.410 align:middle line:84%
So I am residing in a bridge
as close to your density

00:12:49.410 --> 00:13:00.190 align:middle line:84%
as I can be in the denser
forms of fourth density.

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>> From my understanding,
humanity is sort

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.160 align:middle line:84%
of in the beginnings
of fourth density or--

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.707 align:middle line:90%
>> You phase in and out, yes.

00:13:05.707 --> 00:13:06.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Phase in and out.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:09.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, most of you,
generally speaking, yes.

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:11.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Would you in another--

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:15.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And what this means,
for clarification,

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:17.710 align:middle line:84%
for those that may not have
an understanding of this

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:21.090 align:middle line:84%
or, again, to offer my own
harmony line within this

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:21.930 align:middle line:90%
oversoul song--

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:26.070 align:middle line:90%


00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:32.160 align:middle line:84%
is the knowing that you
are in a dream, the knowing

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.270 align:middle line:84%
that this is an experience,
the knowing that you

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:41.140 align:middle line:90%
are spirit in matter.

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.780 align:middle line:90%


00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:49.090 align:middle line:84%
The knowing of this is what
then dictates the consciousness

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:52.390 align:middle line:84%
to have the experience of that
which we are calling "forth

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:53.380 align:middle line:90%
density."

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:56.050 align:middle line:84%
But we feel it relevant
to say it in this way,

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:59.710 align:middle line:84%
it is knowing that
you are in the dream.

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And you all have moments where
you fades in and out of this.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And more and more and more,
it is becoming your knowing

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:08.830 align:middle line:84%
through your experience
you are solidifying

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:12.730 align:middle line:84%
and you are relaxing
into remembering

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:18.385 align:middle line:84%
what it is you actually are,
where you have always been.

00:14:18.385 --> 00:14:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Like being lucid in a dream?

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.945 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct, yes.

00:14:23.945 --> 00:14:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Obviously, you guys
must have a planet.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.280 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:14:31.365 --> 00:14:32.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Obviously!

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:33.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, kind of.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:34.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Not so obvious!

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.190 align:middle line:90%

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:36.990 align:middle line:90%

would define as a planet.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:11.190 align:middle line:84%
But it is not in
another star system.

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:18.730 align:middle line:84%
It is not, in that way, what
you would define as a planet,

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:25.140 align:middle line:84%
not like the created Essassani
not like those planets

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:26.010 align:middle line:90%
around Sirius.

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:29.270 align:middle line:90%


00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:35.530 align:middle line:90%
It is the place of dreams.

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:38.540 align:middle line:90%


00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:43.400 align:middle line:90%
It is somewhere in between.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:48.580 align:middle line:84%
It is, in this way then--
speaking a bit more technically

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:56.870 align:middle line:84%
in a density overlay,
in a vibration

00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:07.460 align:middle line:84%
that the Gaia herself, in
one way of looking at it,

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:14.840 align:middle line:84%
used to, in a past,
existed in fourth density,

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:22.025 align:middle line:84%
and then, in a future will,
exists in fourth density.

00:16:22.025 --> 00:16:23.160 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>> But it is always in existence
and always in a density

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:33.500 align:middle line:90%
overlay.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And we were essentially able to
maintain this dream world when

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:53.020 align:middle line:84%
there was the split
of our original race

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:56.830 align:middle line:84%
many, many, many, many, many
years ago before the fall,

00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:57.910 align:middle line:90%
in this way.

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:00.670 align:middle line:84%
This space was able
to be maintained.

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:04.910 align:middle line:84%
This is what I have been calling
[? Adorapan, ?] [? Adorapan, ?]

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:06.535 align:middle line:84%
a door is opening
to [? Adorapan. ?]

00:17:06.535 --> 00:17:08.520 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:12.950 align:middle line:84%
>> We were able to hold
an anchor, you might say,

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:22.640 align:middle line:84%
in this fourth density
expression of Gaia here

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:27.200 align:middle line:84%
and now, always here
in the his, and her,

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:31.910 align:middle line:84%
their story and also
always in the future.

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:35.590 align:middle line:90%


00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Then we, yes, have our ships
that are birthed and born

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:50.330 align:middle line:84%
in a variety of different
ways, from silicone, plasma,

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:55.940 align:middle line:84%
and different types
of crystals, that we

00:17:55.940 --> 00:18:04.120 align:middle line:84%
are able to bring at a
slightly deeper density, closer

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:06.610 align:middle line:84%
to that of third
density but still

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:13.370 align:middle line:84%
within the level
of fourth density.

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:16.540 align:middle line:84%
[? Adorapan, ?] in
this way, is a bridge

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:21.500 align:middle line:90%
itself in fourth density.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.450 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:23.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:32.520 align:middle line:84%
We also then like the
lyrics from a version

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.540 align:middle line:90%
of "Peter Pan" on your planet.

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:39.900 align:middle line:90%


00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:44.010 align:middle line:84%
In ways, we are second
star to the right

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:47.590 align:middle line:90%
and straight on till morning.

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:52.080 align:middle line:90%
We are not on any chart.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:56.900 align:middle line:90%
You must find with your heart.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:00.740 align:middle line:84%
Never, Neverland
or [? Adorapan. ?]

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:07.180 align:middle line:84%
we might be miles beyond
the moon or right there

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:12.620 align:middle line:84%
where you stand, just
keep an open mind,

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:20.410 align:middle line:84%
and then suddenly you'll
find [? Adorapan. ?] No,

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.570 align:middle line:90%
it is not a different planet.

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:27.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I see, hence the
connection to the fairies--

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:28.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:31.630 align:middle line:90%
>> --the other Earth elves.

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:32.430 align:middle line:90%
>> The elementals.

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:35.200 align:middle line:90%
>> The elementals, yes.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.550 align:middle line:84%
So no planet, so there goes
the rest of my questions.

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh!

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:43.080 align:middle line:84%
>> But that explains
a lot, so thank you.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:48.780 align:middle line:84%
Because I've had conversations
with other yellow beings

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:52.770 align:middle line:84%
through other channelers,
and it would always come up.

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:53.973 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:19:53.973 --> 00:19:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And nobody could quite
put their finger on it,

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:59.460 align:middle line:84%
so this was a nice
little surprise--

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:00.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Fun.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:01.718 align:middle line:90%
>> --but not such a surprise.

00:20:01.718 --> 00:20:06.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, we are very honored
in this way and excited, then,

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:14.400 align:middle line:84%
to be able to bring a bit more
then of my slice of the pie

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:20.580 align:middle line:84%
my translation of the community,
together in which we all shine

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:21.960 align:middle line:90%
brightly.

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.830 align:middle line:90%
>> And your slice--

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:29.640 align:middle line:84%
I know there's a bit of
Sirius energy in the slice,

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.090 align:middle line:84%
but Sirius is a
star with a planet--

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:32.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Many, yes.

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:35.970 align:middle line:84%
>> --many planets, many
beings in different planets.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:37.980 align:middle line:84%
So can you tell us
your relationship

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.590 align:middle line:90%
to that and that connection?

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:44.330 align:middle line:84%
Is that through this
alternate Earth connection?

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:47.160 align:middle line:84%
Does Sirius helped seed
your planet as well

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.620 align:middle line:84%
or your version
of [? Adorapan? ?]

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:51.240 align:middle line:90%
Your version of Earth?

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.602 align:middle line:90%
Is there Sirius energy in there?

00:20:52.602 --> 00:20:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, we understand what
you are meaning in regards

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:59.870 align:middle line:84%
to, well, this gets
technical here.

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:01.250 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] OK.

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And we start tiptoeing into
territory that is not quite

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:08.880 align:middle line:90%
relevant.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.204 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:21:11.204 --> 00:21:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>> There is connection, yes,
to Sirius and that which you

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:19.030 align:middle line:90%
understand as the Anunnaki.

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:20.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Some connection, but again,
this is still in the process

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.410 align:middle line:84%
of being relevant to
fully come to light.

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:28.210 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:32.162 align:middle line:90%


00:21:32.162 --> 00:21:37.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And, yes, so in our
version of our density overlay

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:42.840 align:middle line:84%
and our version of Gaia, yes,
we do share, then, the same--

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:46.590 align:middle line:84%
his and her story in this way
to the most relevant version

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:50.095 align:middle line:84%
of your Gaia and that we are
on the way into blending.

00:21:50.095 --> 00:21:50.970 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:51.785 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:51.785 --> 00:21:56.180 align:middle line:90%
>> And then in that way--

00:21:56.180 --> 00:22:00.790 align:middle line:84%
also, I say my slice
for all truths are true.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And there may be
different versions,

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:08.660 align:middle line:84%
different members
of the YahYel that

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.810 align:middle line:90%
have different experiences.

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:17.570 align:middle line:84%
There are perhaps different
branches of the same family

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:22.580 align:middle line:84%
tree that do have their own
type of planet, be it AI,

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:27.090 align:middle line:84%
but this is, from my
perspective-- again,

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:28.710 align:middle line:90%
from my slice--

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:35.630 align:middle line:84%
from my observation
of relevancy,

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:40.210 align:middle line:84%
the way that the YahYel
are telling the story.

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:42.885 align:middle line:90%


00:22:42.885 --> 00:22:49.300 align:middle line:84%
So then those of us
connected to this slice also

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:55.450 align:middle line:84%
then have Sirius as a
type of oversoul, higher

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:57.850 align:middle line:90%
self-connection.

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Many of us have direct
parallel incarnations

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:09.370 align:middle line:84%
that we connect to from time
to time, but most of the time,

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:12.940 align:middle line:84%
most of the times it
is relevant to have

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:16.060 align:middle line:84%
that constant
connection with Sirius.

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:23.310 align:middle line:84%
It is part of the triad that
we are building together

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:30.920 align:middle line:84%
with your civilization,
with the [? ooss ?]

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:37.820 align:middle line:84%
in its various forms,
the ascended fully,

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:43.090 align:middle line:84%
enlightened, as you might
say, version of Sirius.

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:50.190 align:middle line:84%
Sirius and Gaia are,
in a way, sisters?

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:51.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, yeah.

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:52.735 align:middle line:90%
I've heard this.

00:23:52.735 --> 00:24:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>> We could say it simply enough
that share similar stories,

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:07.270 align:middle line:84%
similar transitions, once again,
relating to the importance

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:15.900 align:middle line:84%
of the emotional body
and the variations,

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:21.110 align:middle line:84%
the stark polarizations of
the experience of limitations.

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:24.742 align:middle line:90%


00:24:24.742 --> 00:24:37.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And so certainly, for those
of us that are from more recent

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:42.610 align:middle line:84%
generations of the
hybrid lineage,

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:49.810 align:middle line:84%
it was part of the agreement
that we would come in on this

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:56.200 align:middle line:84%
wave, the wave of flowing with
the stream of the [? ooss, ?]

00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:03.630 align:middle line:84%
of the Sirius to, once again,
allow further understanding

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:15.220 align:middle line:84%
of the journey of
limitless limitations.

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>> So the [? ooss ?] are sort
of advanced Syrian beings,

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:20.350 align:middle line:90%
so to say.

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:20.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:23.110 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, and that's just
sort of a title for that?

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:25.560 align:middle line:90%
>> This is a lineage term, yes.

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.640 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, OK.

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And we just think
it's fun to say.

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:30.295 align:middle line:90%
>> It is, [? ooss! ?]

00:25:30.295 --> 00:25:31.270 align:middle line:90%
[? >> Ooss! ?]

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>> In Japanese, it's sort
of a shortened grouping

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:37.750 align:middle line:90%
of, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:40.314 align:middle line:84%
And you say it really fast,
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],, ooss!

00:25:40.314 --> 00:25:41.140 align:middle line:90%
>> [? Ooss! ?]

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:42.610 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's just
like a greeting.

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and we
greet, [? ooss! ?]

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:49.435 align:middle line:84%
>> In martial art terms,
in karate and things,

00:25:49.435 --> 00:25:50.310 align:middle line:90%
we always [? ooss. ?]

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:53.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes! [? Ooss! ?]
Yes, very close, yes.

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:54.670 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:55.886 align:middle line:90%
>> Watch it shift.

00:25:55.886 --> 00:25:56.686 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] OK.

00:25:56.686 --> 00:25:57.450 align:middle line:90%

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:04.410 align:middle line:90%
[? ooss. ?]

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>> [? Ooss. ?] All right,
how do you perceive humanity

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:13.690 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that you're
observing-- in the sense,

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:15.610 align:middle line:84%
that we just said,
you never left.

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:20.110 align:middle line:84%
So how are you connected in the
sense where you never leave?

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:22.125 align:middle line:90%
How do you perceive us?

00:26:22.125 --> 00:26:24.990 align:middle line:84%
>> So how does it look from
the other side of the mirror,

00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:25.790 align:middle line:90%
you might say, yes?

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:28.040 align:middle line:84%
>> How does it look from the
other side of the mirror?

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:28.990 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:37.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Not wanting to spook you,
but I am, you might say,

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:40.000 align:middle line:90%
right there.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And it is like being able
to look through a veil.

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:55.670 align:middle line:84%
It is remembering that we
are also physical, just

00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:59.780 align:middle line:84%
able to be in the knowing
that it is a dream so then

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.670 align:middle line:84%
we are able to
manipulate it, you

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:05.810 align:middle line:84%
might say, to travel in
between the frames consciously.

00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:16.200 align:middle line:84%
So it is like seeing
a movie because we

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:29.400 align:middle line:84%
are not quite wanting to
break the fourth wall,

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.760 align:middle line:90%
to be physical in that way.

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:35.070 align:middle line:90%
We could.

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:36.570 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes we do.

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:39.035 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:39.035 --> 00:27:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>> But it is you all making the
internal frequency adjustments

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:47.960 align:middle line:84%
that then align with
that being a match,

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:51.620 align:middle line:84%
where we are able to do
it with the permission

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:58.260 align:middle line:84%
of your alteration of your own
frequency, but we still could,

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:00.590 align:middle line:90%
but we wouldn't.

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:04.130 align:middle line:84%
So it is very much like
looking through a window,

00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:10.007 align:middle line:84%
but it is even less
solid in that way for us.

00:28:10.007 --> 00:28:11.840 align:middle line:84%
Like looking through a
mist, through a veil,

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:15.110 align:middle line:84%
you are right there
for us when we choose

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:18.395 align:middle line:90%
to put our attention there.

00:28:18.395 --> 00:28:19.835 align:middle line:90%
Does this makes sense?

00:28:19.835 --> 00:28:21.195 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, of course.

00:28:21.195 --> 00:28:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And for us to do this
form of communication

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:27.020 align:middle line:84%
in this way and
manner, is this sort

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:29.060 align:middle line:84%
of opening that
veil a little bit?

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:30.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, certainly!

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:31.010 align:middle line:90%
Yes!

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:32.780 align:middle line:90%
Big party, you might say!

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.235 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, so not just you?

00:28:34.235 --> 00:28:35.195 align:middle line:90%
You said a party.

00:28:35.195 --> 00:28:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I'm not the
only one, in that way,

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:41.140 align:middle line:90%
that is just there or just here.

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:43.622 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:43.622 --> 00:28:46.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's many people
in line on your own end--

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes!

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:48.138 align:middle line:90%
>> --talk on the phone?

00:28:48.138 --> 00:28:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Many people, many
different beings, yes.

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Using Bella as a
channel in a sense?

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:55.630 align:middle line:90%
>> In a sense, yes.

00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:57.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes, party line.

00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:57.890 align:middle line:90%
>> To listen in?

00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:00.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, to listen in, and
then we are all telepathically

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:02.450 align:middle line:90%
connected.

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:10.295 align:middle line:84%
So the relevancy of the story,
the specific translations, yes.

00:29:10.295 --> 00:29:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's a lot of talk
with other YahYel speak

00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:24.290 align:middle line:84%
in our interwebs
about hybrid children.

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:27.140 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned earlier
this hybridization

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:31.400 align:middle line:84%
that's been going on through the
[? Zetas, ?] through your race,

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:35.510 align:middle line:84%
and the hybrid children
is a big subject,

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:39.020 align:middle line:84%
and it's said that the
hybrid children are sort of

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:42.620 align:middle line:90%
in the care of the YahYel.

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:45.740 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain, from
your perspective,

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:47.000 align:middle line:90%
how does that work?

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:55.070 align:middle line:84%
>> We will offer the most simple
timeline, for this is shifting,

00:29:55.070 --> 00:30:00.735 align:middle line:84%
and there are some ideas that
we are not quite ready to fully

00:30:00.735 --> 00:30:01.535 align:middle line:90%
disclose.

00:30:01.535 --> 00:30:03.161 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:30:03.161 --> 00:30:13.640 align:middle line:84%
>> But these are the children
of more recent timelines,

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:24.140 align:middle line:84%
more recent donors,
more recent generations.

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:31.100 align:middle line:84%
These children are
closer to your genetics

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:38.870 align:middle line:84%
and able to vibrate
closer to your density.

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:45.200 align:middle line:84%
The YahYel do steward
most of these children.

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:50.660 align:middle line:84%
The Sassani or Shakani
are also involved.

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:53.970 align:middle line:90%


00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:55.352 align:middle line:90%
>> As stewards?

00:30:55.352 --> 00:31:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, teachers as
well and students,

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:12.860 align:middle line:84%
for the children have
a very deep connection,

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:21.480 align:middle line:84%
innerstanding of emotions,
for as each generation

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:34.670 align:middle line:84%
in the program reached clearer
and clearer reflections,

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:40.940 align:middle line:84%
the experience was less
gray for each civilization.

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:49.850 align:middle line:84%
There is less gray
DNA in each linear way

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:54.980 align:middle line:84%
of looking at the creation
of the different races.

00:31:54.980 --> 00:32:02.450 align:middle line:84%
So the children, that which we
are calling the children, which

00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:10.850 align:middle line:84%
also I do wish to say may
come from the different races

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:17.210 align:middle line:84%
that which you define as Sassani
that which you define as YahYel

00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:24.230 align:middle line:84%
but newer generations,
contain slightly more

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:28.360 align:middle line:90%
emotional awareness--

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:41.180 align:middle line:84%
to be able to feel,
match the experience that

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:46.520 align:middle line:84%
have been chosen
by our ancestors,

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:52.290 align:middle line:84%
by Earth civilization
so that we may better

00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:58.470 align:middle line:84%
understand and translate
different hack codes,

00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:00.150 align:middle line:90%
as you might say.

00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:02.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Hack codes for timelines?

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:08.235 align:middle line:84%
>> For existence, for
being in your existence.

00:33:08.235 --> 00:33:10.350 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, for timelines,
but different ways

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:13.380 align:middle line:84%
to be able to transmit
different variations

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:16.290 align:middle line:84%
on a theme, difference
formulas, to have

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:19.920 align:middle line:84%
an understanding of the
emotional experience of what

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:23.460 align:middle line:84%
it truly means to
be on planet Earth

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:27.480 align:middle line:84%
in your time and your density,
to be able to have more

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:32.340 align:middle line:84%
of an emotional understanding
to relay different messages

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:37.320 align:middle line:84%
that may be of a clearer and
more specific tone for you

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:40.740 align:middle line:84%
all to further better ring your
own bells in your experience.

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:43.650 align:middle line:90%


00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:49.530 align:middle line:84%
So I will speak, then,
specifically for my ship

00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:53.640 align:middle line:90%
of what I call "The Karen."

00:33:53.640 --> 00:34:00.750 align:middle line:84%
We have many hybrid
children aboard the craft

00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:05.660 align:middle line:84%
that for this now it is most
relevant to share that they are

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:09.570 align:middle line:84%
what you would understand
a slightly different race,

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:15.500 align:middle line:84%
a new race, the Shalanaya
being a race unto themselves.

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:20.670 align:middle line:84%
So I have many of
these children with me,

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:26.520 align:middle line:84%
and we all experience
many different classes,

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:30.300 align:middle line:84%
many different ways of
transmitting information.

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:32.909 align:middle line:84%
For my specific
department, you might

00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:35.850 align:middle line:84%
say it is mostly centered
around the ideas we

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:38.340 align:middle line:84%
set of sharing the
emotional resonance,

00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:41.310 align:middle line:84%
of sharing the understanding
of the importance

00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:46.800 align:middle line:84%
of the emotional body, as
well as many different types

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:51.179 align:middle line:84%
of playing, interacting
with different donors,

00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:55.500 align:middle line:84%
different parents, different
sisters, different cousins,

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:59.350 align:middle line:84%
many different forms
of communication

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:03.160 align:middle line:90%
with all of our larger family.

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Larger family,
including Sirius and--

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:07.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:08.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>> --and these
other civilizations?

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:11.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:16.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you one of
these children?

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:19.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:19.690 --> 00:35:24.350 align:middle line:84%
In one way of
looking at it, yes.

00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:27.080 align:middle line:84%
Always in this
way, you all should

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:31.880 align:middle line:84%
know that I do also represent
a very specific archetype

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:33.740 align:middle line:90%
of the trickster.

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:36.720 align:middle line:84%
So my information will
always come through very,

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:40.880 align:middle line:84%
very specifically to help
remind you all that there

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:43.130 align:middle line:84%
is this, and this, and
this, and this, and this,

00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:46.610 align:middle line:90%
and, ooh, and also this.

00:35:46.610 --> 00:35:47.540 align:middle line:90%
So yes.

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:51.560 align:middle line:84%
Now I will take the most
direct answer on this

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:54.650 align:middle line:84%
and remind you, then, also
that those of you that

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:59.810 align:middle line:84%
have participated in this very
specific gray human hybrid

00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:03.320 align:middle line:84%
program, those of you
that have participated,

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:11.150 align:middle line:84%
all of your genetics, of
your energetic informational

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:18.260 align:middle line:84%
contributions exist
in all of us from all

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:21.440 align:middle line:84%
of the hybrid races that
have been introduced

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:24.710 align:middle line:84%
to you thus far that are
relevant for this specific

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:25.940 align:middle line:90%
lineage.

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:29.750 align:middle line:84%
So we are all your
hybrid children.

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:31.970 align:middle line:84%
This is, then, also
a fun opportunity

00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:39.572 align:middle line:84%
to segue into
here, from my echo,

00:36:39.572 --> 00:36:46.990 align:middle line:84%
that Shalanaya is a combination
of two Arabic words--

00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:56.840 align:middle line:84%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] the sun
of divinity, sun of purity;

00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:04.040 align:middle line:84%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] is also an
Arabic word that is "daughter

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:07.340 align:middle line:84%
of purity," "daughter
of divinity."

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:10.210 align:middle line:90%


00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:15.760 align:middle line:84%
Together, the
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] are sons

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:24.328 align:middle line:84%
and daughter of light,
purity, divinity.

00:37:24.328 --> 00:37:31.660 align:middle line:84%
So we are all, all-- we say
all the sons and daughters

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:34.480 align:middle line:90%
of light, divinity, and purity.

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:36.535 align:middle line:90%
We are all hybrid children.

00:37:36.535 --> 00:37:40.240 align:middle line:90%


00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:45.310 align:middle line:84%
Once again, always

00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:57.730 align:middle line:84%
So by us sharing
that we are also

00:49:57.730 --> 00:50:03.670 align:middle line:84%
exploring the oceans of
sensation of feeling,

00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:10.510 align:middle line:84%
this then allows you all to
feel that much more seen--

00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:15.220 align:middle line:84%
to be able to honor your
own emotional space to then

00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:20.320 align:middle line:84%
be able to have the
awareness to see,

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:22.630 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that
you are feeling

00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:24.820 align:middle line:84%
many, many, many, many,
many things all at once

00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:25.960 align:middle line:90%
and to choose.

00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And once you choose
that feeling,

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:38.950 align:middle line:84%
to then work it back
to, as the saying goes,

00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:41.440 align:middle line:84%
what would I need
to be believing

00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:48.820 align:middle line:84%
is true in order to
be feeling this, be it

00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:54.970 align:middle line:90%
a positive or negative feeling.

00:50:54.970 --> 00:50:58.840 align:middle line:84%
You can then also find
the positive beliefs.

00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:01.300 align:middle line:84%
So this is a little
bit of my spice,

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:02.980 align:middle line:84%
again, that I'm
adding to the stew.

00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:06.490 align:middle line:84%
My harmony line is to, in
each and every moment, become

00:51:06.490 --> 00:51:08.890 align:middle line:84%
very aware of your
emotions, be it

00:51:08.890 --> 00:51:13.360 align:middle line:84%
a dancer or the
higher-vibrating emotions.

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And you can choose to know
that it may be time to feel

00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:22.330 align:middle line:90%
the denser emotions, yes?

00:51:22.330 --> 00:51:25.690 align:middle line:84%
To address those, to
move those, to give those

00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:26.850 align:middle line:90%
those space to vibrate.

00:51:26.850 --> 00:51:27.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:33.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Now there are some of you
that need to be encouraged

00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:37.060 align:middle line:90%
to go into that depth, yes?

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:39.070 align:middle line:84%
That need to know that
it is safe to do that,

00:51:39.070 --> 00:51:41.650 align:middle line:84%
it must be part of their
journey, and then we might say,

00:51:41.650 --> 00:51:48.730 align:middle line:84%
for most individuals that are
in the soon-to-be-near future

00:51:48.730 --> 00:51:54.910 align:middle line:84%
experiencing this interview,
it may be time for those

00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:59.650 align:middle line:84%
individuals to feel
the other feelings,

00:51:59.650 --> 00:52:04.090 align:middle line:84%
the higher-vibrating feelings,
to know that it is time to make

00:52:04.090 --> 00:52:06.070 align:middle line:84%
the choice, to
feel, and believe,

00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:10.360 align:middle line:84%
and play a different role,
to flip into another infinite

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:15.190 align:middle line:84%
frame, to become
aware of the shifts.

00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And a very wonderful way to
do this is to ask yourself

00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:21.550 align:middle line:84%
what you would need
to be believing

00:52:21.550 --> 00:52:27.720 align:middle line:84%
is true in order to feel this
way about a positive feeling.

00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:28.520 align:middle line:90%
So, yes--

00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:29.660 align:middle line:90%
>> So it goes both ways?

00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:31.025 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, of course.

00:52:31.025 --> 00:52:35.930 align:middle line:84%
>> For us, that may be pie
in the sky, head the clouds,

00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:40.580 align:middle line:84%
all the time we maybe tend to
negate some of our heavier,

00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:45.650 align:middle line:84%
denser emotions, and it's a
good thing to revisit those

00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:48.920 align:middle line:84%
and express those, and you're
saying vise versa for those who

00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:52.400 align:middle line:84%
are deep in the trenches all the
time, and heavy on depression,

00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:56.900 align:middle line:84%
and maybe taking some Prozacs
that they could possibly get

00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:59.060 align:middle line:84%
a little taste of the
pie-in-the-sky stuff

00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:01.160 align:middle line:84%
and neutralize
that a little bit,

00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:04.740 align:middle line:84%
and sort of find that
neutral zone for both sides?

00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:06.083 align:middle line:90%
>> Certainly.

00:53:06.083 --> 00:53:10.343 align:middle line:90%


00:53:10.343 --> 00:53:12.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Probably already most
of the audience knows this,

00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:17.487 align:middle line:10%
but is this all coming from
our Orion Wars experience?

00:53:17.487 --> 00:53:18.320 align:middle line:90%
All of it, I'm sure?

00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:19.250 align:middle line:90%
Not all of it, but--

00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>> No, not all of it, but
that is some of it, yes.

00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:24.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of our
Syrian experiences--

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:31.068 align:middle line:84%
>> There are many civilizations
within our greater lineage--

00:53:31.068 --> 00:53:33.360 align:middle line:84%
great, great, great, great,
great, great, great, great,

00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:34.940 align:middle line:84%
great, great, great,
great, great, great, great

00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:35.810 align:middle line:90%
grandparents, yes?

00:53:35.810 --> 00:53:36.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Lira, Vega.

00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:38.750 align:middle line:90%
>> All of it, yes.

00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Also, then
specifically, that which

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:48.890 align:middle line:84%
you understand as the Anunnaki
come from stories and worlds

00:53:48.890 --> 00:53:50.445 align:middle line:90%
of great contrast.

00:53:50.445 --> 00:53:51.245 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:51.245 --> 00:53:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And so, yes, all of this
residual trauma in this way

00:53:58.250 --> 00:54:01.780 align:middle line:84%
still exists in
varying dilutive forms.

00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:07.400 align:middle line:10%
It is very diluted in this
way, in the hybrid lineage,

00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:10.340 align:middle line:10%
but there are those of us
who then also understand

00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:14.720 align:middle line:10%
the importance of knowing
how to be able to access it

00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:18.836 align:middle line:10%
in an aware space.

00:54:18.836 --> 00:54:23.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's like telling the
story, the hero's journey,

00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:26.330 align:middle line:84%
all these classic
Joseph Campbell stories,

00:54:26.330 --> 00:54:29.180 align:middle line:84%
but knowing and having the
awareness that they're all just

00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:32.233 align:middle line:84%
stories, and we don't have
to become victim to them.

00:54:32.233 --> 00:54:34.025 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, as we said,
remembering the choice.

00:54:34.025 --> 00:54:35.330 align:middle line:90%
>> The choice, exactly.

00:54:35.330 --> 00:54:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>> But then utilizing the
energy itself of the emotion--

00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:51.890 align:middle line:84%
feeling, honing, using,
musing the energy itself

00:54:51.890 --> 00:55:01.770 align:middle line:84%
of these emotions for
positivity for integration,

00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:10.040 align:middle line:84%
being able to harness the
forward-moving trajectory that

00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:15.590 align:middle line:84%
is within the energy itself of
these perhaps more challenging

00:55:15.590 --> 00:55:20.810 align:middle line:84%
emotions, to choose a
very positive definition

00:55:20.810 --> 00:55:25.460 align:middle line:84%
of just the frequency itself,
to truly transform it.

00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:28.130 align:middle line:90%


00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:33.570 align:middle line:84%
This is what your civilization
is doing at great lengths

00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:36.120 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And so by-- here's
where we throw it in--

00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:46.480 align:middle line:84%
following your joy in
each and every moment,

00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:51.070 align:middle line:84%
to the best of your ability,
without any insistence on where

00:55:51.070 --> 00:55:54.520 align:middle line:84%
it needs to lead you,
your higher selves

00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:58.510 align:middle line:84%
are in communication to
align you with any experience

00:55:58.510 --> 00:56:03.670 align:middle line:84%
that you may need to then
clear, and release, and look

00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:08.740 align:middle line:84%
at, and feel any of the residual
trauma that may have resulted

00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:09.745 align:middle line:90%
from this experience.

00:56:09.745 --> 00:56:10.620 align:middle line:90%
Does this make sense?

00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:11.050 align:middle line:90%
>> It makes sense.

00:56:11.050 --> 00:56:13.000 align:middle line:10%
So in essence, it's
almost, I don't have

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.170 align:middle line:10%
to do the work, so to say--

00:56:14.170 --> 00:56:16.400 align:middle line:10%
>> So to say, yes,
until it arises.

00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Until it arises
in the moment.

00:56:18.130 --> 00:56:18.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:19.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So I don't have to
go out and seek for it,

00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:20.675 align:middle line:90%
and I don't have to--

00:56:20.675 --> 00:56:21.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Not if that is--

00:56:21.570 --> 00:56:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>> --20 seconds with
a psychiatrist unless

00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:25.210 align:middle line:90%
it's in my highest excitement.

00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:25.885 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:56:25.885 --> 00:56:26.685 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:56:26.685 --> 00:56:28.270 align:middle line:84%
So if it's not, then
just know that it

00:56:28.270 --> 00:56:31.240 align:middle line:84%
will arise when
it needs to rise,

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:33.920 align:middle line:84%
and I'll deal with it when
it needs to be dealt with--

00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>> --if I haven't
dealt with it already.

00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:36.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:37.630 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:56:37.630 --> 00:56:38.740 align:middle line:90%
That's cool I like that.

00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:43.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is a
case-to-case basis as well.

00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:47.290 align:middle line:84%
This is always up
for the individual.

00:56:47.290 --> 00:56:58.270 align:middle line:84%
This is when the clarity is
required for self-awareness

00:56:58.270 --> 00:57:07.710 align:middle line:84%
that only the individual can
choose to do for their self

00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:15.060 align:middle line:84%
to truly know what is the
difference between heart's joy,

00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:19.530 align:middle line:84%
of wanting alignment,
healing, further expansion,

00:57:19.530 --> 00:57:25.110 align:middle line:84%
and what is denial,
suppression, apathy.

00:57:25.110 --> 00:57:27.360 align:middle line:84%
Only the individual
can truly know this.

00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:33.070 align:middle line:84%
But then also, all
contained in the guide

00:57:33.070 --> 00:57:36.230 align:middle line:84%
to your galaxy, the
guide to your universe

00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:40.320 align:middle line:84%
by acting on
whatever you feel is

00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:43.530 align:middle line:84%
your translation of your
joy, of your passion,

00:57:43.530 --> 00:57:49.790 align:middle line:84%
regardless if it is actually
from your programming

00:57:49.790 --> 00:57:54.760 align:middle line:84%
or truly indicative of
your highest frequency,

00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:56.950 align:middle line:84%
regardless of where
it is actually

00:57:56.950 --> 00:58:00.700 align:middle line:84%
coming from by
staying in the stream,

00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:03.820 align:middle line:84%
staying in the trajectory
of what you believe,

00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:08.330 align:middle line:84%
what you feel to the
best of your ability,

00:58:08.330 --> 00:58:13.130 align:middle line:84%
honestly and authentically is
the representation of your joy.

00:58:13.130 --> 00:58:16.380 align:middle line:90%


00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:20.480 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, those
different experiences

00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:24.020 align:middle line:84%
will align for
individuals to force

00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:29.008 align:middle line:84%
more up to their surface
for them to see to know,

00:58:29.008 --> 00:58:35.510 align:middle line:84%
oh, perhaps I do
need to look at this.

00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Avoidance, in this
way, can still

00:58:40.370 --> 00:58:44.420 align:middle line:90%
lead to a form of authenticity.

00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:47.780 align:middle line:84%
>> The event occurring in
another way, manifesting--

00:58:47.780 --> 00:58:49.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Manifesting in another way.

00:58:49.410 --> 00:58:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And it may be a very
challenging way,

00:58:53.910 --> 00:59:00.000 align:middle line:84%
but because of the innate
integrative nature of the all

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:04.950 align:middle line:84%
that is, it may not be
in what you would define

00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:11.280 align:middle line:84%
as "this life," quote
unquote, this physical form,

00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:12.960 align:middle line:90%
but it will happen.

00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:18.090 align:middle line:84%
It align for that soul's
journey at some point

00:59:18.090 --> 00:59:19.710 align:middle line:90%
in their exploration.

00:59:19.710 --> 00:59:29.030 align:middle line:10%
>> But it's also a gift to
show how we do create our--

00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:33.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, and how you can
transform what happens to you.

00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:40.090 align:middle line:84%
How it truly isn't what happens,
but what you do with what

00:59:40.090 --> 00:59:40.890 align:middle line:90%
happens.

00:59:40.890 --> 00:59:41.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, the opportunity.

00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:42.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Everything is an opportunity.

00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:44.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.
