00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:07.150 align:middle line:84%
starting the show and then

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.590 align:middle line:84%
when and how can I tell this

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:11.390 align:middle line:90%
to do this.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's amazing that 10
years ago when we were really

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:19.240 align:middle line:84%
in our infantile stages that you
saw it even though it was not

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.110 align:middle line:90%
even that transparent to us.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And so I really honor
your persistence

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.980 align:middle line:84%
and your belief in something
that was pretty intangible back

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:28.780 align:middle line:90%
then.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, it's still not
physical but it's more apparent

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.720 align:middle line:84%
and I guess we've all grown
so much in the 10 year period

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.010 align:middle line:84%
that everything is new and
different and wonderful.

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I saw it.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.790 align:middle line:84%
I knew there was
the story I wanted

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:47.800 align:middle line:84%
to tell but I didn't
know how to tell it,

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.120 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what platform.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And we had all these
ideas of documentaries

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:54.130 align:middle line:90%
and different things.

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And in the meantime I
was developing the show.

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:00.970 align:middle line:84%
So the show is doing well
and here's where we are.

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:03.820 align:middle line:90%


00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And we built the audience
now, prepping them

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.090 align:middle line:84%
I think with the idea of extra
dimensional, inter-dimensional.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And we have Lyrica
here to help also

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.890 align:middle line:84%
bridge these worlds who has
been bridging these worlds

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:19.220 align:middle line:90%
for many years now.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:23.810 align:middle line:84%

to tell her story.

our direct plug-in to source.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:10.160 align:middle line:84%
>> --Ever lose our direct
plug in source to source.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.570 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the key to who
we are, why we are here,

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:18.870 align:middle line:84%
and the gifts we are bringing
to humanity and the planet.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:22.110 align:middle line:84%
After 46 years in
my suit of autism,

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:27.360 align:middle line:84%
I am finally now a
tuned in Earth dweller.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Yet, this story began
in a very dark place.

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.419 align:middle line:84%
I felt the vibrational
harshness of this world

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:38.620 align:middle line:84%
as non-stop physical
pain to my body.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And as a lightly incarnated
being, I was in a body

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.510 align:middle line:90%
that I could not control at all.

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:47.520 align:middle line:84%
So I retreated as
much as possible

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:51.900 align:middle line:84%
into my out-of-body state in
the higher dimensional world.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Here, I was peacefully at
home in my source essence.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:59.860 align:middle line:84%
Yet, every time I was touched
by another human or something

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:03.250 align:middle line:84%
in the environment touched
me like a loud noise,

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:06.040 align:middle line:84%
I was plopped back
into this dreadful hell

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.110 align:middle line:90%
on Earth existence.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:09.550 align:middle line:90%
Here, nothing made sense.

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:13.620 align:middle line:84%
Earth life was all one
big non-stop nightmare.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:18.350 align:middle line:84%
>> So in many ways,
Lyrica is trying to--

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:22.370 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, doing work to
understand this reality?

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:26.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I began to finally gain
my mastery here, first,

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.200 align:middle line:84%
by writing my early life
story and then by dropping

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:34.150 align:middle line:84%
into a long intensive ascension
journey supported by my mentor.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:36.940 align:middle line:84%
That first step,
my early life story

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.700 align:middle line:84%
is told in our autism
book co-written

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.760 align:middle line:84%
with three other
non-verbal autistics.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.240 align:middle line:84%
Here, we share about our world
mainly to open up our hearts

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:49.510 align:middle line:84%
to who we are and why
we're here to help

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:52.090 align:middle line:90%
humanity find its truth.

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And that truth is we are
all expressions of source.

00:09:56.470 --> 00:10:01.840 align:middle line:84%
But in the human condition,
this truth gets lost easily.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Then later in my
ascension process,

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:09.580 align:middle line:84%
I was able to eventually embody
my best nonphysical essence

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:13.750 align:middle line:84%
into the human earthly
physical part of me.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:16.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm at peace here,
living in a more unified

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:19.400 align:middle line:90%
and realized state of being.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, I am source
connected and source

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:25.180 align:middle line:84%
empowered to act in this world
to support humanity and Earths

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:26.650 align:middle line:90%
ascension.

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:29.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, I can operate with
my feet on the ground

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:32.080 align:middle line:84%
to help create the higher
order, higher consciousness

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.720 align:middle line:90%
world that we all desire.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, I can experientially
demonstrate the much bigger

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.950 align:middle line:84%
story about who humans
really are and can become

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:45.040 align:middle line:84%
when they step into their
own awakening process

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.232 align:middle line:90%
or path of ascension.

00:10:47.232 --> 00:10:48.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:50.910 align:middle line:84%
So when you said
the other co-author,

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:53.322 align:middle line:84%
so would that be
Daniel and Adri?

00:10:53.322 --> 00:10:54.780 align:middle line:84%
Were they-- they
make appearances--

00:10:54.780 --> 00:11:01.960 align:middle line:84%
>> No, we had three other early
on co-writers Kellen, Leslie,

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:02.760 align:middle line:90%
and Sara.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And they were people that
I was privileged to work

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:06.640 align:middle line:90%
with for about 10 years.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And they typed just
like Lyrica does.

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:08.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>> And they shared
their outer world,

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.230 align:middle line:84%
inner world experiences
and taught me so much about

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:19.920 align:middle line:84%
the multidimensional nature
of who all of us are,

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:24.660 align:middle line:84%
the communing with angels and
soul traveling into dimensions

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:32.010 align:middle line:84%
and healing with light and just
all kinds of things that were

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:33.760 align:middle line:90%
very foreign to me.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:34.560 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:35.360 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:39.450 align:middle line:84%
>> But I think most telling
to me was just being

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:40.590 align:middle line:90%
in their presence.

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And I myself was pretty shut
down, and later to find out I'm

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:51.990 align:middle line:84%
autistic on the Asperger
end of things and life

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:53.710 align:middle line:84%
really wasn't
making sense to me.

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And I was having trouble
with mainstream integration.

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:01.570 align:middle line:84%
It was very difficult
and painful for me.

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And when I was in the presence
of Lyrica and the three

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:11.940 align:middle line:84%
other non-verbal autistics,
wow, just being with them,

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.340 align:middle line:84%
I started to feel
my own life awaken.

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.540 align:middle line:84%
I started feeling
who I really am.

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And I could let the guard
down, the shields down,

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:28.170 align:middle line:84%
and begin to really explore my
truth and my higher humanity.

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:32.310 align:middle line:84%
So I really credit Lyrica
and her first three friends

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:34.200 align:middle line:90%
as being my teachers.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's the whole
point of this first book.

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:43.920 align:middle line:10%
It's really these four beloveds
who write very poetically.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:49.900 align:middle line:10%
And it's really a transmission
of their higher essence,

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.240 align:middle line:10%
their higher heart.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And they're taking us
by the hand and heart

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:58.570 align:middle line:84%
and bringing us into our
own multidimensional world.

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:00.900 align:middle line:90%
What would you like to say, Lyr?

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:13.970 align:middle line:84%
I see the first book as a
heart story of our reason

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:20.370 align:middle line:84%
for being here in
the way we are.

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:24.750 align:middle line:90%
We aren't need to be fixed.

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:34.290 align:middle line:84%
We are wired for the
dimensional truth.

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:40.510 align:middle line:90%
We are here to share.

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And each-- we call them
NBAs, non-verbal autistics,

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:52.760 align:middle line:84%
are highlight
transmitters wherever

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.860 align:middle line:90%
they are, wherever they go.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And those who can
receive their light

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:03.080 align:middle line:84%
are blessed by their
presence like mom was.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:03.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:10.580 align:middle line:84%
There are others
who have honored us

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:22.480 align:middle line:84%
and are working parallel with
us like Susie Miller and Lori

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:30.130 align:middle line:84%
Shehu and just many of the
families and individuals who

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:31.780 align:middle line:90%
are not writing.

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.250 align:middle line:90%
And I'll just say Lyrica was OK.

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:35.500 align:middle line:84%
When Lyrica I first
wrote this book,

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.410 align:middle line:84%
I think our friend
Adri that you've met,

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.690 align:middle line:84%
I think they published the
very first bright light

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:41.810 align:middle line:90%
book on autism.

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, there
really weren't many typers.

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:49.570 align:middle line:84%
Lyrica was one who actually
intuited this whole process

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:53.500 align:middle line:84%
of facilitated typing before it
ever came to the United States

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.180 align:middle line:90%
from Australia.

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:58.900 align:middle line:84%
But since then, there's
been this fabulous explosion

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.780 align:middle line:84%
of people without
a speaking voice

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:03.790 align:middle line:84%
that are learning
how to type and that

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:05.740 align:middle line:84%
are typing about
their experiences

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:11.140 align:middle line:84%
and teaching about their inner
worlds and the outer world.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's just an
amazing explosion.

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And I also feel
like-- to give Lyrica

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:21.700 align:middle line:84%
soul grips and
credit, when we speak

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:27.160 align:middle line:84%
about non-verbal autistics,
Lyrica and her generation

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:28.690 align:middle line:90%
are pretty much that.

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:31.510 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's lots
of new ones coming in,

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:37.240 align:middle line:84%
the young ones just like the
babies that are coming in still

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.720 align:middle line:84%
with the same contract of
being lightly incarnated.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.550 align:middle line:84%
So they don't lose their
connection to source.

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:47.530 align:middle line:84%
But they're better organized
in the physical lane.

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's because the
ones like Lyrica and Adrian

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:56.140 align:middle line:84%
and Daniel and the ones that
are co-writers in our book,

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:57.550 align:middle line:90%
they were the first wavers.

00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And they held the frequency
at a really tough time

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.740 align:middle line:84%
in this planet so that
the young ones now

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.770 align:middle line:90%
can come in more organized.

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:07.060 align:middle line:90%
But I think it's--

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:10.510 align:middle line:90%
now, it's truly a spectrum.

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think with all of the
writers that are coming forth,

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:23.530 align:middle line:84%
I think it's time to really
take advantage of their emerging

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:29.810 align:middle line:84%
truth and make something
pretty amazing happen.

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:43.030 align:middle line:84%
I am not as loudly
connected to the whole tribe

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:56.300 align:middle line:84%
as I used to be because of my
personal experience of pulling

00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:09.410 align:middle line:84%
out for my inner journey
where I had to drop out

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:16.609 align:middle line:84%
my identity as a leader
in that soul group

00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:28.470 align:middle line:84%
to dive deep enough into my
own soul assignment here.

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:38.220 align:middle line:10%
And that's the point of our
second book called My Journey--

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.870 align:middle line:10%
or Lyrica's Journey
of Ascension.

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:42.650 align:middle line:10%


00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:55.140 align:middle line:10%
And I hit a point
where I knew that I

00:17:55.140 --> 00:18:00.000 align:middle line:10%
had written the first book--
and you'd blogged a lot too.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.140 align:middle line:90%
Didn't you?

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:10.890 align:middle line:84%
About my vision for a better
world and a higher expression

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:12.970 align:middle line:90%
of humanity.

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:16.290 align:middle line:84%
But I realized it
was time to stop--

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:17.190 align:middle line:90%
I got it.

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:18.810 align:middle line:84%
It's time to stop
writing about it

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:21.100 align:middle line:84%
and to start becoming
it and living it.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's where this
journey of ascension began.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:29.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Before we move any further,
I just wanted to introduce

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.640 align:middle line:84%
to the audience about the
board and about the telepathic

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.870 align:middle line:90%
communication you have.

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:36.810 align:middle line:84%
I forget because we've been
doing this for so many years.

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:41.032 align:middle line:84%
I forget that the
audience, this may be

00:18:41.032 --> 00:18:42.240 align:middle line:90%
their first time seeing this.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:46.830 align:middle line:84%
So right quick, what's
happening in this communication?

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:48.300 align:middle line:90%
You're using a typewriter.

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:49.470 align:middle line:90%
Could you just show--

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a QWERTY board
just like you would have

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.510 align:middle line:90%
on a keyboard on a computer.

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And the story about
how this has happened

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:00.150 align:middle line:84%
was Lyrica was about
eight years old.

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And we had been
doing a sight reading

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:06.130 align:middle line:90%
program out of Philadelphia.

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And so we were using word cards
for making choices in the day.

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:12.910 align:middle line:84%
And we-- I had this immense
library of these huge word

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:14.040 align:middle line:90%
cards all over the house.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.155 align:middle line:90%
And I just had this--

00:19:15.155 --> 00:19:16.530 align:middle line:84%
I thought I had
a brilliant idea.

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:17.905 align:middle line:84%
Of course, Lyrica
later tells me,

00:19:17.905 --> 00:19:22.120 align:middle line:84%
mom, I telepathically told you
this, and you figured it out.

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.740 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, to take
her to my computer,

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:29.130 align:middle line:84%
if she could read some,
maybe she could type.

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And of course, at first it
was just like gibberish.

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.270 align:middle line:84%
But then this very
clear sentence

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:36.870 align:middle line:84%
came through that was-- that
told me I am not retarded.

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:38.850 align:middle line:90%
I am intelligent.

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And that started our
journey that began--

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.640 align:middle line:84%
I got to really get to know
her for the first time.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.930 align:middle line:84%
She had-- I had no
recognition of her.

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:50.860 align:middle line:90%
She had no reco--

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:52.620 align:middle line:90%
She had no recognition of me.

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:57.780 align:middle line:84%
But the advent of communication
started the relationship

00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.790 align:middle line:84%
that has grown over
many, many decades.

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And she became a
pioneer in being

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:09.780 align:middle line:84%
able to finally access academic
classes in high school.

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:13.060 align:middle line:84%
Unheard of in her
era, in her time.

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:13.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And she even had to go
through a due process in order

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.200 align:middle line:90%
to kind of get there.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And the information we have is
it was the first due process

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.570 align:middle line:84%
case in the United
States that was based

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:26.310 align:middle line:90%
on this support of typing.

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And there's a reason for that
because the autistic brain

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.870 align:middle line:84%
has problems with
perspiration and praxis.

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And so just the rhythmic
up and down sort of

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:38.710 align:middle line:90%
keeps them focused without the--

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:41.730 align:middle line:84%
this gets-- takes over some
time just because it's fun

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:43.770 align:middle line:84%
or they get the
praxis where they

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:46.560 align:middle line:84%
sort of get stuck and can't
make the next movement.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:50.355 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're just lightly
gently holding her hand there.

00:20:50.355 --> 00:20:52.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I mean, she's actually
holding my finger at this point

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:55.695 align:middle line:84%
just because we're sitting in
a kind of unusual position.

00:20:55.695 --> 00:20:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:20:56.790 --> 00:21:00.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but if someone
else could feel what I feel,

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:02.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm certainly not
moving her hand.

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:06.120 align:middle line:84%
But we also have done
a lot of telepathy.

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And she's taught
me that as well.

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:11.190 align:middle line:90%
And that all began with--

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:14.850 align:middle line:84%
she was telling me on the typing
board, mom, you can hear me.

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:15.990 align:middle line:90%
I know you can hear me.

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going like,
Lyrica, I can't.

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:17.910 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:19.535 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:21:19.535 --> 00:21:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And then I would
start to say something

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.730 align:middle line:84%
or she would talk in some
kind of language that was

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:25.362 align:middle line:90%
sort of poetic and symbolic.

00:21:25.362 --> 00:21:27.570 align:middle line:84%
And I was just going like,
what is she really saying?

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:29.970 align:middle line:84%
So I would ask her, is this
what you're really saying?

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And then she would
type out, mummy,

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:34.530 align:middle line:84%
you're getting a telepathy--
you're getting me

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:35.580 align:middle line:90%
through telepathy now.

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:39.180 align:middle line:84%
So we started having
this guessing game.

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.140 align:middle line:90%
Am I getting you?

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.390 align:middle line:90%
And she would verify yes or no.

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And over time, it
just became something

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.470 align:middle line:90%
that we really trusted.

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:47.950 align:middle line:90%
And we use it all the time.

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:51.818 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we live in a non-verbal
household, which is unusual,

00:21:51.818 --> 00:21:52.860 align:middle line:90%
I guess, for most people.

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And we don't even
have a TV here.

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:55.502 align:middle line:90%
So it's really quiet.

00:21:55.502 --> 00:21:56.460 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a good thing.

00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:00.920 align:middle line:84%
>> We love the canyon winds
coming through and all

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.940 align:middle line:90%
the beautiful things in Sedona.

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:05.250 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>> So in many ways, then
she's teaching you and us that

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:15.210 align:middle line:84%
telepathic communication
is possible.

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And not only possible,
but you are experiencing

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:19.605 align:middle line:90%
that on a daily basis.

00:22:19.605 --> 00:22:23.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's how her
collective communicates.

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I'm
sure the higher

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:32.310 align:middle line:84%
beings in their own worlds and
planets communicate as well.

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's so
interesting because we

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:36.600 align:middle line:84%
have to have the internet
with all the connections

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.730 align:middle line:84%
and Wi-Fi and this and
that and the other.

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And how much easier when we just
tune in to the right frequency

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.340 align:middle line:90%
channel like a radio and just--

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:49.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm able to hear what
somebody on that same channel

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:50.230 align:middle line:90%
has to say.

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And also for them,
telepathy helps

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:57.760 align:middle line:84%
them stay higher in their
dimensional zone because--

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:01.480 align:middle line:84%
and that's part of what this
is doing too, because she gets

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:06.520 align:middle line:84%
to kind of borrow my grounding
rod through touch so that she

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:10.210 align:middle line:84%
can stay up in the higher
zones and still bring it down

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:11.740 align:middle line:90%
in some kind of cohesive way.

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>> One of the aspects that--

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:16.840 align:middle line:84%
through the show that
constantly comes up

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:22.210 align:middle line:84%
is we have these-- our extra
dimensional cosmic family

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:26.680 align:middle line:84%
that we're ascending
towards that

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.020 align:middle line:90%
era where we can meet together.

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:33.550 align:middle line:84%
They have to sort of
downplay their-- go

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:34.990 align:middle line:90%
into a heavier density.

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's difficult for them
too when we-- the challenges

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:41.830 align:middle line:90%
and things we work with.

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:44.230 align:middle line:84%
But the more we do our
work as individuals

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:47.238 align:middle line:84%
and as a collective, we're
raising the frequency.

00:23:47.238 --> 00:23:49.280 align:middle line:84%
So we kind of have to meet
in that halfway point.

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.947 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like
that's exactly what's

00:23:50.947 --> 00:23:52.690 align:middle line:90%
happening with you and Lyrica.

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:56.080 align:middle line:84%
You guys are finding
this medium point

00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:00.220 align:middle line:84%
where you can be in both
worlds at the same time.

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:02.500 align:middle line:90%
Anything to say about that?

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:19.480 align:middle line:84%
>> I am moving into a new
paradigm here because when I

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:29.270 align:middle line:84%
unify my soul and body or my
nonphysical and physical self,

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:43.420 align:middle line:84%
I am able to span all dimensions
simultaneously and pick up

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:51.280 align:middle line:84%
highlights in each
in a productive way.

00:24:51.280 --> 00:25:01.220 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, my cosmic
very vast self

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:11.030 align:middle line:84%
can actually inform and kind
of drive the car of my body

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:18.980 align:middle line:84%
into its ability
to manifest things

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:26.540 align:middle line:90%
I could never do here alone.

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:35.700 align:middle line:84%
It's the outcome of
my ascension journey

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:47.950 align:middle line:84%
that has totally
changed my reality here.

00:25:47.950 --> 00:26:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And this brings me to
talking about the importance

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:05.160 align:middle line:90%
of ascension right now.

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:09.600 align:middle line:84%
>> I never considered that
as important in my non-verbal

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:13.545 align:middle line:84%
autistic earlier life because I
didn't know what I was missing.

00:26:13.545 --> 00:26:17.730 align:middle line:90%


00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:22.590 align:middle line:84%
In my work with my mentor, I
knew I had a bigger purpose

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:25.320 align:middle line:84%
to do, but I was not
embodied enough to be

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:29.700 align:middle line:84%
able to help humanity in the
3D world the way I felt I could

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:32.590 align:middle line:90%
in sharing my light and love.

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:34.210 align:middle line:90%
But now, I am.

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:37.270 align:middle line:84%
I am a unifier of many
worlds and realities

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:39.970 align:middle line:84%
who has learned the
truth of my own being

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:45.730 align:middle line:84%
here to open up a similar
truth knowing in others.

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:49.900 align:middle line:84%
Many people shy away
from the word ascension,

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:51.580 align:middle line:84%
but maybe they don't
understand it right

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:53.740 align:middle line:90%
or it sounds offsetting.

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Our main connection
to that concept

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:58.750 align:middle line:84%
is through people like
Jesus who died and ascended,

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:01.720 align:middle line:84%
or maybe mystics on
the mountaintop who

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:06.290 align:middle line:84%
live very strict lives to
reach their Nirvana state.

00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Yet, those examples are not very
relatable as a realistic option

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:14.010 align:middle line:90%
for most of us in today's world.

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:16.800 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is ascension
belongs to everyone.

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:17.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:17.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:18.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:20.060 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's time.

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:22.880 align:middle line:84%
The light coming
into the planet now

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.700 align:middle line:84%
is allowing us to
make our ascension

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:29.100 align:middle line:90%
journey without having to die.

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:32.000 align:middle line:90%
So it's a living operation.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.150 align:middle line:84%
It's mainly about finding
our true essence and gifts

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:38.630 align:middle line:84%
and bringing them back home to
our families and communities

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:42.050 align:middle line:90%
as supports for their journeys.

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:45.200 align:middle line:84%
The technology of ascension
resides in the ability

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.050 align:middle line:90%
to transcend out of 3D.

00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:51.290 align:middle line:84%
It's such a terrible
prison for the soul.

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:55.310 align:middle line:84%
The crossover between 3D
to 5D is the greatest step

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:57.890 align:middle line:90%
that any human can take.

00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:00.200 align:middle line:84%
It has little to do
with the outer world.

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:04.220 align:middle line:84%
It is a total recalibration
of our inner world.

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:08.270 align:middle line:84%
It is a higher vibration of the
heart that informs and directs

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:13.130 align:middle line:84%
every thought and action
of our body and being.

00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:15.620 align:middle line:84%
It is like living
in Wonderland where

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:19.250 align:middle line:84%
there are no more opposites,
only harmony and love.

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:24.370 align:middle line:90%


00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:26.670 align:middle line:10%
That's the story of book 2.

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:29.520 align:middle line:10%
I don't begin to teach about
ascension conceptually.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:33.010 align:middle line:10%
I demo it totally through
my own experiences.

00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:34.890 align:middle line:10%
So it's like reading
an adventure story,

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:38.820 align:middle line:10%
yet getting downloaded with
lots of light for ascension.

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's my hope
for this book.

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:43.080 align:middle line:84%
It demos that even
someone like me

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.420 align:middle line:84%
who began life,
you could say, far

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:48.660 align:middle line:84%
behind the starting line
of most without a speaking

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.460 align:middle line:84%
voice and little
connection to my body,

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:54.240 align:middle line:84%
could rise up to
find the abilities,

00:28:54.240 --> 00:29:00.000 align:middle line:84%
even superpowers that belong
to all but are known by few.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.030 align:middle line:84%
Powers like telepathy,
bilocating, and soul

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:04.910 align:middle line:90%
traveling to other dimensions.

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:08.870 align:middle line:90%


00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:11.660 align:middle line:84%
I am now supported
by a very large group

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:15.890 align:middle line:84%
of planetary leaders in
the highest cosmic zones.

00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:18.020 align:middle line:84%
For many months,
we've been meeting

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:20.120 align:middle line:84%
at night in my
sleep time travels

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:23.960 align:middle line:84%
to orchestrate a
light delivery system

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.690 align:middle line:84%
to ensure Earth's
survival and platform

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:31.370 align:middle line:84%
to thrive as human
divine beings.

00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:34.400 align:middle line:84%
I watched others in
this tribe whose role

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.910 align:middle line:84%
it was to detect the hotspots
on Earth where the light was

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:41.600 align:middle line:90%
most absent or controlled.

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.910 align:middle line:84%
Delivery systems
were installed there

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:48.230 align:middle line:84%
to assure these pockets would
be light targets for humanity's

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:50.270 align:middle line:90%
shift into its higher reality.

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:53.708 align:middle line:90%


00:29:53.708 --> 00:29:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Phew.

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:56.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:59.640 align:middle line:90%
I had a question about--

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:04.350 align:middle line:84%
at night, she's saying
she does this grid work

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:07.710 align:middle line:84%
or working with
these other masters.

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And who are some
of these energies

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:19.170 align:middle line:84%
that she works with to help do
the acupuncture to the planet

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:22.310 align:middle line:90%
sort of thing?

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:26.670 align:middle line:90%
>> I hear your question.

00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:30.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't have a great answer
because in the field where

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:35.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm operating, personal identity
is not as apparent as the pure

00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:37.980 align:middle line:84%
light and divine
intelligence is.

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:41.010 align:middle line:84%
What I am touching on
here and speaking about

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:44.010 align:middle line:84%
is for my most
ascended patterning

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:46.620 align:middle line:84%
in these extremely
high dimensions

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:48.690 align:middle line:90%
in my nighttime travels.

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:53.910 align:middle line:84%
Here, I am having experiences
I haven't had before.

00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:56.820 align:middle line:90%
The me of me totally drops out.

00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And I become part of
this light factory

00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:01.500 align:middle line:90%
of love for planet Earth.

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's key for me to remember
that in my light stream form,

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:09.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm not allowed to directly
influence humanity's

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.030 align:middle line:90%
choices and outcomes.

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And instead, I am part of
a totality that is forever

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:20.610 align:middle line:84%
amplifying this planet's
own true light as humans

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:23.692 align:middle line:84%
become the new masters
walking on Earth.

00:31:23.692 --> 00:31:26.900 align:middle line:84%
But I am so hit now
by these light charges

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:28.550 align:middle line:90%
that are coming in at night.

00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And I know I bet others
are feeling them too.

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:36.020 align:middle line:84%
My mom and I, there's more
tiredness in our bodies,

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:38.910 align:middle line:84%
but our spirits are
bright and alive.

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:41.755 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I think
everybody's feeling it,

00:31:41.755 --> 00:31:43.130 align:middle line:84%
especially these
past few months.

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:45.410 align:middle line:84%
It's been really intense
for a lot of people.

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:47.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, the last--

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>> The last opening of the
floodgate was just a few days

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.690 align:middle line:90%
ago that I'm aware of.

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And these will continue
to support planet Earth.

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Yet, the real transformation
is up to the citizens

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:01.970 align:middle line:84%
here, finding their light
and living their truth.

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, changes have to
happen on the ground now.

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:07.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, feeling that strongly.

00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:08.500 align:middle line:90%
>> The most--

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:12.320 align:middle line:84%
>> The most important part of
my journey inward was my effort

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.000 align:middle line:90%
to embody.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.570 align:middle line:84%
I hope my strides will help
other non-verbal autistics

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:20.660 align:middle line:84%
become more grounded
and empowered in ways

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:24.680 align:middle line:84%
that enable humanity to more
easily receive their light

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:26.480 align:middle line:90%
and gifts.

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:29.390 align:middle line:84%
>> That's pretty neat, Lyrica,
the way all these new books are

00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:31.700 align:middle line:84%
coming out written by
non-verbal autistics,

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:33.380 align:middle line:90%
the artwork coming out.

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:35.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
just this explosion

00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:38.180 align:middle line:84%
that it's just really,
really exciting

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:43.005 align:middle line:84%
that these beloveds are really
being seen and appreciated

00:32:43.005 --> 00:32:43.805 align:middle line:90%
and honored.

00:32:43.805 --> 00:32:47.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and for me too,
that 10 years ago I was like,

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:49.080 align:middle line:90%
how do I tell this story?

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:53.090 align:middle line:84%
It's like it's so complex, and
are people going to receive it?

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- there was a
lot of worry from my side.

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:58.880 align:middle line:90%
But now, I feel--

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.280 align:middle line:84%
now, it's so easy
to tell this story.

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:04.160 align:middle line:84%
There's no-- there's-- the
groundwork has been laid.

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And people are willing
and ready to receive it

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:09.260 align:middle line:90%
in this form and fashion now.

00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's enough that
are ready to receive it.

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:14.390 align:middle line:84%
There's still some
reticent people

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:21.080 align:middle line:84%
that just haven't awakened or
been informed about the bigger

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.360 align:middle line:90%
picture here, but--

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:28.100 align:middle line:84%
and we feel like this whole
story of the ascension journey

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:32.660 align:middle line:84%
that everyone that's here on
the planet now-- right, Lyrica?

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:35.810 align:middle line:84%
Is on the hero's journey
that Joseph Conrad--

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:36.650 align:middle line:90%
Campbell, I'm sorry.

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, wrote about and
talked about so brilliantly.

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And yet, our understanding
is that many of them

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:47.180 align:middle line:84%
are doing it sort
of unconsciously.

00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's where they're kind
of getting bounced around a lot.

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:55.520 align:middle line:84%
But when someone sort of wakes
up and sees that this is really

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:59.870 align:middle line:84%
the point to why
we're here and what

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:03.830 align:middle line:84%
we're meant to be doing here
and really choose to make that

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:06.620 align:middle line:84%
a priority in their
life, however that

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:10.130 align:middle line:84%
might look to fill
whatever purpose they

00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:14.989 align:middle line:84%
may have here, that's when the
hero's journey sort of switches

00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:17.090 align:middle line:84%
gears and becomes
the path of ascension

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:18.860 align:middle line:84%
because it becomes
very conscious.

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we hope
Lyrica's book will be a rally

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:26.389 align:middle line:84%
call to what we're calling
the new consciousness

00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:29.717 align:middle line:84%
pioneers because all the
mess in this world today--

00:34:29.717 --> 00:34:32.300 align:middle line:84%
and we don't want to go into any
of the gloom and doom really.

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:37.489 align:middle line:84%
But realistically, we know that
the world is really struggling.

00:34:37.489 --> 00:34:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's because all the
problems that are being created

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:46.279 align:middle line:84%
and have been created were
created from within the mind

00:34:46.279 --> 00:34:48.080 align:middle line:90%
heartset of a 3D reality.

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:48.889 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:53.179 align:middle line:84%
>> And if we stay down in 3D,
there's no way we can fix all

00:34:53.179 --> 00:34:53.989 align:middle line:90%
of this.

00:34:53.989 --> 00:34:57.890 align:middle line:84%
We have to get into
5D or above in order

00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:00.020 align:middle line:84%
to be able to
create the solutions

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:02.610 align:middle line:84%
and the new institutions
and the new--

00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:03.610 align:middle line:90%
you were just telling me

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:03.630 align:middle line:90%
>> The bitcoins.

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:04.550 align:middle line:90%
>> About the bitcoins.

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:06.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, all the new--

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Decentralized
way of doing things.

00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:08.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:12.890 align:middle line:84%
So that's where the whole
journey of ascension

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:17.150 align:middle line:84%
is just so critical to our very
survival and to our thrival.

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And Lyrica talks about
the greatest step

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:25.500 align:middle line:84%
that any human can take is to
move from 3D into 5D and above.

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:26.300 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:31.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Has she experienced and
helped other civilizations go

00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:34.720 align:middle line:84%
through this shift
outside of humanity?

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:38.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow, that's a big question.

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:40.760 align:middle line:90%
Leave it to Reuben, right?

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:51.710 align:middle line:84%
I have done many other
civilization pop-ups.

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:59.990 align:middle line:84%
But my record keeping
of this undertaking

00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:07.670 align:middle line:84%
is not very
accessible right now.

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:16.805 align:middle line:84%
And I love how my
access to prior life--

00:36:16.805 --> 00:36:19.520 align:middle line:90%


00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.460 align:middle line:84%
prior lifetimes,
OK, prior lifetimes

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:35.540 align:middle line:84%
is totally based on present-day
purpose for me to stay focused.

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:36.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:38.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:40.110 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's what's relevant
now for this life.

00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:41.610 align:middle line:90%
We were here now so--

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think one of the things
that Lyrica's soul group is

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:51.330 align:middle line:90%
so lovingly showing us is that--

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:58.620 align:middle line:84%
I call it the new human design
or the higher human experience.

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And that is that
when we are really

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:08.760 align:middle line:84%
truly able to stay totally
pure connection to source,

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:15.360 align:middle line:84%
perpetual, powerful, that lifts
us up into the quantum field.

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And there, anything and
everything is possible.

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.100 align:middle line:84%
Like Lyrica said,
she started way

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:22.320 align:middle line:84%
behind the starting line
of most when she came here.

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:27.870 align:middle line:84%
But she was able to land in
some pretty amazing places

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:29.890 align:middle line:84%
and do some pretty
amazing things.

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's all because
it wasn't just her.

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:34.920 align:middle line:84%
Once she was in the
quantum field, all

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.980 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden, the things
that she couldn't do,

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:42.900 align:middle line:84%
that I couldn't
help her with that--

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:45.000 align:middle line:84%
all of those things
came to her aid

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.430 align:middle line:84%
like her mentor showing up
from literally nowhere, almost

00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:53.850 align:middle line:84%
out of thin air because
it was all orchestrated

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:55.170 align:middle line:90%
on a much higher plane.

00:37:55.170 --> 00:38:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And when we get to that ability
and operational knowingness,

00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:05.460 align:middle line:90%
wow, what can we manifest?

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:09.570 align:middle line:84%
>> It's really living kind of
in synchronicity and allowing

00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:13.260 align:middle line:84%
the bigger story to sort
of unfold without us trying

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:17.040 align:middle line:90%
to control it and master it.

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:19.620 align:middle line:84%
It's just accessing
what's already there.

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, as long as we're kind
of true to purpose and we stay

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:27.120 align:middle line:84%
in that higher dimensional zone,
it kind of happens through us

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:28.107 align:middle line:90%
and around us.

00:38:28.107 --> 00:38:29.940 align:middle line:84%
We don't even have to
really pull the string

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:31.920 align:middle line:90%
and play the music.

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:34.260 align:middle line:90%
It just-- and it's just--

00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:35.700 align:middle line:90%
it's so joyful.

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And I can say for me, maybe
I'm not in 5D, 6D all the time.

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:46.860 align:middle line:84%
But I spend enough time there
that even though this world is

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:52.890 align:middle line:84%
as crazy as it is, there
is right now the ability

00:38:52.890 --> 00:39:01.470 align:middle line:84%
to individually find that inner
peace and that dimensional zone

00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:06.960 align:middle line:84%
so that it changes the whole
experience of being here.

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:11.550 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't take away
the outside messiness,

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:18.540 align:middle line:84%
but it allows us to live a much
more meaningful and purposeful

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:22.330 align:middle line:84%
and really amazing
things happen.

00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:26.460 align:middle line:84%
I just-- every day, I'm
just like, wow, Lyrica,

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:28.980 align:middle line:84%
another amazing blessing
just kind of came

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:30.750 align:middle line:90%
flying through the front door.

00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:32.010 align:middle line:90%
It's just like--

00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:35.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, since starting this
journey with you guys 10 years

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:37.210 align:middle line:90%
ago and moving--

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:41.550 align:middle line:84%
the more I found that I moved
into the space, the quantum

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:45.330 align:middle line:84%
or this allowance and
utilizing these tools that I've

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:46.830 align:middle line:84%
been getting from
these interviews,

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:54.270 align:middle line:84%
the more I integrate
those tools and allowance,

00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:57.720 align:middle line:84%
which are compassion,
forgiveness, allowance,

00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:00.630 align:middle line:84%
flow, going into the
quantum, non judgment.

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:03.240 align:middle line:84%
These are all just what
the great masters have been

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:04.500 align:middle line:90%
teaching us forever, right?

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:08.280 align:middle line:84%
But when you actually
practically integrate them,

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:11.040 align:middle line:84%
totally enhances
this experience.

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:18.270 align:middle line:84%
It's like the difficulties
and the resistance

00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:19.740 align:middle line:90%
starts to melt away.

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:23.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, you-- we're in charge
of the resistance when

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:24.810 align:middle line:90%
we stop resisting, right?

00:40:24.810 --> 00:40:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And we just allow
the things to happen.

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Then just so much can
happen in a magical way.

00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:31.770 align:middle line:90%
This world becomes magical.

00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>> That's kind of
where we are right now.

00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:38.130 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty phenomenal.

00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:51.050 align:middle line:84%
When mom and I first realized
we needed to relocate to Sedona,

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:58.610 align:middle line:84%
the first message was
through our friend's horse

00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:04.650 align:middle line:84%
named Sedona, telling us
we would be moving here.

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:09.870 align:middle line:84%
Also, our new book
told us it didn't

00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:12.210 align:middle line:84%
want to be published
in Wickenburg

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:17.380 align:middle line:84%
where we were at the time kind
of finishing up life chapters.

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:21.810 align:middle line:84%
So we tried really hard
to find a house here.

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
kind of a nightmare.

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:28.497 align:middle line:84%
Every time we'd find
something we liked, we throw--

00:41:28.497 --> 00:41:30.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to kind of
take over for a minute.

00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:34.270 align:middle line:84%
We throw our hat in the
ring, and we wish and pray.

00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And it would always
go in other direction.

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And we even got to the
point of going, well,

00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:41.070 align:middle line:84%
let's just go find some
kind of rinky-dink rental.

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And even that was like so
competitive and not really

00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:47.190 align:middle line:90%
available.

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And then this-- the
pictures of this house

00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:51.960 align:middle line:84%
just sort of popped
on our computer.

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And I don't-- there wasn't even
a logical way that it showed

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.320 align:middle line:90%
up.

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And so we walked
into this front door.

00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And Lyrica always would
go to find her energy

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:03.180 align:middle line:84%
spot in wherever we went
to go look at a new house.

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And she went right
into the bedroom

00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:09.330 align:middle line:84%
and was facing straight
into a visual view

00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:10.800 align:middle line:90%
of Thunder Mountain.

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And she said she
just got downloaded

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:17.190 align:middle line:84%
with this huge lightning
bolt of energy.

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's when Thunder
started talking to her

00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:26.250 align:middle line:84%
and told her that
Thunder had actually

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:29.400 align:middle line:84%
been holding this house
for us, and that it

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:30.870 align:middle line:84%
was where we were
supposed to move

00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:34.620 align:middle line:84%
because Lyrica had a really
important future with Thunder.

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And this was on the grid line
that would support that future.

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And so Thunder
told Lyrica to tell

00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:44.820 align:middle line:84%
me to take every nickel,
diamond, penny that I had

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:46.980 align:middle line:84%
and throw it into the
ring and get this house.

00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:51.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And get the-- so three
or four hours later,

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:52.068 align:middle line:90%
the house was ours.

00:42:52.068 --> 00:42:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And two weeks later,
we had the keys.

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And this was like-- again,
one of those magical things

00:42:57.150 --> 00:43:01.320 align:middle line:84%
that after all the wishing and
hoping and trying and losing,

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:05.250 align:middle line:84%
this was just so
divinely orchestrated.

00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And that began your new
journey here, right?

00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:11.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:27.320 align:middle line:84%
I have been in constant contact
with Thunder as a light voice

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:32.495 align:middle line:90%
of my new life here.

00:43:32.495 --> 00:43:36.340 align:middle line:90%


00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:52.680 align:middle line:84%
I am landed now
inside Thunder, thanks

00:43:52.680 --> 00:44:02.310 align:middle line:84%
to some additional support
from my first meetup

00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:03.835 align:middle line:90%
with the Mitchell Hedges' skull.

00:44:03.835 --> 00:44:04.635 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:04.635 --> 00:44:06.370 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm glad you mentioned that.

00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:09.450 align:middle line:10%
That's yeah, that's actually
one of the reasons we sort

00:44:09.450 --> 00:44:12.360 align:middle line:10%
of reconnected after
a bit of a lull,

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:15.640 align:middle line:10%
was this project that we were
doing with the Mitchell Hedges'

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:16.440 align:middle line:10%
skull.

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:21.261 align:middle line:10%
And you had mentioned Mitchell
Hedges' skull in the book.

00:44:21.261 --> 00:44:22.386 align:middle line:90%
>> In the first book, yeah.

00:44:22.386 --> 00:44:23.130 align:middle line:90%
>> In the first book.

00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:25.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, because I had a big
experience with it back in like

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:26.580 align:middle line:90%
2000--

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:28.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- can't
remember, 8 or something.

00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:29.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And I had-- it was just
divine synchronicity.

00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:35.610 align:middle line:84%
We were-- six months ago,
we were working on the film.

00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:36.810 align:middle line:90%
So I just called you up.

00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And I said Gayle, hey,
we're going to be in Sedona.

00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:42.700 align:middle line:84%
Would want to revisit
Lyrica's story and journey?

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:44.033 align:middle line:90%
I think I'm ready to tell this.

00:44:44.033 --> 00:44:45.450 align:middle line:84%
By the way, we're
doing this thing

00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:46.533 align:middle line:90%
on Mitchell Hedges' skull.

00:44:46.533 --> 00:44:48.150 align:middle line:90%
And you're like, oh, this is--

00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:52.680 align:middle line:84%
and oh, and we're hanging
out with Adele and--

00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:53.595 align:middle line:90%
in Sedona.

00:44:53.595 --> 00:44:54.720 align:middle line:90%
That's where we're staying.

00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And then just-- I had no
idea about your history,

00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:00.150 align:middle line:90%
Lyrica's history with Sedona.

00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:02.800 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know any of that story.

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:08.110 align:middle line:84%
So our last time here, we
had this amazing unfolding

00:45:08.110 --> 00:45:08.910 align:middle line:90%
of events.

00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:16.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so again, the universe
works in magical and mighty

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:18.150 align:middle line:90%
ways but--

00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:20.113 align:middle line:84%
so now that you're
connected to Thunder

00:45:20.113 --> 00:45:21.780 align:middle line:84%
and you're hearing
the voice of Thunder,

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:26.940 align:middle line:84%
what's the next part
of that iteration?

00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:29.055 align:middle line:90%
I was taken inside--

00:45:29.055 --> 00:45:32.520 align:middle line:84%
>> I was taken inside the inner
sanctuary of Thunder where I

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:34.230 align:middle line:90%
saw many trails.

00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:39.120 align:middle line:10%
But at first, I was too scared
to venture into these pathways.

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:42.210 align:middle line:10%
Thunder encouraged
me to try one path.

00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:45.300 align:middle line:84%
I was instantly transported
to the inner sanctuary

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:46.980 align:middle line:90%
of Mount Shasta.

00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:50.220 align:middle line:84%
Here, I touched
briefly into the pocket

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:53.370 align:middle line:84%
of what I experienced
as the lost Lemurian

00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:57.360 align:middle line:90%
civilization harbored there.

00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:01.440 align:middle line:84%
Afterwards, I remember touching
these same inner Earth beings

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:03.990 align:middle line:84%
at the medicine
wheel here in Sedona.

00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:06.090 align:middle line:84%
That event happened
many years ago

00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:09.270 align:middle line:84%
with my friend Michael and
non-verbal autistic beloveds

00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:10.515 align:middle line:90%
Adrian and Daniel.

00:46:10.515 --> 00:46:12.272 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh wow.

00:46:12.272 --> 00:46:16.700 align:middle line:84%
>> My now time heart feels so
at home in Lemuria that I began

00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:20.420 align:middle line:84%
a nighttime journey program
inside these pathways that

00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:23.610 align:middle line:84%
seemed to cover
the entire planet.

00:46:23.610 --> 00:46:28.040 align:middle line:84%
I dropped into various Lemurian
timelines that I met there.

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:32.090 align:middle line:84%
My other most realized
location was in Tibet.

00:46:32.090 --> 00:46:36.410 align:middle line:84%
Here, the Lemurian population
was different but equally as

00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:39.470 align:middle line:90%
light and higher truth holding.

00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:42.470 align:middle line:84%
That's when I began to
realize I was being journey

00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:45.860 align:middle line:84%
to many Lemurian inner
Earth civilizations

00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:50.930 align:middle line:84%
now live here to embody the
Lemurian template for others

00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:53.030 align:middle line:90%
to receive in some way.

00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:56.855 align:middle line:84%
>> From Lyrica's
words, what is Lemuria?

00:46:56.855 --> 00:47:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>> It is the only time I
remember being on Earth.

00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:02.750 align:middle line:10%
And it was such a
high-vibe paradise

00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:06.095 align:middle line:10%
of light beings
interconnected with nature.

00:47:06.095 --> 00:47:08.865 align:middle line:90%


00:47:08.865 --> 00:47:12.110 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm just flashing on the
movie, The Avatar movie.

00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:13.080 align:middle line:90%
>> The Avatar movie?

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, yeah, just the visions
of the trees and all of that

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:19.100 align:middle line:90%
just that kind of

00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:21.106 align:middle line:84%
>> How everything was
interconnected the connections,

00:47:21.106 --> 00:47:21.906 align:middle line:90%
yeah, I think--

00:47:21.906 --> 00:47:22.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:23.590 align:middle line:90%
We talk--

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:27.650 align:middle line:84%
>> We talk about the new human
design being the return to a 5D

00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:29.480 align:middle line:90%
or above experience.

00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:32.030 align:middle line:84%
But now, I think
the return is back

00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:34.100 align:middle line:84%
to what we were as
light-bearing humans

00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:35.880 align:middle line:90%
back in Lemuria before the fall.

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:36.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Before the fall.

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:37.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:37.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Before the fall.

00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:38.620 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:43.620 align:middle line:84%
So approximately-- would that
be 13,000 years or 26,000?

00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Not good at that math.

00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:46.820 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>> We'll let's you be
the expert on that one.

00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>> We'll figure that
one out later, but--

00:47:49.310 --> 00:47:51.852 align:middle line:84%
>> You've got other people that
can help you with that, but--

00:47:51.852 --> 00:47:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>> So cool you got to experience
the inner Earth beings

00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:58.165 align:middle line:90%
and being in that energy.

00:47:58.165 --> 00:48:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>> I love knowing the true
human light in this way.

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:06.090 align:middle line:84%
It's like returning
home without leaving.

00:48:06.090 --> 00:48:07.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And is-- my understanding,
maybe Lyrica could reiterate it

00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:19.280 align:middle line:84%
on this, is that as
we ascend humanity,

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:24.350 align:middle line:84%
we get to reconnect with our
inner Earth being family.

00:48:24.350 --> 00:48:26.240 align:middle line:90%
Is how that works?

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:30.950 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know the outcome,
but I know my own journey.

00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:33.230 align:middle line:84%
I first looked at
them from the outside

00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:36.410 align:middle line:84%
in like looking
through a window.

00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:39.860 align:middle line:84%
As I took on more of their
divine template into mine,

00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:44.570 align:middle line:84%
I began to have more experiences
of being inside their world,

00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:49.070 align:middle line:84%
no longer a spectator
outside looking in.

00:48:49.070 --> 00:48:53.000 align:middle line:84%
I think that demos what you
were suggesting, Reuben.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.620 align:middle line:84%
At first, I had to stand outside
to view and witness them.

00:48:57.620 --> 00:49:01.190 align:middle line:84%
As I gained my light
patterning, similarly, I

00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:05.900 align:middle line:84%
was ushered in and blended
into their civilization.

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:08.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't recall many
details about their life

00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:10.790 align:middle line:84%
there because I was
interested mainly

00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:13.310 align:middle line:90%
in their light patterning.

00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:17.990 align:middle line:84%
That was my entry point and
holy soul assignment there.

00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:19.406 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:49:19.406 --> 00:49:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And how cool to be here and
have that connection to Shasta.

00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:26.720 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea it was
connected like that.

00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:30.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Since then, I have taken
new nighttime journeys

00:49:30.590 --> 00:49:34.610 align:middle line:84%
into the highest dimensional
zones I've ever experienced.

00:49:34.610 --> 00:49:39.260 align:middle line:84%
Here, as I mentioned earlier,
the me of me disappears.

00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And I am truly only the
vastness and intelligence

00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:44.240 align:middle line:90%
of the creator.

00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:48.500 align:middle line:84%
It is such an amazing reality,
reminding me of the great truth

00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:50.960 align:middle line:84%
that each one of
us is the essence

00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:53.930 align:middle line:90%
and expression of source.

00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:57.440 align:middle line:84%
When I wake up in the morning,
I have to go through a very

00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:00.065 align:middle line:84%
elaborate re-entry
process that can take--

00:50:00.065 --> 00:50:03.544 align:middle line:90%


00:50:03.544 --> 00:50:05.170 align:middle line:84%
>> How much time
do you think it is?

00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:09.520 align:middle line:84%
>> It can take 10 minutes
or more to reinstall my soul

00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:13.270 align:middle line:84%
bubbles into my
physical body as me.

00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:16.660 align:middle line:84%
In those 10 minutes, I'm
still able to draw down

00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:21.000 align:middle line:84%
portions of that experience
and put them into words.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.850 align:middle line:84%
Yet, the words are
not near as powerful

00:50:23.850 --> 00:50:26.760 align:middle line:84%
as the transmission of
this high dimensional unity

00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:29.100 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:32.100 align:middle line:84%
But I am looking forward to
sharing these transmissions

00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:34.560 align:middle line:90%
maybe in a pyramid portal.

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:37.500 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to see if others
can be dearly touched

00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:41.910 align:middle line:84%
in their journeys by my
experiences not likely for them

00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:44.010 align:middle line:90%
to have.

00:50:44.010 --> 00:50:47.010 align:middle line:84%
The only downside is
sometimes I get so

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:49.890 align:middle line:84%
immersed in my
non-physical reality,

00:50:49.890 --> 00:50:54.015 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not sure if
I'm still alive here.

00:50:54.015 --> 00:50:56.625 align:middle line:90%
>> And it brings up--

00:50:56.625 --> 00:50:59.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Brings up my
topic of transition.

00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:03.720 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I'm complete here,
I don't know about timeline.

00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:08.700 align:middle line:84%
That's when I will enter
into my return home holiness.

00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:11.760 align:middle line:84%
As a sign of that
destiny, I am now

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:14.730 align:middle line:84%
hovered over by my
Sedona spaceship that is

00:51:14.730 --> 00:51:17.520 align:middle line:90%
very near to me all the time.

00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:22.230 align:middle line:84%
Others can't see it as it
is in a very tall dimension.

00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:24.600 align:middle line:84%
Yet, it flashes its
light to me easily

00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:27.210 align:middle line:84%
in the form of
attendee transmission.

00:51:27.210 --> 00:51:31.020 align:middle line:84%
What I receive is encoded with
a visual display of the ship's

00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:34.680 align:middle line:84%
frequency patterning and a
sound recording of its vibration

00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:38.340 align:middle line:84%
to make sure I
notice its presence.

00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, my love
affair with that spaceship

00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:44.760 align:middle line:84%
is a big part of
our new book, where

00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:48.810 align:middle line:84%
tell a story of how it helped
me in my journey of becoming

00:51:48.810 --> 00:51:49.740 align:middle line:90%
more embodied.

00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:52.908 align:middle line:90%


00:51:52.908 --> 00:51:54.282 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:51:54.282 --> 00:51:59.960 align:middle line:10%
>> I am grateful--

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:03.140 align:middle line:10%
>> I am grateful for this time
to remember and share tiny

00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:07.670 align:middle line:10%
pieces of my life, hoping they
may inspire others to step

00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:11.060 align:middle line:10%
into their ascension
journey because to me,

00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:13.640 align:middle line:10%
nothing else truly matters here.

00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:18.080 align:middle line:10%
Yet, the good news is all of
our outer world experiences

00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:21.620 align:middle line:10%
are part of the essence of
our inner world transformation

00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:23.180 align:middle line:10%
into our ascension.

00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:25.886 align:middle line:90%


00:52:25.886 --> 00:52:28.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, you've inspired me.

00:52:28.530 --> 00:52:31.140 align:middle line:90%
Here we are yet again.

00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:34.020 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, what a reflection.

00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:38.250 align:middle line:84%
The inner world is
coming out, right?

00:52:38.250 --> 00:52:42.730 align:middle line:84%
These inner world civilizations,
the more we connect with them,

00:52:42.730 --> 00:52:45.525 align:middle line:84%
it's sort of a symbol
of going inside.

00:52:45.525 --> 00:52:46.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Do they want--

00:52:46.890 --> 00:52:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Lyrica, do you think they
want us to know them more?

00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>> They would love to be
connected to more light bearers

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:54.090 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:52:54.090 --> 00:52:58.440 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is the distance
between most light held here

00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:02.385 align:middle line:84%
and their light under the
Earth is a pretty big step.

00:53:02.385 --> 00:53:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, we'll get there.

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:05.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:07.060 align:middle line:90%
>> We are getting there.

00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:07.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah we are.

00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:12.760 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating, exciting.

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:14.555 align:middle line:10%
Wow, stay tuned.

00:53:14.555 --> 00:53:15.555 align:middle line:10%
I always say stay tuned.

00:53:15.555 --> 00:53:15.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Stay tuned.

00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:17.250 align:middle line:10%
Well, with that, why
don't we take a break.

00:53:17.250 --> 00:53:18.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Sure.

00:53:18.050 --> 00:53:19.260 align:middle line:10%
>> Get some food.

00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:20.940 align:middle line:90%
I think Lyrica is hungry.

00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:24.890 align:middle line:90%
