00:00:02.988 --> 00:01:14.750 align:middle line:90%


00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.120 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, well, Shaun,
thanks for being here.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.365 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, well, thanks
for the invitation.

00:01:18.365 --> 00:01:19.490 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful to be here.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:20.415 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing place.

00:01:20.415 --> 00:01:22.540 align:middle line:84%
>> We've been talking about
doing this for a while.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, getting together here.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.660 align:middle line:10%
>> And you're mostly
based in Hawaii.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.522 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, on Maui for the last
10 years mostly, I think.

00:01:30.522 --> 00:01:32.300 align:middle line:90%
So I love it there.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful spot.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And I have family in here
in California up in Santa Cruz

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.180 align:middle line:90%
and down in Laguna.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.145 align:middle line:84%
So still, in a sense, I
have one foot in California

00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:47.270 align:middle line:90%
and most of my foot in Maui.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you get an excuse to
come back to the mainland every

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.930 align:middle line:90%
now and then.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.763 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you would
just end up being away,

00:01:52.763 --> 00:01:54.530 align:middle line:90%
because it's like paradise.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.390 align:middle line:90%


00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Later, we're going to
get in some channeling.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.460 align:middle line:84%
But what got you into
channeling and this sort

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.640 align:middle line:84%
of wacky world we're in,
where we make contact

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.854 align:middle line:90%
with these other beings?

00:02:08.854 --> 00:02:11.590 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, it's something--

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.925 align:middle line:10%
I'd say, it snuck up on me.

00:02:12.925 --> 00:02:14.300 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that
channeling was

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.780 align:middle line:84%
something people did until
maybe just a few months before I

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.270 align:middle line:84%
started channeling--
as far as I can recall.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.940 align:middle line:84%
It's something I realize
that-- channeling--

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.440 align:middle line:84%
I've had many steps
along the way.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that,
as time goes forward,

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.610 align:middle line:84%
steps that I've taken in the
past come to my awareness, oh,

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.130 align:middle line:84%
that was one of those
things that helped get me

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.720 align:middle line:90%
to where I am in channeling.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.040 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not aware right now.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember everything
in the past, all the steps.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.660 align:middle line:84%
But I, of course, realize
now that I've been with--

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.510 align:middle line:84%
primarily, I channel Ishuwa
of the Yahyel civilization.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.060 align:middle line:90%
I channel a group of friends.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.110 align:middle line:90%
Initially, they came--

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Group of friends.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.330 align:middle line:84%
>> The group of friends came
through initially in terms

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.410 align:middle line:90%
of giving a name.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.952 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, that's the
name they gave you.

00:02:58.952 --> 00:03:00.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was
back around 1995.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:01.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.490 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.040 align:middle line:90%
>> And that was the name.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And they were like,
we can give you

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.870 align:middle line:84%
other names of those that are
part of the group of friends.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And I realized,
there's a lot of names.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.190 align:middle line:84%
OK, do I want to
try and remember

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.250 align:middle line:90%
all these different names?

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.120 align:middle line:84%
They're like, no, group
of friends is good.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.530 align:middle line:84%
Then they came through
with Gilgamesh.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.600 align:middle line:84%
So that was one they really
wanted me to know about--

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.400 align:middle line:90%
Gilgamesh.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Gilgamesh.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.270 align:middle line:90%
Why do I know that name?

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.070 align:middle line:90%
What's Gilgamesh?

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one of the older
stories in history that's been

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.490 align:middle line:84%
recorded is the
story of Gilgamesh.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.770 align:middle line:84%
So there is some
connection to the Gilgamesh

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.700 align:middle line:84%
that I am channeling
to these stories.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>> There is some connection.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.650 align:middle line:90%
But it's not a literal.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's not the
exact person, per se,

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.720 align:middle line:84%
that these stories
were written about.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And what is that
story, roughly?

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.160 align:middle line:90%


00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>> My understanding
is he was a king.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And at one point, he gave that
up to look for immortality.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's my understanding
of that story.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.240 align:middle line:84%
I haven't really delved
into it at length.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So kind of an
ascended master idea?

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Ascended master-- well, in my
sense, he was physical being--

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.040 align:middle line:90%
the idea in the story is.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's just how I understand
how the story is written.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And then the person,
as far as the Gilgamesh

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.850 align:middle line:84%
that I am connecting
to, was alive,

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.450 align:middle line:84%
did have a physical lifetime
on Earth several thousand years

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.710 align:middle line:84%
ago-- let's say, approximately
12,000, 13,000 years ago--

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.560 align:middle line:90%
right in that area.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.690 align:middle line:84%
So I had a connection
in a physical lifetime

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.328 align:middle line:90%
with Gilgamesh, too.

00:04:34.328 --> 00:04:36.620 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the reasons
I have a strong connection

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.390 align:middle line:90%
having lived in that lifetime.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.640 align:middle line:84%
We were good friends
in that lifetime.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And so he was one of the first
ones from the group of friends

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:44.750 align:middle line:90%
and Gilgamesh.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, OK, so they
were together.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And I had many
synchronicities when his name

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.322 align:middle line:90%
came through that occurred.

00:04:54.322 --> 00:04:56.030 align:middle line:84%
I had been channeling
a group of friends.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And then there was obviously
a more focused consciousness.

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And I hadn't
received a name yet.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And I was in a channeling
class at the time, which I was

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.590 align:middle line:90%
about once a week for a year.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.440 align:middle line:84%
I had already started
channeling by this time.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.570 align:middle line:84%
I got into the channeling
class, because I

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.000 align:middle line:84%
wanted to become more
comfortable channeling in front

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.290 align:middle line:90%
of other people.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.010 align:middle line:84%
So for a year in
this class, I almost

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.970 align:middle line:84%
never channeled when it came
around for my turn to channel.

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And there were other people who
were not channeling at all yet.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.460 align:middle line:90%
It was all very new to them.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, if I had a friend
or two back at my house

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.170 align:middle line:84%
or at their house, OK,
I'm channeling nonstop.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm recording
channelings at this point.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.340 align:middle line:90%
I used to write questions down.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And then I would go into
the channeling state.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And I would just
open my eyes, and I

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.280 align:middle line:90%
would see one of the questions.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.360 align:middle line:90%
And that would engage.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.830 align:middle line:90%
An answer would come through.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.430 align:middle line:90%
And I had it recorded.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And so then I could go
back after I came out

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.447 align:middle line:84%
of the channeling state and
listen to the recording.

00:05:57.447 --> 00:06:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And I knew which question
was being answered.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And so having done that,
when I got into this class,

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.140 align:middle line:90%
it was always interesting.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.500 align:middle line:84%
I got in there so I
could channel for people.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't
happening that way.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.643 align:middle line:90%
>> Getting over the fear factor.

00:06:10.643 --> 00:06:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>> I was also learning
how it could be taught.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And that was very
fascinating to me to learn.

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.830 align:middle line:84%
Because it was a very
good teacher there.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And also, I was learning,
experiencing other people

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.810 align:middle line:90%
learning to channel.

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And that was
fantastic experience

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.410 align:middle line:90%
to be a part of that.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.240 align:middle line:84%
Because for me,
channeling came very fast.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.920 align:middle line:90%
It came very easy.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.485 align:middle line:84%
And I had only just
learned that it

00:06:35.485 --> 00:06:37.610 align:middle line:84%
was something people did
just a short time before I

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.360 align:middle line:90%
started doing it.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And so at one of those
classes, one of the students

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.960 align:middle line:84%
had been channeling
for many years

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.070 align:middle line:84%
and would come to the
class, because she enjoyed

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.240 align:middle line:84%
being around other people
who were doing channeling

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.770 align:middle line:90%
and learning to channel.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.600 align:middle line:84%
She brought a painting
in that, it turns out,

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.540 align:middle line:84%
it had been painted in
a channeling process

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:04.080 align:middle line:84%
by Luiz Gasparetto who
was a healer from Brazil.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And he has been up in the
area in Southern California

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:07.910 align:middle line:90%
for a while.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And he would do
channeling sessions

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.160 align:middle line:84%
where he paints the
master painters,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.130 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, people like Picasso,
and Modigliani, and Monet.

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:19.248 align:middle line:84%
And he'd, in a sense,
close his eyes.

00:07:19.248 --> 00:07:21.290 align:middle line:84%
Or he doesn't really pay
attention to the canvas.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And he has all of
these acrylics paints.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And he just goes about
it in a very fast--

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.240 align:middle line:84%
and he puts together
these images

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.350 align:middle line:84%
of faces and people
portraits, in a sense.

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And different ones
look like they

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:36.830 align:middle line:84%
were painted by a
different master painter,

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.010 align:middle line:84%
like Picasso, or
Monet, or Modigliani.

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And so one of those--
this woman brought one in.

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And she was all
excited about it.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And I had just
started channeling.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.840 align:middle line:84%
I had received a
message, like, the night

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.170 align:middle line:84%
before that I'm channeling
this person named Gilgamesh.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:56.872 align:middle line:84%
And she brings this painting
in the next day to class

00:07:56.872 --> 00:07:57.830 align:middle line:90%
and goes, look at this.

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.290 align:middle line:90%
Luiz Gasparetto challenged this.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:00.090 align:middle line:90%
And I just got it.

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:02.258 align:middle line:90%
And it's of Gilgamesh.

00:08:02.258 --> 00:08:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And the people in the class
were like, whoa, Gilgamesh.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.280 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, what?

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.885 align:middle line:84%
I'd never heard of
Gilgamesh before.

00:08:07.885 --> 00:08:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And most of them
knew who it was.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.080 align:middle line:90%
>> They knew the story.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.455 align:middle line:84%
>> They really knew the story
and the history behind that

00:08:12.455 --> 00:08:13.255 align:middle line:90%
name.

00:08:13.255 --> 00:08:14.713 align:middle line:84%
And they were all
excited about it.

00:08:14.713 --> 00:08:15.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, whoa.

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.720 align:middle line:84%
I just got the name for
this person yesterday.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.070 align:middle line:90%
Here's the painting.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And so we were also doing some
other things that came through

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:27.380 align:middle line:84%
in the next class or two,
where the group of us

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:31.880 align:middle line:84%
were channeling letters
one letter at a time.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.898 align:middle line:84%
And one person would
write the letters down.

00:08:33.898 --> 00:08:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And one of the beings
that we're channeling

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.198 align:middle line:90%
came through as Gilgamesh.

00:08:37.198 --> 00:08:38.990 align:middle line:84%
So all these things
came through like that.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:41.630 align:middle line:84%
So there was this
real synchronistic.

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.909 align:middle line:84%
And so, for me, the unfolding
and experiencing that

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:47.830 align:middle line:84%
was a wonderful-- to
get to go through that.

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:50.390 align:middle line:84%
>> And when did you start
channeling the Yahyel?

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, so, of course, I've
realized now I've been with

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.970 align:middle line:90%
Ishuwa since before I was born.

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:59.130 align:middle line:84%
But when he came through, I
hadn't been aware of that.

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:08.670 align:middle line:84%
So I had been to one of Bashar's
channelings back around 2006,

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:09.470 align:middle line:90%
I believe.

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:11.690 align:middle line:90%
It might have been 2007.

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:13.460 align:middle line:90%
And I went home that night.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.497 align:middle line:84%
And I went into my
own channeling time.

00:09:16.497 --> 00:09:18.830 align:middle line:84%
>> And by this time, you were
already channeling a group

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:19.880 align:middle line:90%
of friends.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.790 align:middle line:90%
>> So yeah, this was 2006, 2007.

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:24.680 align:middle line:90%
So I had been channeling for--

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:25.940 align:middle line:90%
I started in '95.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.120 align:middle line:84%
So this was over 10 years now
that I had been channeling.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And I had been doing for people,
and groups here and there,

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:34.870 align:middle line:90%
and individuals.

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And so I had been bringing
through a group of friends,

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:39.590 align:middle line:84%
and Gilgamesh, and
a few other names

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:42.740 align:middle line:90%
that I had connected with.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And so there I was channeling
a group of friends.

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:49.677 align:middle line:84%
It was, like, a night
after I'd been--

00:09:49.677 --> 00:09:51.510 align:middle line:84%
it might have been the
same night, actually,

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:52.493 align:middle line:90%
that I came back--

00:09:52.493 --> 00:09:53.910 align:middle line:84%
it might have been
the next night.

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.268 align:middle line:90%
I don't recall the exact.

00:09:55.268 --> 00:09:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And it was a group
of friends-- said,

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.938 align:middle line:84%
so we have a group
of beings here

00:09:58.938 --> 00:10:00.230 align:middle line:90%
that would like to talk to you.

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:03.680 align:middle line:84%
They'd like to have a get
together if you're interested.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.418 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, well, OK--
and I had some discussion

00:10:07.418 --> 00:10:08.460 align:middle line:90%
with my group of friends.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:09.418 align:middle line:90%
So what are they about?

00:10:09.418 --> 00:10:11.080 align:middle line:90%
Why are they interested in?

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And there was a very
cohesive interest

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:19.390 align:middle line:84%
in connection of spirit,
and of direction,

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:22.430 align:middle line:84%
and of interest
in life to share,

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:25.010 align:middle line:84%
and to uplift, and to
bring about healing,

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.710 align:middle line:84%
and bring about information that
would be very useful for people

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.665 align:middle line:84%
in a very positive and
self-empowering way.

00:10:29.665 --> 00:10:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
that sounds like a group

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:32.748 align:middle line:90%
I'm interested in talking to.

00:10:32.748 --> 00:10:33.582 align:middle line:90%
Let's just sit down.

00:10:33.582 --> 00:10:34.640 align:middle line:90%
And that was all it was.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.390 align:middle line:84%
We were just going
to-- and a channeling--

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:37.630 align:middle line:90%
we're going to have this.

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:40.580 align:middle line:84%
So the next night at
the appointed hour,

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:43.150 align:middle line:84%
I sat down and got in my
channeling state connected

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.150 align:middle line:90%
to the group of friends.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And then they acted to connect
this other extraterrestrial

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:53.180 align:middle line:84%
group and didn't say
anything about who it was.

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And so I was
connecting with them

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.160 align:middle line:84%
through the assistance of the
energy of the group of friends

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.490 align:middle line:90%
and Gilgamesh.

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And so through that
conversation and connection,

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:04.850 align:middle line:84%
there was obviously
a very powerful,

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:08.570 align:middle line:84%
uplifting communication and
connection for me and for them.

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:11.170 align:middle line:10%
And so I agreed to--

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:11.970 align:middle line:10%
I said, well, wow.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:17.490 align:middle line:10%
The idea was-- would you
like to channel someone from

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:19.740 align:middle line:10%
our civilization and
share some of our--

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.560 align:middle line:10%
what we're about with your
civilization, with people there

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.880 align:middle line:10%
who are interested?

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And it just seemed
like a great fit.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:26.670 align:middle line:90%
I was really excited.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:27.470 align:middle line:90%
It felt great.

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:28.690 align:middle line:90%
So I said, sure.

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:31.970 align:middle line:90%
And then there was, OK, so--

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And then they kind of stepped
back a little bit and group

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:35.360 align:middle line:90%
of friends.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And here then, they say, are
some exercises for you to do.

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.680 align:middle line:84%
So I might have been
channeling over 10 years.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.690 align:middle line:84%
Here's some exercises
to do to make

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:44.400 align:middle line:90%
this connection a little more--

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Easier.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, to strengthen
this connection with this

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:51.360 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial civilization.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.530 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:55.050 align:middle line:84%
So for maybe six
to eight months,

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:56.800 align:middle line:84%
I was doing these
exercises regularly.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:57.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.760 align:middle line:90%
>> And some of it was new to me.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.540 align:middle line:84%
Because I had taken
some channeling classes.

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And I had encountered a variety
of exercises for channeling.

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And some of it, I
was familiar with.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:11.980 align:middle line:90%
But I kept doing it.

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
easy, very simple.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:16.530 align:middle line:90%
But it was new for me.

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And it was opening me up
to different vibrations

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:19.623 align:middle line:90%
to connect more with them.

00:12:19.623 --> 00:12:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And it made it easier for
them to connect to me.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And then at that point shortly
after that, I actually moved--

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.310 align:middle line:84%
that was when I
was in California.

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:28.710 align:middle line:84%
I was down in the Laguna
area in Southern California.

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:30.450 align:middle line:90%
I moved to Maui.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:32.590 align:middle line:90%
And I kept doing it.

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And then I had the
opportunity once--

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:41.430 align:middle line:84%
it was one of the exercises that
I had been doing been doing.

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:45.850 align:middle line:84%
I started to bring
through sounds.

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:55.601 align:middle line:84%
And the first sound
was iiii, iiii,

00:12:55.601 --> 00:12:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And that went on for
a couple of minutes--

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:05.020 align:middle line:90%
and after that, shhhh.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.783 align:middle line:84%
And that goes on for
a couple of minutes--

00:13:06.783 --> 00:13:07.720 align:middle line:90%
shhhh.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.668 align:middle line:84%
So they've I've
got iiii and shhhh.

00:13:10.668 --> 00:13:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
where this is going.

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:12.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.400 align:middle line:90%
This is this an exercise.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.420 align:middle line:90%
It's another exercise for me.

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:17.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:20.150 align:middle line:90%
And then it gets--

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:22.030 align:middle line:90%
shhh, oooo, and waaa.

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And we go through
it all the way.

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And then it starts going
ahhh, shuuuu, waaaa.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And that goes on for
a couple of minutes.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:34.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.080 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.750 align:middle line:90%
>> And then it's Ishuwa.

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:38.900 align:middle line:90%
And then I realize--

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.310 align:middle line:90%
it comes through for me--

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:41.720 align:middle line:90%
it's a name.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And then I understood
at that point

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.290 align:middle line:84%
that it was a name coming
through and a consciouness.

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:50.100 align:middle line:90%
>> And then when did it--

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.425 align:middle line:84%
>> That was around
early 2009, I believe.

00:13:53.425 --> 00:13:54.225 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, before--

00:13:54.225 --> 00:13:55.940 align:middle line:90%
>> That might have been 2008.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.440 align:middle line:90%
I think it was 2009.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Had you heard of the Yahyel
through Bashar's channelings

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.550 align:middle line:90%
prior to that?

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:03.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh, let's see.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:04.910 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I would have, yeah, sure.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:10.340 align:middle line:84%
So when they identified
themselves as the Yahyel,

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:12.850 align:middle line:84%
you kind of had a
reference point for that?

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:14.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:20.480 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, the
energy was so familiar to me.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.520 align:middle line:90%
It was so at home to me.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.560 align:middle line:84%
It was like-- this
whole process,

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.460 align:middle line:84%
I was stepping more into my
place, my energy, my vibration.

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:32.300 align:middle line:84%
All of those exercises, and the
channeling I had done before,

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.180 align:middle line:84%
and all the steps I
had done, it was all

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:37.940 align:middle line:84%
moving me into that
feeling of being more

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:42.770 align:middle line:84%
into that frequency, that
vibration of the reality that

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:45.550 align:middle line:84%
is their place, that
is their vibration.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's more where
I'm from, in a sense.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.540 align:middle line:84%
>> So it felt good to go
through these exercises.

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, yeah, it
that was fantastic.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.870 align:middle line:90%
I always loved the exercises.

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:55.370 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason
I kept doing it.

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Because it felt-- and I
knew it was effective.

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And it was empowering
and strengthening

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:03.300 align:middle line:90%
my energetic state of being.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And so yeah, it
was just really--

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:09.347 align:middle line:84%
it was it wasn't
really like, oh,

00:15:09.347 --> 00:15:11.180 align:middle line:84%
that's the people that
he was talking about.

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:13.640 align:middle line:90%
It was, this is more who I am.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:14.780 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.300 align:middle line:84%
When did you make that
connection that it was--

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:18.680 align:middle line:90%
or did you?

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:23.120 align:middle line:84%
Was there ever that kind of,
oh, Bashar mentioned these guys.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>> I can't remember
if there was.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:30.620 align:middle line:84%
The strongest memory
and sensation I

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:33.680 align:middle line:90%
have was more in who I am.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm bringing my
about more of who

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:42.080 align:middle line:84%
I am in the other lifetimes
as a Yahyel myself.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:47.780 align:middle line:84%
Concurrently, Ishuwa is me in
a sense, like a parallel me.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm tuning more
into that aspect of me

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:52.600 align:middle line:90%
and feeling more of that--

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.490 align:middle line:84%
where I am moving in my
future in this life--

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:57.470 align:middle line:84%
bring through more
of that-- who they

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:00.530 align:middle line:84%
are, in the sense of connected
to the state of unconditional

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:06.170 align:middle line:84%
love, of supporting one
another, of continual support

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:09.410 align:middle line:84%
for themselves and others, and
being supported continually

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:14.870 align:middle line:84%
by others who support themselves
continuously, and feeling that.

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:18.070 align:middle line:84%
Because there is no limit
to how that can feel.

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:21.140 align:middle line:84%
The variety of ways that
this can be experienced,

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:23.090 align:middle line:90%
there's not a limit.

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And so it just opens up to
me more and more the ways--

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:31.200 align:middle line:84%
these unlimited ways-- that I
feel this and experience this.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:38.060 align:middle line:84%
So it was just more like coming
home as his name comes through

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.550 align:middle line:90%
and as I know it's the Yahyel.

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't
seem like something

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:44.270 align:middle line:84%
that somebody else
is talking about.

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.200 align:middle line:90%
It seems like this is my home.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.770 align:middle line:84%
It's seems like it's here
within me, in a sense.

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:49.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:53.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, you were sort of
the first that I know of.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.060 align:middle line:84%
Maybe others had
channeled the Yahyel.

00:16:56.060 --> 00:17:01.410 align:middle line:84%
I know Darryl has mentioned
Bashar mentioned the Yahyel.

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:04.849 align:middle line:10%
And then you started
bringing through Ishuwa.

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:06.230 align:middle line:84%
But since then,
there seems to be

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:11.060 align:middle line:84%
a lot of Yahyel
channelers now or people

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.369 align:middle line:84%
who are saying that they're
channeling this Yahyel energy.

00:17:14.369 --> 00:17:21.539 align:middle line:84%
And it has a very familiar feel
to Ishuwa and to even Bashar

00:17:21.539 --> 00:17:22.339 align:middle line:90%
a little bit.

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:27.290 align:middle line:90%


00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:33.230 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like just very
playful, and fun, and happy

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:34.880 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:40.640 align:middle line:84%
So in your ideas and
in your discussions--

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.430 align:middle line:84%
and maybe we can ask
this later, too--

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:46.910 align:middle line:84%
are we keep moving as a
collective closer to that

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:47.720 align:middle line:90%
energy, you think?

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And there's going to be more
contact with the civilization?

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, my understanding is--

00:17:53.990 --> 00:18:03.080 align:middle line:10%
and so there's a lot-- for some
people, more healing that they

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:07.390 align:middle line:10%
will encounter within themselves
and within their experience

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:10.570 align:middle line:10%
of life in their daily
life, what they see

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:11.820 align:middle line:10%
with their friends and family.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.887 align:middle line:90%
And then others are very close.

00:18:14.887 --> 00:18:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And of course, as you
mentioned, more people

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.190 align:middle line:90%
are channeling Yahyel.

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:21.430 align:middle line:90%
It's a gift for me.

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:23.890 align:middle line:84%
I love having more
people doing this.

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:27.520 align:middle line:10%
So we have opportunities to come
together like we did in Berlin.

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, with [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:35.230 align:middle line:84%
>> With [INAUDIBLE],, and
with Simon, and with Susanna.

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>> They're also
Yahyel channelers?

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:38.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:41.000 align:middle line:10%
And each has a
wonderful personality.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.050 align:middle line:10%
And there are different
levels of their evolving

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:47.110 align:middle line:10%
with bringing through their
connection to their channels.

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:51.070 align:middle line:10%
For some of them,
it's more recent.

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:54.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually, I said, where
in the density spectrum

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:57.430 align:middle line:90%
and whatnot is Ishuwa at?

00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:03.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, in the book, "Avatars
of the Phoenix Lights,"

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:07.180 align:middle line:84%
where Jefferson Viscardi is
interviewing Ishuwa and asking

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:08.440 align:middle line:90%
many questions.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:14.050 align:middle line:84%
It's, like, 12 chapters, 12
different one-hour channelings.

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:17.830 align:middle line:84%
I stepped aside so Jefferson
could interview Ishuwa.

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:19.570 align:middle line:10%
And that's in there somewhere.

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:22.330 align:middle line:84%
It it, like, fifth
and sixth conscious

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:24.040 align:middle line:84%
dimensions, where
they're talking

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.190 align:middle line:90%
about density and levels.

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And for me, the
number isn't something

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:34.560 align:middle line:90%
that I'm interested in.

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I think he has a hard
time really getting it through.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.240 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:38.510 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:39.310 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:40.810 align:middle line:84%
>> But at the same
time, he says,

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:42.850 align:middle line:90%
there are multi dimensions.

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's important for us
not to get focused on one,

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:48.850 align:middle line:90%
where we are or where they are.

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:51.280 align:middle line:84%
At this moment, the
information he's sharing

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:55.420 align:middle line:84%
is so multidimensional in the
way it can come through for us

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:59.140 align:middle line:84%
and activate us in our current
dimension and densities--

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.060 align:middle line:84%
wherever we perceive
herself to be at.

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:05.650 align:middle line:84%
So we can access more dimensions
and density simultaneously

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:07.990 align:middle line:84%
and give us more
flexibility to move about.

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:09.520 align:middle line:84%
Because they can
move about quite

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.040 align:middle line:84%
a bit in terms of
where they're at

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:18.100 align:middle line:84%
and those ideas of fifth or
sixth dimension and density.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:18.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:21.700 align:middle line:84%
What I've been learning is
that all of these energies,

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.310 align:middle line:84%
even though they may be the
same-- like you said, Yahyel.

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:26.480 align:middle line:84%
There's several
Yahyel channelers now.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.500 align:middle line:84%
But they're at different
states of evolution--

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:30.760 align:middle line:90%
same with the Pleiades.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.190 align:middle line:84%
There's some people
who are channeling

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:35.960 align:middle line:90%
earlier era of Pleidian beings.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.790 align:middle line:84%
Some are channeling
later, collective.

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:40.700 align:middle line:84%
So when we start
having these detailed--

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:44.500 align:middle line:84%
the human monkey mind wants
to piece it all together--

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:46.840 align:middle line:84%
and like, whoa, this is
this, and this fits here.

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.110 align:middle line:84%
But from doing these interviews,
I've sort of realized--

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:50.910 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:52.700 align:middle line:90%
So I understand your question.

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.990 align:middle line:84%
So I rarely get a question
that that's specific.

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:56.920 align:middle line:84%
So I understand
what you're asking.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.880 align:middle line:84%
So there are different timelines
that the different Earth

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.340 align:middle line:84%
human channels are
bringing through

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:04.910 align:middle line:90%
of the Yahyel consciousness.

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:05.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:06.640 align:middle line:90%
It seems like that.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.557 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's the case.

00:21:07.557 --> 00:21:08.560 align:middle line:90%
>> This is the case.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.690 align:middle line:84%
As I have been
channeling Ishuwa longer,

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:13.240 align:middle line:84%
I have come to know the
information originally

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.060 align:middle line:84%
was an idea that
perhaps the Yahyel had

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.400 align:middle line:90%
devolved from Earth humans.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And then I have since
gathered more information.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And there are some timelines--
perhaps in our future--

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:27.250 align:middle line:84%
where some of them could be
like descendants of ours.

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:31.570 align:middle line:84%
But they also have had
DNA from the Yahyel way

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:34.780 align:middle line:90%
in our Earth human past.

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:37.010 align:middle line:84%
So they can be
simultaneously, in a sense,

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:38.470 align:middle line:90%
having some DNA from us.

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And in that sense-- that
aspect of their DNA--

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:42.370 align:middle line:90%
they were like children of ours.

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:45.040 align:middle line:84%
While at the same time, they
have DNA from their Yahyel--

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.470 align:middle line:84%
that are even forefathers
to us, in a sense, that

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:49.390 align:middle line:90%
came before us, in a sense.

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:52.150 align:middle line:84%
So simultaneously, they can be
our children and our fathers

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:52.950 align:middle line:90%
or mothers.

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:55.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:55.060 --> 00:22:01.140 align:middle line:84%
Depending on which timeline
we're interacting with,

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:03.410 align:middle line:84%
there's Yahyel from our
future and from our past.

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:04.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And some of them might
think of themselves

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.050 align:middle line:84%
as children of Earth humans
and others like parents.

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:09.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Parents.

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:11.170 align:middle line:90%
Wow, that's fascinating.

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:11.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:12.250 align:middle line:90%
So it jumps around.

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:13.050 align:middle line:90%
>> I never--

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:13.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:15.430 align:middle line:90%
It was a little bit--

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:18.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think I saw one
of your recent channelings.

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:20.630 align:middle line:10%
And it did kind of throw me off.

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:21.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, wait.

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:24.380 align:middle line:84%
Is he talking about the
Annunaki kind of thing?

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And maybe I'll get into that
with Ishuwa a little bit.

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:29.757 align:middle line:84%
>> So the idea is-- where it's
at now in my understanding.

00:22:29.757 --> 00:22:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm sure it can
change as more information

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.520 align:middle line:84%
comes through, not just
from me, from other people.

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:39.850 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that there was a
time when Earth humans like us

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:42.460 align:middle line:84%
and the Yahyel like
Ishuwa that I channel

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:45.770 align:middle line:84%
were of the same one
civilization living together.

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And then a group of them went
out into space, in a sense,

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:55.120 align:middle line:84%
to explore new worlds,
almost like the beginning

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.890 align:middle line:90%
of "Star Trek" in a sense--

00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:59.933 align:middle line:84%
to explore strange new worlds
on a five-year mission.

00:22:59.933 --> 00:23:01.600 align:middle line:84%
But they weren't on
a five-year mission.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.950 align:middle line:90%
It was, we're going to go.

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:04.857 align:middle line:90%
Goodbye.

00:23:04.857 --> 00:23:06.690 align:middle line:84%
We're probably never
going to see you again.

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:07.990 align:middle line:90%
It was that kind of a departure.

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:08.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:10.015 align:middle line:84%
>> It wasn't a short
term, three, four,

00:23:10.015 --> 00:23:11.520 align:middle line:90%
or five-year kind of a thing.

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And so in that kind
of a moving out,

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:16.850 align:middle line:84%
there has been a great
deal of evolution

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:20.240 align:middle line:84%
from those Yahyel into
other species, in a sense.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:25.280 align:middle line:84%
Or hybridization is
immense at this point.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:28.880 align:middle line:84%
So the idea, for me, isn't to
know all the different levels

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.100 align:middle line:84%
of hybridization but to
connect with the ones that

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:32.508 align:middle line:84%
are most relevant
to where we are

00:23:32.508 --> 00:23:34.550 align:middle line:84%
in evolution at this point
in time that are going

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:36.930 align:middle line:84%
to be most fulfilling and
fun for us to learn from it,

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:38.550 align:middle line:90%
to grow with.

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And so some of the
extraterrestrials

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:47.270 align:middle line:84%
that we have some contact with
through different channels

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:50.120 align:middle line:84%
or in various physical
contexts may or may not

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.030 align:middle line:90%
have some of that Yahyel DNA.

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:55.220 align:middle line:84%
But every Earth human
has some of this DNA

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.032 align:middle line:84%
from that original
period of time

00:23:57.032 --> 00:23:58.490 align:middle line:84%
when there was the
Yahyel and Earth

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:01.470 align:middle line:84%
humans-- were of the
same one civilization.

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:05.450 align:middle line:84%
So there is this point of
instantaneous knowingness

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:09.110 align:middle line:84%
and contact through
that aspect of the DNA.

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:13.400 align:middle line:84%
We all on Earth have
this instant contact--

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:18.050 align:middle line:84%
potential-- to that
place in the Yahyel

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:21.410 align:middle line:84%
timeline where we
and they were one.

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And so that family
beingness, and togetherness,

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:31.100 align:middle line:84%
and connectedness that
was then exists in the DNA

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:32.150 align:middle line:90%
of every Earth human.

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:33.710 align:middle line:90%
And most of us--

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:36.830 align:middle line:84%
perhaps in many
different ways-- have

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:39.860 align:middle line:84%
discovered ways to not
even acknowledge that,

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:43.150 align:middle line:90%
to not even know this.

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:46.340 align:middle line:84%
But some of us, without
knowing it, have activated it

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:49.880 align:middle line:84%
and are streaming some
of that information

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:53.390 align:middle line:84%
back and forth with them without
perhaps maybe even realizing

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:54.870 align:middle line:90%
that's what's going on.

00:24:54.870 --> 00:25:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it seems, the more
I dig into these interviews,

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:04.190 align:middle line:84%
and getting more information,
and have a better understanding

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:11.510 align:middle line:84%
of how all this works, it's
like another shocker information

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:16.160 align:middle line:84%
that really just
massages my brain to say,

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.530 align:middle line:90%
get out of your linear thinking.

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:20.210 align:middle line:84%
Because anything is
possible, really.

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And I feel these contact
specialists, like Ishuwa,

00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:29.120 align:middle line:84%
and the Pleidians, and all these
different energies that are

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.900 align:middle line:84%
interacting with humanity now--
and more and coming through--

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:34.940 align:middle line:84%
seem to be here to--
and they're only

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:37.220 align:middle line:84%
giving this the nuggets we
can handle at that time.

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:42.015 align:middle line:84%
Like, if I had this information
that I have now two years ago,

00:25:42.015 --> 00:25:42.890 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't digest it.

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:45.110 align:middle line:84%
I would probably
walk away from it.

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:48.260 align:middle line:84%
Because my mind just
couldn't handle it.

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:51.140 align:middle line:84%
But now I can-- oh,
yeah, I can see that.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:52.370 align:middle line:90%
I see how that works now.

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:53.390 align:middle line:90%
And I'm able to--

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:56.610 align:middle line:84%
oh, I can connect the dots,
even though it's all right now,

00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:57.410 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:25:57.410 --> 00:25:59.000 align:middle line:90%
That's the ultimate thing.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.900 align:middle line:84%
But what you just said
makes sense, actually.

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Most people probably
watching this are like, what?

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:07.100 align:middle line:90%
How is that?

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:09.080 align:middle line:90%
We'll explain it later.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:11.210 align:middle line:90%
But cool-- no, no, that makes--

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:14.150 align:middle line:84%
I think my monkey
mind is wrapping

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:16.760 align:middle line:90%
around it a little bit.

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:20.600 align:middle line:84%
>> So we all have this
treasure trove of experiences,

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.130 align:middle line:84%
and knowledge,
and understanding,

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:26.820 align:middle line:84%
and types and ways of relation,
and behavior, and being,

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:32.480 align:middle line:84%
and living, and experiencing
life and knowingness in our DNA

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.910 align:middle line:90%
as it comes from how they--

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:37.400 align:middle line:84%
when we were with them--
and as they still do

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.730 align:middle line:84%
live in that experience
and way of co-creating

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:43.140 align:middle line:84%
together, experiencing
life together.

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:47.410 align:middle line:84%
So therefore-- because we all
on Earth have it in our DNA--

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:52.370 align:middle line:84%
we are all capable of accessing
it and having it activated.

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:54.470 align:middle line:84%
The more each of us
is open to knowing

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:58.690 align:middle line:84%
this is possible and willing
and able to accept that

00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:03.230 align:middle line:84%
and not looking at it as an
alien idea or an alien entity

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:07.170 align:middle line:84%
within them, it's easier to
open up and just say, well,

00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:09.800 align:middle line:84%
if it's so, let the
positive attributes of this

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.660 align:middle line:84%
come into my being
and strengthen me

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:15.656 align:middle line:84%
in a very enlightening
self-realizational way.

00:27:15.656 --> 00:27:18.433 align:middle line:84%
The more people are willing
to do that, the more then--

00:27:18.433 --> 00:27:19.850 align:middle line:84%
because what we
put out is what we

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:22.190 align:middle line:84%
get back-- the more we
can get back experiencing

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:24.110 align:middle line:90%
the awakening of that.

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:26.990 align:middle line:84%
>> That's sort of what I've been
noticing going down this rabbit

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:31.492 align:middle line:84%
hole of interviewing what
I first was calling ETs.

00:27:31.492 --> 00:27:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And then I changed
the name of the series

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.940 align:middle line:84%
to "Extradimensional,"
because that was sort of--

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:35.930 align:middle line:90%
>> That's great.

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:38.240 align:middle line:84%
>> But now, as we're even
going deeper into that,

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:40.370 align:middle line:90%
it's almost not even extra--

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:41.960 align:middle line:90%
it is us.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:45.110 align:middle line:84%
It is our-- these are
all permission slips.

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:48.260 align:middle line:84%
These interactions
with these other beings

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:51.920 align:middle line:84%
are permission slips to
gather information to expand

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.240 align:middle line:90%
our own consciousness.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.830 align:middle line:90%
That's just us, anyways.

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, that's the
rabbit hole I'm going down.

00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And it seems-- especially the
last Ishuwa message I listened

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:03.740 align:middle line:90%
to--

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:05.440 align:middle line:84%
it just seems like
that's the message

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.732 align:middle line:90%
that they're trying to tell us.

00:28:06.732 --> 00:28:09.060 align:middle line:90%
It's like pp, pp, pp.

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:11.740 align:middle line:90%
It's all you.

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:14.080 align:middle line:84%
But we have this great
mechanism of channeling.

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:18.340 align:middle line:84%
We have this great
permission slip

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:21.525 align:middle line:84%
to access this
information in this way.

00:28:21.525 --> 00:28:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure there's a
million other different ways

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:24.850 align:middle line:90%
to do this--

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Tibetan monks, Lee in here with
his tarot cards, and all this--

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:29.890 align:middle line:90%
there's so many different arts.

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:30.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Music, stories.

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:32.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's all there.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.540 align:middle line:84%
This is just one-- for me,
it's a laser-focused way

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:39.340 align:middle line:84%
to really get it, and
digest it, and unwrap

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:43.450 align:middle line:84%
your present in this
fun, exciting method we

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:44.440 align:middle line:90%
call channeling.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.933 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, it's deep.

00:28:46.933 --> 00:28:48.850 align:middle line:84%
Going down the rabbit
hole deeper and deeper--

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:54.310 align:middle line:84%
and look forward to talking
with Ishuwa later and furthering

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:56.060 align:middle line:90%
the rabbit hole.

00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:56.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:58.160 align:middle line:90%
It's all us.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:58.960 align:middle line:90%
They are us.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.220 align:middle line:90%
They are me.

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:04.120 align:middle line:84%
They are you from that
perspective of experience.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And they're coming together,
and realizing more of that,

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:13.000 align:middle line:84%
and gives us opportunity to have
experiences that can be really

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.280 align:middle line:90%
enjoyable and fascinating.

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>> It's exciting.

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:19.030 align:middle line:84%
I feel this is the greatest
show on the planet.

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:21.250 align:middle line:84%
I can't even go to the
movie theater anymore.

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:22.900 align:middle line:90%
Because I watch the movies.

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:25.360 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, that is boring.

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:31.600 align:middle line:84%
What we're embarking on as a
society, and the human race,

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.820 align:middle line:84%
and these individual
conversations,

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:38.140 align:middle line:84%
and the contact experiences
people are having--

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:39.340 align:middle line:90%
there's no greater show.

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And you can't write
a better story.

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:46.450 align:middle line:84%
It's beyond what
even our greatest

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:50.890 align:middle line:84%
writers and imaginations
can even imagine, it seems.

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:52.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
feel the same way.

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:54.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, it's fascinating.

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:56.990 align:middle line:90%
And it's thrilling.

00:29:56.990 --> 00:30:02.650 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, rather than being a
member in the audience watching

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:05.740 align:middle line:84%
the movie, we are
the characters.

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:08.350 align:middle line:90%
This is the stage.

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And then we are all interacting
as the producers, the writers.

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:18.640 align:middle line:84%
Our eyes are like the cameras
of each person's experience.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:24.130 align:middle line:84%
So we are all living a
role in this expanding play

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:26.310 align:middle line:90%
as it unfolds.

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And without a doubt, each of us
has the right and the ability

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:43.330 align:middle line:84%
to go through this experience
in a way that is absolutely

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:45.813 align:middle line:90%
fantastically enjoyable.

00:30:45.813 --> 00:30:47.230 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have
to be frightening.

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:49.030 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have
to be a struggle.

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:50.480 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have
to be depressing.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:53.020 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have to be scary.

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:54.890 align:middle line:90%
That is just one choice.

00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:55.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>> The choice could to exciting
and for it to be really

00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:04.660 align:middle line:84%
thrilling, and enlivening,
and refreshing--

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:07.300 align:middle line:90%
moment-to-moment new.

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.250 align:middle line:90%
It's not getting boring right.

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:10.900 align:middle line:90%
Each of us can choose that.

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And by putting out the
choice to choose that,

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:17.080 align:middle line:84%
we then we get back
experiencing that path.

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Both paths exist, the
frightening, scary one

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:21.310 align:middle line:90%
or the fun, fulfilling one.

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:22.880 align:middle line:90%
Choose the one you prefer.

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.250 align:middle line:90%
Know that you have the choice.

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And then put out the
direction that you prefer

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:29.140 align:middle line:90%
to have this unfold upon.

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:32.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you have to be
the actor and the watcher

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:33.547 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:31:33.547 --> 00:31:34.630 align:middle line:90%
It's not one or the other.

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:34.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:36.880 align:middle line:84%
You're acting it and your
audience all at once.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:37.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you're writing the script,
and you're playing the part

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:43.180 align:middle line:90%
simultaneously.

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:46.900 align:middle line:90%


00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's nice to sort of sit
back, and go to the theater,

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:53.170 align:middle line:84%
and watch the
screen for a minute.

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:55.600 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what we
do when we go to sleep.

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:58.720 align:middle line:90%
But then it's also--

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:02.050 align:middle line:84%
to have the realization
that you're writing a story,

00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:04.750 align:middle line:84%
there's so much in
empowerment in that.

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And you can write any
story you want, really.

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:11.780 align:middle line:90%
And that's a lot of fun, too.

00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:17.200 align:middle line:10%
So as a filmmaker,
as an actor, I

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:20.280 align:middle line:10%
think it's easier to grasp
some of these concepts.

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:23.500 align:middle line:84%
>> And sometimes, if you have
a couple different stories

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:27.370 align:middle line:84%
and you can think you can only
get one out-- well, which one?

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, someone else can
write that other story

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:33.490 align:middle line:90%
and experience it for you.

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:36.500 align:middle line:84%
Because that is you being
experienced through them,

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:38.260 align:middle line:84%
which is you from that
other perspective.

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:40.270 align:middle line:84%
Seemingly, it's another
person, but it's you.

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And the more we open
up to that, the more

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:46.480 align:middle line:84%
you can experience the other
person having that story,

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.190 align:middle line:90%
choosing that story.

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:49.490 align:middle line:90%
You can choose this one.

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:51.760 align:middle line:84%
The other one you really
like, they'll choose it.

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:55.480 align:middle line:84%
You can experience yours
and, through them, theirs.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:57.640 align:middle line:90%
Because they are you.

00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:00.745 align:middle line:84%
And then, well, you can get a
lot of scripts and stories--

00:33:00.745 --> 00:33:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>> You have 7 billion
stories of this planet.

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:03.490 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:07.300 align:middle line:10%
7 billion different movies
going at the same time,

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:10.180 align:middle line:10%
and a whole lot of
flavors, and all of it.

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:12.220 align:middle line:10%
Some of it's fun for me and you.

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:15.190 align:middle line:10%
And if it's not, let
them have the stories.

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:16.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Just having the
intention-- for me,

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:18.933 align:middle line:84%
it is to choose the ones
that are going to be most

00:33:18.933 --> 00:33:22.000 align:middle line:84%
applicable, and supportive, and
fulfilling from my perspective

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.630 align:middle line:84%
of the enfoldment, as how
I perceive myself as part

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:29.250 align:middle line:84%
of the one that is the
all, that is the infinite,

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:32.920 align:middle line:84%
that is the one that is all
that I am, that you are,

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:34.350 align:middle line:90%
that we are.

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:35.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.480 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, probably later,
we'll get into--

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:42.160 align:middle line:10%
with Ishuwa, I want
to go over those five

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:43.940 align:middle line:10%
universal laws a little bit.

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, he's still
with the four.

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:46.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, four, OK.

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:48.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I know,
Bashar goes into five.

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.560 align:middle line:84%
But with me, it's that
we exist in here and now.

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:51.740 align:middle line:90%
It just goes with theory.

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:52.480 align:middle line:90%
It's goes with theory.

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>> It's kind of the same thing.

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.160 align:middle line:90%
>> It's the same.

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.920 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it is.

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:56.940 align:middle line:90%
>> It is the same.

00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:57.190 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.790 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree.

00:33:57.790 --> 00:33:59.998 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is information
that's been talked on this

00:33:59.998 --> 00:34:01.030 align:middle line:90%
planet for--

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:03.230 align:middle line:84%
it it's been around
for thousands of years,

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:05.350 align:middle line:84%
just the vocabulary
has been different.

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:08.989 align:middle line:84%
The way we speak had been
different in different times.

00:34:08.989 --> 00:34:11.130 align:middle line:84%
There's been other human
beings on this planet who

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:13.210 align:middle line:84%
have shared this information
in their own time,

00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:16.570 align:middle line:90%
in their own way before.

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:18.909 align:middle line:84%
I find at this
timing, this way--

00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:22.750 align:middle line:84%
for me, it's very easy
to understand these ideas

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:25.530 align:middle line:90%
of the nature of existence.

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:30.159 align:middle line:84%
And yet-- this is
how easy it is--

00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:32.530 align:middle line:84%
I do recall having
spent a couple of years

00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:34.530 align:middle line:90%
immersing myself in them.

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And it took me a couple
of years of living

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:40.304 align:middle line:84%
with them to, in a sense,
tasting of the pudding--

00:34:40.304 --> 00:34:42.429 align:middle line:84%
to see, the proof is in
the tasting of the pudding.

00:34:42.429 --> 00:34:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And through a couple years
of really integrating

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:47.900 align:middle line:84%
them and testing them
in my own experience,

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:50.405 align:middle line:84%
they have come through and
confirmed themself again,

00:34:50.405 --> 00:34:51.280 align:middle line:90%
and again, and again.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And in doing that, I become
more aware of what they are.

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And I see them more
in my life every day.

00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:01.390 align:middle line:84%
So they're easy for me
having gone through that.

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:03.490 align:middle line:84%
But when I can share
them with someone

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:06.280 align:middle line:84%
else for the first time,
sometimes they just--

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.090 align:middle line:90%
what?

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:08.150 align:middle line:90%
>> That simple?

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:09.220 align:middle line:90%
>> They don't get it.

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And some people just
jump up and down.

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.810 align:middle line:90%
They're so excited to hear it.

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:16.600 align:middle line:90%
It's just amazing-- like, wow!

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.880 align:middle line:90%
That's fantastic!

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And then still,
there's other people--

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:23.830 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to go get
something out of the fridge.

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:27.080 align:middle line:84%
You want me to get you
something to drink?

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:29.860 align:middle line:90%
It's just not the time for them.

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:35.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, I've been reminding
myself of the four laws all

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:35.860 align:middle line:10%
the time.

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:39.800 align:middle line:10%
And it's just, when you
are able to live it--

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:41.540 align:middle line:10%
and in the past couple years--

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:42.340 align:middle line:10%
pfft--

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:42.780 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, it makes a difference.

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:43.450 align:middle line:10%
>> --that's it.

00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:44.320 align:middle line:10%
What a difference.

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.870 align:middle line:10%
>> You have to be
mindful of that.

00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:46.670 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And for me, too, I
mean I feel like I'm

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:57.370 align:middle line:84%
a living proof of living by
those concepts and those ideas.

00:35:57.370 --> 00:35:58.630 align:middle line:90%
>> That we exist here and now.

00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:58.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:35:59.620 align:middle line:90%
>> The one is all the.

00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:00.420 align:middle line:90%
The all is the one.

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:02.170 align:middle line:84%
What we put out is
what we get back.

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And everything changes--
those initial ideas there.

00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And what you put out
is what you get back.

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it's what
I put within myself

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.515 align:middle line:84%
as food in terms
of consciousness,

00:36:15.515 --> 00:36:17.230 align:middle line:84%
and my beliefs,
and my definitions,

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:19.600 align:middle line:84%
and my experiences,
my attitudes--

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:23.808 align:middle line:84%
what I put within myself is
the reality I live within.

00:36:23.808 --> 00:36:25.600 align:middle line:84%
That's another way to
say, what you put out

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:26.800 align:middle line:90%
is what you get back.

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:29.650 align:middle line:84%
What I put in is the
reality I live within.

>> You are what you eat.

00:36:30.814 --> 00:36:31.614 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

>> That's a good way to say it.

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:36.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And I experience what I
consume, whether it's food,

00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:38.690 align:middle line:84%
or it's consciousness,
and thoughts, and beliefs,

00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:42.460 align:middle line:90%
energies, emotions.

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:47.470 align:middle line:10%
So yeah, it's those
still simple ideas--

00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:53.020 align:middle line:10%
working with those and allowing
the infinite knowledge that

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:54.970 align:middle line:10%
is contained with
each one of them

00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:57.610 align:middle line:10%
to meld them through
my awareness in more

00:36:57.610 --> 00:37:01.200 align:middle line:10%
and more ways, because there's
not a limit to the ways

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:04.720 align:middle line:10%
I can understand them
and experience them.

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.010 align:middle line:90%
It's just fascinating.

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:07.840 align:middle line:84%
It just opened so
many more doors.

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:11.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm just relaxing more
and more with my life

00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:13.230 align:middle line:90%
wherever I am in the physical--

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:16.000 align:middle line:84%
what's going on around
in the physical life.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And to feel more sense
of infinite structure,

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:26.730 align:middle line:84%
and support, and love
from existence itself.

00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:30.440 align:middle line:84%
So when I put out my
understanding of existence

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:34.575 align:middle line:84%
more, it finds more
ways to support me.

00:37:34.575 --> 00:37:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And again, what I put within
is what I live within.

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:38.492 align:middle line:84%
What I put out is
what I get back.

00:37:38.492 --> 00:37:40.290 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:41.712 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree.

00:37:41.712 --> 00:37:43.170 align:middle line:10%
Well, should we
take a little break

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:45.000 align:middle line:10%
and then get into
some channeling later?

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:45.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Sure.

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:45.640 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:46.110 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:48.030 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, thank you.

00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:51.080 align:middle line:90%
