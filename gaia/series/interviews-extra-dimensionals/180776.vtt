00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.120 align:middle line:10%
>> First of all, just
for my information,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:17.330 align:middle line:10%
I'd like to know if it seems
like you've ever had UFO

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.570 align:middle line:10%
sightings.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.370 align:middle line:10%
You have?

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.170 align:middle line:90%
>> I have.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Back in 2007 I had my first UFO
sighting, which may or may not

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.990 align:middle line:90%
have been extraterrestrial.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.455 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, they're UFOs for--

00:01:35.455 --> 00:01:37.170 align:middle line:90%
>> They're still UFOs.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.740 align:middle line:90%
Unidentified Flying Objects.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And it was in the middle
of the day out in Glendale.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.970 align:middle line:84%
I was walking from
the laundromat.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.250 align:middle line:90%
And I saw a--

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.280 align:middle line:90%


00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.860 align:middle line:84%
it looked like, at
quick glance, a bunch

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.690 align:middle line:84%
of those like white
gnats flying in the air.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:06.830 align:middle line:10%
But I kind of looked harder
and did a perspective check

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.479 align:middle line:10%
to see how far they were out.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized that
these little white specs

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.410 align:middle line:84%
or white orbs were
really far up in the sky.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw a plane fly
through and it actually--

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.910 align:middle line:84%
a plane was in between
whatever was out there--

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:23.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Between them and you?

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Between-- yes.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.493 align:middle line:90%
>> Or between them?

00:02:26.493 --> 00:02:27.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Between them, yeah.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.570 align:middle line:84%
So whatever it was was really
far out and into the sky.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.710 align:middle line:90%
But it was in middle of the day.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.280 align:middle line:90%
And they almost look like stars.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.885 align:middle line:84%
>> Were they kind of sort
of shiny a little bit?

00:02:39.885 --> 00:02:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, and almost--

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Glowing, or--

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.275 align:middle line:90%
>> --twinkling like a star.

00:02:42.275 --> 00:02:46.490 align:middle line:84%
Like, if you could
imagine looking

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.500 align:middle line:90%
at a star in the daylight.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.350 align:middle line:84%
I know it sounds
weird, but if you

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.990 align:middle line:84%
could, if a star was so
bright that you could see it

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.820 align:middle line:84%
during the day, that's
probably the best

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.600 align:middle line:90%
description of what it was.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Were they moving?

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Ever so slightly.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.480 align:middle line:90%
So there was a group of them.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.850 align:middle line:84%
And they started
appearing more and more.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.580 align:middle line:90%
And eventually, there was--

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.880 align:middle line:84%
I counted at least
maybe 20 or 30.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:24.744 align:middle line:84%
And then they were slowly
kind of shifting, maybe

00:03:24.744 --> 00:03:27.920 align:middle line:84%
as the planet was rotating or
something, almost as if stars

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.880 align:middle line:84%
shift in the sky, but faster,
a little bit faster than that,

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.680 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.597 align:middle line:90%
>> That's pretty slow.

00:03:33.597 --> 00:03:36.152 align:middle line:84%
>> Over a 45 minute period,
they moved in the sky--

00:03:36.152 --> 00:03:37.610 align:middle line:84%
>> You watched them
for 45 minutes?

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, for 45 minutes.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.220 align:middle line:84%
They moved about-- if
you look in the sky,

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.920 align:middle line:84%
it's like about this much,
so from there to there.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.170 align:middle line:90%
As a whole group?

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.870 align:middle line:84%
>> As a whole group,
going from west to east.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.050 align:middle line:90%
And I was calling my buddies.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.150 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to get
people to confirm--

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.980 align:middle line:90%
hey, do you see this?

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And nobody could really see
it from where they were at.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Or was there
anybody around you?

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.350 align:middle line:90%
>> No, there was the mailman.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.925 align:middle line:90%
He came by.

00:04:10.925 --> 00:04:12.050 align:middle line:90%
And I was like pointing up.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.467 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at
me kind of funny.

00:04:13.467 --> 00:04:15.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, whatever,
I'm not taking

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.399 align:middle line:90%
my eyes off of these things.

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:18.050 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really want
to say anything.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.230 align:middle line:84%
He just came by to drop
off mail and kept going.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And often, Rubin, when I've
talked to many people about

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:32.050 align:middle line:84%
this sort of thing, they will
be in a group of other people

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.980 align:middle line:84%
on the sidewalk or something,
and they will see a clear

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.510 align:middle line:90%
sighting.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.857 align:middle line:84%
And maybe if lucky, there's
a person right with them

00:04:41.857 --> 00:04:42.815 align:middle line:90%
who will see that, too.

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:47.000 align:middle line:84%
But all the other people
around in the area don't see.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.410 align:middle line:84%
Even if they're kind of
yelling and pointing up,

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.240 align:middle line:84%
and the others either
don't hear them

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.870 align:middle line:84%
or don't want to
look up or just--

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:03.830 align:middle line:84%
well, it makes me think that at
least sometimes these sightings

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.960 align:middle line:84%
are designed by beings
up there to be seen just

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.260 align:middle line:84%
by one specific particular
person, one or two,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.080 align:middle line:84%
and not for anybody
else who's around.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.780 align:middle line:84%
But I've also heard
of instances where

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.350 align:middle line:84%
other people who happen
to be in the same section

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.930 align:middle line:84%
or freeway or same section
of town will also see them.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I thought, for sure, it
was going to be on the evening

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.580 align:middle line:84%
news and all over
the newspapers,

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.070 align:middle line:84%
and people were going to be
talking about this mass UFO

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.250 align:middle line:90%
sighting.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.280 align:middle line:90%
And I started looking.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.030 align:middle line:84%
That night I was checking the
9 o'clock news, the 10 o'clock

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.830 align:middle line:90%
news.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.960 align:middle line:84%
The next morning I was checking
the papers, the internet.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.360 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.260 align:middle line:90%
So I was kind of dumbfounded.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.150 align:middle line:84%
But it opened my curiosity to
start exploring and looking

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.400 align:middle line:84%
into the ET phenomenon,
or the UFO phenomenon.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Because before that you
hadn't particularly been

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.920 align:middle line:84%
interested in the
UFO phenomenon?

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:10.720 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.430 align:middle line:84%
I'd been interested
in science fiction.

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And I had heard, you know, even
my mom told me ETs are real.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And she had mentioned
even growing up

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:30.682 align:middle line:84%
that she had visitations
when she was younger.

00:06:30.682 --> 00:06:31.890 align:middle line:90%
And I kind of laughed it off.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.430 align:middle line:90%
I was like, mom, you're crazy.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's--
quit talking nonsense.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And so my mom's so proud
of me now, by the way,

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.348 align:middle line:90%
that I'm actually--

00:06:44.348 --> 00:06:45.390 align:middle line:90%
like hey mom, guess what?

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:46.000 align:middle line:90%
ETs are real.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.800 align:middle line:90%
And she's like--

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Is she still living?

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:48.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.500 align:middle line:90%
And she's--

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:49.920 align:middle line:90%
>> So--

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.430 align:middle line:90%
>> She's very--

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.510 align:middle line:90%
>> You've told her that?

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:52.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yeah, I've told her.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:53.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she knows
all the work I've

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:54.090 align:middle line:90%
been doing with the citizens--

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:54.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, good!

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:55.010 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yay.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.830 align:middle line:90%
>> So she's--

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.240 align:middle line:90%
>> I bet she's gratified.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, she's
definitely-- she's like,

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.600 align:middle line:84%
you've really come
around since when--

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.380 align:middle line:84%
>> My goodness, he's
finally come around.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, he's finally
come around and--

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:08.220 align:middle line:90%
but yeah.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:14.070 align:middle line:84%
Other than laughing it off
with the rest of society,

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.480 align:middle line:84%
up until that time, I
had not taken it serious.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.150 align:middle line:84%
You know, I had
not really given it

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:25.740 align:middle line:84%
any thought, even though in
films and things like that--

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.480 align:middle line:84%
portray-- like I
was actually working

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:33.107 align:middle line:84%
on "Avatar" at the time,
and portraying an ET.

00:07:33.107 --> 00:07:34.440 align:middle line:90%
You know, learning how to walk--

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh you were one of the--

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:35.700 align:middle line:90%
>> I was one of the Na'vis.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:36.470 align:middle line:90%
>> "Avatar?"

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:36.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:37.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, ETs.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.520 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wonderful.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.430 align:middle line:90%
>> I was a Na'vi.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.750 align:middle line:84%
I was the stunt
double for Jake Sully,

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:47.340 align:middle line:84%
so whenever he was learning
how to use his "Avatar" body,

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:52.660 align:middle line:84%
it was mostly me doing
the physical falling and.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:53.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Boy--

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Doing all the
stunts for that.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>> In that film, they did the
most amazing physical feats.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:01.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:02.220 align:middle line:90%
That was--

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.590 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean, I was really--

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:07.930 align:middle line:84%
the edge of my seat,
just hoping they'd be OK.

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:08.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, good.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:10.270 align:middle line:90%
That means I did my job well.

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:11.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:12.380 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.560 align:middle line:90%
This is exciting.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:17.400 align:middle line:84%
>> So here I am on my day to
day life, playing an alien.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And then I come home
and doing my laundry,

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:22.240 align:middle line:90%
and then I see these things.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
kind of what started--

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:28.350 align:middle line:84%
sparked my curiosity
into what else

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:33.620 align:middle line:84%
is out there, other than this
reality that we're being told.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:41.100 align:middle line:84%
It's also around the same time,
while working on "Avatar," we--

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.140 align:middle line:90%
someone introduced us to--

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:47.350 align:middle line:84%
the group of stunt
performers and actors--

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:50.580 align:middle line:84%
there was a tight, small
group of us working every day,

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.490 align:middle line:84%
and there was a lot of free
time while the computers

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:54.300 align:middle line:90%
were trying--

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.160 align:middle line:84%
there were a lot of computer
glitches and problems

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.170 align:middle line:84%
as they were trying to make
things work for that movie.

00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:59.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, gosh.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.180 align:middle line:84%
>> So in between stuff, we
would be in the back room

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.580 align:middle line:84%
and we'd all be
watching YouTube.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:11.250 align:middle line:84%
Lots of cat videos,
but we also watched

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.800 align:middle line:90%
this film called "Zeitgeist."

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you're
familiar with that.

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:15.420 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:21.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And it really went into the
whole 9/11 issue of it being

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:25.350 align:middle line:84%
a cover up and, you know, not
the story that's being told

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.810 align:middle line:90%
to us, as well as religion.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:30.510 align:middle line:84%
It really opened-- it
really kind of goes

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:32.520 align:middle line:84%
into the whole
paradigm and matrix

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.950 align:middle line:90%
of what we're in right now.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:39.480 align:middle line:84%
Basically, what the mainstream
is telling us-- this.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.250 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, there's
all this evidence

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:43.110 align:middle line:84%
that shows there's
something else out there.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:46.550 align:middle line:84%
So it was kind of watching that
movie, having that experience--

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:49.170 align:middle line:90%


00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:51.880 align:middle line:84%
the combination is what really
started me on this path.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:52.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Of digging deeper into--

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.200 align:middle line:90%
>> What an interesting time.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:56.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.877 align:middle line:84%
>> It must have
been in your life.

00:09:57.877 --> 00:09:59.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yeah.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And luckily, I did have--
it did happen slowly.

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:04.050 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was--

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:05.700 align:middle line:84%
I was still continuing
my daily life

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.430 align:middle line:84%
and it was like uncovering
things, uncovering things.

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And now I feel like I've gone
so down the rabbit hole that--

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:12.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:13.900 align:middle line:90%
>> That yeah.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.650 align:middle line:84%
It's the-- I'm a
completely different person

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:17.900 align:middle line:90%
than when I was.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:18.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow, I bet, yeah.

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:20.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Back in 2007.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Exciting.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And probably, this is
exciting for your mother.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:27.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, she's--

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I would think she's
probably really interested in--

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:29.930 align:middle line:90%
>> She's watching.

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:33.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Every little increment of
involvement and interest that

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:34.350 align:middle line:90%
you show.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:39.660 align:middle line:84%
You know, you first
realize we're not alone

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.060 align:middle line:84%
in this universe, then you
realize you're not alone

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.150 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:43.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:47.568 align:middle line:84%
>> And then you try to figure
out what is going on here

00:10:47.568 --> 00:10:48.610 align:middle line:90%
on this planet, you know.

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:50.790 align:middle line:84%
Then why, if we're
not alone-- then

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.220 align:middle line:84%
why aren't they
expressing themselves?

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:59.960 align:middle line:84%
Why are we allowed to live in
this matrix of secrecy and--

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:00.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Ignorance.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>> High strangeness.

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:03.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:04.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Strange-- it depends--

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:05.700 align:middle line:84%
I guess if you're in
it, you don't really

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:06.825 align:middle line:90%
think of it as strangeness.

00:11:06.825 --> 00:11:08.020 align:middle line:90%
But once you get--

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.490 align:middle line:84%
I call it-- say,
unplugged from the matrix.

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Once you get unplugged,
it just blows my mind

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.950 align:middle line:84%
how people stay in it, you
know, and why is it still--

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:19.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.105 align:middle line:84%
>> How can it
continue and thrive?

00:11:21.105 --> 00:11:22.610 align:middle line:84%
So why-- what is
that experiment?

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:23.410 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:24.410 align:middle line:90%
What's going on there?

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:27.640 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of these
questions and answers

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.110 align:middle line:90%
are being answered in this film.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:30.830 align:middle line:90%
Actually in this documentary.

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:31.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yay.

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's kind of what
started happening once you--

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:39.425 align:middle line:84%
I think that's why
the ET thing is so--

00:11:39.425 --> 00:11:46.858 align:middle line:84%
is such a key component to all
of this is that question of,

00:11:46.858 --> 00:11:48.400 align:middle line:84%
are we the only ones
in the universe?

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.270 align:middle line:84%
Are we the only
ones on this planet?

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And that leads--
that just spreads

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:57.130 align:middle line:90%
to a whole slew of stuff.

00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:01.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Really opens up so much, and
including the whole question

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.130 align:middle line:90%
about free energy.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:03.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:09.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Travel in space that we could
be doing and free energy, and--

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's been
a huge part of--

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:12.320 align:middle line:90%
>> UFO crashes and--

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:17.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And reverse engineering and
material that I think they have

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.600 align:middle line:84%
just willingly,
without crashing--

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.400 align:middle line:90%
have landed and given us.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And the crop circle
phenomenon, which we'll

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.800 align:middle line:90%
talk about later a little bit.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.460 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, all of it is--

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:35.380 align:middle line:84%
it just keeps going
bigger and bigger.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.320 align:middle line:84%
You think the world is a big
place in the world that's

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.550 align:middle line:84%
being projected to humanity,
you know, on a day to day basis.

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:46.300 align:middle line:84%
But once you start really
looking deep into these other

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.680 align:middle line:84%
areas, it's-- the
universe is so vast.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:49.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yeah.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.362 align:middle line:90%
We're just a teeny speck.

00:12:52.362 --> 00:12:53.162 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:53.162 --> 00:12:53.584 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:53.584 --> 00:12:54.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:56.650 align:middle line:84%
>> And we make such a big
deal about little things.

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:57.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:58.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Every one of us.

00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:59.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:00.660 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:01.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my gosh.

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:02.410 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:04.460 align:middle line:90%
Once in a while--

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:05.260 align:middle line:90%
oh, gosh.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:12.430 align:middle line:84%
Maybe 1 out of 15 people I've
regressed to ET encounters

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:16.960 align:middle line:84%
said that once in a while,
in the middle of the session,

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.510 align:middle line:84%
that person will start
giving information

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:23.410 align:middle line:84%
from the beings who are right
there in that experience

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:24.600 align:middle line:90%
with the person.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:26.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Or even--

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:29.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've been
amazed, but it's

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:34.630 align:middle line:84%
happened at least
several times since 1991,

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:39.820 align:middle line:84%
when I first started doing this
part of my regression work,

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:46.030 align:middle line:84%
the being will say, I or
we want to talk to Barbara.

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:49.750 align:middle line:84%
So they-- I mean, you
know, it's really difficult

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:53.980 align:middle line:84%
to figure how they know
that, and even when

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:58.250 align:middle line:84%
we're regressing to a
previous experience that

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:00.070 align:middle line:90%
happened earlier sometime.

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:03.040 align:middle line:84%
But you know, so maybe all
time really is simultaneous.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:08.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And anyway-- and they
definitely, I'm convinced,

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:12.670 align:middle line:84%
have tremendous sense
of remote viewing,

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:13.940 align:middle line:90%
we would probably call it.

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:20.030 align:middle line:84%
But they, from wherever they
are, presumably vast distances,

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:26.030 align:middle line:84%
they know little details about
us and our inner thoughts,

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:27.640 align:middle line:90%
even.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.930 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that is amazing to me.

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:30.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:32.200 align:middle line:90%
>> But it's happened.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:37.080 align:middle line:84%
That's-- and those are the
types of things that, yeah,

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:41.410 align:middle line:84%
I want to have come out in this
documentary to let people know

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:46.190 align:middle line:84%
that there's some
high strangeness.

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's out there, and we
just have to look into it.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:51.750 align:middle line:90%
And

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:53.118 align:middle line:90%
>> Expose it.

00:14:53.118 --> 00:14:54.910 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm doing
with all the cameras.

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:55.710 align:middle line:90%
Exposing the--

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:58.140 align:middle line:84%
>> And be in awe and
great respect and--

00:14:58.140 --> 00:14:58.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:14:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Awe.

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:01.073 align:middle line:90%
>> It's nothing to be afraid of.

00:15:01.073 --> 00:15:02.030 align:middle line:90%
>> In a positive way.

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:02.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:08.260 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, these are fantastic
abilities and they say that we

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.980 align:middle line:84%
have the potential for
using those abilities.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:17.020 align:middle line:84%
That most people don't
use them, but all--

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.120 align:middle line:84%
we all, in a latent
sense, do have them.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep, absolutely.

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>> So that I think the more that
we know what they can do with

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:25.480 align:middle line:90%
us--

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.280 align:middle line:90%
>> It opens up.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Even from a vast distance,
like thinking or speaking

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:34.990 align:middle line:84%
telepathically, I
mean, we, apparently,

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:37.670 align:middle line:84%
will have the
ability to do that.

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:42.640 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think I've ever done
it or heard really accurately,

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:43.840 align:middle line:90%
word for word--

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.480 align:middle line:90%
heard somebody else's thoughts.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, same.

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.920 align:middle line:84%
>> I can pick up what they
might be thinking, you know,

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.400 align:middle line:84%
but we apparently have much
more ability than that.

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.210 align:middle line:84%
So I think that the
more that we can

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:58.060 align:middle line:84%
hear about these beings
doing these things,

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:01.870 align:middle line:84%
the more we're likely to
think, gee, yeah, maybe

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:04.970 align:middle line:84%
I could really start
developing that, too.

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's kind of like
the Olympics or, you know,

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:11.360 align:middle line:90%
the world record.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Somebody does something
amazing and most people

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.340 align:middle line:90%
don't know it can be done.

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:18.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:19.910 align:middle line:90%
>> And then, you know, for--

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:22.790 align:middle line:84%
I think it was like the 100
meter dash or something,

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:25.220 align:middle line:84%
you know, this--
back in the day--

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.450 align:middle line:84%
somebody breaks
the world record.

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And then within days,
even, so many other people

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:31.930 align:middle line:90%
break that record.

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:32.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:34.460 align:middle line:84%
Now that they know
it can be done.

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Now that they
know it can be done.

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:36.695 align:middle line:90%
>> And then they get spurred on.

00:16:36.695 --> 00:16:38.360 align:middle line:84%
I want to do even
better than that.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:39.860 align:middle line:90%
>> And they do.

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:40.660 align:middle line:90%
>> And they do.

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:42.140 align:middle line:90%
And that's humanity.

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:46.430 align:middle line:84%
I think we just have lost
the knowledge that we

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:51.700 align:middle line:84%
can be telepathically connected
with, you know-- all that is.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And we keep telling ourselves
that it's not possible,

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:58.500 align:middle line:84%
when there are people on this
planet that are doing it.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:01.160 align:middle line:90%
>> And off-planet, especially.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.880 align:middle line:84%
But you know, even
on this planet,

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:09.109 align:middle line:84%
there are telepathic people
who clearly have this ability,

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:10.619 align:middle line:90%
and we just keep denying it.

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:12.182 align:middle line:84%
So once, I think,
collectively, we--

00:17:12.182 --> 00:17:13.849 align:middle line:84%
>> Or we think, well,
they're different.

00:17:13.849 --> 00:17:15.150 align:middle line:90%
They're special.

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:17.280 align:middle line:90%
You know, I'm not like that.

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>> But I think if--

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.480 align:middle line:84%
maybe when we have
the Psychic Olympics,

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.486 align:middle line:84%
you know, and then
it's publicized on TV.

00:17:22.486 --> 00:17:23.569 align:middle line:90%
>> Wouldn't that be great?

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:25.569 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, this person
has achieved this goal.

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:26.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my gosh.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:27.859 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, what an exciting idea.

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:30.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Then everybody's like,
oh, OK, I've got do that.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:30.980 align:middle line:90%
And then the next--

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:31.938 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, practice that.

00:17:31.938 --> 00:17:33.026 align:middle line:90%
>> Practice that, yeah.

00:17:33.026 --> 00:17:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Have to be in training.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:36.020 align:middle line:90%
Mental training.

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:39.030 align:middle line:84%
>> What is he
thinking right now?

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:40.530 align:middle line:84%
I know exactly what
you're thinking.

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:42.655 align:middle line:84%
>> He's thinking, how is
he going to get this shot?

00:17:42.655 --> 00:17:43.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:49.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's take a look, Reuben,
at what you would like to focus

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.410 align:middle line:90%
on for this regression.

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:56.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I've been
regressed once,

00:17:56.450 --> 00:18:01.320 align:middle line:84%
and I guess the key purpose of
that was to kind of tap in to--

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.286 align:middle line:90%


00:18:04.286 --> 00:18:08.750 align:middle line:84%
to try to open up a connection
to my higher self or my guides

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:14.450 align:middle line:84%
or, you know, this
other version of myself

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:17.460 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't have
the ego so much.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.260 align:middle line:90%
And I think that--

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:21.740 align:middle line:84%
I know that that's a key
component to regression work,

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:27.240 align:middle line:90%
is getting through the garbage.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.530 align:middle line:84%
Not the garbage, but all the
layers upon layers of stuff

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:35.210 align:middle line:84%
that we-- blockages that
we put on ourselves.

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:41.831 align:middle line:84%
So-- and I had a
great experience,

00:18:41.831 --> 00:18:48.980 align:middle line:84%
having visions or ideas
and things come up

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:52.610 align:middle line:90%
that I was kind of oblivious to.

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:56.420 align:middle line:84%
So maybe just exploring
that, and maybe

00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:01.160 align:middle line:84%
we can ask if there are
any ET guides, potentially,

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.650 align:middle line:90%
because that's what--

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:07.760 align:middle line:84%
with your specialty and
with what I'm doing now.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:13.250 align:middle line:84%
If there are any kind of
extraterrestrial beings

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:14.750 align:middle line:84%
that might want to
come through me.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:17.380 align:middle line:90%


00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And that would be maybe
the main goal, I think.

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:24.035 align:middle line:90%
And that's in the form--

00:19:24.035 --> 00:19:25.410 align:middle line:84%
and then I say
extraterrestrial--

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:30.590 align:middle line:84%
it's actually extra-dimensional
because a lot of these beings

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:35.660 align:middle line:84%
have said, yes, they may be
coming from such and such star

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:39.440 align:middle line:84%
system or doing this, but
a better term would be

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.900 align:middle line:84%
extra-dimensional because
they've gotten a point

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.180 align:middle line:84%
in their evolution
where they can--

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:47.780 align:middle line:84%
like you said, time and
space doesn't necessarily

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:49.560 align:middle line:84%
have the meaning
that it has here.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:50.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So they're kind of
transcending this dimension

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:58.860 align:middle line:84%
and living in other
dimensions in time.

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:03.140 align:middle line:84%
So any extra-dimensionals
who might

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:11.690 align:middle line:84%
want to use me as a vehicle, and
that could be my higher self.

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:14.540 align:middle line:84%
I think in often cases, with
these other interviews I've

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:19.405 align:middle line:84%
been doing, the so-called
ETs or extra-dimensionals

00:20:19.405 --> 00:20:20.780 align:middle line:84%
that are coming
through, I think,

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:24.080 align:middle line:90%
are versions of these people.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>> These people?

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:25.580 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you mean--

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>> The channelers.

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:27.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:30.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Who channel this information.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:32.180 align:middle line:90%
I feel like some of--

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:33.680 align:middle line:84%
you know, and they
give them names.

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.388 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm so-and-so
from the Pleiades

00:20:35.388 --> 00:20:38.730 align:middle line:84%
or I'm so-and-so
from Zeta Reticuli.

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:40.640 align:middle line:90%
A lot of times-- this is my--

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm still working
on this theory.

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:42.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>> But I think it is their
higher self or a version

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:48.150 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:53.030 align:middle line:84%
>> In other words, I think
you're saying that the person

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:55.290 align:middle line:90%
is multi-dimensional.

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:57.230 align:middle line:90%
>> And I think we all are.

00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:57.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:58.710 align:middle line:90%
>> We just don't--

00:20:58.710 --> 00:20:59.990 align:middle line:90%
most of us just don't know it.

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Or even those who are open
to the idea don't think of it--

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:06.123 align:middle line:90%
don't know it most of the time.

00:21:06.123 --> 00:21:08.540 align:middle line:84%
>> To think that there's another
version of you on another

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:10.120 align:middle line:84%
planet somewhere
doing something.

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:10.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yeah.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:11.520 align:middle line:90%
>> How is that possible?

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe in a parallel universe,
we may have a whole lot

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:17.010 align:middle line:90%
of other uses.

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:17.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:19.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Going on at the same time.

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:19.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:19.670 align:middle line:90%
And I--

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:21.600 align:middle line:90%
>> And in different dimensions.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:22.580 align:middle line:90%
It could be.

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:23.760 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what I'm--

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:28.257 align:middle line:84%
my belief systems are starting
to form into that direction,

00:21:28.257 --> 00:21:29.840 align:middle line:84%
and so that's where
I'd like to invite

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:34.460 align:middle line:84%
in today is any other
versions of myself that

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:39.570 align:middle line:84%
would be particular to the ET
frequency, if it's possible.

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:40.370 align:middle line:90%
We'll see.

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:41.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm open to it.

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:42.920 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm
putting out there.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:43.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:43.480 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.147 align:middle line:84%
>> If you guys are listening out
there, that's what I'm looking.

00:21:46.147 --> 00:21:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, well let's send
out an open invitation.

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:51.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:57.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And I certainly
have had experience.

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:01.170 align:middle line:84%
One remarkable time in
particular that stands out,

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:08.450 align:middle line:90%
but where I know that--

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:12.170 align:middle line:84%
well, one time I was in a
terrible jam that I thought

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:20.900 align:middle line:84%
was really life threatening, and
I said inside myself, silently,

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:23.170 align:middle line:90%
I really--

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:25.260 align:middle line:90%
I really need help.

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:27.800 align:middle line:90%
And the next thing I knew--

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:31.430 align:middle line:84%
it was a poisonous snake
approaching me in Peru--

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:39.530 align:middle line:84%
and next thing I knew, I was
up out of that Lotus position

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:41.182 align:middle line:90%
on a very low rock.

00:22:41.182 --> 00:22:42.140 align:middle line:90%
>> You were meditating?

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:43.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Ledge.

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And the snake was
approaching, and I

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.560 align:middle line:84%
knew it was a kind
of snake that had

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:51.980 align:middle line:90%
killed many, many workers at--

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:53.900 align:middle line:90%
this was up at Machu Picchu.

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And when Hiram Bingham had
cleared away the jungle

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:03.170 align:middle line:90%
to expose Machu Picchu--

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:05.730 align:middle line:84%
and I was where I
wasn't supposed to be.

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:08.270 align:middle line:90%
I always do that.

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:10.820 align:middle line:84%
This time, it was
really serious,

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.400 align:middle line:84%
and I could see this
snake, which it killed--

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.560 align:middle line:84%
that type-- it killed
so many people.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And usually, they die
within 30 seconds.

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:18.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it was that
particular kind of snake.

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:22.850 align:middle line:90%
I've forgotten the name.

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Black with a yellow spot
on the side near its eye.

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And so when I said,
gosh, I really need help.

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:34.470 align:middle line:90%
I just didn't know what to do.

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:36.950 align:middle line:84%
I thought it would
strike if I undid my legs

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:39.230 align:middle line:84%
and pushed myself
up from the rock

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:41.480 align:middle line:90%
and grabbed my little backpack.

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And you know, that
would cause a ruckus

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:50.170 align:middle line:84%
and it would probably strike,
so I just froze, and--

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:53.850 align:middle line:84%
but I knew this was very
serious, and after I said,

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:55.370 align:middle line:90%
I really need help--

00:23:55.370 --> 00:24:00.140 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't specifically calling on
a guide or an angel knowingly,

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:04.220 align:middle line:84%
but the next thing I knew,
I was hundreds of feet

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:09.290 align:middle line:84%
from there, being
lowered onto the ground,

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:14.960 align:middle line:84%
running like a parachutist--
hit the ground running.

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And-- with my backpack,
and I was safe.

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:19.490 align:middle line:90%
I mean, really.

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:20.980 align:middle line:90%
Hundreds of yards away.

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:22.820 align:middle line:90%
A whole different section.

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:24.100 align:middle line:90%
And I was fine.

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:29.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And I don't know what did
that, but I didn't do it.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.560 align:middle line:90%
I know I didn't do that.

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:32.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:36.972 align:middle line:84%
>> So that was so
important for me.

00:24:36.972 --> 00:24:39.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, not only to live through
the experience, of course,

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:42.860 align:middle line:84%
but to know that
this sort of thing

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:46.220 align:middle line:84%
can happen when you
sincerely mean it.

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:51.650 align:middle line:84%
You need help, and
gosh, thank you again.

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:54.860 align:middle line:84%
Wow, I was helped out in China
when I was in a real jam,

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:56.900 align:middle line:90%
and oh my god.

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:58.820 align:middle line:90%
Just amazing.

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And not seeing the beings,
but definitely having them

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:05.730 align:middle line:90%
take action.

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:10.210 align:middle line:84%
So I'm personally very
open to that sort of thing.

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:11.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:11.810 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:14.990 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think I heard a
great quote not too long

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:21.560 align:middle line:84%
ago that one of the greatest
awarenesses humanity

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:28.400 align:middle line:84%
can have for itself is that
we're not alone, and this--

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.980 align:middle line:84%
you know, not just
in the physical form,

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:36.590 align:middle line:84%
but you know, in
these other energies.

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And actually, all alone, if you
take out one of the Ls, it's--

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:42.590 align:middle line:90%
or if you take--

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:43.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:47.420 align:middle line:84%
All one-- take out one
of the Ls, it's alone.

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:49.670 align:middle line:84%
So it actually
means we're all one.

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:50.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:51.890 align:middle line:90%
Well that's nice.

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>> So alone-- there is
no such thing as alone.

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.120 align:middle line:90%
It's just-- we're all one.

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And we just have
that illusion sometimes.

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:01.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:04.977 align:middle line:84%
>> We just feel
isolated, but we're not.

00:26:04.977 --> 00:26:05.810 align:middle line:90%
>> But we're never--

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:07.770 align:middle line:84%
>> It's really--
it's totally full.

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:08.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:09.520 align:middle line:90%
>> All the time.

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And like you said,
these beings can--

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:13.640 align:middle line:90%
they know our thoughts.

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:15.110 align:middle line:90%
They know what's going on.

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:17.210 align:middle line:84%
They know where we
poop, where we pee.

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:18.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Everything.

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Everything.

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:19.040 align:middle line:90%
And it's--

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>> And the beautiful
moments, too.

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:21.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:23.480 align:middle line:90%
And it's all-- and it is.

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:29.550 align:middle line:84%
It's all beautiful, you
know, and having that

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:33.180 align:middle line:84%
and just accepting of that and
not being scared or afraid.

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:33.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:35.820 align:middle line:84%
>> There's nothing
to be afraid of.

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:36.800 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:37.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:38.550 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:43.890 align:middle line:84%
Well you've said the
sighting we talked about.

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:48.210 align:middle line:84%
Your mother had encounter
experiences of some sort.

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Does it seem like you've ever
had any kind of visitation

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:54.480 align:middle line:90%
with them?

00:26:54.480 --> 00:27:00.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't have any conscious
memories of such a thing.

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:04.350 align:middle line:84%
I'd be totally open
to try to find out

00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:06.420 align:middle line:90%
if such an event has happened.

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:09.120 align:middle line:90%


00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.940 align:middle line:84%
Like we were just saying,
we're not-- we're never alone.

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:17.430 align:middle line:84%
So I do believe, like,
every day, there's

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:18.370 align:middle line:90%
something going on.

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:20.030 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:21.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:25.350 align:middle line:84%
>> But I've actually
been on board a ship or--

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:29.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm very curious to
know that, as well.

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:32.040 align:middle line:84%
So if that's something
you can help find out

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.110 align:middle line:90%
and go into, then--

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.910 align:middle line:90%
>> It might.

00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:36.400 align:middle line:84%
It might possibly
come into this.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.200 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:37.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:38.420 align:middle line:90%
That would be--

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:42.510 align:middle line:84%
>> But I think we sort of
need to aim in one particular

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:47.400 align:middle line:84%
direction, and it seems like
the direction that's more--

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.070 align:middle line:90%


00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:55.950 align:middle line:84%
you know, do you really have
any or go to a time maybe

00:27:55.950 --> 00:28:01.890 align:middle line:84%
when you've had input from
other dimensional beings

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:04.170 align:middle line:90%
or extraterrestrial beings.

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And maybe from other
higher dimensional aspects

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:09.430 align:middle line:90%
of yourself.

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:10.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think we'll
sort of start with that.

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:20.660 align:middle line:90%


00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:23.960 align:middle line:84%
OK, Reuben, now we're
going to do a regression.

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:24.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:29.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Or maybe we will just
call it a deeper process

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:34.040 align:middle line:84%
because we're not necessarily
going back to something,

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.440 align:middle line:84%
which is implied
in a regression.

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.800 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, you can go
deeply within yourself

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.140 align:middle line:90%
in a very nice, relaxed way.

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And allow another part of
yourself to come through

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.480 align:middle line:90%
and to speak to you.

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:55.340 align:middle line:84%
In other words, another
version of yourself

00:28:55.340 --> 00:29:00.380 align:middle line:84%
that resides in other
frequencies, other dimensions,

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:05.610 align:middle line:84%
and maybe even
extra-dimensional frequencies.

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:08.780 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there
is so much more to you--

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:14.030 align:middle line:84%
you are aware-- than meets
the eye, as this very

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:17.150 align:middle line:90%
nice, human person you are.

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:19.580 align:middle line:90%
There's much, much more to it.

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:21.230 align:middle line:90%
To all of us.

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:25.395 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to go into a nice
state of deep relaxation now.

00:29:25.395 --> 00:29:26.510 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:31.640 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're settled comfortably
with your head supported.

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I think it's
pretty good in there.

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:37.290 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:46.530 align:middle line:84%
So have a sense now of
deepening in, relaxing

00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:56.820 align:middle line:84%
in with your whole body
having the feeling of resting,

00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:04.440 align:middle line:84%
easing, even sinking back
and down into the support

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:09.330 align:middle line:84%
under and behind you,
allowing your body

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:14.880 align:middle line:84%
to feel more heavy,
more and more heavy,

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.550 align:middle line:90%
and more and more relaxed.

00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:17.350 align:middle line:90%
As you--

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:21.580 align:middle line:90%


00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:23.005 align:middle line:90%
Let it come through now.

00:30:23.005 --> 00:30:26.690 align:middle line:90%


00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Even if it doesn't
make any sense,

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:40.275 align:middle line:84%
just mention anything beginning
to come through to you now.

00:30:40.275 --> 00:30:44.350 align:middle line:90%


00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Just got really hot.

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:48.905 align:middle line:90%
>> Really hot?

00:30:48.905 --> 00:30:49.705 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:49.705 --> 00:30:52.240 align:middle line:90%


00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Is that just a body temperature
hot or some other kind

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:01.750 align:middle line:90%
of feeling hot?

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, like a body
temperature kind of thing.

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:08.320 align:middle line:84%
As we were counting
down, just started

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.170 align:middle line:90%
getting hotter and hotter.

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:12.310 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:13.490 align:middle line:90%
And it could be--

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:16.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And now it's pretty
intense hot, too.

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:17.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Pardon?

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:19.280 align:middle line:90%
>> And now it's pretty hot.

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:22.190 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:27.680 align:middle line:84%
It could possibly be
that the increasing heat

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:35.240 align:middle line:84%
is that some other, perhaps
higher aspect of you

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:42.650 align:middle line:84%
is becoming more present
and building up that heat

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:47.980 align:middle line:84%
and wishing to
communicate itself.

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:57.500 align:middle line:84%
So just breathe with it, being
welcoming, being opening.

00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:00.215 align:middle line:84%
I think it will become
more comfortable.

00:32:00.215 --> 00:32:03.780 align:middle line:90%


00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:09.080 align:middle line:84%
So just allowing--
actually inviting

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:10.580 align:middle line:90%
some other part of yourself.

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:16.350 align:middle line:90%


00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So maybe that's one way to
serve is to help and give this

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.486 align:middle line:90%
message.

00:32:28.486 --> 00:32:29.575 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, to--

00:32:29.575 --> 00:32:32.860 align:middle line:84%
a way to serve is to help
and give this message.

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:38.520 align:middle line:90%
>> A message of non-dualism.

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think it could be
helpful if the messages

00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:48.180 align:middle line:90%
of non-dualism--

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:58.162 align:middle line:84%
to find a way to articulate what
it is, rather than a dualism.

00:32:58.162 --> 00:33:05.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, it's the whole.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:10.790 align:middle line:84%
You have light and
dark, and then you

00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:15.260 align:middle line:90%
have them combined for a--

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:17.860 align:middle line:90%


00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:19.180 align:middle line:90%
which makes the whole.

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:22.240 align:middle line:90%
The third-- the missing aspect.

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:28.880 align:middle line:84%
Too often, humanity's
focused on the polarities--

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.070 align:middle line:90%
the opposites.

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:31.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:40.055 align:middle line:84%
>> So by including
the third aspect--

00:33:40.055 --> 00:33:47.664 align:middle line:84%
the whole-- it creates
a different perspective

00:33:47.664 --> 00:33:57.160 align:middle line:84%
on everything that
is done in life.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:01.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And are you seeing the
triangle as a really good

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:03.100 align:middle line:90%
symbol of that?

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:04.652 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:34:04.652 --> 00:34:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And many extra-dimensionals--
extraterrestrial beings

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:23.520 align:middle line:84%
use this symbol as
a kind of reminder.

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.953 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:34:25.953 --> 00:34:42.070 align:middle line:84%
>> To remind each other
of this sacred knowledge.

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:46.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Primarily to
remind each other?

00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:48.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Like our military uses
patches and insignias

00:34:54.880 --> 00:35:04.330 align:middle line:84%
to remind each other of rank
and which military group

00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:05.130 align:middle line:90%
they belong to.

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:09.570 align:middle line:90%


00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:14.508 align:middle line:84%
These other beings
use these symbols

00:35:14.508 --> 00:35:23.381 align:middle line:84%
to remind each other of
the sacred knowledge.

00:35:23.381 --> 00:35:26.680 align:middle line:90%


00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So it sort of implies
that the extraterrestrials

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:37.210 align:middle line:90%
and the other dimensionals--

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:41.820 align:middle line:84%
they're all in
league or in harmony

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:44.530 align:middle line:90%
or a part of each other.

00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:45.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And they've embraced
all that there is.

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:58.252 align:middle line:84%
The light and the dark and
seeing everything as a whole.

00:35:58.252 --> 00:36:03.410 align:middle line:90%


00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:10.560 align:middle line:84%
One unit, interconnected,
is the way

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:19.230 align:middle line:84%
to have a higher
perspective on life.

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:22.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:27.230 align:middle line:84%
Seems like it's a higher
perspective on everything.

00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:28.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:32.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Not only life, but
all that there is.

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:33.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:35.840 align:middle line:90%
>> All the planets.

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:37.420 align:middle line:90%
All the dimensions.

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:39.605 align:middle line:90%
>> All of space.

00:36:39.605 --> 00:36:40.405 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes

00:36:40.405 --> 00:36:43.270 align:middle line:90%
>> The macrocosm, the microcosm.

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:46.025 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:46.025 --> 00:36:52.560 align:middle line:90%
It's all one.

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.395 align:middle line:90%
The yin and yang symbol.

00:36:54.395 --> 00:36:55.690 align:middle line:90%
>> The yin yang.

00:36:55.690 --> 00:37:00.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Is a great example of this.

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:09.930 align:middle line:84%
However, most of-- many
people seem to only look at it

00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:14.380 align:middle line:84%
as light and dark,
when in fact, it is--

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:16.020 align:middle line:90%
>> 'Cause those opposites.

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:26.160 align:middle line:84%
But the circle that encompasses
is the third aspect.

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:29.264 align:middle line:90%
The Trinity aspect.

00:37:29.264 --> 00:37:30.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.260 align:middle line:84%
>> The third point
in the triangle.

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:36.100 align:middle line:90%


00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And the point is
really more the circle--

00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:44.140 align:middle line:90%
the encompassing of all of that.

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:44.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Of any opposites.

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:50.075 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:37:50.075 --> 00:37:58.820 align:middle line:84%
So you have light dark
and light and dark.

00:37:58.820 --> 00:37:59.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:06.440 align:middle line:84%
OK, so it's not just light
or dark, but light and dark.

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:07.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Together, all as one.

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:10.848 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:38:10.848 --> 00:38:15.030 align:middle line:90%


00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:21.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Well I think that definitely
is very germane to what is

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:29.310 align:middle line:84%
going on in the world, in
terms of certain countries

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:33.750 align:middle line:84%
and factions being so
against each other--

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:36.420 align:middle line:90%
so much in opposition.

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:44.460 align:middle line:84%
So-- emphasizing the differences
and making the other bad

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:46.840 align:middle line:90%
and creating all that turmoil.

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:51.193 align:middle line:84%
>> And that only
creates more opposition.

00:38:51.193 --> 00:38:54.151 align:middle line:90%


00:38:54.151 --> 00:39:01.240 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't help the situation.

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:11.325 align:middle line:84%
It just creates-- by declaring
one side over the other,

00:39:11.325 --> 00:39:14.280 align:middle line:90%
it creates more of--

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:16.300 align:middle line:90%
more sides.

00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:17.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:28.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And then there
is no way to heal.

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:41.493 align:middle line:84%
No way to have peace with
constant taking sides.

00:39:41.493 --> 00:39:44.990 align:middle line:90%


00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:49.370 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, one has
to embrace the other.

00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:56.972 align:middle line:90%


00:39:56.972 --> 00:40:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And then a new form of
evolution can begin.

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:09.650 align:middle line:90%


00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And are you seeing that
this new form of evolution is

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:21.480 align:middle line:84%
something that could really
happen within humanity?

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:22.662 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:40:22.662 --> 00:40:25.017 align:middle line:90%
Yes, of course.

00:40:25.017 --> 00:40:37.156 align:middle line:84%
That is the inevitable
direction of humanity

00:40:37.156 --> 00:40:51.130 align:middle line:84%
is to embrace the Trinity and
evolve into a new species.

00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:55.530 align:middle line:90%


00:40:55.530 --> 00:41:02.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And does it seem
as if these beings,

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:13.420 align:middle line:84%
including yourself as a
being from another dimension,

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:21.970 align:middle line:84%
can really see this and is
giving this message to you?

00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, they've embraced these
concepts and have evolved

00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:49.770 align:middle line:84%
in their own ways, and have
technology and ways of life

00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:54.900 align:middle line:84%
that reflect this
way of thinking.

00:41:54.900 --> 00:42:00.125 align:middle line:90%


00:42:00.125 --> 00:42:09.800 align:middle line:84%
So they see the destructive
mannerisms of humanity

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:28.060 align:middle line:84%
and its constant separation or
taking sides, and feel empathy.

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:31.480 align:middle line:90%


00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:32.510 align:middle line:90%
>> They feel empathy?

00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:33.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>> For the human race?

00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:37.355 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:42:37.355 --> 00:43:03.060 align:middle line:84%
So they would like to share
their experiences and evolution

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:05.685 align:middle line:84%
so that humanity
can also evolve.

00:43:05.685 --> 00:43:09.185 align:middle line:90%


00:43:09.185 --> 00:43:09.985 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:43:09.985 --> 00:43:16.310 align:middle line:84%
So they would apparently like
humanity to know about them

00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:17.940 align:middle line:90%
and to know that it's possible.

00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:18.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:21.550 align:middle line:90%
>> To live in this other way.

00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:32.040 align:middle line:84%
>> However, when you're trapped
in the taking side attitude,

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:46.720 align:middle line:84%
the not seeing the whole,
it's hard to see the missing

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:49.000 align:middle line:90%
aspects.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And they see humanity as
being trapped in this way?

00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:57.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Certain people, yes.

00:43:57.970 --> 00:44:01.260 align:middle line:90%
Certain governments.

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Certain people tend
to remain stuck,

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:17.450 align:middle line:84%
but others are awakening
and sharing their knowledge

00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:20.390 align:middle line:90%
and influencing the collective.

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:24.800 align:middle line:90%


00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And slowly, humanity
is waking up.

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:32.300 align:middle line:90%


00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:41.075 align:middle line:84%
And then once that
process is done,

00:44:41.075 --> 00:44:50.830 align:middle line:84%
a whole other world
will be revealed.

00:44:50.830 --> 00:44:53.530 align:middle line:90%


00:44:53.530 --> 00:45:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there any way that these
who are giving this perspective

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:07.960 align:middle line:84%
can see that we who are
hearing this right now can be

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:11.974 align:middle line:84%
of assistance in bringing about
this better understanding?

00:45:11.974 --> 00:45:15.926 align:middle line:90%


00:45:15.926 --> 00:45:19.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm not sure I
understand the question.

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>> These changes are
very needed here.

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:23.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:24.730 align:middle line:90%
>> In humanity.

00:45:24.730 --> 00:45:25.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's now focus
on how Reuben,

00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:35.660 align:middle line:84%
with all the abilities
and talents that he has--

00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:39.070 align:middle line:84%
how Reuben can be of
assistance in helping

00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:43.350 align:middle line:90%
to bring about this evolution.

00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:54.030 align:middle line:84%
>> By making this film and
influencing the people around

00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:55.230 align:middle line:90%
him.

00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:56.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Influencing what?

00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:57.880 align:middle line:90%
>> The people around him.

00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:58.770 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:01.320 align:middle line:90%
>> With these concepts.

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:04.950 align:middle line:90%
He is doing his part.

00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:09.180 align:middle line:84%
>> So he can influence a much
larger audience, hopefully,

00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:10.110 align:middle line:90%
with the film.

00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And even in daily life with
the people he already knows.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:46:17.810 --> 00:46:24.010 align:middle line:84%
Everyone who understands
these concepts

00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:32.100 align:middle line:84%
and holds them true
to their beingness

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:37.300 align:middle line:90%
is influencing the collective.

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:38.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:40.790 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:46.173 align:middle line:84%
>> They don't all have
to make films about it.

00:46:46.173 --> 00:46:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>> We don't know all
have to make films.

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:49.710 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:50.510 align:middle line:90%
>> That's good.

00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:53.480 align:middle line:90%


00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:55.780 align:middle line:90%
But Reuben can.

00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:56.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:58.562 align:middle line:90%
That is his talent.

00:46:58.562 --> 00:47:06.110 align:middle line:84%
It's what he's good at,
so he's doing his part.

00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And you, who are speaking and
giving this perspective now--

00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:21.550 align:middle line:84%
can you say in a way which
we humans would understand,

00:47:21.550 --> 00:47:24.630 align:middle line:90%
basically, who you are?

00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:29.470 align:middle line:90%
Are you some part of Reuben?

00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, just an aspect of him.

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:34.924 align:middle line:90%


00:47:34.924 --> 00:47:36.860 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:43.250 align:middle line:84%
The information I
have at the moment.

00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:46.880 align:middle line:90%
>> That's all the information.

00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:49.740 align:middle line:90%
I'll just ask one more question.

00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:51.935 align:middle line:84%
>> That's all the
information about--

00:47:51.935 --> 00:47:54.800 align:middle line:90%


00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:58.275 align:middle line:84%
this aspect of
Reuben is just that.

00:47:58.275 --> 00:48:01.070 align:middle line:90%
It is an aspect of Reuben.

00:48:01.070 --> 00:48:02.960 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:06.280 align:middle line:90%
And we get curious.

00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:09.380 align:middle line:84%
I know that Reuben
does get curious

00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:19.660 align:middle line:84%
about, well, the type
of other aspect of him.

00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:23.440 align:middle line:84%
He thinks in terms
of other dimensions,

00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:26.125 align:middle line:90%
other frequencies of reality.

00:48:26.125 --> 00:48:29.300 align:middle line:90%


00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Does it-- could you
say that you are

00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:38.650 align:middle line:84%
an aspect of him in some
other dimension or frequency?

00:48:38.650 --> 00:48:41.380 align:middle line:90%


00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:46.321 align:middle line:84%
>> There are aspects
of that, yes.

00:48:46.321 --> 00:48:58.150 align:middle line:84%
But it's not in his
best interest for him

00:48:58.150 --> 00:49:02.608 align:middle line:90%
to know those details right now.

00:49:02.608 --> 00:49:03.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:08.810 align:middle line:90%


00:49:08.810 --> 00:49:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And I would imagine
that you were basically

00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:16.460 align:middle line:84%
saying that the really
important thing is

00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:18.210 align:middle line:90%
the concept and the message.

00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:19.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:23.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Rather than
exactly what you are.

00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:25.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:28.350 align:middle line:90%
The collective information.

00:49:28.350 --> 00:49:37.719 align:middle line:90%
A collective, universal truth.

00:49:37.719 --> 00:49:38.713 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:49:38.713 --> 00:49:42.690 align:middle line:90%


00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:48.110 align:middle line:84%
It's very rewarding to this
human being right here--

00:49:48.110 --> 00:49:59.250 align:middle line:84%
myself-- to know that there
is cooperation and wholeness

00:49:59.250 --> 00:50:06.930 align:middle line:84%
and mutual acceptance in the
universe by other beings.

00:50:06.930 --> 00:50:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And we do see some of
that here on Earth.

00:50:11.070 --> 00:50:14.980 align:middle line:90%
We need to see so much more.

00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's very gratifying to
know that this does exist

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:27.660 align:middle line:84%
and is a big feature
elsewhere in the universe.

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:28.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:43.810 align:middle line:84%
It's the natural progression and
foundation of building blocks

00:50:43.810 --> 00:50:46.543 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:50:46.543 --> 00:50:47.485 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:50:47.485 --> 00:50:48.285 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:50:48.285 --> 00:50:51.253 align:middle line:90%


00:50:51.253 --> 00:50:54.090 align:middle line:90%
And for the rest of us--

00:50:54.090 --> 00:51:01.830 align:middle line:84%
those of us in third dimension
in what we think of, at least,

00:51:01.830 --> 00:51:08.790 align:middle line:84%
as individual bodies with the
illusion of being separate

00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:17.920 align:middle line:84%
from each other, this is a
very, very helpful reminder--

00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:22.580 align:middle line:84%
a helpful perspective that
we're not really separate.

00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:25.070 align:middle line:90%
We're not really alone.

00:51:25.070 --> 00:51:25.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And by having the triangle
form in your environment,

00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:59.638 align:middle line:84%
it can be a reminder of this in
picture form or artwork or crop

00:51:59.638 --> 00:52:01.500 align:middle line:90%
circles.

00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, there are quite a number
of triangles in crop circles.

00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And they are certainly, in my
opinion, very significantly--

00:52:16.170 --> 00:52:25.930 align:middle line:84%
the circle form itself,
which speaks of wholeness.

00:52:25.930 --> 00:52:26.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:30.130 align:middle line:90%
>> And the everything.

00:52:30.130 --> 00:52:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:52:30.930 --> 00:52:33.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Including spirit.

00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:42.500 align:middle line:84%
Is this one of the
many significances

00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:45.680 align:middle line:90%
of the pyramids on Earth?

00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:52.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, but slightly different.

00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:55.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And would you care
to say more about that?

00:52:55.250 --> 00:53:02.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it is a reminder, but
it also has other purposes.

00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:03.160 align:middle line:90%
The pyramids.

00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:04.210 align:middle line:90%
>> The pyramid?

00:53:04.210 --> 00:53:05.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:07.850 align:middle line:84%
>> The pyramids
themselves, yeah.

00:53:07.850 --> 00:53:12.680 align:middle line:84%
But you'd like Reuben,
I would imagine--

00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:21.040 align:middle line:84%
you'd like Reuben to really
ponder what you have shared

00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:23.110 align:middle line:90%
and bring that forth.

00:53:23.110 --> 00:53:23.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:25.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:27.340 align:middle line:84%
>> It's something
for him to sleep on.

00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:29.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:29.770 --> 00:53:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And would you be willing to
talk through or to Reuben

00:53:36.590 --> 00:53:40.880 align:middle line:84%
on other occasions when
he would seek this?

00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:42.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:44.720 align:middle line:90%
I just asked him to see.

00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:48.080 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:51.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's a good way
for that-- it's

00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:58.320 align:middle line:84%
for him to really
dedicate a time and relax.

00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:00.850 align:middle line:84%
Let him get into a very
nice, relaxed state

00:54:00.850 --> 00:54:07.560 align:middle line:84%
and just be receptive or
perhaps to ask a question.

00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:08.897 align:middle line:90%
Do you have any advice on that?

00:54:08.897 --> 00:54:11.430 align:middle line:90%


00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:12.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:18.650 align:middle line:84%
Of course, asking questions
is the clearest way

00:54:18.650 --> 00:54:20.958 align:middle line:90%
to receive an answer.

00:54:20.958 --> 00:54:24.210 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Instead of just
waiting for a download.

00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:30.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, OK.

00:54:30.210 --> 00:54:32.090 align:middle line:90%
It helps to have a focus, right?

00:54:32.090 --> 00:54:32.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:54:32.890 --> 00:54:38.550 align:middle line:84%
To ask specific questions
creates the frequency

00:54:38.550 --> 00:54:41.902 align:middle line:90%
for the answer to come through.

00:54:41.902 --> 00:54:42.864 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:54:42.864 --> 00:54:45.750 align:middle line:90%


00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:50.080 align:middle line:90%
That's very helpful to know.

00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:50.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:53.270 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:58.040 align:middle line:84%
I honor this and I know
that Reuben will, as well.

00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's to the point,
really, is that he

00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:06.010 align:middle line:90%
will honor this and use this.

00:55:06.010 --> 00:55:08.380 align:middle line:90%
So again, I thank you.

00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:10.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:55:10.030 --> 00:55:11.460 align:middle line:90%
>> And then, Reuben--

00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:14.040 align:middle line:90%


00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:18.720 align:middle line:84%
bringing you, Reuben,
back into awareness.

00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:26.241 align:middle line:84%
Now letting you be fully
you, lying here on this sofa.

00:55:26.241 --> 00:55:29.130 align:middle line:90%


00:55:29.130 --> 00:55:35.600 align:middle line:84%
Have you been aware of special
information coming through?

00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:36.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:37.850 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, great.

00:55:37.850 --> 00:55:40.540 align:middle line:90%


00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And you will remember and
there is also a record of it.

00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you will use
this wonderfully in your life

00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:54.455 align:middle line:90%
and in your work.

00:55:54.455 --> 00:55:57.425 align:middle line:90%
It's very blessed.

00:55:57.425 --> 00:56:00.400 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:04.940 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm going to
ask you to come back

00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:09.572 align:middle line:84%
to this time and this
place and this situation.

00:56:09.572 --> 00:56:12.430 align:middle line:84%
It will take a little
bit of time to do this.

00:56:12.430 --> 00:56:17.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be counting from
number one to number five,

00:56:17.850 --> 00:56:20.290 align:middle line:84%
and when we get to
number five, you'll

00:56:20.290 --> 00:56:25.750 align:middle line:84%
be able to open your
eyes and sit up and be

00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:31.810 align:middle line:84%
more light, alert,
refreshed, awake,

00:56:31.810 --> 00:56:37.060 align:middle line:84%
and to go on with the rest
of your day and your evening.

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:39.330 align:middle line:90%
So number one.

00:56:39.330 --> 00:56:41.230 align:middle line:84%
You can really thank
yourself, Reuben--

00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And number five,
opening your eyes,

00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:49.110 align:middle line:84%
feeling more light, alert,
refreshed, awake every moment.

00:56:49.110 --> 00:56:51.710 align:middle line:90%
Increasingly alert.

00:56:51.710 --> 00:56:53.590 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:56:53.590 --> 00:56:56.450 align:middle line:84%
Taking in what's right here
in your field of vision.

00:56:56.450 --> 00:56:57.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:56:57.250 --> 00:57:00.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Whew, that was good.

00:57:00.530 --> 00:57:02.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:57:02.590 --> 00:57:05.964 align:middle line:84%
What do you get back
out of the experience?

00:57:05.964 --> 00:57:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Just sit up here.

00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:08.430 align:middle line:90%
I am sweaty.

00:57:08.430 --> 00:57:10.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, you really did get hot.

00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:11.620 align:middle line:90%
You meant it.

00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:13.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow, I have a feeling--

00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:19.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't
know for sure, but I

00:57:19.630 --> 00:57:24.510 align:middle line:84%
have a feeling that that was the
effect of this coming through.

00:57:24.510 --> 00:57:25.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:57:25.310 --> 00:57:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it seemed like you
were really getting hot when it

00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:31.350 align:middle line:84%
was just starting to
percolate through.

00:57:31.350 --> 00:57:32.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:32.500 align:middle line:90%
Just--

00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:33.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Into your awareness.

00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:36.895 align:middle line:90%
>> That's-- it was--

00:57:36.895 --> 00:57:39.460 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to pay attention
to all the sensations

00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:43.006 align:middle line:84%
and everything, and
there's a certain aspect

00:57:43.006 --> 00:57:48.930 align:middle line:90%
of is something going to happen?

00:57:48.930 --> 00:57:50.500 align:middle line:90%
What's going to happen?

00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:51.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:54.455 align:middle line:84%
There's always part of you that
can't help but wonder that.

00:57:54.455 --> 00:57:55.255 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:57:55.255 --> 00:57:56.580 align:middle line:90%
>> As you're going through it.

00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:58.590 align:middle line:84%
Or even is anything
going to happen?

00:57:58.590 --> 00:57:59.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:57:59.390 --> 00:58:00.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:58:00.050 --> 00:58:02.490 align:middle line:84%
>> But it really helped when
you started asking me questions

00:58:02.490 --> 00:58:03.323 align:middle line:90%
because then I can--

00:58:03.323 --> 00:58:04.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Then things would just
kind of pop into my head.

00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:12.240 align:middle line:90%


00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:15.210 align:middle line:84%
I guess, like, the
answers would be there

00:58:15.210 --> 00:58:21.510 align:middle line:84%
or I'd have visions or
something would come through.

00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:23.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, kind of
give a little focus.

00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:27.214 align:middle line:90%
A little structure to it.

00:58:27.214 --> 00:58:30.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and then
I was kind of--

00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:32.580 align:middle line:84%
I was aware the whole
time-- what was happening.

00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:35.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I guess as
you were walking me

00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:40.920 align:middle line:84%
through, there were
times when your voice--

00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:44.250 align:middle line:84%
I think I maybe fell asleep
or went completely out

00:58:44.250 --> 00:58:46.140 align:middle line:84%
because your voice
was totally gone.

00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:48.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And then I would
come back and--

00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:50.263 align:middle line:90%
oh, there's that voice again.

00:58:50.263 --> 00:58:51.930 align:middle line:84%
>> As we were doing
the relaxation part?

00:58:51.930 --> 00:58:52.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:54.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that happens
to a lot of people.

00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:56.460 align:middle line:90%
>> So I don't know.

00:58:56.460 --> 00:58:58.040 align:middle line:84%
There's parts in
there that I missed.

00:58:58.040 --> 00:58:58.915 align:middle line:90%
>> It doesn't matter.

00:58:58.915 --> 00:59:00.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as long as
you get relaxed.

00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:01.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:59:01.470 --> 00:59:08.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And then I guess one
of the oddest sensations--

00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:11.130 align:middle line:90%


00:59:11.130 --> 00:59:15.360 align:middle line:84%
and I guess this is how I
could tell that there was some

00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:20.160 align:middle line:84%
guidance or information coming
through that wasn't-- that I

00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:22.140 align:middle line:90%
wasn't just making it up--

00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:31.450 align:middle line:84%
was your voice, when
you were talking,

00:59:31.450 --> 00:59:35.350 align:middle line:84%
felt like it was way on
the other side of the room.

00:59:35.350 --> 00:59:38.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that-- if
anybody's ever described that.

00:59:38.620 --> 00:59:39.820 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I don't think so.

00:59:39.820 --> 00:59:41.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm interested.

00:59:41.530 --> 00:59:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>> So-- and then there were
times when it was right here.

00:59:47.170 --> 00:59:50.750 align:middle line:84%
But during the
bulk of when the--

00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:52.250 align:middle line:84%
I have to go back
and listen to this

00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:54.380 align:middle line:84%
because it's kind of a
little bit of a blur,

00:59:54.380 --> 01:00:00.460 align:middle line:84%
but I think when the
bulk of the juicy

01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:03.830 align:middle line:90%
bits of information, maybe--

01:00:03.830 --> 01:00:04.630 align:middle line:90%
it was weird.

01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:07.824 align:middle line:90%
I had the sensation where--

01:00:07.824 --> 01:00:13.335 align:middle line:90%


01:00:13.335 --> 01:00:14.710 align:middle line:84%
and as I was
starting to get hot,

01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:19.700 align:middle line:84%
too, this sensation where my
arms were kind of like one arm.

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:20.500 align:middle line:90%
You have--

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>> As the information
was coming through?

01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>> As I was getting into that,
when I started really heating

01:00:24.970 --> 01:00:28.943 align:middle line:84%
up, too, you know how
you feel your arms are--

01:00:28.943 --> 01:00:31.110 align:middle line:84%
you know, this is my left
arm, this is my right arm.

01:00:31.110 --> 01:00:31.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, they're separate.

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:33.340 align:middle line:84%
>> They're separate and
I kind of-- you know,

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:34.840 align:middle line:90%
this arm is laying on this arm.

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:38.480 align:middle line:84%
So they kind of merged and I
felt like my left was my right

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:41.390 align:middle line:90%
and my right was my left.

01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And then that's when things
started really heating up, too.

01:00:46.090 --> 01:00:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And then keeping that sensation
and when you were talking--

01:00:58.550 --> 01:00:59.630 align:middle line:90%
it was like that.

01:00:59.630 --> 01:01:02.210 align:middle line:84%
The sensation of the
arms was very prevalent,

01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:04.160 align:middle line:90%
and then your voice--

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:05.670 align:middle line:90%
it was like I was almost--

01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:06.840 align:middle line:90%
I was analyzing.

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.430 align:middle line:84%
I think we were
having a conversation,

01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:15.850 align:middle line:84%
but I was so blown away by
how you were way over there,

01:01:15.850 --> 01:01:19.680 align:middle line:84%
and I knew, conceptually, that
you're not way over there.

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>> That I wasn't.

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:20.810 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't--

01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:21.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, you're right here.

01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:22.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Gotten up and moved.

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:23.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:27.740 align:middle line:84%
>> But for some reason, your
voice was way over there.

01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:33.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, maybe it's actually
more that you moved.

01:01:33.850 --> 01:01:35.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I was-- yeah,
that's what I was--

01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:37.160 align:middle line:90%
>> That you moved into--

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:39.530 align:middle line:84%
well, I think we
could definitely

01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:43.290 align:middle line:84%
say that you moved into a
different state of being.

01:01:43.290 --> 01:01:44.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:01:44.330 --> 01:01:48.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And there may even be a
sense of distance with that.

01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:50.450 align:middle line:90%
>> For all I know.

01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:51.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:01:51.250 --> 01:01:53.450 align:middle line:90%
No, I was very--

01:01:53.450 --> 01:01:54.860 align:middle line:84%
never had that
experience before.

01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:55.990 align:middle line:90%
That was interesting.

01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:57.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

01:01:57.660 --> 01:01:58.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:00.570 align:middle line:90%
>> It was cool.

01:02:00.570 --> 01:02:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think this
was really beautiful.

01:02:03.590 --> 01:02:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>> A beautiful,
beautiful happening.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:07.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:12.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And I just so
much appreciate,

01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:15.130 align:middle line:84%
just even from my point
of view, you know,

01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:19.280 align:middle line:84%
it feels honoring to be
a witness for that fine

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:21.770 align:middle line:90%
information coming through.

01:02:21.770 --> 01:02:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And I must say that
I learned a lot

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:33.050 align:middle line:84%
and gained from that whole
concept of the triangle.

01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:34.755 align:middle line:84%
I had never-- I had
never thought of a--

01:02:34.755 --> 01:02:35.555 align:middle line:90%
>> Neither did I.

01:02:35.555 --> 01:02:38.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I've thought of triangles
zillions of times, but--

01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:39.590 align:middle line:90%
>> You know, I kept--

01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:41.295 align:middle line:90%
what triggered it, initially--

01:02:41.295 --> 01:02:42.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
it was initially.

01:02:42.670 --> 01:02:45.980 align:middle line:90%
I saw like a--

01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:49.775 align:middle line:84%
not a typical triangle, but
more like the base of the fan.

01:02:49.775 --> 01:02:52.490 align:middle line:90%


01:02:52.490 --> 01:02:54.690 align:middle line:90%
Like that triangle.

01:02:54.690 --> 01:02:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, well, so in other
words, the three sided.

01:02:57.890 --> 01:03:00.060 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like if there's
a point in the middle.

01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:00.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:03.555 align:middle line:84%
>> That triangle, as opposed
to the outside triangle.

01:03:03.555 --> 01:03:04.430 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:05.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, oh.

01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>> So you have--

01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that point--

01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:08.570 align:middle line:84%
the significant
thing is the point

01:03:08.570 --> 01:03:10.500 align:middle line:90%
where the sides come together.

01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:11.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:12.100 align:middle line:90%
In the triangle.

01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:15.800 align:middle line:90%
So it's almost like the--

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:18.500 align:middle line:84%
you have the center and then
you have the three things

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:20.180 align:middle line:90%
coming out of it.

01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:22.575 align:middle line:84%
And then if you trace that
around, you have the triangle.

01:03:22.575 --> 01:03:25.160 align:middle line:84%
But that was the first image
that came into my head,

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:26.570 align:middle line:90%
was this--

01:03:26.570 --> 01:03:29.090 align:middle line:84%
was kind of the fan--
the base of your fan

01:03:29.090 --> 01:03:31.110 align:middle line:90%
that you have in there.

01:03:31.110 --> 01:03:32.990 align:middle line:90%
That triangle.

01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And then later, the
next image I saw

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:40.520 align:middle line:84%
was actually the
crop circle picture

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:44.537 align:middle line:84%
that you have on
your wall downstairs.

01:03:44.537 --> 01:03:45.370 align:middle line:90%
I think you have a--

01:03:45.370 --> 01:03:45.820 align:middle line:90%
there's a triangle.

01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:46.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yeah.

01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:47.060 align:middle line:90%
>> I noticed that as I was--

01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Over the table.

01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>> As I was coming
up, just briefly.

01:03:50.070 --> 01:03:55.880 align:middle line:84%
But that was the next triangle
that popped into my head.

01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>> That particular-- that
one in the little frame over

01:03:59.040 --> 01:03:59.840 align:middle line:90%
the table.

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:00.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>> That particular
crop circle, too--

01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:06.480 align:middle line:84%
1991 Barbury Castle
crop circle--

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:09.470 align:middle line:90%


01:04:09.470 --> 01:04:19.190 align:middle line:84%
is the one crop circle
that every person

01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:24.800 align:middle line:84%
I've come to know who
is really seriously

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:28.080 align:middle line:90%
interested in crop circles--

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:32.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, dedicated in
their own way to it.

01:04:32.210 --> 01:04:37.020 align:middle line:84%
That's the one crop circle
that absolutely brought them

01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:41.210 align:middle line:84%
into being devoted
to crop circles,

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:45.830 align:middle line:84%
out of all the other
thousands of crop circles--

01:04:45.830 --> 01:04:49.302 align:middle line:84%
probably 13,000
in England alone.

01:04:49.302 --> 01:04:50.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, those were kind of--

01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:51.660 align:middle line:90%
that was the thing.

01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:53.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I'm thinking back.

01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:55.370 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I did say some
pretty interesting stuff.

01:04:55.370 --> 01:04:56.480 align:middle line:90%
>> You did.

01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:57.280 align:middle line:90%
You did.

01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:00.920 align:middle line:90%
And really, nothing extraneous.

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:01.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>> You know, it was just pure.

01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:04.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>> In that sense.

01:05:05.450 --> 01:05:11.380 align:middle line:84%
It was pure, to the point,
no extra little frills.

01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right right.

01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:16.030 align:middle line:84%
This could be the first steps
into my own channelling.

01:05:16.030 --> 01:05:17.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:05:17.150 --> 01:05:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Having that feeling,
you know, of, OK, well now,

01:05:19.550 --> 01:05:20.967 align:middle line:84%
I'm on the other
side of the room.

01:05:20.967 --> 01:05:24.340 align:middle line:84%
That means I can let
whatever come through

01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:27.510 align:middle line:84%
and that means it's
coming through, right?

01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:28.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Maybe.

01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:32.160 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you would
associate that together

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:33.670 align:middle line:84%
because that was
your experience.

01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:36.380 align:middle line:90%
But yes, indeed, Reuben.

01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:38.302 align:middle line:90%
I would say you did channel.

01:05:38.302 --> 01:05:39.286 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, something.

01:05:39.286 --> 01:05:40.270 align:middle line:90%
Something was there.

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:41.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And it was a good something
and it made sense.
