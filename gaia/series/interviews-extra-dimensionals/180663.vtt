00:01:42.588 --> 00:01:44.070 align:middle line:90%
>> So Wendy, welcome.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you--

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for--

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.500 align:middle line:90%
>> --for having me.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.640 align:middle line:84%
>> --being here and
doing this interview.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us,
can you tell me,

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.160 align:middle line:84%
and tell us, I guess everybody
that's watching, first of all,

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.480 align:middle line:84%
how did you get into
the channeling process?

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And how did you
come into contact

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.700 align:middle line:84%
with the beings known
as the Pleiadians?

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, gosh.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.580 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.759 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, I think a couple
different things there.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.150 align:middle line:10%
So it was around 1994 and I
started having some visions.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't really
know what they were.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.370 align:middle line:84%
They weren't the
happiest of visions,

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.450 align:middle line:90%
but I wasn't frightened by them.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
doing some research

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.850 align:middle line:84%
for that to see if it was
past-life related, because that

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.890 align:middle line:90%
was what my instinct was.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And so as I started
that research

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.900 align:middle line:84%
to find out more
about past lives,

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.070 align:middle line:90%
I came across channeling.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.930 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know what it was.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.365 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know
anybody who did it.

00:02:39.365 --> 00:02:40.990 align:middle line:84%
But I just knew it
was something that I

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.585 align:middle line:90%
was supposed to be doing.

00:02:42.585 --> 00:02:43.385 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:02:43.385 --> 00:02:46.308 align:middle line:84%
>> When you came across it,
you came across it as you saw

00:02:46.308 --> 00:02:47.350 align:middle line:90%
somebody else doing that?

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.192 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:02:48.192 --> 00:02:49.275 align:middle line:90%
I came across it in books.

00:02:49.275 --> 00:02:50.075 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:02:50.075 --> 00:02:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>> And there wasn't a lot of
channel material out there

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:53.660 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.020 align:middle line:84%
There was the Seth
material and Sanaya Roman

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.160 align:middle line:90%
had some books out.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.170 align:middle line:84%
But really, there
wasn't a whole lot.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.400 align:middle line:90%
And it was very familiar.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And I just knew it was
something I was supposed to do.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.110 align:middle line:84%
So I found some
books and I started

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.150 align:middle line:84%
doing some of the
meditation exercises

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.010 align:middle line:90%
and the visualization exercises.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to
channel verbally,

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.060 align:middle line:84%
but it wasn't really
happening for me.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.340 align:middle line:84%
I was having really
visceral experiences,

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.410 align:middle line:84%
like my eyes would
flutter and water

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.700 align:middle line:90%
and my hands would tingle.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.500 align:middle line:90%
But I couldn't form the words.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.360 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't get the words out.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And so I'd put it aside and
then I'd come back to it.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And in the interim, I did
a lot of work on myself.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.830 align:middle line:84%
I studied meditation and
did a lot of inner work.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd come back
to it periodically.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.345 align:middle line:84%
And I'd have kind of
the same experience.

00:03:42.345 --> 00:03:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And then one day, I knew
I was supposed to sit down

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.455 align:middle line:90%
with a pen and paper--

00:03:45.455 --> 00:03:46.255 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:03:46.255 --> 00:03:48.210 align:middle line:84%
>> --and I started
doing automatic writing.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:49.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>> And that I did--

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.250 align:middle line:84%
well, for the first
two years, I wrote down

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.860 align:middle line:84%
every single question
and every answer.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And about nine
months or so into it,

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.650 align:middle line:84%
it was becoming very
cumbersome to write.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And so I put down
the pen and then

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.910 align:middle line:84%
just started to
channel verbally,

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.205 align:middle line:84%
because I was hearing it well
before I was able to write it.

00:04:10.205 --> 00:04:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And I still use
automatic writing today

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.680 align:middle line:84%
because it's much easier for
me to remember the information.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.740 align:middle line:84%
It's a bit like a
lucid dream for me.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.329 align:middle line:84%
So at least I have
the written notes.

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:21.700 align:middle line:90%
And I can go back to it.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.270 align:middle line:84%
But about nine months in, that's
when the Pleiadians showed up.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And they were waiting
for me to channel verbally

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.350 align:middle line:84%
because they work
with tone and sound.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.150 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And a lot of people will
ask me where I'm from when they

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.100 align:middle line:84%
hear the Pleiadians,
especially at the beginning,

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.020 align:middle line:90%
they sounded a bit more British.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And then they started
working with new tones

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.970 align:middle line:84%
and then it sounded a
bit more Australian.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.460 align:middle line:90%
And it's not any one dialect.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>> It's just tones and
sounds that resonate with you

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.250 align:middle line:90%
at a cellular level.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
interesting for me

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.013 align:middle line:84%
because when they started
channeling and working

00:04:54.013 --> 00:04:56.680 align:middle line:84%
with the new tones, it was using
all different kinds of muscles.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And I was like, OK, can
we tone it back just a bit?

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:02.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Tone it, no pun intended.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.770 align:middle line:84%
But it really affects
us vibrationally.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And I could tell that
there was a big difference.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.890 align:middle line:84%
So we get a healing
when we work with them.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.960 align:middle line:84%
Not only do we receive
the information,

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.775 align:middle line:84%
but the tones and sounds help to
alter the cellular structure--

00:05:19.775 --> 00:05:20.575 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:20.575 --> 00:05:24.110 align:middle line:84%
>> --and create more balance
and harmony in the body.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.943 align:middle line:90%
And how did I first meet them?

00:05:26.943 --> 00:05:28.860 align:middle line:84%
I think I've been working
with them all along.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:29.660 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.290 align:middle line:84%
>> And I know that there's
an aspect of me that is part

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.870 align:middle line:90%
of the Collective.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.240 align:middle line:84%
There are about 2,500
beings in the group.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.622 align:middle line:84%
And there is an aspect of
me that is a part of that.

00:05:39.622 --> 00:05:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And they're in the
ninth dimension.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have physical
form, they're beings of light.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And they align
with Alcyone, which

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.990 align:middle line:84%
is the central sun in
the Pleiades star system.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And because they don't
have physical bodies,

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.020 align:middle line:84%
they don't incarnate,
but they align

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.290 align:middle line:90%
with a purpose, or a function.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And they're here to help us
with records, and information,

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:04.960 align:middle line:84%
and to kind of
oversee what we're

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.090 align:middle line:84%
doing to help us
along the way so

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.280 align:middle line:84%
that we can start
taking ownership

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.840 align:middle line:90%
and guardianship of the planet.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And there's another
role that we're

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.740 align:middle line:84%
about to step into at
the galactic level.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, so you mentioned
earlier that you formulated

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.810 align:middle line:90%
questions and answers.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.940 align:middle line:84%
Were the questions
also being channeled?

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:26.740 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.380 align:middle line:84%
There were things that
I wanted to know about--

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:28.866 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:06:28.866 --> 00:06:29.110 align:middle line:90%
Got you.

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:30.040 align:middle line:84%
>> --problems I was
having in my life.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think, early on,
everybody has the same couple

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:33.370 align:middle line:90%
questions.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:34.180 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about love.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.990 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about money.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.680 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about career.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And then it
evolves from there.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.100 align:middle line:84%
But they started helping
me with my own stuff.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind
of like the carrot

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.980 align:middle line:90%
to get us to keep channeling.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's also one
of the hardest things,

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.340 align:middle line:84%
I think, for people, what
do I want to know about?

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.350 align:middle line:84%
We've forgotten how to
formulate questions.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.695 align:middle line:84%
We've forgotten how to
be curious, how to ask,

00:06:55.695 --> 00:06:57.070 align:middle line:84%
because we're so
conditioned just

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.470 align:middle line:84%
to go along kind of mindlessly
making our way through our day.

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:01.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.335 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's a big step
in working with them is

00:07:05.335 --> 00:07:06.460 align:middle line:90%
formulating your questions.

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.150 align:middle line:84%
Because if you don't
ask, you don't get.

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:11.523 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's one of
those tricky things.

00:07:11.523 --> 00:07:12.940 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well,
I don't know what

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.470 align:middle line:90%
I don't know until I know it.

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:15.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:16.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:17.620 align:middle line:90%
>> So where do I want to start?

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.000 align:middle line:90%
What questions do I want to ask?

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.417 align:middle line:84%
And what do I want to know
more about, especially when you

00:07:21.417 --> 00:07:25.240 align:middle line:84%
get to the more complex
questions, the bigger

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.320 align:middle line:90%
universal questions--

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:26.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.990 align:middle line:84%
>> --because that can't be
revealed until you're ready

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:29.440 align:middle line:90%
for it.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And once you formulate
the question,

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.790 align:middle line:84%
that's kind of their
signal that you're ready

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:35.300 align:middle line:84%
and they can give
more information.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what we
want to get into today.

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:47.260 align:middle line:84%
We have lots of questions
about the universal history

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.320 align:middle line:90%
and story.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:54.760 align:middle line:84%
So right quick, before we
introduce the Pleiadians,

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.570 align:middle line:84%
have you had any physical
contact in the light sense?

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:00.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, have you
seen these lights?

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Have you had experiences
in that level?

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>> With them, my strength
is as a clairsentient,

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:11.770 align:middle line:84%
so I feel a lot of
things in my body.

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:15.220 align:middle line:84%
I occasionally will see
things, as a clairvoyant,

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.952 align:middle line:84%
literally seeing lights,
and auric fields,

00:08:17.952 --> 00:08:18.910 align:middle line:90%
and that kind of thing.

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:23.395 align:middle line:84%
More of what I see in
the clairvoyant sense

00:08:23.395 --> 00:08:24.340 align:middle line:90%
is with my inner eye.

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:25.210 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:26.820 align:middle line:90%
So like eyes closed and just--

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, what I would
see in my mind's eye.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So when I do see them,
they're usually blue,

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:33.340 align:middle line:90%
blue light.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they have
geometric forms.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.610 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes triangles.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:37.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.919 align:middle line:84%
And so let me
clarify, so you can

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:47.313 align:middle line:84%
see the geometric forms and
the lights, but you feel a--

00:08:47.313 --> 00:08:49.480 align:middle line:84%
almost like a human presence
or something like that?

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:49.780 align:middle line:90%
How could you describe it?

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:50.740 align:middle line:90%
>> I feel a frequency.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:51.645 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:08:51.645 --> 00:08:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>> And yet, you could say
it's like a human presence.

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like, well,
let's see, how can I--

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Like I know my cameraman
here is standing here.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:01.420 align:middle line:90%
Is that--

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:01.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:02.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that a good analogy?

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:03.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So you know what
his energy feels like.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:04.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And you wouldn't necessarily
have to turn around just

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.500 align:middle line:84%
to know that that
person is standing--

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:08.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:09.610 align:middle line:90%
>> --behind you.

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And they often
describe it as it's

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.880 align:middle line:84%
like hearing somebody's
footsteps coming down the hall.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.410 align:middle line:84%
After a while, once you begin to
know what that person's energy

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:19.720 align:middle line:84%
is like, what their
patterns are like,

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.817 align:middle line:84%
you know who it is
by the sound of--

00:09:21.817 --> 00:09:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Of the footsteps.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:23.085 align:middle line:90%
>> --the footsteps,

00:09:23.085 --> 00:09:23.885 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:09:23.885 --> 00:09:25.140 align:middle line:90%
>> --what the gait's like.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of the
same thing with them.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:29.570 align:middle line:84%
I know it's them
when they show up.

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they show
up with other people.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:33.957 align:middle line:84%
And I can feel them,
but I know that they

00:09:33.957 --> 00:09:36.040 align:middle line:84%
brought other people along
because the frequency's

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:36.610 align:middle line:90%
different.

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they're
making an introduction,

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.620 align:middle line:84%
so they're beings that I
haven't worked with before.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And so when we say people,
we're talking about other light

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:44.380 align:middle line:90%
beings?

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes they're
light beings.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.570 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they're physical.

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they're fifth
dimensional, sixth dimensional,

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:52.030 align:middle line:90%
seventh dimensional.

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:54.310 align:middle line:90%
And they do have bodies.

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:56.920 align:middle line:84%
They're not as dense as ours,
but they do have physical form.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:57.720 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And I do work with
a variety of beings.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:02.290 align:middle line:84%
The Sirians that I work
with, they're physicals.

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:03.760 align:middle line:90%
They're fifth dimensional.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.902 align:middle line:84%
But I don't necessarily
work with them

00:10:07.902 --> 00:10:09.610 align:middle line:84%
in a conscious way
where they're standing

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:11.080 align:middle line:90%
physically in front of me.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.700 align:middle line:84%
It's more telepathic
communication

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:16.330 align:middle line:84%
that I have with them, at
least in my waking hours.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And have you had physical
contact then with other beings,

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.400 align:middle line:90%
non-light beings, body--

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:24.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:24.920 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:25.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:25.950 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:26.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Sirians?

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:27.640 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:28.540 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.100 align:middle line:90%
Different beings.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.690 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are insectoids.

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:33.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, interesting.

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>> And then the Zetas as well.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.280 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:40.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And those are my
physical experiences.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And another group who I just
recently had an introduction

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.900 align:middle line:84%
to, I don't have all
the bits and pieces

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.240 align:middle line:84%
as to who they are,
exactly, but they're

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:52.710 align:middle line:84%
kind of a cross
between the insectoids

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:56.410 align:middle line:84%
and what we would
traditionally call the grays.

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:57.570 align:middle line:90%
They look different.

00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:59.020 align:middle line:90%
And it's not the same species.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:02.140 align:middle line:90%
But they've shown up for me.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:10.330 align:middle line:84%
Do you find once you've opened
yourself up to, let's say,

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.240 align:middle line:84%
this channeling experience
back in the '90s--

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.680 align:middle line:90%
was it '94 you said?

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.600 align:middle line:84%
>> When I started,
it was in '94.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And I had kind of my
breakthrough in '95.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think that has
opened the door to other being

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:24.970 align:middle line:90%
experiences?

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:27.820 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think we're all
getting these experiences

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.650 align:middle line:84%
and we're just
not tuned into it?

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, both.

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:35.320 align:middle line:84%
I think we're all
connected to our guides.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.580 align:middle line:84%
We've got two guides that
are with us 24 hours a day,

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.120 align:middle line:84%
7 days a week, who
are helping us.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And then we've got our
solicited friends--

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:42.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Everybody?

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:42.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Everybody.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:43.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And I laugh because people
think that channeling is just

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.120 align:middle line:90%
something that a few people do.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.510 align:middle line:90%
But everybody does it.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it's like
being an interpreter.

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:57.080 align:middle line:84%
I recognize frequency
and I translate it

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:00.170 align:middle line:84%
into a recognizable form,
whether that's writing

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:01.460 align:middle line:90%
or whether it's speaking.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:03.860 align:middle line:84%
But I think any form
of creative expression

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.290 align:middle line:90%
can be a form of channeling.

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And my own experiences
with beings, I think,

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:11.550 align:middle line:90%
started much younger.

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:12.780 align:middle line:90%
I think it started in childhood.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:13.650 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.700 align:middle line:84%
>> But I didn't really
have an awareness,

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:19.850 align:middle line:84%
a conscious awareness of that
until I started opening up

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:21.650 align:middle line:90%
in my early 20s.

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:24.038 align:middle line:84%
And I started having some
past-life experiences.

00:12:24.038 --> 00:12:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, I
didn't really understand

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:26.872 align:middle line:90%
that's what was going on.

00:12:26.872 --> 00:12:29.660 align:middle line:84%
I was accessing some
of that information.

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:32.230 align:middle line:84%
So once I made
conscious contact,

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:34.730 align:middle line:84%
then some of the things that
had happened earlier in my life

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:36.110 align:middle line:90%
made a lot more sense.

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:38.240 align:middle line:84%
I understood, oh,
that's what that was.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.320 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.640 align:middle line:84%
So you think if we all
could tap into this,

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:46.940 align:middle line:84%
then this channeling
experience, or our guides,

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:51.570 align:middle line:84%
humanity would be a little
less hectic or frantic maybe?

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:52.370 align:middle line:90%
>> I think so.

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:54.787 align:middle line:84%
>> Or more because now there's
so much more out there that

00:12:54.787 --> 00:12:56.510 align:middle line:90%
we're not aware of.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:58.370 align:middle line:90%
How about in your life--

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:02.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure this could go on into a
much deeper conversation which,

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:05.960 align:middle line:84%
hopefully, we can have later--
but quickly, by opening

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.090 align:middle line:84%
yourself up to this
channeling experiences,

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:11.440 align:middle line:84%
has it been a positive
influence in your life?

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, definitely.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:12.550 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:12.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:13.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:15.260 align:middle line:90%
I can't imagine not doing it.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.610 align:middle line:90%
To me, it's normal.

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:17.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Got you.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And I always say it's
going to be the new normal--

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:20.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:23.470 align:middle line:84%
>> --because it's just expanding
the connection that's already

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:24.270 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:26.750 align:middle line:84%
We're never disconnected
from anyone or anything.

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:29.950 align:middle line:84%
So it's just kind of opening
up to what's already around us

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:35.830 align:middle line:84%
and using what's available
to us, the tools.

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think the guides
are going to get into it--

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.090 align:middle line:84%
and we're hearing they
are-- but part of it's

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:44.750 align:middle line:84%
understanding why we're here
in 3D, the purpose of 3D,

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:46.250 align:middle line:90%
the playground.

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And its opening back up to
other potentials and other games

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.890 align:middle line:90%
that we can also participate in.

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:53.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:57.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, with that said, can
we introduce the Pleiadians?

00:13:57.830 --> 00:13:58.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:01.020 align:middle line:84%
>> And can we start asking
some of those questions?

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:01.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:02.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:05.770 align:middle line:90%
