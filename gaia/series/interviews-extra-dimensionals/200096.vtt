00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.210 align:middle line:84%
>> What is our
highest potential?

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.700 align:middle line:84%
What is the question
you're seeking to answer?

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.240 align:middle line:90%


00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.980 align:middle line:84%
What is that continual drive
within you that you're always

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.083 align:middle line:84%
being inspired in the
direction of answering

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:43.000 align:middle line:90%
a particular question?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.540 align:middle line:90%


00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.923 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it was what
is our highest potential?

00:00:51.923 --> 00:00:55.710 align:middle line:90%


00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.110 align:middle line:84%
It's not about finding heaven
sometime after you leave here.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.950 align:middle line:84%
It's about being able to
create your own heaven on Earth

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.040 align:middle line:84%
in your own life, and bringing
heaven to Earth in the way

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.860 align:middle line:84%
that you live, in the way
that you treat others,

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.572 align:middle line:90%
in the way that you show up.

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:13.530 align:middle line:90%
You're here on a quest.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.930 align:middle line:90%


00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think at this
time, where we're

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.170 align:middle line:84%
at is this deep
desire for freedom,

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.752 align:middle line:84%
the freedom to be
who we really are.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.110 align:middle line:90%
We're here with Sara Landon.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Reuben.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:46.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:47.670 align:middle line:90%
In your backyard.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.530 align:middle line:90%
What an amazing backyard.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>> How long have you
been in this place?

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.450 align:middle line:10%
>> I've been in this
area for a few years now,

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.290 align:middle line:10%
in this home for
a couple of years.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.290 align:middle line:10%
So it's just-- it's my
version of heaven on Earth.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.270 align:middle line:90%
It's super cool.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.070 align:middle line:90%
Super cool.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.070 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having us.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.642 align:middle line:90%
>> We're happy to have you.

00:02:06.642 --> 00:02:07.600 align:middle line:90%
>> So you're a channel?

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>> What other titles could
you claim, I should say?

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I'm a recovering
corporate executive

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.340 align:middle line:10%
and entrepreneur.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.090 align:middle line:84%
Came from the business world
as a corporate professional,

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.140 align:middle line:90%
and never--

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.240 align:middle line:84%
if anyone would
have told me that I

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.930 align:middle line:84%
was going to end up channeling
and doing this work,

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.180 align:middle line:84%
would I have ever thought
that that was my path.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.340 align:middle line:84%
But I am so blessed and
grateful that it is.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.632 align:middle line:84%
>> In the corporate world,
what exactly were you doing,

00:02:38.632 --> 00:02:40.298 align:middle line:84%
or if you don't mind
saying, recovering?

00:02:40.298 --> 00:02:42.160 align:middle line:84%
>> So I was in technology,
technology world.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.810 align:middle line:84%
I was in sales, strategy,
vision work, which you know,

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.880 align:middle line:84%
actually, is part of
something that you can take

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.950 align:middle line:90%
into any and all professions.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.493 align:middle line:90%
But I started off, actually--

00:02:56.493 --> 00:02:57.910 align:middle line:84%
we were talking
about it before we

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.760 align:middle line:84%
started shooting--
in some influence

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.920 align:middle line:84%
and spirituality
very, very young.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.117 align:middle line:84%
But as I got into
my teenage years

00:03:05.117 --> 00:03:07.450 align:middle line:84%
and I actually started working
in my family's restaurant

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.150 align:middle line:84%
really young, I got very
into personal development,

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.090 align:middle line:84%
and more the art and science
of achievement and success.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that's what
you do in life, you know.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.030 align:middle line:84%
You go to school and you get
a good job and you buy a house

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.020 align:middle line:90%
and you live happily ever after.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And so very early on, I started
studying Napoleon Hill and Tony

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Robbins and Ryan Tracy
and Jack Canfield

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.580 align:middle line:84%
and all these incredible
personal development

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.970 align:middle line:84%
teachers that kind of said, no
matter what your circumstances

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.850 align:middle line:84%
or conditions, anything's
really possible for you

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.130 align:middle line:84%
if you work hard and
take massive action

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.770 align:middle line:90%
and have really clear goals.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I did that,
and it worked.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And I went through
the corporate world,

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.560 align:middle line:84%
and achieving over time all
of the goals that I had.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And I found myself,
at one point in time,

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.170 align:middle line:84%
having achieved
exactly what I thought

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.590 align:middle line:84%
was the biggest possible
dream for me in my life.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.500 align:middle line:84%
And yet inside, I knew I wasn't
really living my deeper purpose

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.540 align:middle line:84%
and was looking
for greater meaning

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.490 align:middle line:84%
and fulfillment in
my life, although I

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.839 align:middle line:90%
didn't know what that meant.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:20.079 align:middle line:84%
I struggled with
understanding what I

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.480 align:middle line:90%
believed about God and spirit.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.680 align:middle line:90%
And in a short period of time--

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.960 align:middle line:84%
I think when you
knock on the door,

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.610 align:middle line:90%
it eventually gets answered.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.940 align:middle line:84%
When you start to seek, your
world begins to open up.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think I found
that in that journey--

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.330 align:middle line:84%
doesn't matter
how far you travel

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.270 align:middle line:84%
or what journey you go on-- it
always just leads back to you.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.860 align:middle line:84%
So if you're not happy with
what's going on within you,

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.350 align:middle line:84%
and feeling the love and
joy and peace within you,

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.660 align:middle line:84%
it's very hard to find it
in the world around you.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.440 align:middle line:84%
So this work ultimately has
been my greatest teaching

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.640 align:middle line:84%
and returning to that
truth within myself.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
the council saying

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.390 align:middle line:84%
early on that if you will
just live this wisdom,

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.250 align:middle line:84%
you will live a life
beyond your wildest dreams.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
you don't really

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.340 align:middle line:84%
get it because I have these
really big, big dreams.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.970 align:middle line:84%
But fast forward many
years now, I can absolutely

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.460 align:middle line:84%
say I get what they meant
because through channeling

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.210 align:middle line:84%
the council and practicing their
wisdom and living their wisdom

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.570 align:middle line:84%
and teaching their
wisdom, I really

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.380 align:middle line:84%
do feel like we live
in a wonderful world

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.700 align:middle line:90%
at a wonderful time.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.790 align:middle line:84%
Never been a better
time to be here.

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And I know so many
people are going

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.130 align:middle line:84%
through that journey of going
from the life they thought

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.690 align:middle line:84%
would make them happy, not
really knowing what's out there

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.180 align:middle line:90%
or what their purpose really is.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.660 align:middle line:84%
But if you will open that
door and ask the questions,

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.490 align:middle line:90%
the answers will come.

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And there is so much love
and peace and joy and harmony

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.470 align:middle line:84%
in this world if you will really
open your heart and allow it.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's the basis of all
of the council's teachings.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Who is the council?

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.900 align:middle line:90%
>> I have no idea.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:17.700 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:18.620 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:19.440 align:middle line:90%
Good answer.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Which also goes along with,
at some point in time someone

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.270 align:middle line:84%
said, you know, when did you
decide you wanted to start

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.580 align:middle line:90%
channeling and doing this work?

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I still haven't
decided if I want to do it.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:31.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm just doing it.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.340 align:middle line:90%
I can't not do it.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.373 align:middle line:90%
It's greater calling.

00:06:35.373 --> 00:06:36.790 align:middle line:84%
>> How did it start
for you, then?

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well, to answer
your question, quickly,

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.070 align:middle line:90%
on the council.

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:51.080 align:middle line:84%
So they are a consciousness
with a much greater perspective

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.130 align:middle line:84%
of who we are and
why we are here

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:59.520 align:middle line:84%
and what we intended when we
chose this life experience.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And when I get in a
state to receive them,

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.870 align:middle line:84%
it's really about getting
myself out of the way and just

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.170 align:middle line:84%
opening up to the energy and
allowing them to come through.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.710 align:middle line:84%
My consciousness sort
of mixes with theirs

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:17.420 align:middle line:84%
or steps to the side, and a
higher state of consciousness

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.478 align:middle line:90%
and awareness streams through.

00:07:19.478 --> 00:07:21.020 align:middle line:84%
They don't really
need to be labeled.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.900 align:middle line:90%
They don't really need a name.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And they have said always that
even to label them with any

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.810 align:middle line:84%
name-- just as yourself, even
to call yourself Reuben--

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:32.690 align:middle line:90%
>> It's limiting.

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Or an actor or filmmaker,
any of these things,

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.900 align:middle line:84%
we automatically begin
to limit all that we are.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And the basis of
all of their work

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:43.730 align:middle line:84%
is living your highest
potential and what's

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:47.210 align:middle line:84%
really possible beyond
all of this limitation

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:53.010 align:middle line:84%
that we believe in
and agree to live in,

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:54.410 align:middle line:90%
even though we don't have to.

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>> How did you come up
with the name for them?

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Or did you name them, or where
did the name the council come

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:01.820 align:middle line:84%
from, because even
though it's limiting,

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.600 align:middle line:90%
it still has some reference.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.750 align:middle line:84%
Very early on, when I started
channeling, my experience of it

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.510 align:middle line:84%
was that my voice
was really loud

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.900 align:middle line:84%
and they talked through
me very quickly.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:18.140 align:middle line:84%
I sounded to myself
like a Russian man,

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:21.420 align:middle line:90%
which was very uncomfortable.

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And so for a long time,
I called it The Voice.

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And it was just a voice
that would speak through me.

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And yet when I
really tuned into it,

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:32.929 align:middle line:84%
I was aware that it was
not just a singular being.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:35.390 align:middle line:90%
They always spoke as we.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that they were
a collective of beings.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.570 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes they would say,
we are those most interested

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:43.017 align:middle line:90%
in this conversation here.

00:08:43.017 --> 00:08:44.600 align:middle line:84%
They are the higher
selves of everyone

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.600 align:middle line:84%
here present that will
ever listen to this.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.850 align:middle line:90%
I do believe that they have--

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:53.210 align:middle line:84%
at times, it's certain
particular collectives.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>> So you feel the energy
shifting from time to time?

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:56.810 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's much
more expansive,

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:02.900 align:middle line:84%
and I feel that there may
be more specific groups that

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:06.120 align:middle line:84%
are coming in at that
particular period of time.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And so when I started
calling them the council,

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:12.110 align:middle line:84%
or when I really identified it's
more like a council of beings.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:14.150 align:middle line:90%
And I saw them.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:18.050 align:middle line:84%
One particular time when
I was doing a channel,

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:22.190 align:middle line:84%
I was going up the staircase,
and I walked into this room

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:25.560 align:middle line:84%
with these beings that were
just the most beautiful beings I

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:26.360 align:middle line:90%
had ever seen.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And they were sitting
around a round table.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And I walked up, and
there was a chair,

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:36.950 align:middle line:84%
and I took my seat
at the council.

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's really when I knew
the name was the council.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And that was, for
many years when

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.460 align:middle line:84%
I started channeling
the experience I had,

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:46.010 align:middle line:84%
is I would go up
sort of to this place

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:49.580 align:middle line:84%
where I would take my
seat at the council

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.420 align:middle line:84%
with these incredibly
amazing beings of light.

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And then we would
start speaking through.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And you saw that
in a meditation?

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And visually you would
see this council sitting?

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:01.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:03.500 align:middle line:84%
So when I go into channel--
and this has evolved over

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:04.300 align:middle line:90%
the years--

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.680 align:middle line:84%
I always say to
people that channel--

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.290 align:middle line:84%
or just beginning or having
certain experiences-- we

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:12.320 align:middle line:84%
all have a very unique
perspective and experience.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:18.110 align:middle line:10%
And it expands over time, or for
many people, becomes more easy

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:19.140 align:middle line:10%
over time.

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.860 align:middle line:84%
More you do it,
the easier it gets.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.608 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, when
I first started,

00:10:23.608 --> 00:10:25.400 align:middle line:84%
it took me about 15
minutes to actually get

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.530 align:middle line:84%
into a channeled state where
the council would come through.

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:29.113 align:middle line:84%
And now it's just a
couple of breaths,

00:10:29.113 --> 00:10:33.410 align:middle line:84%
and I can do it for six
or eight hours a day.

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:37.550 align:middle line:84%
So for awhile, when I was
beginning to first channel,

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:41.660 align:middle line:84%
I would do that visualization
process for myself in order

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:43.220 align:middle line:90%
to get into a channeled state.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>> What's a typical
day of Sara Landon?

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Like what do you
have for breakfast?

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.170 align:middle line:84%
Do you channel first
thing in the morning?

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:54.300 align:middle line:90%
Or how does that work?

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.640 align:middle line:90%
Walk us through a day.

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>> I wake up at a pretty natural
time, whenever I wake up.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.520 align:middle line:84%
I very rarely have
an alarm clock.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And if I do need to wake
up for a particular thing,

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:07.690 align:middle line:84%
I often wake up a
minute or two before.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think our minds have that
awareness to gently, peacefully

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.980 align:middle line:90%
awaken us each morning.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
I do in the morning,

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:16.530 align:middle line:84%
I just take a little
time to simmer.

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:18.110 align:middle line:90%
I just sort of allow myself--

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:21.200 align:middle line:84%
if there's something that came
in in a dream that I look at.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.460 align:middle line:90%
I just allow myself to simmer.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.000 align:middle line:84%
I think the thing about dreams
is that it will show you

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.220 align:middle line:84%
what's still active
in your consciousness,

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.553 align:middle line:84%
even if it makes
no flipping sense.

00:11:30.553 --> 00:11:31.970 align:middle line:84%
It will show you
what's still kind

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:34.500 align:middle line:84%
of going on unresolved
in your consciousness.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:39.200 align:middle line:84%
So I think for me, that space of
just simmering a, bit and what

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:43.250 align:middle line:84%
did I dream about/ Then I get
up and I take care of my lovely

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:47.300 align:middle line:84%
animals, who are my
joy, my dog and my cat.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And that just brings
me so much joy.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.070 align:middle line:84%
I usually come
outside and just look

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:55.910 align:middle line:84%
at the sunrise and the trees
and the colors and the beauty.

00:11:55.910 --> 00:12:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And then I go work
out, either yoga--

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:03.020 align:middle line:90%
but more often, I run.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.740 align:middle line:84%
I love to run, I love to
walk, I love to move my body.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.140 align:middle line:84%
I feel like, for me,
that's a way I kind of move

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.280 align:middle line:90%
stagnant energy out of my body.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.910 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a really
healthy practice,

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:16.190 align:middle line:90%
however that feels good to you.

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And I have a wonderful
place here where

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:22.760 align:middle line:84%
I live that I have just this
incredible community of people

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.520 align:middle line:84%
that I love to see
every single morning.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And that is as much of my
work as this is-- and none

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:35.270 align:middle line:84%
of it's work-- but showing up
and smiling and connecting.

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:38.360 align:middle line:84%
That part of it, to me--
we get so focused on

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.970 align:middle line:84%
my work is my channeling client
or my courses or my Master

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:42.770 align:middle line:90%
Class program.

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And yet that is as
important to me,

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:49.310 align:middle line:84%
to show up and be present
and open and allow.

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:53.330 align:middle line:10%
You begin to be able to stretch
time and space so that you're

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.580 align:middle line:10%
always where you need to be
when you need to be there,

00:12:55.580 --> 00:13:01.690 align:middle line:10%
but giving yourself that
permission to just be.

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:06.380 align:middle line:84%
So I make as much time
as I can for just being.

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.410 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not a breakfast person.

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:12.590 align:middle line:84%
So I got into the whole
intermittent eating thing.

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:13.910 align:middle line:90%
It's supposed to be fasting.

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:14.937 align:middle line:90%
I like eating better.

00:13:14.937 --> 00:13:15.895 align:middle line:90%
>> Intermittent eating.

00:13:15.895 --> 00:13:16.310 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:17.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:19.810 align:middle line:84%
I usually have lunch sitting
out on the patio there

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:23.710 align:middle line:84%
that you all were at
earlier and enjoy lunch

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:26.610 align:middle line:90%
with my animals and my place.

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And then I do my work
in the afternoon, which

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.590 align:middle line:90%
also is part of my perfect day.

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:37.080 align:middle line:84%
You know, I find that I channel
the council so much each day

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.610 align:middle line:90%
that that is my meditation.

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:41.920 align:middle line:84%
What I make time
for is to be out

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:46.270 align:middle line:90%
in nature, just seeing things.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:50.560 align:middle line:84%
I feel like guidance almost
always comes to me in nature.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.110 align:middle line:84%
I can go deeper
into the teachings.

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:57.340 align:middle line:84%
So either walking on the beach
or walking in the hills here

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.230 align:middle line:90%
is just a wonderful thing.

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:01.090 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a really good sleeper.

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:04.580 align:middle line:10%
I like to go to bed probably
about 10, and I like sleep.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:12.340 align:middle line:84%
So ultimately, it's creating a
life that you love every day.

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:17.170 align:middle line:84%
>> So who would you say is
sort of your demographic,

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:22.250 align:middle line:84%
people who gravitate to this
material, to your material?

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:25.000 align:middle line:84%
I sort of have a very
cosmic vibe with my energy

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.810 align:middle line:84%
and what I'm putting out there
with the interview with Ed.

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:32.260 align:middle line:84%
Do you have the alien believers
and the cosmic people?

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.610 align:middle line:84%
Or is it a little bit
different audience?

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I know
there's definitely people

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:41.510 align:middle line:84%
in my audience that are
interested in that or study

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:42.310 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:46.948 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that we
talk about much in my work.

00:14:46.948 --> 00:14:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And I don't find
it's a lot of people

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:51.610 align:middle line:84%
that ask questions about
that in my particular work.

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:55.060 align:middle line:84%
I think there's
not many that would

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.370 align:middle line:84%
acknowledge that
there's definitely

00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:59.320 align:middle line:90%
so much more going on here.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.500 align:middle line:84%
But not so much the
alien, UFO, cosmic,

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:08.240 align:middle line:84%
although they're always welcome
if it resonates with them.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.390 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a
wonderful conversation.

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:12.340 align:middle line:84%
But for me, it's
really people that

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:15.850 align:middle line:84%
are wanting to understand
what their purpose is.

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:18.970 align:middle line:84%
Why are they here in
this life experience?

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:21.820 align:middle line:90%
What is their purpose?

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.500 align:middle line:90%
What's really going on here?

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:28.000 align:middle line:84%
How do they live a more
meaningful, purposeful life?

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And how do they make a
greater impact on the world?

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And from the most
limitless perspective,

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:38.890 align:middle line:84%
beyond all the limitation
that we learn here

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:45.970 align:middle line:84%
in this human experience of
prejudice, stress, worry,

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:51.460 align:middle line:84%
separation by either religion
or belief system or hierarchy,

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:54.430 align:middle line:84%
even the whole
sort of former way

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:59.050 align:middle line:84%
of being in a guru-type setting
where the teacher's up here

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:00.950 align:middle line:84%
and everybody else
is down there.

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Or church-type situations,
religious context.

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:04.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I'm not
against any religion at all.

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:10.600 align:middle line:84%
Surprisingly to me,
there are people

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.090 align:middle line:84%
in all sorts of
different religions

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:15.550 align:middle line:84%
that that follow the work
of the council and my work.

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:19.180 align:middle line:84%
But they have chosen to
stay in their communities

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:21.610 align:middle line:84%
and their family dynamics
because they know

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:23.380 align:middle line:90%
they can be way showers there.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:27.310 align:middle line:84%
They know they can be
the example of this work

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:31.610 align:middle line:84%
and really live from an open
heart no matter where they are.

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:33.460 align:middle line:84%
So oftentimes they
choose to stay

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.620 align:middle line:90%
in those types of situations.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:36.820 align:middle line:90%
Same with corporate.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:38.440 align:middle line:84%
People who have
been entrepreneurs

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:42.430 align:middle line:84%
or in the business world,
very similar to where I was.

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:45.520 align:middle line:90%
I compartmentalized my life.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.470 align:middle line:84%
I had my corporate
life and my business,

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:51.160 align:middle line:90%
which was 99% of my life.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.780 align:middle line:84%
But any time I had
a spare moment,

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:54.640 align:middle line:84%
I was reading a spiritual
book or something

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:58.000 align:middle line:84%
about spiritual growth
or enlightenment.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And that was my passion
and my hobby and my joy.

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And so it's often people
that are looking for answers.

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:09.950 align:middle line:84%
For me, I kept asking
this question is,

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:12.859 align:middle line:90%
what is our highest potential?

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:17.140 align:middle line:84%
If you think of your life
not so much as something

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:21.220 align:middle line:84%
you're here to learn, or you're
not here to save the world,

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.750 align:middle line:84%
you're not here to right
some wrong from the past,

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:25.990 align:middle line:90%
but you're here on a quest.

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:28.119 align:middle line:90%
And it can be wonderful.

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:29.320 align:middle line:90%
It can be joyous.

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.960 align:middle line:84%
It can be easy and
effortless and harmonious.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.400 align:middle line:90%
But you're here on a quest.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:36.010 align:middle line:10%
And if you think
about it more in terms

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:41.570 align:middle line:10%
of what is the question
you're seeking to answer?

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:44.500 align:middle line:84%
What is it that continual
drive within you

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:47.560 align:middle line:84%
that you are always
being inspired

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:51.430 align:middle line:84%
in the direction of answering
a particular question?

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it was what
is our highest potential?

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:57.700 align:middle line:84%
After studying
personal development

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:01.060 align:middle line:84%
and rising to what I
thought was the highest

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:04.640 align:middle line:84%
level possible for me, I
still knew that wasn't it.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm grateful for
those experiences.

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:07.690 align:middle line:90%
I learned so much.

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:11.110 align:middle line:90%
I worked with wonderful people.

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And yet I still knew there
was more for my life.

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And I do think it
is that realization,

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:19.840 align:middle line:90%
your own self-realization.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And while that word we might
be more comfortable with,

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:28.540 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people could accept
that I'm here to self-realize,

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.380 align:middle line:84%
but what about being
here for self-love?

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:34.180 align:middle line:84%
Just to just to
experience greater levels

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:38.970 align:middle line:84%
of loving and being loved and
finding the beauty and the joy

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:39.770 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
basis of this work

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:47.620 align:middle line:84%
is that it's not about
finding heaven sometime

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.720 align:middle line:90%
after you leave here.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.560 align:middle line:84%
It's about being able to
create your own heaven on Earth

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.500 align:middle line:84%
in your own life and bringing
heaven to Earth in the way

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.020 align:middle line:84%
that you live, in the way
that you treat others,

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:00.790 align:middle line:90%
in the way that you show up.

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think at this
time, where we're

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:07.270 align:middle line:84%
at is this deep
desire for freedom,

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:11.980 align:middle line:84%
the freedom to be
who we really are.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And we tend to
identify-- as children,

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:20.410 align:middle line:84%
we start learning that
I'm me and you're you.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:23.080 align:middle line:84%
So you're Reuben and I'm
Sarah, and if you have my toy,

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.610 align:middle line:90%
then that's mine.

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And if it is mine, then if I
lose it, it's no longer mine,

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:32.110 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden I'm not
happy or peaceful or joyful,

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:36.650 align:middle line:84%
where when you really understand
your connection to all that is

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:40.540 align:middle line:84%
and who you really are, there's
no longer this grasping on.

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:43.340 align:middle line:84%
There's no need to have to
own everything and control

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:44.140 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:48.410 align:middle line:84%
You can live in that
natural state or flow.

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:51.790 align:middle line:10%
And in that, so much
more opens up to you.

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:55.890 align:middle line:84%
I was very much in a state
of doing all the time,

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:57.370 align:middle line:90%
you know, making it happen.

00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what I learned
is if you take massive action

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.100 align:middle line:84%
and you work really hard
and you do and you push it

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:07.420 align:middle line:84%
you make it happen, all
that effort, that you'll

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:09.070 align:middle line:90%
achieve your goal but.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:11.740 align:middle line:84%
For the most part,
anytime we get anything,

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:14.620 align:middle line:84%
we manifest or create anything,
the energy that we put into it

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.570 align:middle line:84%
is often the energy
that will result

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:18.400 align:middle line:90%
in the manifestation of that.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.170 align:middle line:84%
So it'll just be
more of the same,

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:24.340 align:middle line:84%
where if you create from
a place of pure love

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:29.030 align:middle line:84%
and joy and peace within
you, and inspiration,

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:30.940 align:middle line:90%
it's a very different feeling.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:32.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:37.150 align:middle line:84%
>> I do think it's important
in that there's so much great

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:38.350 align:middle line:90%
wisdom out there.

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:42.940 align:middle line:84%
You have amazing channels
that are part of your show

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:44.080 align:middle line:90%
that you've spoken to.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think, always, the
personality of the channel

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:51.400 align:middle line:90%
is part of the work.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And so to me, the people
that are drawn to this work

00:20:56.950 --> 00:21:04.450 align:middle line:84%
are really wanting to live
a grounded, balanced life.

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:07.900 align:middle line:84%
At this point in time, in my
work and in my channeling,

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:11.570 align:middle line:84%
it's about how to create
the best possible life here.

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:14.650 align:middle line:84%
So we can use these
big, galactic words

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:15.920 align:middle line:90%
or spiritual terms.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.640 align:middle line:84%
But how do you really ground
that in your life experience?

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:22.420 align:middle line:84%
To me, it's about
that level of balance.

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And while I love exploring all
the different dimensions that

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:32.470 align:middle line:84%
are available to us, it's about
being able to really embody

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:35.660 align:middle line:90%
all of that here and now.

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:36.640 align:middle line:90%
So it's very grounded.

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:39.430 align:middle line:84%
It's very balanced,
and I would say

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:43.630 align:middle line:84%
almost practical spirituality
for living an enlightened life.

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And that typically
means people that

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:47.800 align:middle line:84%
are in leadership
positions, people

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.480 align:middle line:84%
that are doing great
things in the world

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.370 align:middle line:84%
and wanting to make an
impact like yourself

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:56.800 align:middle line:84%
and your team, entrepreneurs,
corporate professionals,

00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:00.760 align:middle line:84%
political leaders,
people in education,

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.550 align:middle line:84%
and even some forms
of activist work,

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:06.730 align:middle line:84%
trying to do good for the
planet, for the animals,

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:09.670 align:middle line:84%
for the land, for the
water, for the environment.

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:12.460 align:middle line:84%
So I find that the
people that come to me

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:16.270 align:middle line:84%
really find themselves as way
showers in the world, people

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:21.400 align:middle line:84%
that are here using their life
as an example of a better way,

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:28.390 align:middle line:84%
that in the space of freedom,
there is no suffering.

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:29.320 align:middle line:90%
There is no stress.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.370 align:middle line:90%
There is no worry.

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:33.010 align:middle line:90%
And we can lead from that place.

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And there's an
evolution, I think,

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:39.070 align:middle line:84%
of that word leadership that
still implies some level, I

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:40.330 align:middle line:90%
think, of separation.

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:45.010 align:middle line:84%
But just realizing that
in your everyday life,

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:48.100 align:middle line:84%
by the way you live,
and by your very being,

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.973 align:middle line:84%
you can show others that
a better way is possible.

00:22:50.973 --> 00:22:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Being the change you
want to see in others.

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:54.850 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:57.768 align:middle line:90%
And to quote some other--

00:22:57.768 --> 00:22:59.560 align:middle line:84%
be the change you want
to see in the world.

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:04.150 align:middle line:84%
But the greatest opportunity is
to start right where you are.

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of
the things I see.

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:09.100 align:middle line:84%
So often is people have
big dreams and big goals

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:11.020 align:middle line:84%
and big ideas,
which is also often

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:14.530 align:middle line:84%
why they're attracted to me
because that's who I am, too.

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:16.390 align:middle line:90%
And I love to think big.

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And the council gives us the
grandest perspective of what's

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:20.920 align:middle line:90%
possible for us, really.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:25.960 align:middle line:90%
And all of that is great.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And don't miss the opportunity
you have every single day

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:32.650 align:middle line:84%
to look someone in the
eye and to smile at them

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:36.610 align:middle line:84%
and change their entire day,
and maybe their entire life.

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:39.430 align:middle line:84%
When people come to me and they
say, I want to write a book,

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:43.180 align:middle line:84%
or I want to create a community,
or I want to do a film,

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:46.750 align:middle line:84%
or start an organization,
all of it's wonderful.

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:48.820 align:middle line:84%
But don't create such a
huge gap from where you

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:50.110 align:middle line:90%
are to where you want to be.

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:50.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:50.870 align:middle line:90%
You'll never get started on it.

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:51.760 align:middle line:90%
>> You'll never get there.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:52.718 align:middle line:90%
You'll never get there.

00:23:52.718 --> 00:23:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Find some way, in this
day, to make a difference.

00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:59.620 align:middle line:10%
And for most people,
that means really

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:03.120 align:middle line:10%
allowing themselves to show
up and be all that they are.

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:07.390 align:middle line:84%
If you're still afraid that
your light is just too bright,

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:10.240 align:middle line:84%
or that people are
going to reject you--

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.900 align:middle line:90%
we talk about fear commonly.

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:18.610 align:middle line:84%
But the general term
of fear doesn't really

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:20.900 align:middle line:84%
get to the root of
what's going on.

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is not about going
into the past stories.

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:26.680 align:middle line:84%
It's not about going back and
figuring out who wronged you

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:30.850 align:middle line:84%
and who didn't give you
the right information all

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:32.830 align:middle line:90%
the way along the lines.

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:39.370 align:middle line:10%
But it is about understanding
what is keeping you stuck

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:41.170 align:middle line:10%
and allowing that to
come to the light.

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And that, sometimes, is
the most difficult part,

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:49.640 align:middle line:84%
is having the courage to see how
your life is showing up exactly

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.120 align:middle line:84%
in alignment to
what you believe.

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:54.320 align:middle line:90%
It never fails.

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.420 align:middle line:84%
So when you can allow
yourself to see,

00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:00.680 align:middle line:84%
oh, I have a fear of
rejection-- and that's

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:03.290 align:middle line:84%
what it was for me in relation
to doing this channeling

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:09.050 align:middle line:84%
work, is I have so many
wonderful family members

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:11.660 align:middle line:84%
and friends that are
very conservative

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:16.800 align:middle line:84%
and still in the Christian
faith, and I love them dearly.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And my fear in really coming
out and being all that I am

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:26.210 align:middle line:84%
was the fear of rejection,
losing the love of the people

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:29.430 align:middle line:90%
that I care most deeply about.

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And as the council would
say, it's always a mirror.

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:35.870 align:middle line:84%
It's always-- whatever
is going on out

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:40.050 align:middle line:84%
there is just a reflection of
what's going on within here.

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:43.820 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to live in a more
peaceful, joyful, loving world

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:47.450 align:middle line:84%
around you, you must first
create it within you.

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:51.140 align:middle line:84%
And whatever is being
triggered by someone

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:53.870 align:middle line:84%
around you, or in your
interaction with another,

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:56.480 align:middle line:84%
is always showing you
something within you.

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.000 align:middle line:84%
That's not to say that
something's wrong with you,

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.850 align:middle line:84%
or you don't speak your
truth or have boundaries,

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:05.120 align:middle line:84%
and say what is and isn't OK
for you in how others treat you.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:08.810 align:middle line:84%
But the fear that I
was holding myself in

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:10.460 align:middle line:90%
was fear of rejection.

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And when I got to the
place within myself where

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:17.870 align:middle line:84%
I really accepted
myself for who I am--

00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:21.770 align:middle line:84%
even though part of that meant
admitting to myself and others

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:27.500 align:middle line:84%
that I channel a group of
non-physical beings that is

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:30.620 align:middle line:84%
the most loving, incredible
experience that anyone could

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:33.230 align:middle line:84%
ever have, or certainly
that I've ever had--

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:35.990 align:middle line:84%
but when I decided
with inside of myself

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:40.970 align:middle line:84%
that I accepted
myself, and I didn't

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:46.660 align:middle line:84%
need anyone else to
understand in order for me

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:48.760 align:middle line:90%
to be OK with who I am.

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And almost in the
moment that I accepted

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:55.220 align:middle line:84%
that, and I didn't need
anyone else to understand,

00:26:55.220 --> 00:27:00.317 align:middle line:84%
I had a very dear family
member who I love say to me,

00:27:00.317 --> 00:27:02.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't really understand
what you're doing.

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:04.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand this
whole channeling thing.

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And this person had no concept
of spirituality outside

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:09.130 align:middle line:90%
of the church.

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:11.403 align:middle line:10%
And that's just where
they are in their path.

00:27:11.403 --> 00:27:12.570 align:middle line:10%
Doesn't mean right or wrong.

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:15.100 align:middle line:10%
Doesn't mean we're farther
along or better, just

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.890 align:middle line:10%
in a different space.

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:19.930 align:middle line:10%
And I said, that's OK.

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:22.100 align:middle line:90%
It's OK if you don't understand.

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:22.900 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:24.275 align:middle line:84%
>> What was their
answer to that?

00:27:24.275 --> 00:27:26.160 align:middle line:90%
>> It was just peace.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.440 align:middle line:90%
It was like, yeah.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And we both agreed we
were just always going

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:31.750 align:middle line:84%
to love each other
no matter what.

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of jokingly
said, you didn't

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:36.800 align:middle line:84%
understand what I did in
the corporate world, either.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.610 align:middle line:84%
You didn't necessarily
understand IT infrastructure

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:40.520 align:middle line:90%
consulting, either.

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:42.040 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.260 align:middle line:90%
But the love is always there.

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
that's sometimes--

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:50.530 align:middle line:84%
when our work becomes
our life and our passion,

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:54.420 align:middle line:84%
and people ask what we do, and
they're trying to understand,

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:57.850 align:middle line:84%
when we're doing something
that we consider unique

00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:04.590 align:middle line:84%
or on the edge sort of
say, we expect everybody

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:05.590 align:middle line:90%
to understand or get it.

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:07.313 align:middle line:90%
And it's OK if they don't.

00:28:07.313 --> 00:28:08.230 align:middle line:90%
It's OK if they don't.

00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:11.550 align:middle line:90%


00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:13.340 align:middle line:90%
There are the deer.

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:17.840 align:middle line:84%
This is like one of the
greatest joys in my whole day

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:18.890 align:middle line:90%
on a daily basis.

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:19.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And they're
there all the time.

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah, there they are.

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:21.960 align:middle line:90%
There's one right there.

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.250 align:middle line:90%
>> One, two.

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:24.960 align:middle line:84%
There's, like, six
of them in there.

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.000 align:middle line:90%
There's a buck.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.740 align:middle line:84%
There's a big buck
in there, and he's

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:32.625 align:middle line:84%
been driving them nuts
because clearly it's

00:28:32.625 --> 00:28:33.750 align:middle line:90%
mating season or something.

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:35.920 align:middle line:90%
>> And this is their hangout.

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.610 align:middle line:90%
They're here every day.

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>> How close have
you gotten to one?

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:40.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, they'll come--

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:41.750 align:middle line:84%
I have picture of
them standing out--

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:44.800 align:middle line:84%
I walk this pretty
much every day.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, 10 feet away
from me, when I had Kona.

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:49.020 align:middle line:90%
But I love it.

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:49.820 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh.

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:51.147 align:middle line:90%
It just makes me so happy.

00:28:51.147 --> 00:28:53.582 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:53.582 --> 00:29:05.857 align:middle line:90%


00:29:05.857 --> 00:29:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>> What about your
parents and family?

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.120 align:middle line:90%
How did they react to all this?

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, so that's
the interesting piece.

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:16.860 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's any
accident that early

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:20.550 align:middle line:84%
on in my childhood,
my aunt, who--

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:26.100 align:middle line:84%
my entire family was Christian,
and some were more devout

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.490 align:middle line:90%
than others.

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:30.090 align:middle line:84%
Some were a little more open
minded and entrepreneurial.

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:33.180 align:middle line:84%
So my aunt had had
a car accident,

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:35.650 align:middle line:84%
and while she was recovering
from her car accident,

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:40.830 align:middle line:84%
had seen something on a
TV program about soulmates

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:43.260 align:middle line:84%
and went to do this
thing on soulmates,

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:44.880 align:middle line:84%
and just opened
her whole life up

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:48.060 align:middle line:84%
to spirituality
and enlightenment.

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And she said she just
knew, when she heard

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:55.140 align:middle line:90%
the wisdom, that it was truth.

00:29:55.140 --> 00:30:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And she started following
channelers back 30 years ago,

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.350 align:middle line:90%
40 years ago.

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:03.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you know which ones?

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:06.870 align:middle line:84%
>> So a channel by
the name of Mafu,

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:10.200 align:middle line:84%
and a more commonly known
channel still today by the name

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.860 align:middle line:84%
of Ramtha, back many years ago,
which I know you're familiar

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:13.660 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:14.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Very well, yeah.

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And so we ended up living
with my aunt at one point

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:19.860 align:middle line:90%
in my childhood.

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And she shared these videos,
specifically of Mafu, with me.

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And the first time
I ever saw it,

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:32.850 align:middle line:84%
heard it, I just
felt like I was home.

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:37.800 align:middle line:84%
I just felt the
deeper truth that we

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:43.740 align:middle line:84%
are more than these bodies, that
we are far more capable than we

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:47.740 align:middle line:84%
have ever been told or ever
learned to be in this life.

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:51.300 align:middle line:84%
So we are more than
just these bodies.

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:53.730 align:middle line:10%
There's so much more
to our experience

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:57.210 align:middle line:10%
than what we are
taught to believe,

00:30:57.210 --> 00:31:00.600 align:middle line:10%
and that there's so much
more possible for us,

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:04.440 align:middle line:10%
and that we have this
intelligence and this awareness

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:08.580 align:middle line:10%
that is always available to us
and always guiding us and is

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:14.370 align:middle line:10%
there so we don't lose
our way in this dimension

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:16.560 align:middle line:10%
of density in form.

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.670 align:middle line:90%
And that's not a bad thing.

00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:20.650 align:middle line:90%
The word density or lower--

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:24.150 align:middle line:84%
densities, I don't mean that
disparagingly in any way.

00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:27.720 align:middle line:84%
We're here in form, and we're
perceiving in this body.

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.240 align:middle line:84%
We're perceiving
through our senses.

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:33.540 align:middle line:10%
And that's what we
tend to think is real.

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:37.980 align:middle line:10%
When we begin to move
beyond our physical senses

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:40.890 align:middle line:10%
and we perceive from
a grander awareness,

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:43.740 align:middle line:10%
or an extra-dimensional
awareness,

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:46.140 align:middle line:10%
our life opens up
in incredible ways.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
basic understanding

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:50.640 align:middle line:84%
of what some of these
teachings were, in addition

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.848 align:middle line:84%
to past lives and other
forms of intelligence

00:31:53.848 --> 00:31:55.140 align:middle line:90%
and all these different things.

00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:56.970 align:middle line:84%
But I just knew
that that was truth.

00:31:56.970 --> 00:31:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And how old were you
when you were hearing this?

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>> I was about seven
years old at the time.

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:01.622 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:32:01.622 --> 00:32:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And you could grasp that,
those concepts back then?

00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>> I could feel the love.

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:11.610 align:middle line:84%
I could feel the love for this
being that I was watching.

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:16.110 align:middle line:10%
And it was a woman who
channeled a masculine energy

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:19.020 align:middle line:10%
by the name of Mafu.

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And yet I saw a
masculine energy.

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:23.370 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see the woman.

00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:24.330 align:middle line:90%
I saw this energy.

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And so my aunt had many
books on spirituality,

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:31.823 align:middle line:84%
and I started reading them
very young, eight, nine, 10.

00:32:31.823 --> 00:32:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And I would talk
to her for hours,

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:36.330 align:middle line:84%
and she would share this
wisdom that she was learning

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:39.060 align:middle line:84%
and all these incredible
experiences she was having.

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them were
based on past life things

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.960 align:middle line:90%
that she was tuning into.

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And so I was very
open to that, and I

00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:50.010 align:middle line:90%
knew it was truth very young.

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:54.505 align:middle line:84%
>> I had kind of the opposite
when I was experiencing Ramtha.

00:32:54.505 --> 00:32:56.880 align:middle line:84%
I was in junior high school,
so I was a little bit older.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.550 align:middle line:90%
But I was cringing.

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:01.800 align:middle line:84%
I remember telling my mom,
this is the craziest thing.

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.498 align:middle line:84%
Don't include me in
any of this stuff.

00:33:03.498 --> 00:33:04.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I did the opposite.

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:05.596 align:middle line:90%
>> Look at you now.

00:33:05.596 --> 00:33:06.396 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:33:06.396 --> 00:33:07.979 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, aren't you
proud of me, mom?

00:33:07.979 --> 00:33:09.280 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:10.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing shows on channeling.

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:11.596 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:33:11.596 --> 00:33:12.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Who would have thought?

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:14.750 align:middle line:84%
She's like, you've come
a long way, Reuben.

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:15.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:16.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:19.200 align:middle line:84%
See, we always find our
way back to the truth.

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, we do.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.530 align:middle line:84%
>> No matter where we journey
out to, we always find our way

00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:24.810 align:middle line:90%
back to the truth.

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:32.580 align:middle line:10%
So along those lines,
I probably was about 10

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:36.270 align:middle line:10%
when I excitedly went to
tell some other members

00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:40.350 align:middle line:10%
of my Christian family all
this amazing, incredible wisdom

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:41.550 align:middle line:10%
that I had learned from--

00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:42.350 align:middle line:10%
>> From your aunt.

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:47.610 align:middle line:10%
>> This being-- my aunt, and
from this entity named Mafu.

00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:52.530 align:middle line:90%
And I remember it very well.

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:55.320 align:middle line:84%
The response was, if
you believe that, you're

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:56.800 align:middle line:90%
going to go to hell.

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:59.425 align:middle line:90%
And so is Sunny.

00:33:59.425 --> 00:34:00.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Sunny's your aunt.

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:01.770 align:middle line:90%
>> My aunt.

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:05.070 align:middle line:84%
In that moment, I remember
just shutting it all off.

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:06.830 align:middle line:90%
I remember just--

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:11.909 align:middle line:84%
I see that little girl, and the
entire light of her being just

00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:13.780 align:middle line:90%
going off.

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:20.550 align:middle line:10%
And I remember that feeling,
like, oh, this is not safe.

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:23.820 align:middle line:10%
And so I continued
to talk with my aunt.

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:25.480 align:middle line:10%
I continued to listen to her.

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:29.040 align:middle line:10%
I continued to watch and
listen to the videos of Mafu

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:32.489 align:middle line:10%
and read the books, but I just
didn't really talk about it.

00:34:32.489 --> 00:34:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And in my teenage
years, I actually

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:38.670 align:middle line:90%
couldn't even use the word God.

00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:43.260 align:middle line:84%
I felt so hurt and
judged by what I thought

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:45.870 align:middle line:84%
was the teachings
of Christianity

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:49.290 align:middle line:84%
that I wouldn't even
use the word God.

00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And yet I knew I was
still very spiritual.

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:56.010 align:middle line:90%
I was living in Montana.

00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:57.600 align:middle line:90%
I loved nature.

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:00.210 align:middle line:90%
I loved life.

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:01.740 align:middle line:90%
I knew there was more.

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:04.980 align:middle line:84%
I just was so confused
at that point.

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:07.990 align:middle line:90%
And it felt a little unsafe.

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And so when I was 21, my brother
was killed in a car accident.

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And my aunt and I happened
to be in the same place,

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.480 align:middle line:90%
in Seattle, flying up to Alaska.

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And so my very
spiritual aunt and I

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:30.720 align:middle line:84%
flew up together to
my brother's funeral.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:37.680 align:middle line:10%
And we were in the airplane
talking, and we were happy.

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:40.590 align:middle line:84%
We were laughing, we
were telling stories.

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:43.140 align:middle line:84%
We knew that it wasn't
really an accident.

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:45.210 align:middle line:90%
We weren't mad at anyone.

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:46.860 align:middle line:90%
We weren't blaming.

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:50.820 align:middle line:84%
We were really in
this wonderful state.

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:55.500 align:middle line:10%
And we got off the airplane,
and everyone was so ticked off

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:58.470 align:middle line:10%
about how peaceful
and fun and happy

00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:01.470 align:middle line:10%
we were about it because we
were supposed to be upset.

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:02.270 align:middle line:90%
He has died.

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:04.060 align:middle line:90%
Something's gone wrong.

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:05.900 align:middle line:84%
You know, he was
robbed of his life.

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And another moment
where you're wondering,

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.930 align:middle line:90%
what the heck is going on here?

00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:17.030 align:middle line:84%
How did this get
so out of whack?

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And when I walked into
my brother's viewing,

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:21.860 align:middle line:90%
it was just our family.

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very
cold day in Alaska.

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And you know those chairs
in a high school auditorium,

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.040 align:middle line:90%
the metal folding chairs?

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:32.350 align:middle line:90%
That's what was set up there.

00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:33.150 align:middle line:90%
And it was heavy.

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:38.610 align:middle line:84%
I could feel the heaviness
of the grief and sorrow

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:40.540 align:middle line:90%
in everyone that was there.

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And I walked up to my brother's
body, and I touched it.

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's the first time
I'd seen a dead body.

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:47.870 align:middle line:84%
I was shocked at
how cold it was.

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:51.690 align:middle line:90%
And so I went and sat down.

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:55.050 align:middle line:90%
And after a couple of minutes--

00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:57.690 align:middle line:84%
not really sure how
long I sat there--

00:36:57.690 --> 00:37:01.210 align:middle line:84%
this feeling went
through my body.

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And it started at
the top of my head,

00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:07.900 align:middle line:84%
and I can only describe it to
you, Reuben, as liquid love.

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And it just started
at the top of my head,

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:12.160 align:middle line:84%
went all the way
through my body,

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:18.310 align:middle line:84%
and I was just in a state
of pure bliss and peace,

00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:21.900 align:middle line:84%
this eternal sort
of peace feeling.

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel
it all around me.

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And I heard my brother say
as clear as day over my right

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:31.690 align:middle line:84%
shoulder-- his body was
on the left side of me--

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:33.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm still here.

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:35.122 align:middle line:90%
I'm just not in there.

00:37:35.122 --> 00:37:37.770 align:middle line:90%


00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And I said back, where
are you, in my head.

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And he said I'm just
as here as I ever was.

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:47.655 align:middle line:84%
I just left the
density of the body.

00:37:47.655 --> 00:37:50.040 align:middle line:90%
And no one goes anywhere.

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:54.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm just at such a frequency
your eyes can't perceive me.

00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:57.450 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not gone,
and I'm always here.

00:37:57.450 --> 00:38:00.330 align:middle line:90%
So that went on for many years.

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And I never told
anyone except my aunt

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:08.190 align:middle line:84%
because I, again, was afraid
of the rejection of others

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:10.110 align:middle line:84%
who wouldn't have
really liked that I

00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:13.470 align:middle line:84%
was in a peaceful state
about his passing.

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And he explained there
are no accidents.

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:22.390 align:middle line:84%
He explained that he came
in and was here to love.

00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And so that was really my
first conscious awareness

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:33.990 align:middle line:84%
of communicating with something
beyond our normal senses,

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:37.860 align:middle line:90%
a extra-dimensional perception.

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:39.860 align:middle line:84%
>> And what did your aunt
say when you told her?

00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:41.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, she was--

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Happy, excited.

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:47.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Happy, and had some
experiences with him herself,

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:52.020 align:middle line:90%
and very much understood that.

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:57.470 align:middle line:84%
However, I just wanted
to go back to my normal--

00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:58.920 align:middle line:90%
whatever that is-- life.

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't say much
about it except to my aunt.

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:04.020 align:middle line:84%
I went back to my
corporate world

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:07.380 align:middle line:84%
of achieving goals and being
successful and buying the house

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:09.240 align:middle line:90%
and all the stuff, right?

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:14.310 align:middle line:10%
And then, a few years
later, I started

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:17.730 align:middle line:10%
having these experiences in
the middle of the night where

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:23.480 align:middle line:10%
I would wake up
and I had to write.

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:25.620 align:middle line:90%
It almost said, grab a pen.

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And I would grab a
pen and I would write.

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:29.990 align:middle line:84%
Or I'd turn my phone on and
I would write in the notes

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:33.080 align:middle line:90%
section of my phone later on.

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And it was this energy
that came through.

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.040 align:middle line:90%
And I was just translating it.

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.800 align:middle line:84%
I was literally
just writing it down

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.140 align:middle line:90%
as fast as I was hearing it.

00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And I would read it
the next morning,

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:47.820 align:middle line:84%
and it was the most
incredible wisdom

00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:50.978 align:middle line:84%
beyond anything I had
ever experienced before.

00:39:50.978 --> 00:39:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And it was the answers
to all the questions

00:39:52.770 --> 00:39:55.680 align:middle line:84%
that I had that no one else
could answer for me yet,

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.710 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Like what is our
highest potential?

00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:02.470 align:middle line:10%
And what really is going on?

00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:04.590 align:middle line:90%
And why do bad things happen?

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And these incredible
answers came through.

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:14.370 align:middle line:84%
And I realized at that
point that something else,

00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:19.620 align:middle line:84%
some other awareness
was speaking through me.

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:22.002 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't coming from my head.

00:40:22.002 --> 00:40:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>> What time of
the night was this?

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:28.830 align:middle line:84%
>> It was almost always
like 1:00, 2:00, 3:00 AM.

00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:33.630 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time, it was,
like, 3:00 AM to 5:00 AM.

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And then I would just
go right back to sleep.

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was never tired
the next morning.

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:39.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm a good sleeper.

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:41.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm a good eight,
10, 12 hours of sleep

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:43.890 align:middle line:90%
if I get it in person sometimes.

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:45.720 align:middle line:84%
But I would wake
up and felt like I

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:47.210 align:middle line:90%
had a complete night's sleep.

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:50.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And this was during
your corporate world, too.

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:52.320 align:middle line:84%
So you had to perform
and do your thing.

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:55.080 align:middle line:84%
>> It was probably during one
of the most stressful times

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:57.330 align:middle line:90%
of my corporate life.

00:40:57.330 --> 00:41:01.650 align:middle line:10%
And I think that is sort of
the resistance of when you're

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:04.020 align:middle line:10%
in such resistance and
stress, the second you just

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:09.590 align:middle line:10%
let go a little bit, you feel
who you really are again.

00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:11.310 align:middle line:84%
But you don't have
to get to that level

00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:15.570 align:middle line:84%
to feel into those higher states
of awareness and vibration

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:18.960 align:middle line:84%
that are here, or
getting into a frequency

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:23.100 align:middle line:84%
where you allow more of
your multidimensional self

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:25.080 align:middle line:90%
to be known by you.

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And so a series
of events happened

00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:33.810 align:middle line:84%
after that, which felt like
coming to the end of myself.

00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:39.210 align:middle line:84%
It felt like the life that I had
spent so long building was sort

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:43.380 align:middle line:84%
of crumbling before my eyes,
and yet some part of me

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:46.810 align:middle line:84%
was really calm and
peaceful about it.

00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:51.040 align:middle line:10%
And while it felt like
everything was falling apart,

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.770 align:middle line:10%
there was just this
deeper awareness.

00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:55.470 align:middle line:10%
And certainly the wisdom
that was coming through

00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:58.110 align:middle line:10%
in the channeled
writing was that it

00:41:58.110 --> 00:42:02.190 align:middle line:10%
is going to fall into place
if you just trust and allow

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:03.690 align:middle line:10%
and be in a state of grace.

00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:06.880 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot less doing needed
here, and all of those things.

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:11.970 align:middle line:84%
But when you have learned to
work hard and effort and all

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:15.540 align:middle line:84%
of that, to go to the state
of being and allowing--

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:17.310 align:middle line:90%
and I get this often.

00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:18.900 align:middle line:84%
It's like, what
does that even mean?

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:20.440 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:23.062 align:middle line:10%
So, again, you're back in
the how do I do it stage.

00:42:23.062 --> 00:42:24.270 align:middle line:90%
You're still trying to do it.

00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:26.550 align:middle line:90%
>> How do you do the non-doing?

00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:27.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:29.130 align:middle line:84%
I've been working
really hard at allowing,

00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:30.980 align:middle line:90%
is what I hear oftentimes.

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:38.580 align:middle line:84%
So after a series of changes
in my life that I knew

00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:43.800 align:middle line:84%
were not aligned to my truth,
I just didn't know what was,

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:47.040 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't want
to hurt anyone.

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:49.080 align:middle line:84%
I was in a marriage
at that time.

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.580 align:middle line:84%
I was in a business
at that time.

00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:54.330 align:middle line:84%
I was living in a different
state at that time

00:42:54.330 --> 00:42:56.020 align:middle line:90%
with wonderful friends.

00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:59.490 align:middle line:84%
But I also knew
there was more, and I

00:42:59.490 --> 00:43:01.890 align:middle line:84%
knew there were greater
experiences that I

00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:03.520 align:middle line:90%
wanted to have in my life.

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:06.450 align:middle line:90%
And so I made a lot of changes.

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:10.750 align:middle line:84%
I was moving in a
particular direction.

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:12.510 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know where I was going.

00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And the council would
say, what brings you joy?

00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:17.590 align:middle line:90%
People want to be free.

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:20.220 align:middle line:84%
They want to be free
to be who they are

00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:21.660 align:middle line:90%
and do what they want to do.

00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And they have all of
these ideas and ways

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:27.000 align:middle line:84%
that they like to
create, and passions

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.180 align:middle line:90%
that they want to pursue.

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:31.290 align:middle line:84%
But they feel that they're stuck
and unable to do those things,

00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:34.122 align:middle line:84%
and they don't have
the freedom to do them.

00:43:34.122 --> 00:43:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And yet what the
council will often

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:39.530 align:middle line:90%
ask is, what brings you joy?

00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And people almost always
say the same things.

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:50.580 align:middle line:84%
Nature, animals, their loved
ones, music, dancing, cooking,

00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:57.460 align:middle line:84%
creating, reading, the
ocean, the mountains, hiking.

00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:59.340 align:middle line:84%
So people will say
travel sometimes.

00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:04.260 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part, the
things that bring you joy,

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:06.300 align:middle line:90%
we could all do today.

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:08.970 align:middle line:84%
We just don't think we have
the freedom to do them,

00:44:08.970 --> 00:44:09.990 align:middle line:90%
so we don't.

00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we
hold ourselves stuck.

00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:15.630 align:middle line:84%
So the first step is
really get clear on what

00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:19.410 align:middle line:84%
things bring you joy, and
start doing those things.

00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:23.070 align:middle line:84%
For me, it was nature,
it was the ocean,

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:27.690 align:middle line:84%
it was having conversations
like this with people.

00:44:27.690 --> 00:44:31.260 align:middle line:84%
It was spirituality
and consciousness.

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's what drove me,
being with other people

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:40.930 align:middle line:84%
and feeling that deep
sense of connection.

00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I just began to move
in that direction, whatever

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:45.100 align:middle line:90%
that meant.

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And we can never logically
figure out the path.

00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:49.420 align:middle line:90%
It's not designed that way.

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And the council would
say, divine orchestration

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.050 align:middle line:84%
is always out ahead of
you, orchestrating things

00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:56.100 align:middle line:90%
on your behalf.

00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:58.200 align:middle line:84%
If you will just
follow your joy,

00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:02.730 align:middle line:84%
if you will just do the
things that really bring you

00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:06.430 align:middle line:84%
into the moment,
it'll all come to you.

00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And in that state of being, all
things are done through you,

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:16.030 align:middle line:84%
and so I just moved in
that direction each time.

00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And I took some windy roads, a
little off path here and there,

00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:22.527 align:middle line:84%
but ultimately it all came
back to this experience

00:45:22.527 --> 00:45:23.610 align:middle line:90%
of channeling the council.

00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And it started with a
meditation, a visualization,

00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:30.990 align:middle line:84%
kind of hypnosis
practice of getting

00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:33.090 align:middle line:90%
in touch with your higher self.

00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:36.720 align:middle line:84%
So at that time, I had
started meditating.

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:39.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Up until then you hadn't
really been meditating?

00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:41.690 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't have time, Reuben.

00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:47.680 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was so busy doing,
I didn't have time to do that.

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
meditating, but not

00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:53.130 align:middle line:84%
with any type of
real structure, just

00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:57.210 align:middle line:84%
taking a few minutes each day
to notice that I was breathing,

00:45:57.210 --> 00:45:59.040 align:middle line:90%
that I was peaceful.

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think running
can be a meditation,

00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:05.070 align:middle line:84%
swimming can be a meditation,
walking can be a meditation.

00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:07.620 align:middle line:84%
Drawing or writing
can be a meditation.

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:12.210 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't always have to be a
close eyes, particular position

00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:14.220 align:middle line:84%
that you put your
hands and feet.

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:18.490 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is that just allows
you to open up a little bit.

00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And so the first
time the council

00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:27.120 align:middle line:84%
came through, as I told you,
it sounded like a Russian man.

00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:29.520 align:middle line:84%
>> This was in a
meditative state?

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:32.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it was a bit of a
hypnosis state that was being

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:33.420 align:middle line:90%
recorded.

00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:36.780 align:middle line:84%
And the basis of
that hypnosis was

00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:38.850 align:middle line:84%
to get in touch with
your higher self.

00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:41.730 align:middle line:84%
It was based on the
quantum hypnosis healing

00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:43.210 align:middle line:90%
techniques of Delores Cannon.

00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:44.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:44.980 align:middle line:90%
Done a few of those.

00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:45.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:46.620 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful work.

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And so the question was,
do we have permission

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:54.640 align:middle line:90%
to talk to Sara's higher self?

00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:55.673 align:middle line:90%
And so I said yes.

00:46:55.673 --> 00:46:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And this went on
for a little bit.

00:46:57.090 --> 00:46:59.173 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden
this energy just came in.

00:46:59.173 --> 00:47:01.120 align:middle line:90%
And I felt it go into my body.

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And it just spoke
really, really loud.

00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:05.010 align:middle line:90%
It didn't pause.

00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:06.882 align:middle line:90%
It didn't um.

00:47:06.882 --> 00:47:08.520 align:middle line:90%
It didn't miss a beat.

00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:10.890 align:middle line:90%
And it always said we.

00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:12.090 align:middle line:90%
We are here for this.

00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:14.070 align:middle line:90%
We love you.

00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:16.800 align:middle line:90%
We are here guiding you.

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of it-- it
had all been recorded--

00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:23.580 align:middle line:84%
I realized it was the same
energy that was coming through

00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:24.990 align:middle line:90%
in the writing.

00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And it was just finally time
to move into that space and--

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Give it a voice.

00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:32.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Give it a voice.

00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:33.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Very cool.

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah So even after the
voice started coming through,

00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:42.240 align:middle line:84%
I didn't consider
myself a channeler.

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:45.270 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't trying to channel.

00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:49.980 align:middle line:84%
I was looking for
answers to more so what

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:53.890 align:middle line:84%
my soul's purpose
was, why am I here,

00:47:53.890 --> 00:47:55.660 align:middle line:84%
what am I supposed
to do with my life?

00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:57.900 align:middle line:84%
How do I get this
right sort of thing.

00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:01.250 align:middle line:10%
And so the content
that came through

00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:03.400 align:middle line:10%
was really based
on those things,

00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:06.750 align:middle line:10%
and even sort of
what I would consider

00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:11.220 align:middle line:10%
as the next evolution
of the Law of Attraction

00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:15.210 align:middle line:10%
because a big part of my
questions at that time

00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:19.200 align:middle line:10%
were based on this idea
that, hey, I did everything

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:22.200 align:middle line:10%
that I was supposed
to do here, especially

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:24.000 align:middle line:10%
by the Law of Attraction.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.185 align:middle line:90%
Look out there at what you want.

00:48:26.185 --> 00:48:27.060 align:middle line:90%
Take a picture of it.

00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:29.970 align:middle line:10%
Put it on a vision board,
and you can manifest it,

00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:32.770 align:middle line:10%
and then you'll be
happy sort of thing.

00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:35.100 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of my
questions were about that

00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:39.570 align:middle line:10%
because I had these dreams
and hopes and desires.

00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:43.800 align:middle line:10%
And yet they didn't really
feel aligned with my soul,

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:47.220 align:middle line:10%
and I didn't really know
what my soul's desires were.

00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:52.410 align:middle line:10%
And so as I listened back to the
information that came through,

00:48:52.410 --> 00:48:54.090 align:middle line:10%
I really realized
that these were

00:48:54.090 --> 00:48:55.930 align:middle line:10%
the answers I was looking for.

00:48:55.930 --> 00:49:00.600 align:middle line:10%
And as I began to share
this work with other people,

00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:02.910 align:middle line:10%
or this experience of
what was happening, just

00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:06.870 align:middle line:10%
for a couple of people
where it was really safe,

00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:09.140 align:middle line:10%
they wanted to talk
to the voice, too.

00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:11.790 align:middle line:10%
And so I had a few
really close friends

00:49:11.790 --> 00:49:16.730 align:middle line:10%
that started to talk to the
council and ask questions.

00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:19.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're able to
self-hypnotize yourself

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:20.240 align:middle line:90%
in a way?

00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:21.463 align:middle line:90%
Or how did you get into that?

00:49:21.463 --> 00:49:22.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:49:22.350 --> 00:49:23.910 align:middle line:90%
It was a progression for sure.

00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:28.590 align:middle line:84%
When I first started channeling,
I had to lay down on a bed,

00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:30.040 align:middle line:90%
and my eyes were closed.

00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:33.000 align:middle line:84%
It had to be really dark,
and nobody come in for, like,

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.080 align:middle line:90%
15 minutes.

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:37.410 align:middle line:10%
And then when you come in, you
turn the voice recorder on,

00:49:37.410 --> 00:49:41.310 align:middle line:10%
and I'll be in channel,
hopefully, by then.

00:49:41.310 --> 00:49:44.130 align:middle line:84%
As it has progressed,
then I was sitting up.

00:49:44.130 --> 00:49:47.310 align:middle line:84%
Then I could turn
the recorder on.

00:49:47.310 --> 00:49:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And now it's just a couple
of breaths and they're in,

00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:53.240 align:middle line:84%
and you feel it
when they recede.

00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:57.780 align:middle line:10%
I can feel when they recede, but
they don't really go anywhere.

00:49:57.780 --> 00:50:00.090 align:middle line:10%
And having done
this for many years

00:50:00.090 --> 00:50:05.220 align:middle line:10%
now, and done so many sessions
and workshops and courses,

00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:07.620 align:middle line:10%
their energy's never
really far away.

00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:09.690 align:middle line:90%
They're here right now.

00:50:09.690 --> 00:50:12.390 align:middle line:84%
It's just me and you
talking versus me

00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:15.900 align:middle line:84%
sort of moving my consciousness
into a different space

00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:18.440 align:middle line:90%
to allow that to come through.

00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:24.420 align:middle line:10%
And so I started sharing the
voice with some people that

00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:26.860 align:middle line:10%
had questions of their own.

00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:31.230 align:middle line:10%
And I really saw where it
was this incredible wisdom

00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:34.380 align:middle line:10%
that we are all love.

00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:39.720 align:middle line:10%
The truth of who we are is
love, that everything really

00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:43.080 align:middle line:10%
is always working out for
you, that life is happening

00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:48.660 align:middle line:10%
for you, not to you, that you
are capable of so much more,

00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:55.500 align:middle line:10%
and that when you really
find peace within you,

00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:59.880 align:middle line:10%
you will find peace
around you, that you're

00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:01.920 align:middle line:10%
the only one who
can hold yourself

00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:06.150 align:middle line:10%
in either suffering
or a state of freedom.

00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:10.440 align:middle line:10%
And none of the teachings
are really complicated.

00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:11.980 align:middle line:90%
They're actually simple.

00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's why most
people have to practice them.

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:18.850 align:middle line:10%
The council says
there are basically

00:51:18.850 --> 00:51:24.070 align:middle line:10%
three playgrounds where we're
learning to master our power.

00:51:24.070 --> 00:51:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And almost all the questions,
for a long period of time,

00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:29.410 align:middle line:90%
were based on health--

00:51:29.410 --> 00:51:34.390 align:middle line:84%
how do I heal this pain
or disease in my body,

00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:36.790 align:middle line:84%
or some sort of
imbalance of their body,

00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:40.690 align:middle line:84%
not feeling their best,
wanting health and well-being.

00:51:40.690 --> 00:51:44.860 align:middle line:10%
The other one was money and
finances, wanting more money,

00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:47.350 align:middle line:10%
either not having
the money to do

00:51:47.350 --> 00:51:49.670 align:middle line:10%
what they are feeling
inspired to do,

00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:52.432 align:middle line:10%
or wanting to make
changes in their lives

00:51:52.432 --> 00:51:54.640 align:middle line:10%
and feeling like they have
all these responsibilities

00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:57.040 align:middle line:10%
and so they can't do
what they want to do

00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:58.900 align:middle line:10%
until they have more money.

00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:02.090 align:middle line:10%
And relationships.

00:52:02.090 --> 00:52:07.960 align:middle line:84%
You know, how to have a better
marriage, how to find the one,

00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:11.080 align:middle line:84%
how to create more
connection in their lives.

00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:13.480 align:middle line:84%
So those were really
the three places,

00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:17.120 align:middle line:84%
for a very long period of time,
that I would get questions

00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:17.920 align:middle line:90%
about--

00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:21.990 align:middle line:84%
health, finances,
and relationships.

00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:27.070 align:middle line:10%
And I would also put success
and purpose in there.

00:52:27.070 --> 00:52:31.420 align:middle line:84%
What is my purpose, often,
and success go hand in hand

00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:35.470 align:middle line:84%
with some of the money stuff
or aligning all of that.

00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:39.760 align:middle line:84%
I think now the
questions have also

00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:44.890 align:middle line:84%
evolved towards that bigger
picture of what is the highest

00:52:44.890 --> 00:52:46.600 align:middle line:90%
perspective for us?

00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:49.582 align:middle line:84%
It's no longer trying
to fix a problem, like I

00:52:49.582 --> 00:52:51.790 align:middle line:84%
want to fix my health, I
want to fix my relationship,

00:52:51.790 --> 00:52:53.830 align:middle line:90%
I have to fix my money problem.

00:52:53.830 --> 00:52:59.080 align:middle line:10%
It's more of realizing
that all of those things

00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:02.150 align:middle line:10%
exist in a dimension of density.

00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:04.780 align:middle line:84%
So speaking of
extra-dimensional,

00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:11.260 align:middle line:84%
we have an aspect of us that
is in all different sorts

00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:13.060 align:middle line:90%
of dimensions and consciousness.

00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:15.880 align:middle line:84%
There's aspects of us in
multiple different dimensions

00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:17.620 align:middle line:90%
of awareness and consciousness.

00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:18.970 align:middle line:90%
We're most focused here.

00:53:18.970 --> 00:53:23.290 align:middle line:84%
But even here, we have different
dimensions of consciousness.

00:53:23.290 --> 00:53:26.060 align:middle line:90%
It's not a different place.

00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:28.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a different
state of consciousness

00:53:28.690 --> 00:53:34.270 align:middle line:84%
that is based on where
your frequency is.

00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:37.030 align:middle line:10%
And so if you are
in a place where

00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:40.930 align:middle line:10%
you are feeling that there's
lack, there's not enough,

00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:46.090 align:middle line:10%
you're feeling powerless, you're
feeling separate from even

00:53:46.090 --> 00:53:50.860 align:middle line:10%
the solution to your problem
or the answer to your question,

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:55.570 align:middle line:10%
or you're in judgment,
you are holding yourself

00:53:55.570 --> 00:53:58.000 align:middle line:10%
in a dimension of
consciousness that feels

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:01.090 align:middle line:10%
really heavy, really isolating.

00:54:01.090 --> 00:54:04.030 align:middle line:84%
There's not enough,
and it's a struggle.

00:54:04.030 --> 00:54:05.950 align:middle line:84%
So you can even see
this in someone.

00:54:05.950 --> 00:54:07.810 align:middle line:84%
If someone walks
into the room, you

00:54:07.810 --> 00:54:10.630 align:middle line:84%
can see with your
physical senses

00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:12.580 align:middle line:84%
the state of
consciousness they're in.

00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:14.470 align:middle line:84%
If their shoulders
are shrunk down,

00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:16.840 align:middle line:84%
and they just look
frazzled and overwhelmed,

00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:19.630 align:middle line:84%
and they've just got
this frown on their face,

00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:24.100 align:middle line:84%
they're in a heavier state of
consciousness or awareness.

00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:26.050 align:middle line:84%
The thoughts that come
to us from that place

00:54:26.050 --> 00:54:28.240 align:middle line:84%
are what exists in that
mass conscious collective

00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:29.770 align:middle line:90%
at that state.

00:54:29.770 --> 00:54:32.740 align:middle line:10%
So you just get
more of the same.

00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And people don't realize
they have the opportunity

00:54:35.710 --> 00:54:38.560 align:middle line:84%
to step into higher
states of consciousness,

00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:43.000 align:middle line:84%
and that when you do that,
more and more opens up to you.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:46.060 align:middle line:84%
The greater awareness you
have, the greater potential,

00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:47.890 align:middle line:90%
the greater possibilities.

00:54:47.890 --> 00:54:49.570 align:middle line:84%
The more you expand
your consciousness,

00:54:49.570 --> 00:54:52.960 align:middle line:84%
the more your life
expands, and the more that

00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:55.610 align:middle line:90%
becomes possible for you.

00:54:55.610 --> 00:54:58.120 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the
work now, which I

00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:00.610 align:middle line:84%
think is always
and ever-evolving,

00:55:00.610 --> 00:55:03.700 align:middle line:84%
is around this understanding
of different states

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:04.788 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:55:04.788 --> 00:55:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And again, I always go
back to the question

00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:11.710 align:middle line:84%
of what does that have
to do with my life today?

00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:14.350 align:middle line:90%
So we have been moving through--

00:55:14.350 --> 00:55:16.510 align:middle line:84%
I think a great
majority of people

00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:19.900 align:middle line:84%
that are on this path
to greater awareness--

00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:22.720 align:middle line:84%
we've been moving through
sort of the next state

00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:27.730 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, which is
the state of transformation.

00:55:27.730 --> 00:55:30.910 align:middle line:10%
Healing, transformation,
figuring it out,

00:55:30.910 --> 00:55:35.260 align:middle line:10%
realizing that no matter
what your circumstances are

00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:37.810 align:middle line:10%
or what conditions
you find yourself in,

00:55:37.810 --> 00:55:41.360 align:middle line:10%
that you can change them.

00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:43.900 align:middle line:10%
You can use your thoughts,
your focus, your energy,

00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:49.090 align:middle line:10%
your awareness, and
create an outcome

00:55:49.090 --> 00:55:52.990 align:middle line:10%
that is wanted no matter what
the current circumstances are.

00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:54.100 align:middle line:90%
We're opening up to that.

00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:55.780 align:middle line:84%
We're becoming
more aware of that.

00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:57.650 align:middle line:90%
That's a state of consciousness.

00:55:57.650 --> 00:55:59.710 align:middle line:10%
It's a higher state
of consciousness

00:55:59.710 --> 00:56:04.270 align:middle line:10%
than that state of separation
and lack and heaviness.

00:56:04.270 --> 00:56:07.390 align:middle line:10%
Again, you and I can be
sitting in the same room,

00:56:07.390 --> 00:56:09.850 align:middle line:10%
and I can be in fear and
stress and overwhelm,

00:56:09.850 --> 00:56:13.300 align:middle line:10%
trying to figure it all out,
feeling separate from all

00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:14.770 align:middle line:10%
of the answers that
I need to have,

00:56:14.770 --> 00:56:16.640 align:middle line:10%
and how do I figure this out.

00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And you can be sitting
there in a state

00:56:18.970 --> 00:56:21.970 align:middle line:84%
of knowing that wherever
I am, that things are

00:56:21.970 --> 00:56:23.500 align:middle line:90%
going to work out for me.

00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:25.420 align:middle line:84%
So we're not in a
different place.

00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:27.850 align:middle line:84%
We're just in a different
state of consciousness.

00:56:27.850 --> 00:56:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And hierarchically,
it's not better.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.220 align:middle line:84%
You're not more worthy
than someone else

00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:35.680 align:middle line:84%
because you're in a different
state of consciousness.

00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:37.758 align:middle line:84%
You might be living
a much better life.

00:56:37.758 --> 00:56:38.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Or more relaxed, yeah.

00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:41.470 align:middle line:84%
>> You might be a lot
more joyful and relaxed

00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:44.410 align:middle line:84%
and peaceful, and you might find
your relationships to be much

00:56:44.410 --> 00:56:46.630 align:middle line:90%
more loving and harmonious.

00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:51.010 align:middle line:84%
But it's not about them
doing anything wrong.

00:56:51.010 --> 00:56:54.520 align:middle line:84%
So now we're in
this time where I

00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:59.890 align:middle line:84%
think we are exploring what
it's like to access higher

00:56:59.890 --> 00:57:02.920 align:middle line:84%
dimensions of consciousness,
and to be able to bring

00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:07.420 align:middle line:84%
them here and now,
in this moment,

00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:15.970 align:middle line:84%
to have that experience of
an even greater sense of joy

00:57:15.970 --> 00:57:19.180 align:middle line:90%
and peace and love in our lives.

00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:24.070 align:middle line:10%
And in that, we feel
that sense of oneness.

00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:26.110 align:middle line:10%
We are not separate.

00:57:26.110 --> 00:57:30.280 align:middle line:84%
What grief feels like to
you feels the same to me.

00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:32.470 align:middle line:90%
There's not separation.

00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And we find our
connection in love.

00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:40.550 align:middle line:84%
So evident to me, s
being in this place.

00:57:40.550 --> 00:57:43.010 align:middle line:90%
I find joy in the trees.

00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:45.170 align:middle line:90%
I find joy in the birds.

00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:48.800 align:middle line:84%
I find joy in the butterfly,
and just having people

00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:53.240 align:middle line:84%
here experiencing this
just sacred space.

00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And each day truly is more
joyful and more beautiful.

00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And where we are
right now, I believe,

00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:07.460 align:middle line:84%
is this deeper desire to
express ourselves more fully.

00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:10.160 align:middle line:84%
We have expanded
our consciousness.

00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:14.330 align:middle line:84%
We have expanded our awareness.
d And for most people,

00:58:14.330 --> 00:58:19.040 align:middle line:10%
they're ready to start living
the next chapter of their life,

00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:21.560 align:middle line:10%
and it's an extraordinary one.

00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:25.148 align:middle line:10%
And so what keeps us stuck?

00:58:25.148 --> 00:58:27.440 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's where a
lot of people are right now,

00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:29.850 align:middle line:10%
is there's a lot of
information out there.

00:58:29.850 --> 00:58:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And if you're constantly
seeking out there for it,

00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:35.240 align:middle line:84%
you'll find that people
interpret it differently.

00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:37.670 align:middle line:84%
People are in
different stages of how

00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:41.900 align:middle line:90%
they perceive that wisdom.

00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:47.300 align:middle line:10%
And there's a real balance
of gaining greater awareness

00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:49.910 align:middle line:10%
and consciousness,
and then allowing

00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:53.270 align:middle line:10%
yourself to really live it
and integrate it in your life,

00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:58.760 align:middle line:10%
never giving your power
away to anybody out there.

00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:01.330 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you feel
that alignment.

00:59:01.330 --> 00:59:03.980 align:middle line:84%
Now it might mess with
your belief system.

00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:05.900 align:middle line:90%
That's different.

00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:09.740 align:middle line:84%
That level of feeling a little
uncomfortable is different.

00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:12.470 align:middle line:84%
When you have that little
intuition that says,

00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:15.650 align:middle line:84%
this is right for me, or
this isn't right for me,

00:59:15.650 --> 00:59:18.740 align:middle line:90%
trust that and follow that.

00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:22.730 align:middle line:84%
But intuition, it's not about,
oh, I got this idea year ago,

00:59:22.730 --> 00:59:25.010 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just going
to go with it.

00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Intuition is a thing you
check in with every day

00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:29.450 align:middle line:90%
and every moment, all the time.

00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:31.150 align:middle line:90%
What feels right now?

00:59:31.150 --> 00:59:33.200 align:middle line:84%
We are feeling
beings, so the truth

00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:35.900 align:middle line:84%
is going to come
to us as a feeling.

00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And being present in the moment,
you'll always know by the way

00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:43.340 align:middle line:84%
that you feel, what
your next step is.

00:59:43.340 --> 00:59:46.890 align:middle line:10%
But with all this
information out there,

00:59:46.890 --> 00:59:51.350 align:middle line:10%
sometimes something
that we hear really

00:59:51.350 --> 00:59:56.810 align:middle line:10%
triggers us because we
are remembering something,

00:59:56.810 --> 01:00:01.580 align:middle line:10%
and yet it really messes
with our belief system.

01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:02.780 align:middle line:10%
And that's perfect.

01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:03.580 align:middle line:10%
It's OK.

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:07.550 align:middle line:10%
Let it, because the belief is
going to come to the light,

01:00:07.550 --> 01:00:09.590 align:middle line:10%
and that's what
it's intended to do.

01:00:09.590 --> 01:00:13.370 align:middle line:84%
The difference is, when you
get triggered by something,

01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:15.950 align:middle line:84%
this is where all
of this work, to me,

01:00:15.950 --> 01:00:18.140 align:middle line:84%
really makes a
difference in your life.

01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:20.240 align:middle line:10%
When you become more
conscious and aware,

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:23.490 align:middle line:10%
when you have more
awareness of your own power

01:00:23.490 --> 01:00:26.420 align:middle line:10%
and the ability to just put
some space around yourself,

01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:28.700 align:middle line:10%
sometimes that
extra-dimensional part of you

01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:31.790 align:middle line:10%
is the part of you that can
be so present in the moment

01:00:31.790 --> 01:00:34.150 align:middle line:10%
that you can put some
space around yourself,

01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:37.880 align:middle line:10%
and you can literally
move beyond that feeling

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:40.170 align:middle line:10%
of time and space.

01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:41.480 align:middle line:90%
But time and space--

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:44.210 align:middle line:84%
you're not moving
through time and space.

01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:46.460 align:middle line:84%
Time and space is
moving through you,

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:50.580 align:middle line:84%
and you can let it flow through
you without reacting to it.

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:53.390 align:middle line:10%
And when you find yourself
triggered by something, either

01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:57.600 align:middle line:10%
that you hear, someone
says, or in a relationship,

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:02.600 align:middle line:10%
it's that ability to hold
a compassionate space

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:06.830 align:middle line:10%
for yourself as you
have the courage

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:16.190 align:middle line:10%
to see how this belief has
created the circumstances you

01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:19.670 align:middle line:10%
have in your reality
right now, and why you're

01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:21.470 align:middle line:10%
in the circumstance you're in.

01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:23.330 align:middle line:90%
There's some belief there.

01:01:23.330 --> 01:01:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And people often, I think,
want to jump over that stage

01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:27.410 align:middle line:90%
or skip over that stage.

01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Nobody wants to take
responsibility for the crap

01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:30.920 align:middle line:90%
they're in.

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:34.170 align:middle line:90%
>> And yet it is so liberating.

01:01:34.170 --> 01:01:37.490 align:middle line:84%
It's actually hilarious
and fascinating.

01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And you get to this point
where you're like, oh, wow,

01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:43.370 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing that
for the last 20 years.

01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:47.790 align:middle line:10%
And it's so perfect because
my belief was so strong

01:01:47.790 --> 01:01:49.310 align:middle line:10%
that it had to be
my truth, and I

01:01:49.310 --> 01:01:52.400 align:middle line:10%
had to continue to
attract that to me.

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:55.760 align:middle line:10%
So when we can find that
courage and compassion

01:01:55.760 --> 01:02:00.470 align:middle line:10%
to see those beliefs and allow
them to come to the light,

01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:03.020 align:middle line:10%
and then you, from
your place of being

01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:07.430 align:middle line:10%
a sovereign being in your
power aligned to that master

01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:12.620 align:middle line:10%
that you are, you can
then choose whether--

01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:15.780 align:middle line:10%
for some people, and
I've seen this happen,

01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:18.950 align:middle line:10%
they see how a
belief has kept them

01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:22.520 align:middle line:10%
from releasing a
disease in their body.

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:28.190 align:middle line:10%
The council would say no one
would ever intentionally create

01:02:28.190 --> 01:02:32.420 align:middle line:10%
or manifest disease
or pain or suffering

01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:34.100 align:middle line:10%
or financial devastation.

01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:38.240 align:middle line:84%
We would never consciously,
intentionally create that.

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:44.410 align:middle line:10%
And so oftentimes, we get
stuck in shaming ourself

01:02:44.410 --> 01:02:47.850 align:middle line:10%
for we think we should
have had this figured out,

01:02:47.850 --> 01:02:49.890 align:middle line:10%
or we think we should
be more powerful.

01:02:49.890 --> 01:02:54.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Especially people who have
been on the spiritual path

01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:56.300 align:middle line:10%
doing this work for awhile.

01:02:56.300 --> 01:03:01.640 align:middle line:10%
And they tend to be the
hardest self-judging.

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And shame and guilt are the
heaviest of all emotions that

01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:09.170 align:middle line:90%
we carry.

01:03:09.170 --> 01:03:11.600 align:middle line:84%
That often is what
keeps us in those lower

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:14.070 align:middle line:90%
dimensions of consciousness.

01:03:14.070 --> 01:03:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And so this particular
person had this pain,

01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:21.990 align:middle line:84%
and she really wanted
to get rid of this pain.

01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:26.430 align:middle line:10%
And she did feel a lot of
shame for having it, and guilt.

01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And she had a situation
where a family member came.

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And she couldn't
go see the family

01:03:31.790 --> 01:03:35.570 align:middle line:84%
member because of this pain, and
she was really upset about it.

01:03:35.570 --> 01:03:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And the council said, did
you really, really, really

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:41.710 align:middle line:90%
want to go?

01:03:41.710 --> 01:03:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And after she got to the bottom
of it, she was, like, no,

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:46.250 align:middle line:90%
not really.

01:03:46.250 --> 01:03:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And she realized that the
pain was the thing that

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:54.790 align:middle line:90%
gave her permission to say no.

01:03:54.790 --> 01:03:56.770 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do that.

01:03:56.770 --> 01:04:00.280 align:middle line:10%
It was easy to say I can't
because I have this pain

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:02.260 align:middle line:10%
and I don't feel OK.

01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:03.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Permission slip.

01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:03.990 align:middle line:90%
Excuse.

01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And she really
had this epiphany,

01:04:06.130 --> 01:04:08.800 align:middle line:84%
and it was a beautiful moment
that we all got to be a part

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:11.950 align:middle line:84%
of in my master's class
group, where we saw it.

01:04:11.950 --> 01:04:15.130 align:middle line:10%
We saw the belief, why
it was still there,

01:04:15.130 --> 01:04:18.150 align:middle line:10%
that the pain gave
her permission

01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:23.560 align:middle line:10%
to not do all these things
she felt like she had to do.

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And the council said, do you
believe you have the power

01:04:27.550 --> 01:04:31.870 align:middle line:90%
to say no without it?

01:04:31.870 --> 01:04:34.300 align:middle line:90%
And she said, no, I'm not ready.

01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:35.483 align:middle line:90%
And that's OK.

01:04:35.483 --> 01:04:36.400 align:middle line:90%
>> She's being honest.

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:37.990 align:middle line:90%
>> It's beautiful.

01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:39.670 align:middle line:10%
It's so beautiful.

01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:43.420 align:middle line:10%
And then we began to see
the perfection in it all.

01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:45.490 align:middle line:10%
And there's so many
examples of this,

01:04:45.490 --> 01:04:48.980 align:middle line:10%
and I certainly can
say in my own life,

01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:55.060 align:middle line:10%
it's almost a daily basis where
I become conscious of something

01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:58.060 align:middle line:10%
that is a belief I picked up.

01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And you may still choose to
agree to play by those rules

01:05:03.730 --> 01:05:05.510 align:middle line:90%
and carry that belief.

01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:09.280 align:middle line:84%
But there's something very
empowering and liberating

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:11.200 align:middle line:90%
about being able to see it.

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:15.550 align:middle line:10%
And that, I do believe, takes
compassion, a great amount

01:05:15.550 --> 01:05:21.380 align:middle line:10%
of compassion for yourself, and
not going into self-judgment,

01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:25.610 align:middle line:10%
not going into shame and
blame and feeling guilty,

01:05:25.610 --> 01:05:31.510 align:middle line:10%
and allowing that
to come to the light

01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:33.880 align:middle line:10%
so that it can be
something that you

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:36.430 align:middle line:10%
change if you choose
to do, or rebalance,

01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:38.050 align:middle line:10%
if you choose to do that.

01:05:38.050 --> 01:05:39.850 align:middle line:84%
I think an important
thing I would say

01:05:39.850 --> 01:05:46.280 align:middle line:84%
is when you're on this
path to really discovering

01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:52.470 align:middle line:84%
who you are, or better said,
remembering who you really are,

01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:58.930 align:middle line:84%
everything shows up along the
way, meaning people, resources,

01:05:58.930 --> 01:06:00.520 align:middle line:90%
connections, opportunities.

01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:05.380 align:middle line:10%
But I would not be sitting
here today without the people

01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:09.760 align:middle line:10%
on my path that showed up and
guided me to the next step

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:14.260 align:middle line:10%
or walked with me to the next
town, we think of this journey.

01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And some of those people
are still in my life,

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:20.480 align:middle line:84%
and some of those people
came into my life for a time.

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And I've also seen that
with my journey and people

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:27.100 align:middle line:84%
that I helped them
to a particular step,

01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:28.660 align:middle line:84%
and then they moved
forth from there.

01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:34.480 align:middle line:84%
But when we really know how
guided we are from all sides,

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:38.560 align:middle line:84%
that divine orchestration
is always out ahead of us,

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:40.690 align:middle line:84%
orchestrating things
on our behalf, which

01:06:40.690 --> 01:06:43.930 align:middle line:84%
means putting the right
people in our path,

01:06:43.930 --> 01:06:46.690 align:middle line:84%
putting the right
opportunities in our path,

01:06:46.690 --> 01:06:49.150 align:middle line:84%
putting the resources
there so we always have

01:06:49.150 --> 01:06:51.117 align:middle line:90%
everything we need and more.

to speaking to the council

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:55.225 align:middle line:90%
tomorrow.

01:06:55.225 --> 01:06:56.350 align:middle line:90%
And how do people find you?

01:06:56.350 --> 01:06:57.150 align:middle line:90%
Your website?

01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:01.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect.

01:07:01.450 --> 01:07:02.466 align:middle line:90%
Easy enough.

01:07:02.466 --> 01:07:03.266 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

01:07:03.266 --> 01:07:03.720 align:middle line:90%
Well, thanks, Sara.

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:04.610 align:middle line:90%
This has been awesome.

01:07:04.610 --> 01:07:05.350 align:middle line:90%
Can't wait till tomorrow.

01:07:05.350 --> 01:07:06.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, me, too.

01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:07.246 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:07:07.246 --> 01:07:08.046 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

01:07:08.046 --> 01:07:08.240 align:middle line:90%
Hugs.

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:08.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:09.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:07:09.310 --> 01:07:10.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:11.680 align:middle line:90%
So good,

state of pure love,

your well-being and

You have everything
you need and more.

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:46.720 align:middle line:84%
Everything works out you're
in a state of allowing,

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:49.540 align:middle line:84%
or in a state of
grace, which is being

01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:52.790 align:middle line:90%
open to receive in the moment.

01:07:52.790 --> 01:07:54.850 align:middle line:84%
We are feeling
beings, so the truth

01:07:54.850 --> 01:07:57.550 align:middle line:84%
is going to come
to us as a feeling.

01:07:57.550 --> 01:08:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And being present in the moment,
you'll always know, by the way

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:03.840 align:middle line:84%
that you feel, what
your next step is.

01:08:07.370 --> 01:08:13.350 align:middle line:84%
I think we're here to realize
that greater master within you,

01:08:13.350 --> 01:08:15.530 align:middle line:84%
and then allow your
life to be everything

01:08:15.530 --> 01:08:20.540 align:middle line:84%
you intended it to be,
which is a grand adventure.

01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:21.720 align:middle line:90%
It's a grand adventure.

01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:22.970 align:middle line:90%
And where do you go from here?

01:08:22.970 --> 01:08:24.359 align:middle line:90%
To the next grand adventure.

01:08:24.359 --> 01:08:25.901 align:middle line:84%
And what are we
going to do tomorrow?

01:08:25.901 --> 01:08:29.180 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have the
next grand adventure.

01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:30.990 align:middle line:84%
Where we are right
now, I believe,

01:08:30.990 --> 01:08:35.090 align:middle line:84%
is this deeper
desire to express,

01:08:35.090 --> 01:08:41.119 align:middle line:84%
a deep desire for freedom, the
freedom to be who we really

01:08:41.119 --> 01:08:41.919 align:middle line:90%
are.
