00:00:03.486 --> 00:02:03.200 align:middle line:90%


00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.600 align:middle line:10%
>> Wonderful to be here with
you in these blending moments

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:17.600 align:middle line:10%
to God, to have this opportunity
to explore more of the infinite

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.150 align:middle line:10%
that we all are, more of the
unconditional love that is all

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.080 align:middle line:10%
of our actual nature.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And with this in heart
and mind, in what way

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.064 align:middle line:84%
would you most enjoy
exploring together?

00:02:31.064 --> 00:02:31.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.890 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Ishuwa.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.330 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to ask a few questions.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Very well.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.150 align:middle line:10%
>> First of all, I'd like to
know a little bit more about

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.050 align:middle line:10%
yourself and your civilization.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Very well.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:44.880 align:middle line:90%
I am Ishuwa--

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>> --of the Yahyel civilization.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.950 align:middle line:84%
The idea, then,
in brief brevity--

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.640 align:middle line:84%
your and our civilization
were at one time

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.660 align:middle line:90%
the same one civilization.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.600 align:middle line:84%
There were some in
our world who chose

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.160 align:middle line:84%
to step out into
space to explore

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:16.190 align:middle line:84%
new worlds, new creations,
new evolutions, hybridizations

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.480 align:middle line:90%
of life forms.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.180 align:middle line:90%


00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And some of those who embarked
on that co-creation from

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.700 align:middle line:90%
our civilization--

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:35.000 align:middle line:84%
they, over eons and eons
of your time in a sense,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.770 align:middle line:84%
through the blending,
through the hybridization,

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.050 align:middle line:84%
through the evolving
with other civilizations,

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.770 align:middle line:84%
some quite different
than ours, but human.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:56.220 align:middle line:84%
Yes-- have evolved and become
your Earth human civilization.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.160 align:middle line:84%
So you do-- as the channel was
mentioning earlier, you do--

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.450 align:middle line:84%
each of you on Earth, even the
DNA of your human biology--

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.510 align:middle line:84%
all of you without
exception born here on Earth

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:15.750 align:middle line:84%
have DNA that is then very
much that of our civilization,

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.620 align:middle line:84%
the one in which
you, in a sense,

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.550 align:middle line:84%
were a part of before
the time of stepping out

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:28.980 align:middle line:84%
into space to explore, to
create new hybrid worlds.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.380 align:middle line:90%
So in that sense, we are family.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.860 align:middle line:90%
We are human as you are.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.050 align:middle line:84%
There are variations in our
physical appearance from those

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.420 align:middle line:90%
of you and your world.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.160 align:middle line:90%
We could walk amongst you.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And the variations wouldn't
make you think necessarily we

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.210 align:middle line:84%
were from another
world, perhaps just

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.220 align:middle line:84%
from a different part
of your world you aren't

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.940 align:middle line:90%
familiar with in that way.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.140 align:middle line:84%
We are very different in our
vibration, our consciousness,

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.180 align:middle line:90%
our sense of who we are.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.610 align:middle line:84%
Our knowingness of
existence is quite different

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.390 align:middle line:84%
than that you have in
your world that is tiny.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.870 align:middle line:84%
We all know in that
sense who we are.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:24.370 align:middle line:84%
We all support one
another in all moments

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.170 align:middle line:84%
without hesitation,
without question.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:34.390 align:middle line:84%
We are then supported by
ourself and by all others

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:40.210 align:middle line:84%
in our civilization at all
times without hesitation.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.450 align:middle line:90%
This is a wonderful--

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.380 align:middle line:84%
a wonderment, a wondrous
experience for us

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.600 align:middle line:90%
to be a part of.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.660 align:middle line:84%
This simply is the way
we have chosen to create

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.010 align:middle line:90%
our experience together.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:59.740 align:middle line:84%
So it is no less or greater than
that in your world's choices

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.600 align:middle line:84%
to choose as you
have been doing,

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.120 align:middle line:84%
to be somewhat separate
from the awareness

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.370 align:middle line:90%
of your actual nature.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.380 align:middle line:90%
So the idea then--

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:13.090 align:middle line:84%
I have been exploring
and traveling

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:20.080 align:middle line:84%
through what you might think
of as timelines, what you might

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.340 align:middle line:84%
think of as for a very
long time in terms

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:29.320 align:middle line:84%
of how you perceive years in
past, present, and future.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.340 align:middle line:84%
But it isn't all that
long in my experiencing,

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.970 align:middle line:84%
for I am able, as many of us
are, to move about in time--

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.510 align:middle line:84%
past, present, and
future at rates

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:48.850 align:middle line:84%
that don't then take as long
as you might think they would.

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And in doing this
type of exploration,

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.720 align:middle line:84%
it allows me to experience
extraterrestrial civilizations

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:01.660 align:middle line:84%
from a variety of choices
in terms of who they choose

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.590 align:middle line:84%
to be as individuals, as
a society, how they choose

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.140 align:middle line:84%
to interact with
other civilizations

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.930 align:middle line:84%
in their own worlds
and on other planets,

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.870 align:middle line:90%
in other solar systems.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.870 align:middle line:84%
This, then, for
me is a great joy

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:21.100 align:middle line:84%
to explore, and experience, and
learn from other civilizations,

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.670 align:middle line:84%
other extraterrestrial
beings, other worlds,

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:29.380 align:middle line:84%
other ways of life, other forms
of experiencing the infinite,

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:34.120 align:middle line:84%
that we all are unconditional
love, that we all are.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:40.060 align:middle line:84%
This is of great excitement and
fulfillment for me to do this.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:46.810 align:middle line:84%
I, in doing this, have developed
the type of translation ability

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:50.290 align:middle line:84%
that affords me the
ability then to speak

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:54.010 align:middle line:84%
with a variety of
extraterrestrial civilizations

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:57.640 align:middle line:84%
in a language they
can understand.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.370 align:middle line:84%
It is as though
I am a translator

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:03.040 align:middle line:84%
in a sense for several
extraterrestrial worlds,

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:08.440 align:middle line:84%
civilizations,
beings, life forms.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:13.120 align:middle line:84%
These are some, then, of the
activities and functions for me

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.970 align:middle line:84%
that are fulfilling,
that are a part of who

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:21.130 align:middle line:84%
I enjoy experiencing and sharing
with others in other worlds

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:25.390 align:middle line:84%
and in my own
Yahyel civilization.

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:27.790 align:middle line:84%
It is always a great
joy to have opportunity

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:30.970 align:middle line:84%
to interact in that,
then in your civilization

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:36.100 align:middle line:84%
to share and interact with
those of your human experience

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.460 align:middle line:84%
in your current
timeline, which is always

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:43.000 align:middle line:90%
changing in every moment.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.260 align:middle line:84%
There's a great joy for me to
be able to interact with you.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:53.160 align:middle line:84%
So that is a little about me
and the Yahyel civilization.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.230 align:middle line:84%
Did you have more around
that-- you wanted to ask about?

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:59.920 align:middle line:84%
Or was there another direction
you would like to explore?

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>> A few more questions
in regard to this.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:06.760 align:middle line:84%
For when-- for interacting
with other civilizations,

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:07.930 align:middle line:90%
do you also--

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:11.200 align:middle line:84%
do they also have the same
type of channeling mechanisms

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.800 align:middle line:84%
that we are using in
this case and other--

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.650 align:middle line:84%
we're interacting with
other civilizations?

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Specifically, my series
that I'm doing here

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:25.870 align:middle line:84%
is utilizing the channeling
mechanism or techniques to--

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Some other
civilizations do this.

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:38.920 align:middle line:84%
It is part, in a sense, of
human biological ability.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.560 align:middle line:84%
There are different
ways that the channeling

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:46.090 align:middle line:84%
can be done than
what you are most

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:49.300 align:middle line:90%
familiar with experiencing.

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:54.760 align:middle line:84%
But those will be
more evident in time

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:59.440 align:middle line:84%
as those types of channeling
capacities unveil themself

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.530 align:middle line:84%
in your world's
experiencing of them.

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:04.780 align:middle line:84%
There are then
other civilizations

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:09.710 align:middle line:84%
that simply choose not to
interact in that capacity.

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:10.570 align:middle line:90%
>> What would be--

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:13.030 align:middle line:84%
if it's OK to
share, what would be

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:16.000 align:middle line:90%
some of the other capacities?

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Some do not speak at all.

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:22.140 align:middle line:84%
Some are entirely, let's
say, telepathic in a sense.

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.390 align:middle line:90%
Some do not do that at all.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:28.330 align:middle line:90%
Some are very vocal.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:33.930 align:middle line:84%
They are very behavioral
in their communication.

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:39.940 align:middle line:84%
It is then to learn what their
behavior is communicating

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.660 align:middle line:90%
in a sense.

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.580 align:middle line:84%
That then is a very different
type of communication.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.280 align:middle line:84%
It isn't necessarily
as specific as words

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:54.120 align:middle line:84%
in telepathic
communication can be.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:58.290 align:middle line:84%
In those types of trends,
actions, interactions,

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:02.820 align:middle line:84%
communications with those
behavioral communicators--

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:09.870 align:middle line:84%
it can-- at first, interactions
seem that the information

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:11.040 align:middle line:90%
is very vague.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Not much one can learn from
that type of interaction.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:19.050 align:middle line:84%
However, giving it time,
behavioral communication

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:21.870 align:middle line:84%
can be a little bit
like those in your world

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:24.060 align:middle line:90%
who do sign language.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And so it can get to be very
useful, very meaningful, very

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:34.530 align:middle line:84%
fulfilling in levels of
great depth, and detail,

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:38.460 align:middle line:90%
and interlayerment in a sense.

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And so that is-- another type
of communication or channeling

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:46.020 align:middle line:90%
isn't really taking place--

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.300 align:middle line:90%
behavioral communication.

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:52.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Almost like how we interact
with some animal species--

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:53.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:54.250 align:middle line:10%
>> --on our planet.

00:11:54.250 --> 00:12:00.510 align:middle line:10%
>> And there are then-- many of
your animals do more of this.

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:02.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Specific, like
dolphins and apes?

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And some people have
telepathic communication

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:06.930 align:middle line:90%
with these animals, but--

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:08.910 align:middle line:84%
>> They can with
themselves as well.

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:10.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:10.860 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:11.790 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:12.660 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:18.000 align:middle line:84%
Is there any sort of technology,
how we understand in our world

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.280 align:middle line:84%
with electronics,
AI, and gadgets?

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.770 align:middle line:84%
Is there any kind of
gadget communication

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:30.000 align:middle line:84%
with other civilizations
through your civilization?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.640 align:middle line:90%
Or is it more biological?

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>> We do have some artificial
constructs that in that sense

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:38.220 align:middle line:90%
convey communication.

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:41.730 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:45.150 align:middle line:10%
For us humans as
we're moving along

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:50.910 align:middle line:10%
this path of interacting
with our star

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:56.820 align:middle line:10%
families, our cosmic
families such as yours,

00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:01.380 align:middle line:10%
we recently had in our
collective consciousness--

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:04.710 align:middle line:10%
the US government had made--

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:07.920 align:middle line:10%
brought to the awareness--

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:14.730 align:middle line:10%
programs of studying UFOs and
not fully announcing the UFO ET

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:17.190 align:middle line:10%
presence, but sort of
coming close to sort of seed

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:18.780 align:middle line:10%
the collective.

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:21.180 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to ask how you--

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:24.450 align:middle line:10%
from your perspective,
how you guys

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:30.180 align:middle line:10%
see this energy or
this news affecting--

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.850 align:middle line:10%
>> It can facilitate
more of those

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:35.610 align:middle line:10%
in your world's willingness
to accept this idea

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:39.155 align:middle line:10%
of extraterrestrial reality.

00:13:39.155 --> 00:13:40.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Has it sped timelines up?

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:41.640 align:middle line:90%
Or is it early?

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:42.440 align:middle line:90%
>> It can.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.670 align:middle line:84%
Yes, jump a little bit
ahead, so to speak--

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:45.010 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:45.320 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.960 align:middle line:84%
>> --in the way
that is supported,

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.250 align:middle line:90%
so it can still be appropriate.

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:51.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:55.960 align:middle line:84%
Many, many people on our
planet say it's not enough.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.630 align:middle line:90%
They need to disclose more.

00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:04.230 align:middle line:84%
>> It has to come from within
the individuals more, really.

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And then they can
feel more comfortable,

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:12.120 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, within
what they are sharing.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:16.960 align:middle line:84%
They don't fully understand
it themself at this point,

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.200 align:middle line:84%
even though the understanding
is contained within all

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.720 align:middle line:90%
of your DNA in a sense.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Not many of you have
accessed to it yet,

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:31.470 align:middle line:90%
acknowledged its existence yet.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>> If it were to
happen too fast,

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.590 align:middle line:84%
it would almost be
counterproductive.

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:40.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it is happening on a
very organic rate in a sense,

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:47.080 align:middle line:84%
just as the seed grows into a
tree produces branches, leaves,

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:53.610 align:middle line:84%
flowers, and fruit, but then
ripens in its appropriate--

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:58.140 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, organic
timing in its source.

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
factors involved

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:12.270 align:middle line:84%
in facilitating alignment
with your civilizations,

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:18.270 align:middle line:84%
aligning in alignment
with an organic unfoldment

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:21.660 align:middle line:84%
as though you're awakening
to this ET reality

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:25.440 align:middle line:84%
is coming through as though
it had come out of a seed

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.260 align:middle line:84%
and is growing,
surfacing, breaking

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:32.610 align:middle line:84%
the surface of the soil,
seeing the sunlight--

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:35.520 align:middle line:90%
the light of day in a sense.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense,
that is about as far

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:42.960 align:middle line:84%
as you've gotten in this analogy
with your growth at this point.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:47.890 align:middle line:84%
Beginning to break the
surface, the seed of a plant,

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:53.850 align:middle line:84%
the tinder growth process
is occurring at that level

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:56.990 align:middle line:90%
in this analogy in this sense.

00:15:56.990 --> 00:16:01.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, usually
when we plant seeds,

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.570 align:middle line:84%
before it sprouts out of the
ground is the longest time.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:07.080 align:middle line:84%
But once it starts to
sprout, it comes very fast,

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:10.140 align:middle line:90%
so hopefully, that's the case.

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>> And in a sense, as
more of you embrace this,

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.730 align:middle line:84%
you are like the sun
giving light to this,

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:20.370 align:middle line:84%
that it may grow even faster,
but all the while in its own

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:22.830 align:middle line:90%
appropriate rate.

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:26.160 align:middle line:84%
It will not grow
faster than it can.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.950 align:middle line:84%
There are times in
your plant world.

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:33.210 align:middle line:84%
There are those who
might try and accelerate

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:35.460 align:middle line:84%
the rate of growth of
a particular plant,

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:39.660 align:middle line:84%
experimenting with it
or not knowing, simply

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:43.970 align:middle line:84%
wanting to see if they can
kick it into gear faster.

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And there are then those in
your world who do at times

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:51.930 align:middle line:84%
and will continue to try and
accelerate the rate to even try

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:55.890 align:middle line:84%
and genetically alter it in
a sense to be something other

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:59.550 align:middle line:84%
than that which
they might perceive

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:03.420 align:middle line:84%
it would be if it were allowed
to grow into its own tree

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:06.250 align:middle line:84%
and create its own
fruit in a sense.

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:09.599 align:middle line:84%
So there are some who would have
an idea to try and genetically

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:12.270 align:middle line:90%
alter the outcome.

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Again, there are
many forces, factors,

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:19.740 align:middle line:84%
beings of high intelligence
within the one that

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.890 align:middle line:84%
has the all-- that are
very focused here with all

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:28.230 align:middle line:84%
that are in our interacting
in this exchange of unfoldment

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:34.800 align:middle line:84%
of these co-created realities to
facilitate an alignment of how

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.860 align:middle line:90%
it unfolds in a sense.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And so that what is the
final and in a sense result--

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:53.790 align:middle line:84%
the fruit is very ripe for all
involved human beings on Earth,

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:56.670 align:middle line:84%
human beings and
our civilization,

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:59.800 align:middle line:90%
others who facilitate this.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:03.330 align:middle line:84%
For there are many that
are part of the one

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:08.412 align:middle line:84%
that we and you
all are one with.

00:18:08.412 --> 00:18:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>> So many factors that we
maybe can't quite understand.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:15.060 align:middle line:90%
So we should just--

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.100 align:middle line:90%
>> You can open--

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.870 align:middle line:84%
invite to learn
more about them--

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:20.850 align:middle line:90%
won't need to know all of them.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:24.975 align:middle line:84%
Some will be very
helpful to learn about.

00:18:24.975 --> 00:18:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, some very
exciting to know about.

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:31.370 align:middle line:84%
Some that you can, in a sense,
stand beside and grow and learn

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:34.460 align:middle line:84%
from and with and
share what you know,

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:38.690 align:middle line:84%
that they may learn from
you as well in a sense.

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, these interactions
are quite informative.

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:44.570 align:middle line:90%
So this is one way, I suppose.

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:47.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Certainly.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.530 align:middle line:90%
>> You described earlier.

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:51.620 align:middle line:10%
You described your
civilization's

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:54.350 align:middle line:10%
physical appearance
and maybe being

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:56.195 align:middle line:10%
quite similar to us humans.

00:18:56.195 --> 00:18:58.710 align:middle line:90%


00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:01.760 align:middle line:10%
The human physical appearance
is so wide in its spectrum

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.430 align:middle line:10%
from different nationalities--

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:09.320 align:middle line:10%
Asian, African, Spanish.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.330 align:middle line:90%
We have such a wide variety.

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Is there such a variety
in your civilization?

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:16.760 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a variety
potentially as wide,

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:20.480 align:middle line:90%
but generally not as wide.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.410 align:middle line:84%
But the potential is within
the genetic framework.

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:27.265 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see.

00:19:27.265 --> 00:19:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Currently, right
now-- and I know

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:32.720 align:middle line:84%
time is always changing, and
timelines, and everything else.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Right now, your civilization--
what genetic makeup

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.130 align:middle line:84%
would be closest
in our reference

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:45.290 align:middle line:84%
points of nationalities
and different types

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:46.950 align:middle line:90%
of people on our planet?

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:52.310 align:middle line:84%
What would be more a
closer description,

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:54.610 align:middle line:90%
if that's possible?

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:55.625 align:middle line:90%
Or is that too specific?

00:19:55.625 --> 00:20:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>> We can mirror, given
the characteristics

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:12.190 align:middle line:84%
of our physiology to those in
your civilization at this time.

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:13.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:18.310 align:middle line:90%
And when we talk of--

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:19.640 align:middle line:90%
part of my series--

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:23.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm sort of creating a library.

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And I know categorizing things
is a very human, linear way

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:27.970 align:middle line:90%
of doing things.

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:29.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Earth human.

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:30.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Earth humans.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:30.800 align:middle line:90%
Oh, Earth humans.

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.620 align:middle line:84%
Yes, so our future
selves probably

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.750 align:middle line:90%
don't go do it as much.

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:40.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Perhaps some will continue,
but not all, perhaps.

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:43.190 align:middle line:84%
We'll find it
enjoyable to do that.

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:43.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:45.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm having a good time.

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:47.360 align:middle line:90%
It's nice to--

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Understood.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:48.980 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, to understand these
different energies and--

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:52.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Certainly.

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>> --different beings.

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:56.600 align:middle line:84%
So with the help
of others, we've

00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:02.060 align:middle line:84%
sort of created this idea
of densities and dimensions

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And would there be a
density level that we

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.680 align:middle line:90%
could classify Ishuwa in his--

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Fourth, fifth,
and sixth, primarily,

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:14.520 align:middle line:84%
in interacting with your
civilization at this timing.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:18.380 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so for-- my understanding
from that would be very close

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:22.565 align:middle line:84%
to an almost non-physical being,
but still having a physicality,

00:21:22.565 --> 00:21:23.690 align:middle line:90%
but close in the evolution.

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:26.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Different than vibration
of your physiology.

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:31.120 align:middle line:84%
Yes, physical for me, all the
same in my vibratory world.

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:35.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And in that sense, you can
easily adapt to our likeness.

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Or other beings have of a lower
density, I guess it would be,

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:46.070 align:middle line:84%
or any density, really,
to adapt your physicality.

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Is that sort of when you
say you are mirroring?

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>> There are those who
are similar in physical

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:56.450 align:middle line:84%
characteristics in our world
to those in your world,

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:58.020 align:middle line:90%
mirroring in that sense.

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.170 align:middle line:10%
So those from Asia--

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:03.530 align:middle line:10%
we have some in our
world similar to that.

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:06.960 align:middle line:84%
They would then mirror one
another in that respect.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:10.440 align:middle line:84%
If they were in the
presence of one another,

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.500 align:middle line:84%
they would mirror one
another in that way.

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:13.300 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:16.070 align:middle line:84%
>> There are those in
your South America,

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:20.210 align:middle line:84%
in your continent of Africa,
in your North America,

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:22.910 align:middle line:90%
in your European continents.

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:26.570 align:middle line:84%
We have those in our
world-- would mirror those

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:30.320 align:middle line:84%
of your Earth humans in
those regions as well--

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>> --that the
mirroring is the idea.

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:33.790 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:34.590 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:35.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Similar.

00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:40.170 align:middle line:84%
>> From other information, we've
heard a lot about the Yahyel

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:42.350 align:middle line:90%
civilization having--

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:47.360 align:middle line:84%
or being the offspring of humans
and the Zeta Reticuli beings.

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Is there a relationship
with what humans

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:55.880 align:middle line:90%
know as Grays or Zeta beings?

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:59.582 align:middle line:90%
>> To my civilization?

00:22:59.582 --> 00:23:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, to the
Yahyel civilization.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:03.730 align:middle line:84%
>> There are some of
our DNA within that,

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:06.200 align:middle line:90%
that you would think of as Zeta.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.290 align:middle line:84%
Or there is, then,
as noted in the--

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:12.450 align:middle line:84%
every human on
Earth contains DNA

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:17.770 align:middle line:84%
from the time we and you
are of our civilization.

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:19.680 align:middle line:90%
So they then--

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Zeta have their own experience,
their own history, herstory,

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:27.960 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want
to think of it.

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:30.960 align:middle line:90%
That is in that sense created--

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:34.950 align:middle line:84%
very unique characterizations
and experience,

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:44.670 align:middle line:84%
realizing that produces a
great deal of individuation

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:49.620 align:middle line:84%
culturally, contextually,
consciously,

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:53.940 align:middle line:84%
relative to the
Yahyel civilization

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:59.010 align:middle line:84%
that I am a part of, that
some of their DNA in a sense

00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:01.560 align:middle line:90%
derived from in a sense.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:05.510 align:middle line:90%


00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:08.330 align:middle line:90%
Is that understandable for you?

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:11.406 align:middle line:84%
>> A little confusing, but I'm
sure maybe down the road it

00:24:11.406 --> 00:24:12.206 align:middle line:90%
will.

00:24:12.206 --> 00:24:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>> They are not Yahyel Zetas.

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:15.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:16.180 align:middle line:90%
That clears.

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:16.980 align:middle line:90%
That helps.

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:20.810 align:middle line:84%
>> They contain some DNA
from my civilization,

00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:23.900 align:middle line:90%
just as Earth humans do.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So they have their
own hybrid programs?

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>> They have DNA from
other civilizations--

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.260 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:36.515 align:middle line:84%
>> --different even from
your Earth human DNA,

00:24:36.515 --> 00:24:40.760 align:middle line:84%
for you have DNA from more
than one other extraterrestrial

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.140 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:45.380 align:middle line:84%
All Earth humans
have more than one

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:49.820 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial civilization
within their DNA.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:51.710 align:middle line:90%
Zeta is different.

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:52.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, Zetas.

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:57.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Different combination and
different hybridization of DNA

00:24:57.110 --> 00:25:01.220 align:middle line:84%
coming from different
extraterrestrial civilizations.

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:05.990 align:middle line:84%
They are different to us and
yet, they can contain some.

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:10.850 align:middle line:84%
Not necessarily all of them
contain some of our DNA.

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:14.000 align:middle line:90%
They have varieties as well--

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.080 align:middle line:90%
hybrid.

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:22.870 align:middle line:84%
They have moved out and
have some variation as well.

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:27.710 align:middle line:10%
>> So many people have talked
about interactions with

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:30.020 align:middle line:10%
their hybrid children.

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:34.100 align:middle line:10%
And they talk in the sense
of their understanding

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:39.450 align:middle line:10%
that their children
are Zeta human hybrids.

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:41.690 align:middle line:90%
>> They can be.

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:42.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Are there.

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:43.930 align:middle line:90%
Yahyel human hybrids?

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:44.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>> The Yahyel and
the Earth humans--

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:54.060 align:middle line:84%
one civilization
that is, in a sense,

00:25:54.060 --> 00:26:00.980 align:middle line:84%
being co-created from our and
your collective consciousness

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:05.930 align:middle line:84%
through choice or in your
collective conscious level,

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:10.610 align:middle line:84%
super-conscious levels,
choosing to co-create--

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:15.770 align:middle line:90%
Yauaney civilization.

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:16.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yauaney.

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:19.190 align:middle line:90%
>> The Yauaney.

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:24.000 align:middle line:84%
Some Earth humans have hybrids
in a sense that are Yauaney.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.320 align:middle line:90%


00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>> So would that be what
collectively we're starting

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:34.565 align:middle line:84%
to understand-- the
hybrid children?

00:26:34.565 --> 00:26:37.400 align:middle line:90%


00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.400 align:middle line:84%
Would that be a
name of this race?

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.790 align:middle line:90%
The Yauaney would be our--

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:46.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Some of them are Yauaney

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:47.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yauaney.

00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:49.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yauaney.

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:50.480 align:middle line:90%
Some are.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.040 align:middle line:90%
Not all are.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:57.590 align:middle line:84%
There are then Earth
humans who have connections

00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:02.570 align:middle line:84%
to extraterrestrials
from other civilizations,

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:05.440 align:middle line:84%
interacting with
them in various ways.

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And then they can have
created some hybrid children

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:12.020 align:middle line:84%
with those extraterrestrial
civilizations.

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:16.100 align:middle line:84%
So we are not the only one
interacting with Earth humans

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:17.635 align:middle line:90%
at this time.

00:27:17.635 --> 00:27:19.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Not just Zetas,
not just Yahyel.

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:20.510 align:middle line:90%
But we have Pleiadians.

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:22.100 align:middle line:90%
We have Dracos.

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:25.160 align:middle line:90%
We have Octarians.

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:30.560 align:middle line:84%
We have a whole big cosmic
family and lots of offspring

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:31.650 align:middle line:90%
from that at some point.

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:32.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Family.

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:34.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Galactic family.

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Yes, a variety of hybrid
children are a part of this.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.750 align:middle line:10%
>> Do these children
play together--

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:47.990 align:middle line:10%
different races,
different offsprings

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:50.750 align:middle line:10%
from different cosmic--

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:53.100 align:middle line:10%
>> This can and does occur.

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:54.330 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:55.130 align:middle line:90%
Does it--

00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:57.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Not to say that they are
all aware of one another

00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:58.460 align:middle line:90%
necessarily.

00:27:58.460 --> 00:27:59.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:03.650 align:middle line:84%
It said that the
Phoenix Lights--

00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:08.560 align:middle line:84%
the big ship that sort of
flew over Phoenix, Arizona--

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:09.420 align:middle line:90%
>> A variety.

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:10.910 align:middle line:90%
Yes, there were more than one.

00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:11.710 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:13.096 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:28:13.096 --> 00:28:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was in 1997--
was sort of the big one.

00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:18.510 align:middle line:90%
And it continues to happen.

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:19.343 align:middle line:90%
I know there was a--

00:28:19.343 --> 00:28:21.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Very powerful visual contact.

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:22.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:23.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:24.640 align:middle line:90%
In a boomerang shape, isn't it?

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:25.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.750 align:middle line:90%
And a visual contact occurred.

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>> And is this
Yahyel civilization?

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Primarily, this was
of our co-creation with

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.690 align:middle line:84%
your civilization, although
we were not alone in terms

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:41.740 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
civilizations.

00:28:41.740 --> 00:29:03.580 align:middle line:84%
But it was primarily our
civilization bringing a larger

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:10.060 align:middle line:84%
input into your awareness
on a conscious level

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:15.820 align:middle line:84%
of our existence at
a time and in a way

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:21.940 align:middle line:84%
that on a super-conscious level,
your civilization knew about

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:26.800 align:middle line:84%
in advance, agreed to,
co-created, understood,

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:30.610 align:middle line:84%
understands, can see
what is occurring--

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:36.970 align:middle line:84%
past, present, future
timelines and understands

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:48.160 align:middle line:84%
the powerful, beneficial
results and grow in positive,

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:52.360 align:middle line:84%
nurturing ways for all
involved in that choice

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:56.800 align:middle line:84%
to have that come out,
come through, evolve,

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.160 align:middle line:90%
develop in that way.

00:29:59.160 --> 00:29:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:03.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, it still is
a large imprint

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:05.290 align:middle line:84%
on the collective
consciousness and continues

00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:07.696 align:middle line:90%
to expand, so thank you.

00:30:07.696 --> 00:30:09.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And there were others before,
perhaps not as highlighted.

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.330 align:middle line:90%
There were others since.

00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And there will be a variety
of other ones coming.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:25.510 align:middle line:90%
The light forms will vary.

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:28.930 align:middle line:84%
At times, they will not
seem to come from a craft.

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:32.290 align:middle line:84%
They will seem to be
very organic in form,

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:36.790 align:middle line:84%
and shape, and coloration
as though they are phenomena

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:38.995 align:middle line:90%
of space and time itself.

00:30:38.995 --> 00:30:41.820 align:middle line:90%


00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:44.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:46.630 align:middle line:10%
Would you be able to name some
of these other civilizations

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:48.460 align:middle line:10%
that you work with closely?

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:52.210 align:middle line:84%
>> They are those you are most
familiar with at this time

00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:58.430 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the ones that
are to focus and be aware of.

00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:59.350 align:middle line:90%
There are others.

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Yes, but not to come
through at this time,

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:06.130 align:middle line:84%
simply because you will then,
through your own mechanisms,

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:08.830 align:middle line:84%
begin focusing and
expanding your focus

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:16.570 align:middle line:84%
when truly focusing your focus
will bring greater connection

00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:22.630 align:middle line:84%
in a more heartfelt,
intelligent way,

00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:34.480 align:middle line:84%
allowing for clarity through
simplification, focus.

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:37.330 align:middle line:90%
Pleiadians-- yes.

00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:46.130 align:middle line:84%
There are certainly a variety
of Pleiadian civilizations

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:58.960 align:middle line:84%
that have a very close contact
conversing, communication,

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:03.206 align:middle line:84%
co-creation, interrelation
with our civilization.

00:32:03.206 --> 00:32:06.290 align:middle line:90%


00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:09.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you also share DNA from
the Pleiadian civilization

00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:10.580 align:middle line:90%
as we do?

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:14.750 align:middle line:90%
>> There are-- yes.

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:17.670 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, there
is no end to this.

00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:19.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it just goes forever.

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Learning which then will
be most applicable for you

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:29.210 align:middle line:84%
in unfolding a future and a
present that you most enjoy

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:33.920 align:middle line:84%
fulfillingly, will then
provide the greatest excitement

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.950 align:middle line:90%
for you.

00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:40.100 align:middle line:84%
Understand, then, to know
that there are in a sense

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:47.030 align:middle line:84%
no end to the numbers to
suggest that it is not finite,

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:55.280 align:middle line:84%
perhaps allows you to focus more
on a finite number of them--

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Kind of like--

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:59.000 align:middle line:84%
>> --to know that there
are an infinite number.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And in this physical
embodiment, your awareness

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:07.640 align:middle line:84%
will not truly embody all of
the infinite number of them

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:09.820 align:middle line:90%
nor need it do so.

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:12.790 align:middle line:90%


00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:16.500 align:middle line:84%
Allow, then, to focus,
to know the ones that are

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:19.540 align:middle line:90%
of greatest heartfelt support.

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:24.880 align:middle line:84%
We'll find you as you open
up and focus on those.

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:28.790 align:middle line:84%
But reaching out to uncover
new ones can be a joy to do.

00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:29.870 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>> You do not let go of that
explorative joys if it is a joy

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:40.780 align:middle line:90%
for you to do that.

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:42.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it is definitely a joy.

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:45.970 align:middle line:90%
It's so expansive into--

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>> It will guide you beyond
that which you are aware or have

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:53.680 align:middle line:84%
heard of in terms of trying to
create a family tree of sorts

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:58.720 align:middle line:84%
or a point of origination, for
the point changes as you learn

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:02.260 align:middle line:84%
of the next one and then changes
as you learn over the next one.

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that seems to be the
case, and that's exciting.

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:07.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, understand.

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:08.600 align:middle line:90%
>> That's fun.

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.690 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot of fun.

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:16.179 align:middle line:10%
How would you describe
from your perspective

00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:19.280 align:middle line:10%
the angelic realms that we
consider on our Earth plane?

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:22.420 align:middle line:84%
>> There are non-physical
beings that support Earth humans

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:23.980 align:middle line:90%
in your life here.

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:27.100 align:middle line:84%
They can be thought
of as angelic beings.

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:31.870 align:middle line:84%
There are extraterrestrials who
are in the physical form who

00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:33.870 align:middle line:90%
support Earth Humans.

00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And Earth humans might not
be aware of this coming

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:40.480 align:middle line:84%
from physical extraterrestrials
and might then

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.850 align:middle line:84%
define their experience
and communications

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:51.489 align:middle line:84%
as coming from angels
or spirit guides.

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:55.300 align:middle line:84%
So an extraterrestrial could be
for someone on Earth, thought

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:58.630 align:middle line:84%
of as an angel or
a spirit guide,

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:02.260 align:middle line:84%
even though they are physical,
all the while then being

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:06.490 align:middle line:84%
some angels and spirit guides
for an Earth human's experience

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:10.270 align:middle line:84%
are non-physical
consciousnesses.

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:16.280 align:middle line:84%
So it comes down to, then,
which a person is connecting to,

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:20.500 align:middle line:84%
to decide or determine,
is it a non-physical

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:25.390 align:middle line:84%
or a physical being that they
are defining or experiencing

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:29.950 align:middle line:84%
as an angel, or a spirit
guide, or communication

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:33.870 align:middle line:90%
with extraterrestrial?

00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:37.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And in your realm where
you exist, do you work with--

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:40.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm assuming you work
as we do with a lot

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:42.740 align:middle line:90%
of these non-physical energies.

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, there are a variety of
non-physical consciousnesses

00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:52.980 align:middle line:84%
that support the matrix in a
sense, the physical experience,

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:56.820 align:middle line:90%
the experience of physicality.

00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:01.800 align:middle line:84%
There are a variety of
consciousnesses interacting

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:05.850 align:middle line:84%
that allow for
the way we and you

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:09.820 align:middle line:84%
are experiencing
physicality, that which

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:16.440 align:middle line:84%
holds what you experience as
time and space in a sense,

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:18.780 align:middle line:90%
in a physical spectrum.

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:24.210 align:middle line:84%
There are consciousnesses
that are involved

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:31.308 align:middle line:84%
in this that have evolved to
be more focused and doing that,

00:36:31.308 --> 00:36:35.100 align:middle line:84%
that are in a sense,
born to do that,

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:37.920 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, gifted
at doing that.

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:46.590 align:middle line:84%
It is their joy in a sense to
be that support to live life,

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:50.870 align:middle line:84%
almost as if they are
the substance that

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:55.510 align:middle line:84%
holds the physical experience
of your life together.

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:57.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:57.530 --> 00:36:59.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Conscious being.

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:04.700 align:middle line:84%
So even, for example,
a peach or an apple--

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:08.990 align:middle line:84%
physical item you
experience contains

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:12.200 align:middle line:90%
some of these conscious beings.

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:16.230 align:middle line:90%


00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:19.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And this goes back to what
Shaun and I were talking about

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:20.030 align:middle line:90%
earlier.

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:21.630 align:middle line:84%
When we consume these
consciousnesses,

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:26.310 align:middle line:90%
we're putting in what--

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:28.960 align:middle line:84%
what you put out is
what you get back.

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:29.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, what you put
in, what you put out

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:37.620 align:middle line:84%
is what you get
back or live within.

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>> So having awareness of
what types of consciousness we

00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:47.080 align:middle line:84%
consume can help us in
our external reality?

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:52.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it is conscious
energies and entities, beings,

00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:57.000 align:middle line:84%
lifeforms that you are consuming
in the food that you are

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.790 align:middle line:84%
consuming or the chemistry
that you are consuming that is

00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:06.000 align:middle line:84%
interblended with someone from
the foods or many of the foods

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.620 align:middle line:84%
that are constructed at this
time that many people on Earth

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:14.700 align:middle line:84%
are eating, construction
of synthetic and chemical

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:20.590 align:middle line:84%
consciousnesses with other types
of organic consciousnesses.

00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'm assuming
the constructor--

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:27.660 align:middle line:84%
the cook, the preparer
of these foods

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:29.905 align:middle line:84%
also puts in their own
consciousnesses in the mix.

00:38:29.905 --> 00:38:30.780 align:middle line:90%
And then it becomes--

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:31.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Certainly.

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:32.080 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:34.308 align:middle line:90%
>> --a consciousness soup--

00:38:34.308 --> 00:38:35.256 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:38:35.256 --> 00:38:37.890 align:middle line:84%
>> --and can become quite
tasty if you have a good one.

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:39.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Very much so.

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:40.620 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:42.810 align:middle line:84%
So what we're enjoying
is not just the taste,

00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:45.720 align:middle line:84%
but we're also enjoying all the
other different consciousnesses

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:49.590 align:middle line:84%
that are-- go into that making
of this wonderful creation we

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:51.030 align:middle line:90%
call like an apple pie or--

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:52.560 align:middle line:90%
>> That can play a part in it.

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:55.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful.

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:58.015 align:middle line:90%
So you interact with--

00:38:58.015 --> 00:38:59.640 align:middle line:84%
many of these
civilizations have talked

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:03.810 align:middle line:84%
about a council of worlds,
a sort of federation,

00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:05.040 align:middle line:90%
a galactic federation.

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:07.950 align:middle line:90%
There's many titles for this.

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:10.560 align:middle line:90%
Are you part of one?

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:11.940 align:middle line:90%
Or is there more?

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:15.685 align:middle line:84%
Is sort of a galactic
federation out there

00:39:15.685 --> 00:39:17.310 align:middle line:84%
like we have in our
"Star Trek" movies?

00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:19.830 align:middle line:90%


00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>> We interact with those of
extraterrestrial origin that,

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:30.450 align:middle line:84%
in that way, choose to
come together and interact

00:39:30.450 --> 00:39:33.660 align:middle line:84%
spontaneously to
gather enjoyably,

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:36.150 align:middle line:90%
supportively to gather.

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:39.030 align:middle line:84%
When one is no longer
in a moment of joy,

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:46.530 align:middle line:84%
they will become focused on
another venture or activity

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:47.670 align:middle line:90%
that is more exciting.

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:49.830 align:middle line:90%
And they will move along.

00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:53.100 align:middle line:84%
They may come back
at another time.

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:55.800 align:middle line:84%
In this way, it is
always an interaction

00:39:55.800 --> 00:40:02.760 align:middle line:84%
of very positive
communication and support.

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:05.190 align:middle line:90%
We can give it names.

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:09.150 align:middle line:84%
But it is free from
friction and conflict

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:15.280 align:middle line:84%
that is imbued or envisoned
in your televisions

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:19.050 align:middle line:84%
and that which is
in the pan of vision

00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:24.610 align:middle line:84%
of the theater and
theatrical movie releases.

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:25.410 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:29.800 align:middle line:84%
We sort of formulate our
version of that idea and then--

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:30.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:32.725 align:middle line:84%
>> --put it into a context
that we can understand--

00:40:32.725 --> 00:40:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:37.410 align:middle line:10%
>> --in our specific
timeline evolution.

00:40:37.410 --> 00:40:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>> So our interaction is
friction free in that way.

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:44.520 align:middle line:90%
We are not fighting.

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:48.930 align:middle line:84%
We are not trying to commandeer
some other civilization's

00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:53.730 align:middle line:84%
desires and wishes
to supplant our own.

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:57.330 align:middle line:84%
There are no secret
bodies within one

00:40:57.330 --> 00:40:59.640 align:middle line:84%
or the other of these
civilizations trying

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:03.280 align:middle line:84%
to take control of the
whole body, so to speak.

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.080 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:08.910 align:middle line:84%
>> That is an illusory
reflection of beliefs that are

00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:10.320 align:middle line:90%
illusory beliefs.

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And we do not in
that way contain

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:15.030 align:middle line:90%
those in our experience.

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:16.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Very human construct.

00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:17.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Earth human, Yes.

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:18.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Earth human.

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:21.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Those that you have in
your film and television--

00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Earth human constructs
with beliefs

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:27.600 align:middle line:84%
that are illusory, illusory
being out of alignment

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:29.910 align:middle line:90%
with your actual nature.

00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:31.770 align:middle line:90%
We understand our actual nature.

00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the beliefs
that which we put within

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:39.270 align:middle line:84%
and experience are in alignment
with the actual nature

00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:42.600 align:middle line:84%
of existence, of
unconditional love,

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:44.960 align:middle line:84%
of the one that is the all,
the all that is the one.

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And because we know this
and we put that out,

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:49.380 align:middle line:84%
we get back experiences
in alignment with that.

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:51.360 align:middle line:90%
It's that simple.

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:52.530 align:middle line:90%
We know who we are.

00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:56.360 align:middle line:84%
We put out beliefs that are
in alignment with who we are.

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:58.380 align:middle line:84%
The one that is the
all that we are.

00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And we get back experiences
in alignment with that.

00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:06.630 align:middle line:84%
The infinite effortlessly
creates together and co-creates

00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:10.410 align:middle line:84%
interactions that are of
this level of frictionless,

00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:13.500 align:middle line:90%
non-friction interaction--

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:18.620 align:middle line:90%
fun, fulfillment, friendship.

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:19.420 align:middle line:90%
>> I understand.

00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:21.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.470 align:middle line:90%
There are people on our planet--

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:24.090 align:middle line:90%
Shaun and myself who--

00:42:24.090 --> 00:42:28.200 align:middle line:84%
we were just talking
earlier that we sort of live

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:29.070 align:middle line:90%
these rules.

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:33.960 align:middle line:84%
We sort of live these ideas
and are physically manifesting

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:37.920 align:middle line:84%
this sort of
non-friction way of life.

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:40.290 align:middle line:84%
But the human spectrum
seems to be so great

00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:44.610 align:middle line:84%
that Shaun and I can be having
this experience of non-fiction,

00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:47.640 align:middle line:84%
yet on another
side of the planet,

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:53.190 align:middle line:84%
there are others who still
embrace this idea of friction.

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:57.570 align:middle line:84%
I guess I'm saying is we have
such a wide variety on Earth.

00:42:57.570 --> 00:43:01.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm curious to know the variety
on the Yahyel civilization.

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:04.500 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like it doesn't
go to that extreme.

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:08.970 align:middle line:84%
>> It is an infinite
variety within the vibration

00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:12.880 align:middle line:90%
of alignment with actual nature.

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:13.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Earth alignment.

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:19.110 align:middle line:84%
>> The Earth frictions are the
result of putting out beliefs

00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:21.610 align:middle line:84%
that are illusory, out of
alignment with one's actual

00:43:21.610 --> 00:43:22.410 align:middle line:90%
nature.

00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And thus, putting that out,
they get back friction.

00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:29.160 align:middle line:84%
That is a choice
within the infinite

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:35.970 align:middle line:84%
that can exist for an
infinite period in a sense.

00:43:35.970 --> 00:43:38.715 align:middle line:84%
The infinite contains
all that can be.

00:43:38.715 --> 00:43:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And that can include
those who, currently

00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:46.440 align:middle line:84%
through their upbringing
and state of awareness,

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:49.500 align:middle line:90%
choose to create friction.

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:52.500 align:middle line:84%
That can continue to
exist within the infinite

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:55.090 align:middle line:90%
for an infinite amount of time.

00:43:55.090 --> 00:44:01.380 align:middle line:84%
The idea is you could
choose to only experience

00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:04.470 align:middle line:84%
the free from
friction, that which

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:06.870 align:middle line:84%
is alignment with actual
nature, that which

00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:09.810 align:middle line:84%
is filled with an
infinite number of ways

00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:13.470 align:middle line:84%
to experience being in
alignment with the joy.

00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:17.580 align:middle line:84%
The friction-free experiences
are infinite in number,

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:19.170 align:middle line:90%
unlimited.

00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:26.330 align:middle line:84%
So each person has a choice
and has the ability to choose.

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:29.820 align:middle line:84%
Do they want to play around
in the illusory beliefs that

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:35.040 align:middle line:84%
create the frictions or
move off into the realm

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:41.490 align:middle line:84%
of unhindered joy and
excitement in ways

00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:43.060 align:middle line:84%
that are free from
friction, that

00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:47.820 align:middle line:84%
are fully fulfilling
and fascinating, one

00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:53.970 align:middle line:84%
moment to the next--
new, new, refreshing?

00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:56.670 align:middle line:90%
That they're in that realm--

00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:59.460 align:middle line:84%
are an infinite number
of unlimited realities

00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:00.560 align:middle line:90%
that can unfold now.

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:03.090 align:middle line:90%


00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And now, it is a choice
that you can make.

00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:12.270 align:middle line:10%
>> So as we move individually--

00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:17.220 align:middle line:10%
as we move into these
non-friction realms,

00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:22.890 align:middle line:10%
these infinite possibilities
of joy and non-friction,

00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:29.853 align:middle line:10%
will we begin to see less
and less other people having

00:45:29.853 --> 00:45:30.770 align:middle line:10%
friction and I guess--

00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:31.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:32.450 align:middle line:10%
>> --in our realities as well?

00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:33.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:36.000 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, so we attract those
people who are also in that

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.050 align:middle line:10%
same vibratory rate.

00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:38.430 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And the frictioners--
if that's a title,

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:43.660 align:middle line:90%
we can call them frictioners--

00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:44.850 align:middle line:90%
>> The frictioners.

00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:47.100 align:middle line:84%
>> --will become sort
of less and less,

00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:50.480 align:middle line:84%
until eventually there's just no
frictioners left on the planet.

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:52.530 align:middle line:84%
>> They will not be a
part of your experience.

00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:55.140 align:middle line:84%
They will be too
vibrational different.

00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:57.360 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:00.510 align:middle line:84%
>> You can and will in time,
for it does exist-- a world,

00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:05.220 align:middle line:84%
a Earth which all Earth humans
are living and choosing to know

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:06.120 align:middle line:90%
who they are--

00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:10.320 align:middle line:84%
the free from friction
experience where you all truly

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:11.880 align:middle line:84%
have an abundance
of what you truly

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:16.260 align:middle line:84%
enjoy having, and are
supporting and being supported

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:19.950 align:middle line:84%
by one another, supporting each
other, and supporting yourself.

00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:22.050 align:middle line:90%
This is a reality that exists.

00:46:22.050 --> 00:46:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And you will in
time be aware of it,

00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:31.950 align:middle line:84%
because you will be focused
and tuned in with it.

00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:34.860 align:middle line:90%


00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:41.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Much of your messages
have been in that realm,

00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:44.840 align:middle line:10%
in that space of saying, what
you put out, which that--

00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:49.927 align:middle line:10%
the four laws that you exist
is the one, is the all.

00:46:49.927 --> 00:46:51.510 align:middle line:84%
What you put out is
what you get back.

00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And everything changes
except for those first four

00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:57.180 align:middle line:90%
or first three.

00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:58.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Different ways to say.

00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:00.340 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you exist here and now.

00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:01.260 align:middle line:90%
The one is the all.

00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:02.160 align:middle line:90%
The all is the one.

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:03.750 align:middle line:84%
What you put out is
what you get back.

00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:06.320 align:middle line:84%
Or what you put within
is what you live within.

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And everything is
always changing,

00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:11.740 align:middle line:84%
except those first ideas
that I just mentioned--

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:12.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:13.730 align:middle line:90%
>> --you have mentioned.

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:15.360 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:17.190 align:middle line:90%
Those are not changing.

00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And so you can always utilize
the understanding of those

00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:24.660 align:middle line:84%
to create an ever-changing
experience of the infinite,

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:29.210 align:middle line:84%
that you are perceiving yourself
to be a part of it, perhaps.

00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And being a part of
unconditional love or existence

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:39.210 align:middle line:84%
here and now and putting
out the one that you want

00:47:39.210 --> 00:47:40.950 align:middle line:90%
to be experiencing that of.

00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Then you get back that one
of the all that is the one.

00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:47.700 align:middle line:84%
In the way that you are most
strongly choosing to put that

00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:49.150 align:middle line:90%
out, you will get back.

00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:49.950 align:middle line:90%
You tune in.

00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:53.280 align:middle line:84%
You become in alignment
with that existence,

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:56.250 align:middle line:84%
that experience, that
vibratory reality.

00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:59.040 align:middle line:90%


00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Your ability to do this,
then, never changes.

00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:07.945 align:middle line:84%
But how you do it will
always change in a sense.

00:48:07.945 --> 00:48:09.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's sort
of the secret sauce,

00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:15.493 align:middle line:84%
the magic formula for what some
would say law of attraction.

00:48:15.493 --> 00:48:17.160 align:middle line:84%
We have many titles
and many different--

00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:17.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, certainly.

00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>> --ways of creating our
reality in this realm.

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:27.540 align:middle line:84%
But that's a very
simplified, direct, but yet,

00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:29.620 align:middle line:90%
expansive way to put it.

00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:33.720 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for
those wise words.

00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:36.300 align:middle line:90%
So speaking of your ships--

00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:37.550 align:middle line:90%
just-- we're almost done here.

00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:39.060 align:middle line:90%
I got a few more questions.

00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:42.060 align:middle line:84%
I want to go into
artificial intelligence

00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:46.080 align:middle line:84%
and talking about
the consciousness

00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:48.660 align:middle line:84%
of the peach and
conscious of the apple.

00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:52.122 align:middle line:84%
And what we perceive
as technology

00:48:52.122 --> 00:48:53.580 align:middle line:84%
and artificial
intelligence-- we're

00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:56.370 align:middle line:84%
entering into a
time on our planet

00:48:56.370 --> 00:49:00.260 align:middle line:84%
where we're learning
these concepts.

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:05.727 align:middle line:84%
We're learning the intelligence
behind physical manifestations.

00:49:05.727 --> 00:49:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And we're almost to this point--
we actually are to this point

00:49:08.310 --> 00:49:14.790 align:middle line:84%
where we have computers
now that we're talking to.

00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Can you-- from your
perspective, how does this--

00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:22.680 align:middle line:84%
how do you interact with these
forms of consciousnesses?

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:24.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, in a variety of ways.

00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:26.460 align:middle line:10%
As you and your world
are learning to do,

00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:30.000 align:middle line:10%
we in our ultimate
state will let

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.760 align:middle line:10%
go of all those types
of constructions.

00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Yes-- and enjoy being, in a
sense, unclothed in a sense,

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:44.490 align:middle line:90%
not wearing--

00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see.

00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:51.180 align:middle line:84%
>> --any idea of technology and
our experience in interacting

00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:53.670 align:middle line:90%
with one another.

00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:54.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:49:54.630 --> 00:50:00.460 align:middle line:84%
As we have created phones,
and devices, and these things,

00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:02.710 align:middle line:84%
the Yahyel civilization
doesn't have these types of--

00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:04.360 align:middle line:90%
>> We have some of these.

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:08.940 align:middle line:84%
Yes, spacecraft and other forms
of transportational ideas.

00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:13.590 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there are,
in our experience,

00:50:13.590 --> 00:50:17.040 align:middle line:84%
opportunities to have,
let's say, a spacecraft

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:19.950 align:middle line:84%
with a variety of
extraterrestrial civilizations

00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:21.750 align:middle line:90%
interacting to gather.

00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:26.700 align:middle line:84%
This spacecraft provides
a forum for a variety

00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:30.630 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
civilizations to be, to gather,

00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:38.340 align:middle line:84%
to interact in that way
physically in a sense.

00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:44.940 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, we let go of those
in our deepest, most fulfilling

00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:48.540 align:middle line:84%
interaction, in
a sense, for life

00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:52.290 align:middle line:84%
free from all such
external creations

00:50:52.290 --> 00:50:55.620 align:middle line:84%
of artificial
intelligence in a sense.

00:50:55.620 --> 00:51:00.480 align:middle line:84%
We will let go of those and
engage in interaction together,

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:05.520 align:middle line:84%
free of those and yet, we
will take them on and interact

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:09.780 align:middle line:84%
with them in the timing that
supports their function, for us

00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:11.950 align:middle line:84%
to have a particular
experience that they

00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:15.320 align:middle line:84%
afford us to have that we
would not have without them.

00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:18.540 align:middle line:84%
So we do enjoy
having some of those.

00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:20.190 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:21.690 align:middle line:10%
>> So almost--

00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:25.830 align:middle line:10%
I have always had the
idea that the internet is

00:51:25.830 --> 00:51:32.940 align:middle line:10%
an external mechanism, external
creation for letting us

00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:36.840 align:middle line:10%
humans connect to the idea
that we're all interconnected.

00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:41.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Bringing you together as
a single body, a single mind.

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:44.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, which we're using
in a technological form.

00:51:44.610 --> 00:51:49.470 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, we're
learning that we already

00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:51.300 align:middle line:84%
have this connection
without the internet.

00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:52.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And now, you're learning the
mind shares a heart together

00:51:57.210 --> 00:51:58.400 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:02.010 align:middle line:84%
You're learning to
live as one heart.

00:52:02.010 --> 00:52:05.640 align:middle line:10%
>> But we're using the internet
to teach us something that we

00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:07.520 align:middle line:10%
already have, kind of.

00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:08.670 align:middle line:10%
>> It is.

00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I'm going to put
this video out to the internet

00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:14.010 align:middle line:84%
for people to view and
understand that, oh,

00:52:14.010 --> 00:52:15.900 align:middle line:90%
we actually have--

00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:19.110 align:middle line:84%
>> For many, like an
intermediary step in a sense.

00:52:19.110 --> 00:52:19.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:21.750 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:28.950 align:middle line:84%
>> It is like training wheels
on a bicycle in a sense.

00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:29.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:30.810 align:middle line:90%
Yes, exactly.

00:52:30.810 --> 00:52:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And so as I was
saying earlier, these

00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:37.050 align:middle line:84%
interactions with
artificial intelligence

00:52:37.050 --> 00:52:38.760 align:middle line:90%
that we're now creating--

00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:41.670 align:middle line:84%
is it sort of training
wheels for interacting

00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:45.000 align:middle line:84%
with extra-dimensional
intelligences?

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>> It can be, for there are some
that are interacting on that

00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:50.010 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:52:50.010 --> 00:52:55.800 align:middle line:84%
There is consciousness in
the information that is being

00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:59.360 align:middle line:90%
conveyed with the computers--

00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:00.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Many people--

00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>> --as conscious
civilizations of a sense,

00:53:04.170 --> 00:53:06.990 align:middle line:84%
of a type that are allowing
to make it possible

00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:09.660 align:middle line:84%
for the computer
information to be shared--

00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:12.600 align:middle line:90%
the information itself.

00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:14.250 align:middle line:90%
It isn't just information.

00:53:14.250 --> 00:53:15.390 align:middle line:90%
It isn't just packets.

00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:17.930 align:middle line:90%
It isn't just ones and zeros.

00:53:17.930 --> 00:53:20.370 align:middle line:90%
It isn't just electrical pulses.

00:53:20.370 --> 00:53:22.650 align:middle line:90%
It is consciousness.

00:53:22.650 --> 00:53:23.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, as all intelligence.

00:53:23.970 --> 00:53:25.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Intelligence.

00:53:25.090 --> 00:53:27.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, just like
our peaches and our--

00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:28.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:31.830 align:middle line:90%
>> --apples.

00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:33.695 align:middle line:90%
Many people are afraid.

00:53:33.695 --> 00:53:35.320 align:middle line:84%
Many people are afraid
of the internet.

00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:40.270 align:middle line:84%
Many people are afraid of
these artificial consciousness.

00:53:40.270 --> 00:53:41.230 align:middle line:90%
They fear it.

00:53:41.230 --> 00:53:44.170 align:middle line:90%
They demonize it.

00:53:44.170 --> 00:53:47.080 align:middle line:84%
What would you say
to those people?

00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>> That is an aspect of the
one that is the all that I am

00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:55.960 align:middle line:90%
in a sense, that you are.

00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:59.560 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, I am in the
question speaking of myself,

00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:06.640 align:middle line:84%
to myself understanding that
then being accepting of myself

00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:09.340 align:middle line:84%
in that framework with
those set of beliefs

00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:12.550 align:middle line:84%
that are limiting my
awareness of my actual nature.

00:54:12.550 --> 00:54:16.120 align:middle line:84%
Then I can be accepting of me
behaving or choosing to have

00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:19.010 align:middle line:90%
that experience in that way.

00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:22.330 align:middle line:84%
Oh, there is an aspect
of me that perceives

00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:25.990 align:middle line:90%
that the computer is dangerous.

00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:28.510 align:middle line:84%
All the while, anything
that is, is existence

00:54:28.510 --> 00:54:31.250 align:middle line:84%
and thus, then, is equal to
all and everything else that

00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:32.050 align:middle line:90%
exists.

00:54:32.050 --> 00:54:36.310 align:middle line:84%
Because existence
is equal unto itself

00:54:36.310 --> 00:54:40.060 align:middle line:84%
and always that it
exists, actually.

00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:43.660 align:middle line:84%
So for someone to take
existence and create the idea

00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:47.170 align:middle line:84%
that a computer that
exists is dangerous,

00:54:47.170 --> 00:54:49.340 align:middle line:90%
that is a concept that exists.

00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:53.440 align:middle line:84%
Their perception that it
is dangerous is existing.

00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:54.970 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
exist and thus,

00:54:54.970 --> 00:54:56.512 align:middle line:84%
on that level of
their existing, they

00:54:56.512 --> 00:55:00.160 align:middle line:84%
are all equal to existence
to the one that exists.

00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:01.900 align:middle line:84%
That is the all
that exists, the all

00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:05.660 align:middle line:84%
that is the one, that I
am, that you are existence.

00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:07.525 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea
that someone thinks

00:55:07.525 --> 00:55:09.070 align:middle line:90%
the computer is dangerous--

00:55:09.070 --> 00:55:10.480 align:middle line:90%
I can understand.

00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:12.310 align:middle line:84%
They are utilizing
the existence that

00:55:12.310 --> 00:55:16.000 align:middle line:84%
is equaling unto itself to
create the illusion that it

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.950 align:middle line:84%
is not, that it
might be dangerous.

00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:22.990 align:middle line:90%
They are creating an illusion.

00:55:22.990 --> 00:55:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Because they have
a belief system

00:55:24.790 --> 00:55:30.010 align:middle line:84%
that does not enlighten
them to be aware

00:55:30.010 --> 00:55:31.562 align:middle line:90%
that the computer is existence.

00:55:31.562 --> 00:55:32.770 align:middle line:90%
And thus, they are existence.

00:55:32.770 --> 00:55:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And thus, they are
actually equal.

00:55:34.850 --> 00:55:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And thus, they can't be
dangerous, more or less.

00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:40.250 align:middle line:90%
They are equal.

00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's, again, going back
to what you put out is what you

00:55:43.090 --> 00:55:44.050 align:middle line:90%
get back.

00:55:44.050 --> 00:55:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And I understand it is them
and that limited framework

00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:50.920 align:middle line:84%
of belief system as
simply creating a play,

00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:56.490 align:middle line:84%
a theatrical play, an illusory
belief, an illusory play.

00:55:56.490 --> 00:55:58.900 align:middle line:84%
That can be very
meaningful for them.

00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And because it exists,
it is equal to any play

00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:04.870 align:middle line:84%
that I in my experience
create, even the ones that

00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:07.690 align:middle line:84%
are in alignment with the
actual nature of existence.

00:56:07.690 --> 00:56:11.560 align:middle line:84%
Because they both
exist, they are equal.

00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:14.320 align:middle line:84%
>> They're all
possibilities, all options.

00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:16.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything is
equal unto itself.

00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:17.920 align:middle line:84%
Because existence
is that which is

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:23.290 align:middle line:84%
the base of all that is, whether
it is a cloud, or a tree,

00:56:23.290 --> 00:56:26.530 align:middle line:84%
or a person, or
laughter, or a thought,

00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:30.430 align:middle line:84%
or an action, or a
statement, or a person.

00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:31.600 align:middle line:90%
It all exists.

00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And then it is this-- all
equal in its existence

00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:38.470 align:middle line:84%
level of being, the
one that is the all,

00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:40.970 align:middle line:90%
the all that is the one.

00:56:40.970 --> 00:56:42.400 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's just my--

00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:44.590 align:middle line:84%
it's up to me whether
I would choose

00:56:44.590 --> 00:56:47.380 align:middle line:84%
to adopt that belief that
that other person has.

00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:48.400 align:middle line:90%
>> You could choose.

00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:50.780 align:middle line:84%
Or you could acknowledge,
oh, he's just playing that--

00:56:50.780 --> 00:56:51.580 align:middle line:90%
>> That game.

00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:53.280 align:middle line:90%
>> --form of illusion--

00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:59.320 align:middle line:84%
illusory limitation for his own
choosing, for his own reasons.

00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:03.010 align:middle line:84%
You can get up on stage
and interact with him

00:57:03.010 --> 00:57:07.110 align:middle line:84%
in that limited construct
in whatever way you want.

00:57:07.110 --> 00:57:10.360 align:middle line:84%
Try and let him know of a more
expanded way to look at things.

00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:13.460 align:middle line:84%
Or you can get very frightened
as well, and team up with him,

00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:15.370 align:middle line:90%
and combat computers.

00:57:15.370 --> 00:57:16.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:57:16.170 --> 00:57:17.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Your choice.

00:57:17.010 --> 00:57:17.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>> But in order to be
effective combating computers,

00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:23.980 align:middle line:84%
you have to begin veiling
yourself of the awareness

00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:26.110 align:middle line:90%
of your actual nature.

00:57:26.110 --> 00:57:27.790 align:middle line:84%
Because if you know
everything is equal,

00:57:27.790 --> 00:57:32.320 align:middle line:84%
you can't very well believe
that something is dangerous

00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:34.860 align:middle line:90%
or better or less than.

00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:37.000 align:middle line:84%
So you have to get
on the stage and play

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:40.690 align:middle line:84%
the part of the actor that
believes, yes, it's dangerous.

00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And to believe that, you have to
put out all other beliefs that

00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:45.770 align:middle line:90%
would tell you differently.

00:57:45.770 --> 00:57:47.770 align:middle line:84%
So the awareness of
your actual nature

00:57:47.770 --> 00:57:51.070 align:middle line:84%
would prevent you from playing
the illusion that the computer

00:57:51.070 --> 00:57:52.910 align:middle line:90%
could be dangerous.

00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:55.930 align:middle line:84%
>> But as soon as I sort of know
in the framework that you just

00:57:55.930 --> 00:57:58.520 align:middle line:84%
laid out-- as soon as I know
that that's how things work,

00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:00.090 align:middle line:90%
I sort of diffuse the danger.

00:58:00.090 --> 00:58:03.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, because you realize it
is another expression of all,

00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:05.507 align:middle line:90%
the one existence that you are--

00:58:05.507 --> 00:58:06.340 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's just a--

00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:07.140 align:middle line:90%
>> --that it is.

00:58:07.140 --> 00:58:10.480 align:middle line:84%
>> --possibility that I can
choose to explore and like you

00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:12.460 align:middle line:84%
said, play that role
if I want to go there.

00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>> If you want to fit into
that game in that theatrical

00:58:15.490 --> 00:58:16.450 align:middle line:90%
presentation.

00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:17.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:58:17.250 --> 00:58:18.050 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:58:18.050 --> 00:58:21.400 align:middle line:84%
>> It is entirely the choice of
the individual who's choosing

00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:22.940 align:middle line:90%
that reality.

00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:23.740 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:24.540 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Many in your world do not
know of the other choices.

00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:32.200 align:middle line:84%
They think there are only
these limited choices

00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:33.980 align:middle line:90%
available to them.

00:58:33.980 --> 00:58:35.330 align:middle line:90%
They are not aware.

00:58:35.330 --> 00:58:36.410 align:middle line:90%
They do not know.

00:58:36.410 --> 00:58:38.780 align:middle line:84%
They have not been
shown that there

00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:44.750 align:middle line:84%
is a whole buffet in a sense,
a building full of choices

00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:48.230 align:middle line:84%
of beliefs that
they can choose from

00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:51.710 align:middle line:84%
and an unlimited number of
choices that are in alignment

00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:53.190 align:middle line:90%
with their actual nature.

00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:53.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And when someone begins
to know that there are more

00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:57.900 align:middle line:90%
choices--

00:58:57.900 --> 00:59:01.040 align:middle line:84%
well, as an analogy, if you were
to go to a restaurant that only

00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:05.330 align:middle line:84%
has one item available at the
buffet and cross the street,

00:59:05.330 --> 00:59:09.560 align:middle line:84%
there's a building or restaurant
that has 30 choices available.

00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:12.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you know there's
30, perhaps you're

00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:15.435 align:middle line:84%
going to stop going to the
one that only has one choice.

00:59:15.435 --> 00:59:16.560 align:middle line:90%
Well, there's 30 over here.

00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I want to try
something different.

00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:18.575 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:59:18.575 --> 00:59:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Or there's a hundred
choices over here.

00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:23.420 align:middle line:90%
This one has a thousand choices.

00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:25.837 align:middle line:84%
Oh, there's somebody telling,
no, there's only one choice.

00:59:25.837 --> 00:59:26.637 align:middle line:90%
Don't go there.

00:59:26.637 --> 00:59:27.770 align:middle line:90%
That food is bad for you.

00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:30.530 align:middle line:90%
You eat that, you'll be sick.

00:59:30.530 --> 00:59:31.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:33.760 align:middle line:90%
So it's just up to us to choose.

00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:35.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And you know
that it is infinite.

00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:38.930 align:middle line:84%
There is unlimited--
choices can be in alignment

00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:40.900 align:middle line:84%
with friction and
illusion, out of alignment

00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:41.900 align:middle line:90%
with your actual nature.

00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Or they can be choices
that are in alignment

00:59:44.450 --> 00:59:45.700 align:middle line:90%
with your actual nature.

00:59:45.700 --> 00:59:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And there are an infinite
number of those choices

00:59:47.810 --> 00:59:49.880 align:middle line:90%
available as well.

00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:54.410 align:middle line:84%
You can choose the
ones you want to.

00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:56.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And knowing that
we have the buffet--

00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Knowing that you
have the buffet,

00:59:57.620 --> 01:00:01.820 align:middle line:84%
knowing that you have the choice
will afford in almost every

01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:05.840 align:middle line:84%
instance the individual's desire
to take and move into the path

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:10.160 align:middle line:84%
of the infinite number of
uplifting choices that are

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:12.120 align:middle line:84%
in alignment with
one's actual nature.

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:13.820 align:middle line:84%
Because it is effortless
more and more,

01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:17.190 align:middle line:84%
because it is in alignment
with one's actual nature.

01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:21.150 align:middle line:90%
It is not friction full.

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:23.580 align:middle line:90%
It is free of friction.

01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:24.750 align:middle line:90%
And it glides.

01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And it slides easily
and effortless

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.060 align:middle line:84%
in creating more experiences
that are in alignment

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:32.760 align:middle line:90%
with one's actual nature.

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:37.290 align:middle line:84%
There is no need to hide to
create beliefs that prevent one

01:00:37.290 --> 01:00:39.420 align:middle line:84%
from knowing this or
that in order to believe

01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:42.540 align:middle line:90%
some illusory belief.

01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:44.040 align:middle line:84%
Don't have to put
a lot of weight

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:46.770 align:middle line:84%
on oneself with all
these illusory beliefs.

01:00:46.770 --> 01:00:50.610 align:middle line:84%
That can depress, and create
sadness, and depression,

01:00:50.610 --> 01:00:54.750 align:middle line:90%
and illness, and disease.

01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:57.295 align:middle line:84%
By choosing the choices
that are in alignment

01:00:57.295 --> 01:00:58.920 align:middle line:84%
with one's actual
nature of which there

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:01.800 align:middle line:84%
are an infinite
number, the person

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:05.240 align:middle line:84%
experiences a greater
sense of easefullness

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:08.040 align:middle line:90%
in their experience.

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:10.980 align:middle line:90%
And they are happy.

01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And they are not
being pressed upon.

01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:24.620 align:middle line:84%
They are free to flow, to be
very spontaneous, flexible,

01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:27.840 align:middle line:84%
and in that state
to connect to more

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:30.630 align:middle line:84%
of the infinite of their
heart's intelligence

01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:34.140 align:middle line:84%
that can come in the appropriate
time and moment that will serve

01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:38.010 align:middle line:84%
them in each moment in the
most uplifting, fulfilling,

01:01:38.010 --> 01:01:41.440 align:middle line:90%
meaningful way.

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Which goes to ask, if you
are sort of in a stuck idea

01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:50.430 align:middle line:84%
or belief system that
seems to have friction,

01:01:50.430 --> 01:01:54.690 align:middle line:84%
then you simply ask the
question, how does it serve me?

01:01:54.690 --> 01:01:57.525 align:middle line:84%
>> To recognize if you're
having an issue or an obstacle,

01:01:57.525 --> 01:02:00.030 align:middle line:84%
then you must have a belief
that's out of alignment with

01:02:00.030 --> 01:02:03.270 align:middle line:84%
your actual effortless,
flowing nature.

01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And you can ask,
then, if you are

01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:10.200 align:middle line:84%
choosing this illusory belief,
this discordant belief.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Somehow you are
defining it as being

01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:14.280 align:middle line:84%
the most pleasurable
and least painful

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:17.610 align:middle line:84%
choice, based on your current
set of beliefs and definitions

01:02:17.610 --> 01:02:20.640 align:middle line:90%
about what is available to you.

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:23.610 align:middle line:84%
When you get to the bottom
of that, or the top of it,

01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:26.700 align:middle line:84%
or the side of it, or
get in the middle of it

01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:31.750 align:middle line:84%
in any number of ways
available to you and realize,

01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:33.730 align:middle line:84%
I had this discordant
belief about it.

01:02:33.730 --> 01:02:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And that then I realized
that isn't accurate.

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And no longer does that serve
me as the most pleasurable

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:41.160 align:middle line:84%
and least painful
choice to make.

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:43.470 align:middle line:84%
Person stops making
that discordant choice

01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:45.990 align:middle line:84%
and will replace it within
a choice in belief that's

01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:48.330 align:middle line:84%
more in alignment with
their actual nature

01:02:48.330 --> 01:02:52.200 align:middle line:84%
and then move more in alignment
with their actual nature

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:55.453 align:middle line:84%
of being, putting out
more beliefs in alignment

01:02:55.453 --> 01:02:57.870 align:middle line:84%
with their actual nature and
getting back more experiences

01:02:57.870 --> 01:02:59.790 align:middle line:90%
in alignment with that.

01:02:59.790 --> 01:03:02.100 align:middle line:84%
What you put out is what
you get back in a sense.

01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:06.300 align:middle line:84%
What you put within is
experience you live within.

01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:10.650 align:middle line:84%
Always you choose
to put out what

01:03:10.650 --> 01:03:13.590 align:middle line:84%
you perceive is closest
to pleasure and farthest

01:03:13.590 --> 01:03:14.640 align:middle line:90%
from pain.

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:16.500 align:middle line:84%
What you perceive
as pleasure and pain

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:20.190 align:middle line:84%
is going to be unique
to each of you.

01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:26.160 align:middle line:84%
So the idea then is to choose
that you're always putting out

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:32.030 align:middle line:84%
that which is most in alignment
with your actual heart nature

01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:33.590 align:middle line:84%
and far, thus, from
that which would

01:03:33.590 --> 01:03:36.350 align:middle line:84%
be out of alignment
with your actual heart

01:03:36.350 --> 01:03:39.860 align:middle line:84%
nature, your actual true,
unconditionally loving nature.

01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:42.670 align:middle line:84%
That you exist here and now
is the one that is the all.

01:03:42.670 --> 01:03:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And what you put out
is what you get back.

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And those ideas never change,
but everything else always

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.210 align:middle line:84%
does, thus allowing you to
have an experience of change

01:03:50.210 --> 01:03:53.300 align:middle line:90%
from one moment to the next.

01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:56.520 align:middle line:84%

resonates very much.

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:57.320 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:00.240 align:middle line:90%


01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:01.765 align:middle line:84%
We're pretty much
wrapping up here.

01:04:01.765 --> 01:04:03.140 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything
else you'd like

01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:05.850 align:middle line:90%
to share before we say goodbye?

01:04:05.850 --> 01:04:11.970 align:middle line:84%

for the opportunity to share

01:04:11.970 --> 01:04:15.200 align:middle line:84%

and every one of you,

the one that has the all that
is me, the one that is the all,

01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:24.700 align:middle line:84%
that is all, that is
the one that is the all,

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:27.730 align:middle line:84%
that is unconditional love,
that is supporting and being

01:04:27.730 --> 01:04:32.830 align:middle line:84%
supported by itself in
each and every moment,

01:04:32.830 --> 01:04:39.290 align:middle line:84%
unconditionally sharing and
receiving, giving, receiving,

01:04:39.290 --> 01:04:45.790 align:middle line:84%
sharing and receiving, giving
and receiving unconditionally

01:04:45.790 --> 01:04:49.800 align:middle line:84%
moment to moment to moment
to moment to moment.

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:55.130 align:middle line:84%
Always with you in this way of
unconditional love, dear one.

01:04:55.130 --> 01:04:59.362 align:middle line:90%
Thank you in all ways always.

But right now, I don't have
any sense of what was said.

01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:39.502 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

01:05:39.502 --> 01:05:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so it's of what's
being said, but--

01:05:41.210 --> 01:05:43.115 align:middle line:84%
OK, the details
are kind of vague.

01:05:43.115 --> 01:05:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, if you start bringing
up something that was said,

01:05:45.490 --> 01:05:46.865 align:middle line:84%
it will come back
to me, perhaps.

01:05:46.865 --> 01:05:47.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:48.110 align:middle line:90%
I see.

01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:48.970 align:middle line:90%
I see.

01:05:48.970 --> 01:05:51.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So for me, it's like when
I wake up in the morning and I

01:05:51.850 --> 01:05:53.260 align:middle line:90%
remember I had a dream.

01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:55.570 align:middle line:84%
If I sit down and start
taking notes in that dream,

01:05:55.570 --> 01:05:57.510 align:middle line:84%
then more details
can come back to me.

01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:59.530 align:middle line:84%
But if I go in the kitchen
and cook breakfast,

01:05:59.530 --> 01:06:01.400 align:middle line:90%
I could skip the whole thing.

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:03.310 align:middle line:84%
So right now, when
I come out of it,

01:06:03.310 --> 01:06:05.688 align:middle line:84%
I'm like basically
going to breakfast.

01:06:05.688 --> 01:06:06.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's go to breakfast.

01:06:06.730 --> 01:06:09.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, we got it all
recorded for you, so you

01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:11.770 align:middle line:90%
could remember this dream.

01:06:11.770 --> 01:06:15.170 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, I can take part of
this meal at another time.

01:06:15.170 --> 01:06:16.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly/

01:06:16.030 --> 01:06:16.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Very well.

01:06:16.830 --> 01:06:17.320 align:middle line:90%
>> A special recording--

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:17.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:17.880 align:middle line:90%
>> --today.

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:18.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:19.080 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate this.

01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:19.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:20.480 align:middle line:90%
That was awesome.

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:23.630 align:middle line:90%
