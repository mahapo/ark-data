00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.810 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>>One time, Thoth
came to me and he

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:26.890 align:middle line:84%
said, do you know one of the
stages that this leads to?

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.140 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what do you mean?

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.522 align:middle line:84%
He says, someday
you will be a star.

00:00:32.522 --> 00:00:34.702 align:middle line:84%
And I said, do you mean
like a rock and roll star?

00:00:34.702 --> 00:00:38.630 align:middle line:90%


00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.110 align:middle line:90%
He goes, no, a real star.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.370 align:middle line:84%
He says, humans are
seeds that become suns.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.750 align:middle line:90%
It's one of the levels or steps.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.270 align:middle line:90%
You literally become a sun.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And it was not long after
he was telling me that--

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.470 align:middle line:84%
and this is out of
"Scientific American."

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.090 align:middle line:84%
It was really just-- I don't
remember when this was,

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.240 align:middle line:90%
about 1991 or 1992, I think.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.470 align:middle line:90%
Last year, I think this was.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.790 align:middle line:90%
I used to have it here.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.710 align:middle line:90%


00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.285 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it was '91.

00:01:15.285 --> 00:01:17.880 align:middle line:84%
They gave in this article
all the information

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.010 align:middle line:84%
they now know about
the formation of suns.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And when I read this, it
was really exciting to me,

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.786 align:middle line:84%
because here's the process
that they now know.

00:01:28.786 --> 00:01:34.100 align:middle line:84%
An old, old sun has been
around for a long, long time.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And as it passes into
the dark-light spiral

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.410 align:middle line:84%
it can either expand
and become a red giant,

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.770 align:middle line:84%
like we talked about,
and die in that process,

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:52.930 align:middle line:84%
or it could blow up, expand
beyond itself, just poof,

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.090 align:middle line:84%
and form this huge hydrogen
cloud, that is so big,

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.767 align:middle line:84%
you can't believe how
big this thing is.

00:01:59.767 --> 00:02:01.040 align:middle line:90%
It's enormous.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.654 align:middle line:84%
It's immense, and it's way
bigger than solar systems

00:02:04.654 --> 00:02:05.570 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.570 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge, huge cloud.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.539 align:middle line:84%
And what they discovered
is that the hydrogen,

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.360 align:middle line:84%
when it does that, is
not totally homogeneous.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.680 align:middle line:84%
There are certain areas
that are not as much

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.960 align:middle line:84%
and some areas where
there is more, like where

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.430 align:middle line:90%
these bright spots are.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.080 align:middle line:84%
There's, like, spots
in there where there is

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.440 align:middle line:90%
more hydrogen than the others.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens, first
the cloud blows up and goes out,

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.600 align:middle line:84%
and it kind of sits
there for a while.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And what happens then
is because of gravity,

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.230 align:middle line:84%
the hydrogen where it's
denser begins to move

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.910 align:middle line:90%
toward those dense spots.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.920 align:middle line:90%
And new stars begin to form.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.650 align:middle line:84%
For every one that dies,
approximately 200 or 300

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.978 align:middle line:90%
new babies are born.

00:02:55.978 --> 00:02:57.602 align:middle line:84%
Good example of that
is the middle star

00:02:57.602 --> 00:02:58.677 align:middle line:90%
of the belt of Orion.

00:02:58.677 --> 00:03:00.260 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what's
happening there.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:07.870 align:middle line:84%
There are 200 new babies being
formed right now from just one

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.730 align:middle line:90%
adult giving its life.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:18.440 align:middle line:90%


00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And as the gas keeps
tracking in and coming

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.220 align:middle line:84%
in and in and in and in, finally
the gas gets to this place

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.020 align:middle line:84%
where the compression, the heat
is such that fusion begins.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And it begins a low level
fusion reaction of hydrogen

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.880 align:middle line:90%
and becomes called a protostar.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.660 align:middle line:90%
But the gas is still coming in.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.960 align:middle line:84%
This is taking place inside
that big gas cloud you just saw.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.300 align:middle line:84%
We formed this little
protostar in here.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And then it has another
sphere of round gas

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.390 align:middle line:84%
around that one with a
lighter sphere of round

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.130 align:middle line:90%
gas around that one.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.790 align:middle line:84%
If you remember, we
have a chakra point

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.700 align:middle line:84%
at the base point with
another sphere around that,

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.150 align:middle line:84%
and then a bigger sphere
out here, exact same image,

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.420 align:middle line:84%
and the whole thing forms
a north and south pole

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.170 align:middle line:90%
and begins to rotate.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.990 align:middle line:84%
It's actually rotating in
both directions at once,

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:21.870 align:middle line:84%
but the overall image
of it is rotating

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.460 align:middle line:84%
in one direction,
which as you can see,

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.390 align:middle line:90%
usually is counterclockwise.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.900 align:middle line:90%
Just that's where the planet is.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And at one point, it reaches
a certain speed and a disc

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:40.940 align:middle line:84%
pops out like this, and the
image of the flying saucer

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.140 align:middle line:90%
or the Merkaba takes place.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
the fusion reaction

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.920 align:middle line:90%
begins to really take off.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And again, you see
this rotational pattern

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.855 align:middle line:84%
counterclockwise that's going
on through the whole thing.

00:04:59.855 --> 00:05:03.550 align:middle line:90%


00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.955 align:middle line:84%
As the reaction gets greater
and greater and greater,

00:05:06.955 --> 00:05:08.330 align:middle line:84%
there's different
steps of fusion

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.050 align:middle line:90%
that begin to take place.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And this continues to
contract faster and faster.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And the cellular disc begins
to flatten out more and more

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.090 align:middle line:84%
and more so it becomes a
greater round sphere with a disc

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:27.590 align:middle line:84%
through it, until eventually
the sun actually truly

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.020 align:middle line:84%
ignites into an actual sun,
or it takes a long time.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And the matter that
is left in this disc

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.670 align:middle line:84%
is what congeals because it's
also not totally homogeneous.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.650 align:middle line:84%
It congeals into the planets
and forms the planets.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And you end up with
a little solar system

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.080 align:middle line:84%
like we're living in, which
is just another big Merkaba.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.740 align:middle line:90%


00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very,
very similar process

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.474 align:middle line:84%
to what we're teaching in
the human Merkaba field.

00:06:02.474 --> 00:06:08.831 align:middle line:90%


00:06:08.831 --> 00:06:10.298 align:middle line:90%
This little guy right here.

00:06:10.298 --> 00:06:15.190 align:middle line:90%


00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:21.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, this field, though
it doesn't seem like it,

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.310 align:middle line:90%
is all over the place.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.790 align:middle line:90%
We know it's in the galaxy.

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.160 align:middle line:84%
We can see these stars
that are coming out

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.175 align:middle line:84%
in spirals rotating around
it with a central core

00:06:31.175 --> 00:06:32.180 align:middle line:90%
in the middle.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.500 align:middle line:84%
They believe it's a black hole
that's in the middle of it,

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.420 align:middle line:90%
the middle of the galaxy.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And if you go down to a
particular point in there,

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:43.660 align:middle line:90%
you have a solar system.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And again, you have a sun in
the middle with planets rotating

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.240 align:middle line:90%
around it.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.990 align:middle line:84%
Same kind of thing,
what you just saw.

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:55.672 align:middle line:84%
And then if you go down
to a single planet, again,

00:06:55.672 --> 00:06:57.130 align:middle line:84%
things like Saturn
and Neptune, you

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.260 align:middle line:84%
can actually see the disc
and the sphere pattern

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.550 align:middle line:90%
around there.

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:03.990 align:middle line:90%
But it's much more than that.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And if you study the
works of Richard Hoagland,

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.850 align:middle line:84%
you'll see that planets have
these star tetrahedral fields

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.720 align:middle line:84%
inscribed in a sphere around
them, which they're just

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.670 align:middle line:84%
beginning to understand
through the world bodies

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.920 align:middle line:90%
and in science.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.560 align:middle line:90%
And the same thing is going.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.890 align:middle line:84%
Or you can come down
to a human being,

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:26.860 align:middle line:84%
and we have the same
potential in there.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.320 align:middle line:84%
Even if you go down to
the molecular structure

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.990 align:middle line:84%
of the very fabric
of the reality,

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:37.110 align:middle line:84%
you have the core of
the atom in the center

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.615 align:middle line:84%
and the electrons
rotating around that.

00:07:39.615 --> 00:07:46.590 align:middle line:84%
The same kind of image going
on from microcosm to macrocosm.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:48.640 align:middle line:84%
So I say, is it
any wonder that it

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.790 align:middle line:84%
was chosen, that
shape will be used

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:56.490 align:middle line:84%
for what we call the UFOs
and the flying saucers?

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:59.230 align:middle line:84%
It would be kind
of a natural thing

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:01.120 align:middle line:84%
if you were trying
to duplicate nature.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.030 align:middle line:90%


00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:06.950 align:middle line:90%
Like this.

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.880 align:middle line:84%
These are the photographs
from Billy Meier that came out

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.736 align:middle line:90%
of Switzerland, isn't it?

00:08:12.736 --> 00:08:13.536 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:13.536 --> 00:08:17.160 align:middle line:90%


00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And they are real
photographs, I believe.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Though again, I don't
think that the people who

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:38.420 align:middle line:84%
are putting these out have
us in their greatest concern.

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.510 align:middle line:90%


00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:44.800 align:middle line:84%
Though that may all
change very soon.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.700 align:middle line:84%
There's tremendous
change going on,

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:52.280 align:middle line:84%
not only in the ascended masters
but in all peoples everywhere.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.020 align:middle line:84%
There's a great, great
change occurring right now

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:59.950 align:middle line:84%
in the darkest of the forces
and the lightest of the forces.

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:05.990 align:middle line:90%
There is a tremendous something.

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:09.210 align:middle line:84%
The greatest change
ever seen is occurring

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:12.320 align:middle line:84%
at this moment, not just
on Earth but everywhere.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:36.128 align:middle line:90%


00:09:36.128 --> 00:09:41.850 align:middle line:84%
So, what I'd like
to approach now

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:47.290 align:middle line:84%
is who is it that is using these
kinds of things, these ships.

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:53.060 align:middle line:84%
So I slowly brought
this up for, I

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:58.145 align:middle line:84%
want to look at-- there are
basically two kinds of people

00:09:58.145 --> 00:10:02.870 align:middle line:84%
in this-- sort of
two kinds of people,

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:05.464 align:middle line:90%
two basic categories of people.

00:10:05.464 --> 00:10:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And there are those
that use these kinds

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:10.980 align:middle line:84%
of external Merkabas and
ones that use internal living

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.680 align:middle line:90%
fields of Merkabas.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:17.686 align:middle line:90%
It's like archangel Michael.

00:10:17.686 --> 00:10:20.663 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't have any spaceship.

00:10:20.663 --> 00:10:23.180 align:middle line:84%
Neither does Raphael, or
a lot of these people,

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.470 align:middle line:90%
there's no spaceships at all.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And yet they're incredibly
powerful beings.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.986 align:middle line:84%
And then we've got a lot
of these alien beings that

00:10:31.986 --> 00:10:33.770 align:middle line:84%
are around that are
interfering or coming

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:37.619 align:middle line:84%
in in different ways, who come
in on these physical vehicles.

00:10:37.619 --> 00:10:39.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're
physical in the sense

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:43.120 align:middle line:84%
that if they lowered their
frequency to this place,

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.090 align:middle line:84%
they're something you
can get in and out of.

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:49.080 align:middle line:84%
They become
non-physical when they

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.985 align:middle line:84%
change to a different
wavelength and go up

00:10:50.985 --> 00:10:52.360 align:middle line:84%
to higher and
higher wavelengths,

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:56.310 align:middle line:84%
but they're not Merkaba
fields that are linked

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:58.280 align:middle line:90%
with a particular person.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.525 align:middle line:90%
They're externally created.

00:11:00.525 --> 00:11:05.060 align:middle line:90%


00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:09.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, it all goes back
to Lucifer rebellion.

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:13.280 align:middle line:84%
The Lucifer rebellion
is not the first time

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.995 align:middle line:84%
that someone has
attempted to do this.

00:11:15.995 --> 00:11:19.430 align:middle line:84%
There's been at least
three times before.

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:24.390 align:middle line:84%
But approximately a
little over 200,000 years

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:29.380 align:middle line:84%
ago, a person named
Lucifer decided

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.530 align:middle line:84%
to do something that had been
tried in ancient times before.

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And Lucifer if you remember,
according to the Bible,

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:47.200 align:middle line:84%
was the greatest angel
that God had ever created.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:51.150 align:middle line:84%
He was the most beautiful,
the most intelligent,

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:57.610 align:middle line:84%
the number one model
that he'd ever made.

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:00.360 align:middle line:90%


00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And he was on the
left hand side.

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:08.340 align:middle line:84%
Jesus was on one side, and
Lucifer was on the left hand

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:12.520 align:middle line:90%
side of God as the top model.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And the flaw, if there is
any such a thing of Lucifer

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:21.920 align:middle line:90%
is that-- let's put it this way.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.340 align:middle line:84%
It is a natural
trait that God gave

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:29.870 align:middle line:84%
us to try to become greater
than what we already are.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And so usually we have
these heroes or people

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:36.580 align:middle line:84%
that have already gone beyond--
the gurus or whatever you want,

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.150 align:middle line:84%
people who have gone
beyond-- that we

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:42.240 align:middle line:84%
tried to eliminate or
to become like them.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.200 align:middle line:90%
But Lucifer didn't have anyone.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:49.990 align:middle line:84%
The only one that he had that
was greater than him was God.

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:53.205 align:middle line:84%
And so he tried to become
like God and greater than God.

00:12:53.205 --> 00:12:56.921 align:middle line:90%


00:12:56.921 --> 00:13:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And so he was so intelligent
that he knew everything.

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:05.140 align:middle line:84%
He understood all
mental patterns.

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.930 align:middle line:84%
He understood how all
things were created.

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:12.450 align:middle line:84%
He knew that the Merkaba field
was the creation pattern.

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And so he decided to become as
great as, or greater than God.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And from another point
of view, it very well

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:24.700 align:middle line:84%
could have been
that God understood

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.920 align:middle line:84%
this, that this
would take place,

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.350 align:middle line:90%
in creating someone like this.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:35.430 align:middle line:90%


00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And what he did was
he knew that love

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:41.370 align:middle line:84%
was the thing that created
the living Merkaba field.

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And his choice was to sever his
connection with God, his love

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:51.970 align:middle line:84%
connection with God, and to
create an external field, what

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:56.870 align:middle line:84%
we call a UFO, to get
inside of, and to ascend

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:59.080 align:middle line:84%
to the heights of the
heavens, and to become

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:05.660 align:middle line:84%
as great as or greater than God,
and creating a separate reality

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:09.130 align:middle line:84%
from the rest of
the body of God.

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:11.120 align:middle line:84%
He convinced a
great deal of people

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:17.690 align:middle line:84%
that they should do this because
of what I'm about to show you.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And we were all
some of those people

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:22.540 align:middle line:84%
that he convinced in
one way or another,

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:25.660 align:middle line:90%
because we're all here.

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And this entire level of
consciousness is-- I mean,

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:35.890 align:middle line:84%
he convinced me in a sense that
I'm here trying to change it,

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:38.280 align:middle line:90%
but I'm still here.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.510 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not any better
than anyone else.

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:43.010 align:middle line:84%
We all have, for one
reason or another,

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:47.040 align:middle line:84%
no matter how high or
where you came from,

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:50.270 align:middle line:90%
we're involved in this dance.

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:53.350 align:middle line:90%
And this is what happened.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.910 align:middle line:90%
This is what he said.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:57.830 align:middle line:84%
There was this
missing information

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:00.430 align:middle line:84%
which had to do with
that little sphere that

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:03.310 align:middle line:84%
was inside the sphere that
would pass through here

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:05.285 align:middle line:84%
and the sphere that would
happen in the middle.

00:15:05.285 --> 00:15:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And there's only one way that
that could be calculated.

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And it was tied to another
possibility of the way

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.570 align:middle line:84%
that that spirit could
move out of the great void.

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:25.160 align:middle line:90%


00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And there were two trees
in the Garden of Eden.

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:39.730 align:middle line:84%
One of them was
the Tree of Life.

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And the other was the Tree of
Knowledge of Good and Evil.

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And they were both
in the center,

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:49.222 align:middle line:84%
which is kind of an
interesting image,

00:15:49.222 --> 00:15:53.500 align:middle line:84%
that we could have two
trees exactly in the center.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:57.320 align:middle line:84%
But these two trees were right
in the center of this garden.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And they were both
very different.

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And they were both
very different.

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:08.120 align:middle line:84%
One led to death,
and the other led

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.875 align:middle line:90%
to immortality and eternal life.

00:16:09.875 --> 00:16:14.250 align:middle line:90%


00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And the key
significance behind them

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.760 align:middle line:84%
was that there was
two different ways

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:25.620 align:middle line:84%
it was possible geometrically
to come out of the great void.

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:29.930 align:middle line:84%
There were actually many,
many, many ways conceptually,

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:38.280 align:middle line:84%
but there was only two
ways geometrically that you

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.960 align:middle line:90%
could proceed through.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:43.180 align:middle line:84%
And one of these
ways was the Tree

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:46.580 align:middle line:84%
of Life, which we showed
you, where the spirit of God

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:50.100 align:middle line:84%
moved up to the top, and
then it moved to the circle.

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And then it began a vortex,
rotating around the equator

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:57.250 align:middle line:90%
of the central one.

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:59.736 align:middle line:90%
But there's another way.

00:16:59.736 --> 00:17:05.609 align:middle line:84%
And that way is, first of
all, spirit is not a thing.

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:10.839 align:middle line:84%
And space-time is something
that spirit creates.

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:13.310 align:middle line:84%
It's an illusion
created by a spirit.

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And so spirit is able to be
in more than one place, what

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.700 align:middle line:90%
we call simultaneously.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:25.874 align:middle line:84%
Spirit can divide itself and
be anywhere in its creation

00:17:25.874 --> 00:17:26.985 align:middle line:90%
that it wants to be.

00:17:26.985 --> 00:17:28.712 align:middle line:84%
It could divide
itself a lot of times.

00:17:28.712 --> 00:17:31.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look how many times
just in this room we've divided

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:32.310 align:middle line:90%
ourselves.

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And so definitely spirit
can be in two places

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:39.460 align:middle line:84%
at once, which is the
easiest of all situations.

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And so at the very,
very beginning

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:45.090 align:middle line:84%
of creation, while we're
still in the great void,

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:47.330 align:middle line:90%
the first sphere is made.

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.110 align:middle line:90%
The same patterns are made.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:51.462 align:middle line:84%
It goes to the same
procedure, whatever procedure

00:17:51.462 --> 00:17:52.420 align:middle line:90%
you want to go through.

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:56.080 align:middle line:84%
There are other ones than what
the Egyptians thought in terms

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.640 align:middle line:90%
of actually creating a sphere.

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:02.650 align:middle line:84%
But once the first
sphere is created,

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:06.630 align:middle line:84%
rather than moving-- when
the first motion is made--

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:08.090 align:middle line:90%
this is the key right here.

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:10.605 align:middle line:84%
Rather than moving
up here totally,

00:18:10.605 --> 00:18:14.280 align:middle line:84%
the spirit divides itself
and leaves half of itself

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:17.100 align:middle line:90%
here and the other half up here.

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:21.620 align:middle line:84%
So only half of spirit
moves up to the top

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:25.380 align:middle line:84%
so that it's in two places
at once simultaneously.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And then on the next motion,
the motions from then on in

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:34.270 align:middle line:84%
are dual so that the
motion of this one

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:37.390 align:middle line:84%
would move from here while
the one in the center

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:38.500 align:middle line:90%
moves over to here.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.020 align:middle line:90%


00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:46.910 align:middle line:84%
So it begins this dual or double
helical pattern rather than

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:49.330 align:middle line:90%
a vortex motion.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And when that continues out, the
grid begins to look like this.

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And if you continue
doing this, it

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:01.820 align:middle line:84%
begins to form the
flower of life.

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:10.460 align:middle line:90%


00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:20.530 align:middle line:84%
It's the same flower, the same
geometrical images are there.

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:22.820 align:middle line:90%
It creates the same laws.

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:25.920 align:middle line:84%
You end up with a reality
looking exactly the same,

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.050 align:middle line:84%
the reality itself--
the laws that

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:30.080 align:middle line:84%
are contained in that
pattern and this pattern

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.996 align:middle line:84%
are the same, because
that is the same pattern

00:19:31.996 --> 00:19:33.670 align:middle line:90%
as this pattern.

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:36.476 align:middle line:84%
So you get the same laws, you
get plants and trees and all

00:19:36.476 --> 00:19:38.600 align:middle line:84%
the other various things
and all the various levels

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:39.670 align:middle line:84%
and dimensions and
everything else.

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:40.470 align:middle line:90%
Exactly the same.

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:43.180 align:middle line:84%
It duplicates it
in every single way

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:49.650 align:middle line:84%
except for one big central
important difference.

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:54.240 align:middle line:84%
This one has a
single center in it.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And this grid, no matter
where you come back from it,

00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:01.280 align:middle line:90%
has two centers.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:06.280 align:middle line:84%
This has a single eye, and that
has two centers or two eyes.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:10.270 align:middle line:90%


00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:13.590 align:middle line:84%
The vortex will have
a single center.

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:16.890 align:middle line:84%
The helical pattern
will have-- it creates--

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:20.560 align:middle line:90%
it will have two eyes.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And no matter how
big the grid gets,

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:26.159 align:middle line:84%
when you try to
locate its center,

00:20:26.159 --> 00:20:27.450 align:middle line:90%
you'll find that there is none.

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:30.090 align:middle line:84%
There's two points
inside it, in the middle.

00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
geometrical difference

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.180 align:middle line:90%
between this one and this one.

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus said something
once before that's

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.530 align:middle line:84%
kind of gone over a
lot of people's heads,

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:42.110 align:middle line:90%
but relative to this.

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:45.480 align:middle line:84%
If you hear it, he said, if
thine eye be single, thy body

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.490 align:middle line:90%
be filled with light.

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:50.810 align:middle line:90%


00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:55.850 align:middle line:90%
And this is what he meant.

00:20:55.850 --> 00:21:01.700 align:middle line:90%


00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:06.710 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the
geometry of a consciousness

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:10.000 align:middle line:84%
or a body or
anything else, you'll

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.760 align:middle line:84%
find-- I think I've
mentioned this,

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:15.870 align:middle line:84%
that around a human being,
there's a cube or a square.

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:26.405 align:middle line:84%
And it all is tied into
this little egg of life

00:21:26.405 --> 00:21:28.530 align:middle line:84%
which is the second form
that comes out of Genesis.

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:31.170 align:middle line:90%


00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And so there are
many views of this.

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:36.080 align:middle line:84%
Didn't I go through all that
before, where this is one view

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.440 align:middle line:84%
and this is another
diamond view?

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And there's the hexagonal
view, which is like this.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And in the diamond
view, there's also

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.730 align:middle line:84%
the diamond view in
this way and there's

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:54.510 align:middle line:84%
the diamond view in this
way, which are rectangles.

00:21:54.510 --> 00:22:00.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, the diamond view in this
way, this one, looks like that,

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:05.310 align:middle line:84%
is what you will find if you
analyze this sequence that was

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:07.304 align:middle line:90%
created by moving in that way.

00:22:07.304 --> 00:22:09.720 align:middle line:84%
I didn't do these very lightly,
but there's a green sphere

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.440 align:middle line:84%
here, a green one there,
and a green on there,

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:15.520 align:middle line:84%
and there's kind of a rose
one here, a rose one here,

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.380 align:middle line:84%
and a rose one here,
which happens to be

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:21.810 align:middle line:90%
a view of this from that angle.

00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:24.598 align:middle line:84%
It's the only pattern
you'll find in there.

00:22:24.598 --> 00:22:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And when you put that into
geometrical images, these three

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:35.046 align:middle line:84%
spheres moving down here, this
one, this one, and this one,

00:22:35.046 --> 00:22:38.670 align:middle line:84%
that is exactly what this would
be translated to onto a two

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:41.640 align:middle line:90%
dimensional piece of paper.

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And it happens to be-- and
this was the convincing thing

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:50.150 align:middle line:84%
that Lucifer got about one
third of the angels on,

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:54.430 align:middle line:84%
was that the only way that you
can calculate the sphere that

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:56.140 align:middle line:84%
passes through
here and the sizes

00:22:56.140 --> 00:23:01.440 align:middle line:84%
and get the rest of the
information is from this view.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.220 align:middle line:84%
It needs this
diagonally view of that

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:06.511 align:middle line:84%
to calculate all of
the size of this sphere

00:23:06.511 --> 00:23:07.510 align:middle line:90%
and all of these things.

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:11.512 align:middle line:84%
And this is all the mathematics
on it that came up with.

00:23:11.512 --> 00:23:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And to calculate all
those various things

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:17.825 align:middle line:90%
that are inside of there.

00:23:17.825 --> 00:23:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And so he said, we
need to do this.

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And I guess a lot of
people believed him.

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:26.960 align:middle line:84%
However every time
that someone's

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.700 align:middle line:84%
tried to do this in
the past, it has always

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:36.410 align:middle line:84%
resulted in utter complete
chaos with untold numbers

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:42.345 align:middle line:84%
of lives being destroyed and
unbelievable amount of pain

00:23:42.345 --> 00:23:44.720 align:middle line:90%
to the system.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:49.360 align:middle line:90%
And it's also true this time.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:53.137 align:middle line:84%
It's caused incredible chaos,
and not just here on Earth

00:23:53.137 --> 00:23:55.220 align:middle line:90%
but all over the place.

00:23:55.220 --> 00:24:00.510 align:middle line:84%
But something appears to
be happening differently

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:01.310 align:middle line:90%
this time.

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:04.110 align:middle line:90%


00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And it appears to be centered
on this little speck of dust

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:11.480 align:middle line:84%
out in the middle of
nowhere called Earth.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Much of what I'm about to
talk about in a little bit.

00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:22.850 align:middle line:84%
There's a choice in life
that many people have chosen.

00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:28.130 align:middle line:84%
It's either to do external
Merkaba, which isn't just that.

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:29.960 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if you got in
one of these things

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.880 align:middle line:90%
and you flew to a new planet.

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:35.990 align:middle line:84%
Now that you have
externalized your powers,

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:37.700 align:middle line:84%
then you externalize
it in a form

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:43.240 align:middle line:84%
also, once you get there, in
terms of buildings and all

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:46.980 align:middle line:84%
this other stuff and everything,
all the stuff, clothes,

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:50.800 align:middle line:84%
everything that we have,
gets externalized also.

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And so it becomes an
externalized civilization

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:58.430 align:middle line:84%
which is the direct result
of the Lucifer rebellion.

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:04.080 align:middle line:84%
So in truth, anybody who's
flying around in these things

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:08.040 align:middle line:84%
and anybody who has what
we call high sophisticated

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:11.450 align:middle line:84%
civilizations or even low
sophisticated civilizations,

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:14.740 align:middle line:84%
is to one degree or another
involved in the Lucifer

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:17.090 align:middle line:90%
rebellion.

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And the beings who were not
don't have any external stuff

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:24.760 align:middle line:90%
at all going on.

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.800 align:middle line:84%
An example of that, the perfect
example that we have right here

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.640 align:middle line:90%
on Earth is the dolphin.

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:34.450 align:middle line:84%
That's a being that is way
beyond where we are right now,

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:37.660 align:middle line:84%
but they don't have any
externalized stuff at all,

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:39.960 align:middle line:84%
though they were
involved in this.

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:43.840 align:middle line:84%
They have managed to totally
extract themselves from it.

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.470 align:middle line:84%
They were only lightly
involved in it.

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:47.635 align:middle line:84%
They were not real
heavily involved in it

00:25:47.635 --> 00:25:48.650 align:middle line:90%
like some groups.

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And because of it, they
were able to get out of it.

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:55.080 align:middle line:90%
And so now they've done it.

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.085 align:middle line:84%
And if they can do
it, we can do it.

00:25:57.085 --> 00:26:02.290 align:middle line:90%


00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:07.640 align:middle line:84%
But there is far more life
out there-- way, way, way, way

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.520 align:middle line:84%
more life out
there-- than beings

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:18.020 align:middle line:84%
who are involved in UFOs, or the
externalized Merkabas, who live

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:20.160 align:middle line:90%
with internalized Merkabas.

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And the vast majority of
them don't even have bodies.

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:30.110 align:middle line:84%
They don't have any physicalness
associated with them at all.

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:36.080 align:middle line:84%
It may seem unusual to--
it's hard to imagine

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:36.880 align:middle line:90%
that kind of life.

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:37.921 align:middle line:90%
That's where I came from.

00:26:37.921 --> 00:26:41.350 align:middle line:84%
I came from a place
where there was

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:48.220 align:middle line:84%
no distinction between oneness,
or one thing and another thing.

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:50.300 align:middle line:84%
It was an all-inclusive
light field

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.610 align:middle line:84%
that extended everywhere
and throughout everything.

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:57.500 align:middle line:84%
So there was nothing
externalized whatsoever at all.

00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:00.340 align:middle line:84%
So we have a choice
between either a living

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:06.430 align:middle line:84%
field or to continue
in this kind of way.

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:09.820 align:middle line:90%
And it's our choice.

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:12.710 align:middle line:84%
We have that right because
we have God within us.

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:15.470 align:middle line:90%
And so we can do either one.

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:22.700 align:middle line:84%
But if we make the choice
to move to a living field,

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:26.430 align:middle line:90%
all I can say is it's not easy.

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:27.780 align:middle line:90%
It's not easy at all.

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:29.300 align:middle line:84%
It's hard because
we are addicted.

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:31.380 align:middle line:90%
We are on a drug.

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:32.940 align:middle line:90%
It's a very heavy duty drug.

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:35.385 align:middle line:84%
It's submerged right into
the core of our being.

00:27:35.385 --> 00:27:37.730 align:middle line:90%
It's like heroin or something.

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And it takes
tremendous will power.

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:44.310 align:middle line:84%
It starts with a place
where you decide that you're

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:47.060 align:middle line:90%
going to be free again.

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:51.045 align:middle line:84%
But without it-- and as you
can see, look at this room

00:27:51.045 --> 00:27:53.410 align:middle line:90%
we're emerged in all our life.

00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:56.350 align:middle line:90%
Could any of us be free of this?

00:27:56.350 --> 00:28:00.520 align:middle line:84%
Could we live in a
way without this?

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:01.450 align:middle line:90%
It's not easy.

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:04.680 align:middle line:90%


00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.520 align:middle line:84%
We can hardly go
from week to week

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:09.900 align:middle line:84%
without money that
we have to have.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.175 align:middle line:84%
They've got us addicted on
every conceivable level we

00:28:12.175 --> 00:28:15.640 align:middle line:84%
can think of, and then
further addictions onto that.

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:16.890 align:middle line:90%
It's not just drugs.

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:18.430 align:middle line:90%
That's only part of it.

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:21.330 align:middle line:90%
It's the whole way of being.

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And this starts getting
into other things,

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:27.660 align:middle line:84%
like the secret governments
and all the things that

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:34.330 align:middle line:84%
are behind this, stretching
back deep into space.

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:37.880 align:middle line:84%
There's a great deal
of stuff going on here.

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:43.640 align:middle line:84%
But once you do get out,
you start getting clear,

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:47.550 align:middle line:84%
and your heart starts opening
up and starts feeling better.

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:53.110 align:middle line:84%
But it takes a long
time for the vibrations

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:59.405 align:middle line:84%
of those various drugs to leave,
because they're always pulling.

00:28:59.405 --> 00:29:01.570 align:middle line:84%
It's always pulling,
because some of them

00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:05.520 align:middle line:84%
are very pleasurable
and very beautiful.

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:11.460 align:middle line:90%


00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:12.870 align:middle line:90%
We can do it.

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:16.710 align:middle line:84%
Once we get to the other side
and we reach the living field,

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:20.130 align:middle line:84%
the beauty and the
light is greater

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:23.740 align:middle line:84%
than anything of the
darkness, absolutely anything.

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:26.925 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing in the
darkness that can come close.

00:29:26.925 --> 00:29:29.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, here's the
darkness all around.

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:31.930 align:middle line:90%
It is enclosing it.

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:37.690 align:middle line:84%
But the light is something
of extraordinary beauty.

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And eventually it
leads to something

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:42.700 align:middle line:90%
even beyond light and dark.

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:45.120 align:middle line:84%
>>You may be addressing
this very question

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.050 align:middle line:90%
right this minute.

00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:49.270 align:middle line:84%
I'll ask it, and if it
is, please take over.

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:53.010 align:middle line:84%
I just have a bit of
a problem believing

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:57.010 align:middle line:84%
that God is anything other
than God, God is all that

00:29:57.010 --> 00:30:00.520 align:middle line:84%
is, is anything other than
love, and that God could create

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:03.930 align:middle line:84%
anything that was less
than beauty and perfection

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:05.140 align:middle line:90%
and light.

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, that if this
decision to create a Lucifer

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:15.290 align:middle line:84%
was-- if that decision was
made and that polarization

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:18.200 align:middle line:84%
started at that point,
that there was a higher

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.630 align:middle line:90%
purpose still to that.

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:21.630 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>>So it's not so
terrible that we're--

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:27.880 align:middle line:84%
>>Obviously God knew what he was
doing when he created Lucifer.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And so Lucifer obviously
is working with God.

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:39.457 align:middle line:84%
So from our Christian
point of view down here,

00:30:39.457 --> 00:30:40.540 align:middle line:90%
we don't want to see that.

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:42.420 align:middle line:84%
We want to separate
it into the devil

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:44.860 align:middle line:84%
and to God, which
we've done, and we've

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:47.980 align:middle line:84%
made the devil almost
as strong as God,

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:49.790 align:middle line:90%
and there's this war going on.

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:51.310 align:middle line:90%
But it's not a war.

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:54.520 align:middle line:84%
It's a very intricate
plan from God.

00:30:54.520 --> 00:31:00.167 align:middle line:84%
And there is no-- like I said
before, I think I did in here.

00:31:00.167 --> 00:31:01.750 align:middle line:84%
Did I talk about the
white brotherhood

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:02.480 align:middle line:90%
and the dark brotherhood?

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:03.377 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:31:03.377 --> 00:31:04.868 align:middle line:90%
>>I thought I did.

00:31:04.868 --> 00:31:09.341 align:middle line:90%


00:31:09.341 --> 00:31:11.329 align:middle line:90%
I'm losing it in my old age.

00:31:11.329 --> 00:31:16.796 align:middle line:90%


00:31:16.796 --> 00:31:18.287 align:middle line:90%
I think I did.

00:31:18.287 --> 00:31:22.290 align:middle line:90%


00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:26.990 align:middle line:84%
I didn't talk about the
great white brotherhood

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:28.360 align:middle line:90%
and the dark brotherhood?

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.310 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:32.430 align:middle line:90%
>>There is two primary forces.

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:33.810 align:middle line:90%
There's really more than that.

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:35.060 align:middle line:90%
There's neutral, et cetera.

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:39.170 align:middle line:84%
But there's two primary forces,
the light and the darkness.

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And we tend to think the
light are the good guys

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:44.640 align:middle line:84%
and the dark are the bad
guys and this kind of thing.

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.680 align:middle line:84%
From the Melchizedek point of
view, this just isn't true.

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:52.610 align:middle line:84%
This is a result of our
polarization consciousness

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:55.845 align:middle line:84%
from where we are, the
interpretation as we look out

00:31:55.845 --> 00:31:59.240 align:middle line:84%
of our eyeballs, resulting
from the way that we breathe.

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:02.622 align:middle line:84%
But in truth beyond
this, in the unity place,

00:32:02.622 --> 00:32:06.560 align:middle line:84%
though I have chosen
to work with light,

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:09.980 align:middle line:84%
I see the dark side
also as my brothers.

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And you see, if you take a
planet like planet Earth,

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:19.560 align:middle line:84%
or it could be a person
or anything else,

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.685 align:middle line:84%
the dark side comes
in and does everything

00:32:22.685 --> 00:32:26.880 align:middle line:84%
that it can to stop that
planet from evolving.

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:28.916 align:middle line:90%
That's its job.

00:32:28.916 --> 00:32:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And then the light force
comes in and does everything

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:35.770 align:middle line:90%
that it can to evolve it.

00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:39.240 align:middle line:90%
And so it appears like a battle.

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.590 align:middle line:84%
But really, they're
working together,

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:44.350 align:middle line:84%
and they're functioning
very closely together.

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose behind
it all is so that timing

00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:50.820 align:middle line:84%
results at the right moment,
so that the moment when

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:55.060 align:middle line:84%
the planet either
goes up or down,

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:58.350 align:middle line:84%
whichever side wins
or loses, happens

00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:00.670 align:middle line:90%
at a very precise moment.

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's very much like
giving birth to a baby.

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:07.050 align:middle line:84%
You want the baby to
be born at nine months.

00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:09.240 align:middle line:84%
You don't want the baby
to be born at two months

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:12.840 align:middle line:84%
or four months or 12 years,
or something like that.

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.270 align:middle line:90%
You want it at nine months.

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:16.690 align:middle line:90%
So the timing is very important.

00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at life
carefully, everything in life

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:20.330 align:middle line:90%
is timing.

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:22.820 align:middle line:84%
It's things happening
at the right moment.

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And things happening
at the right moment

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:27.120 align:middle line:84%
is the result of
the dark brotherhood

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:30.080 align:middle line:84%
and the light brotherhood
working together as one.

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:33.120 align:middle line:90%


00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And so good and evil are
just-- they're necessary.

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:40.420 align:middle line:90%
They're important.

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:41.960 align:middle line:90%
Both sides are important.

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:46.010 align:middle line:84%
They have to be there for at
least in the level of life

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:48.200 align:middle line:90%
that we are in now.

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:50.420 align:middle line:84%
>>I had a really
important question.

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:54.130 align:middle line:84%
You begin explaining to
us the double helical form

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:57.640 align:middle line:90%
of the Tree of Life.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.730 align:middle line:84%
Are we existing in the
double helical structure

00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:01.480 align:middle line:84%
of the Tree of Life
or the one you've been

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:03.430 align:middle line:90%
teaching us the whole class?

00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>>No, we are physically
on the double helical one.

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:10.199 align:middle line:84%
The one I taught is the one
that-- I won't say should have,

00:34:10.199 --> 00:34:12.620 align:middle line:84%
just the one that
we could have taken.

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:13.630 align:middle line:90%
But we didn't.

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:16.969 align:middle line:84%
We took the one with two eyes
and a double helical pattern.

00:34:16.969 --> 00:34:22.310 align:middle line:84%
>>My question is, why does the
symbol of the-- I'm taking it,

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:25.429 align:middle line:84%
the vortex pattern, it's the
only way I can describe it,

00:34:25.429 --> 00:34:28.500 align:middle line:84%
the flower of life--
they both apply though?

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:29.820 align:middle line:90%
You could use both?

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:32.719 align:middle line:84%
And they do the same-- they
have the same laws, everything,

00:34:32.719 --> 00:34:34.070 align:middle line:90%
geometry, everything--

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:35.880 align:middle line:84%
>>They created the
exact same reality.

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:37.710 align:middle line:90%
It's an identical reality.

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:39.610 align:middle line:90%
It's like a parallel reality.

00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:42.640 align:middle line:84%
The only difference is the
person who takes this one--

00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:43.440 align:middle line:90%
>>The double?

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:45.064 align:middle line:84%
>>The double helical
one, interprets it

00:34:45.064 --> 00:34:47.646 align:middle line:84%
differently than the one
who has a single eye.

00:34:47.646 --> 00:34:49.495 align:middle line:84%
>>How did we come up
with the vortex one?

00:34:49.495 --> 00:34:50.870 align:middle line:84%
How come we never
see any symbols

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:53.400 align:middle line:84%
with the double helical
pattern on the planet and only

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:54.200 align:middle line:90%
spherical?

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Is it trying to remind
us to make a choice

00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:57.565 align:middle line:90%
to move towards that?

00:34:57.565 --> 00:34:58.750 align:middle line:90%
>>I didn't understand that.

00:34:58.750 --> 00:34:59.340 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:01.465 align:middle line:84%
The only symbols that I've
seen that you've show us

00:35:01.465 --> 00:35:04.640 align:middle line:84%
around the world
of the Tree of Life

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:06.234 align:middle line:90%
are based on the vortex pattern.

00:35:06.234 --> 00:35:08.025 align:middle line:84%
They're not based on
the double helical one

00:35:08.025 --> 00:35:10.640 align:middle line:90%
that you've shown us.

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.330 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, that's true.

00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>>Is that a process of
trying to remind us?

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:17.310 align:middle line:90%
Is that what that's all about?

00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Do there exist double helical
patterns of the flower of life?

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:23.569 align:middle line:90%
And what is the significance?

00:35:23.569 --> 00:35:25.610 align:middle line:84%
I understand the significance
that you just made,

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:28.320 align:middle line:84%
but what's the existence
or the significance

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:30.330 align:middle line:84%
of the-- they're
nonexistent, that pattern,

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:32.430 align:middle line:84%
and nobody learning
the basic technology--

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:34.450 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, the other pattern
does exist out there.

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:37.590 align:middle line:84%
It is on [? Wasp ?] It isn't
that it doesn't exist out

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:38.400 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:43.600 align:middle line:84%
But it is that all the world's
major religions have all

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:52.810 align:middle line:84%
come to the agreeing that--
that ultimately everyone

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:58.151 align:middle line:84%
feels that this is probably
the best way, I guess.

00:35:58.151 --> 00:36:00.370 align:middle line:90%
This is like a sacred symbol.

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:03.740 align:middle line:90%
But it is not what we have done.

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:12.920 align:middle line:84%
However, realize, we only really
fell into Lucifer rebellion--

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.040 align:middle line:90%
there's good, evil, and neutral.

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:17.705 align:middle line:90%


00:36:17.705 --> 00:36:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And there's proton,
electron, neutron.

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:21.555 align:middle line:90%
There is threeness.

00:36:21.555 --> 00:36:21.712 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:36:21.712 --> 00:36:23.370 align:middle line:84%
That's what I've
talked about before.

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:24.650 align:middle line:90%
But I was just breaking it in.

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:27.900 align:middle line:84%
But there are neutral beings,
and they're very important.

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:30.881 align:middle line:84%
But all they do is
just sit and watch.

00:36:30.881 --> 00:36:36.760 align:middle line:84%
The cyclops, the beginning ones,
have one eye a long time ago.

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:39.040 align:middle line:90%
But that's in physical form.

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:42.170 align:middle line:84%
When you get into the
higher forms of light,

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:44.402 align:middle line:84%
the higher forms
have a single eye.

00:36:44.402 --> 00:36:50.570 align:middle line:84%
But the eye is a sphere,
and it's all they are.

00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:52.575 align:middle line:90%
And it sees 360 degrees.

00:36:52.575 --> 00:36:56.540 align:middle line:90%


00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And so it's just a sphere of
light, like the Arcturians,

00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:03.890 align:middle line:84%
for example, which is
the highest form that we

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:06.140 align:middle line:90%
have in this galaxy.

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:08.690 align:middle line:90%
They're little spheres of light.

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:10.390 align:middle line:84%
They're alive,
that's their body.

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And they're a single
eye, and they look out

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.475 align:middle line:90%
in all directions at once.

00:37:15.475 --> 00:37:19.520 align:middle line:90%


00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:21.680 align:middle line:84%
But there's higher
levels than that.

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:23.630 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>>I went to a workshop
or something recently.

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And somebody said something
that really irritated me,

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.480 align:middle line:84%
so I had to think about
it for a long time.

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And what they said was,
their understanding

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:38.950 align:middle line:84%
was in relationships in
life, that if somebody

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:41.920 align:middle line:84%
were to be around
you and cause you

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:46.240 align:middle line:84%
a lot of pain or difficulty,
that they were actually

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:49.443 align:middle line:84%
somebody who really holds a
great deal of love for you

00:37:49.443 --> 00:37:51.350 align:middle line:84%
and agreed to come
back and afflict you

00:37:51.350 --> 00:37:53.570 align:middle line:84%
with this kind of
pain to help you.

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:54.419 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm serious.

00:37:54.419 --> 00:37:55.877 align:middle line:84%
And I thought about
it for a while,

00:37:55.877 --> 00:37:58.530 align:middle line:84%
and I was like, get
the hell out of here.

00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:01.400 align:middle line:84%
But the more I began to think
about it was why it imitated

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:04.985 align:middle line:84%
me was because it took away my
anger and hatred for the person

00:38:04.985 --> 00:38:07.970 align:middle line:84%
and maybe actually look
at what the problem was.

00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:10.580 align:middle line:84%
And I kinda really preferred
to just be really pissed off

00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:11.996 align:middle line:90%
at the person.

00:38:11.996 --> 00:38:15.240 align:middle line:84%
But it was that good
and evil thing again.

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And once I took that away and I
stopped looking at that person

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:21.460 align:middle line:84%
as being mean to me and
actually doing me a favor--

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:22.960 align:middle line:84%
whether it's true
or not, it really

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:26.080 align:middle line:84%
became irrelevant-- it
still took that away,

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.930 align:middle line:84%
and I had no choice
at that point

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:30.800 align:middle line:84%
but to focus on what the problem
was and then get rid of it

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:33.660 align:middle line:84%
and actually thank them,
although I didn't do that.

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:36.710 align:middle line:84%
That took a lot, but
I didn't get that far.

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:39.920 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, we grow in the
negative situations

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:42.770 align:middle line:84%
faster than we do in
the positive ones.

00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:45.050 align:middle line:84%
When everything's just
running along smooth and great

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:48.300 align:middle line:84%
and nothing's going on and
everything's comfortable,

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:50.280 align:middle line:84%
we're on a plateau and
nothing much happens.

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:54.030 align:middle line:84%
It's only when something heavy
duty comes along and blows us

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:58.870 align:middle line:84%
out of the water that we tend to
make the changes and the steps

00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:59.670 align:middle line:90%
to do it.

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:03.340 align:middle line:84%
So the negativity
causes rapid growth.

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:07.090 align:middle line:84%
If we didn't have
any negativity,

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:08.580 align:middle line:90%
we wouldn't be here.

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:12.536 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where we would
be, but we wouldn't be here.

00:39:12.536 --> 00:39:15.260 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>>Is it possible to change
from the double helix

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:21.312 align:middle line:90%
to the single eye?

00:39:21.312 --> 00:39:23.270 align:middle line:84%
>>That's what we're
attempting to do right now.

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:24.190 align:middle line:90%
>>That will do it?

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:30.520 align:middle line:84%
>>By attempting to reestablish
the other way of breathing

00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:32.850 align:middle line:84%
and to reconnect
the living field.

00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:37.420 align:middle line:84%
If we're capable of doing
this, then we can sidestep.

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:40.310 align:middle line:84%
We step from one reality
to the other one,

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:42.555 align:middle line:84%
and our eye becomes
single and our body

00:39:42.555 --> 00:39:43.850 align:middle line:90%
becomes filled with light.

00:39:43.850 --> 00:39:47.000 align:middle line:90%
We literally become light.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's a possibility
that's always there.

00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:52.920 align:middle line:90%
It works the other way around.

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:54.420 align:middle line:84%
It's a possibility
for someone who's

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:56.750 align:middle line:84%
in light to switch back
over to the other side

00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:59.670 align:middle line:90%
too, to the other possibility.

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>>Would this happen for
all beings on the Earth

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:04.317 align:middle line:90%
when it does happen?

00:40:04.317 --> 00:40:05.900 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, we're going
to talk about that

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:08.360 align:middle line:90%
in just a little bit.

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:10.020 align:middle line:90%
>>Just a couple questions.

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:13.670 align:middle line:84%
One is that-- and I truly
feel this from my heart,

00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:16.350 align:middle line:84%
and it's been bothering
me for many years,

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:21.140 align:middle line:84%
that I feel I have a very
strong Lucifer connection

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:24.860 align:middle line:84%
but not because I'm of the
dark side, so to speak.

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:30.550 align:middle line:84%
But Lucifer was on one side
of God and Jesus on the other.

00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And Lucifer was the
brightest of angels.

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:36.980 align:middle line:84%
And my true feeling
is that instead

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:40.740 align:middle line:84%
of he deciding to become
a god or better than God,

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:43.180 align:middle line:84%
I think he gave the
ultimate sacrifice

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:47.810 align:middle line:84%
to create a new situation,
whereas that even love can

00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:49.250 align:middle line:90%
move.

00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:51.380 align:middle line:84%
In order for love
to move, it has

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:53.720 align:middle line:84%
to go to somewhere
from somewhere.

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And if love is the same,
it really doesn't move.

00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:58.450 align:middle line:90%
It just exists.

00:40:58.450 --> 00:41:01.342 align:middle line:84%
So love in itself
has a polarity,

00:41:01.342 --> 00:41:05.725 align:middle line:84%
and Lucifer and Jesus, they
went their separate ways.

00:41:05.725 --> 00:41:07.100 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
what we're going

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:09.180 align:middle line:84%
through now, and
eventually-- in fact,

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:12.250 align:middle line:84%
very soon-- there will
be a reunion of the love.

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:14.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think at this
point the love will even

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:17.710 align:middle line:84%
be more powerful than
it was originally.

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:21.340 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, this is why, for those
of you who saw the video,

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:28.820 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] tell the story about
when I was faced with Lucifer.

00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:30.620 align:middle line:84%
That was in that
video, wasn't it?

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:33.000 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.530 align:middle line:84%
>>Lucifer, when he found out
I was here, he came to me

00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:40.700 align:middle line:84%
and he said, he wanted to
know, what are you going to do?

00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:43.650 align:middle line:90%


00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And I told him that
we were here to find

00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:49.490 align:middle line:90%
a solution for everybody.

00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:51.480 align:middle line:84%
We weren't looking
for a solution

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:55.500 align:middle line:84%
to save part of a people and
let the other ones go to hell.

00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:59.550 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to find a solution
that all beings and all light

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:03.200 align:middle line:84%
everywhere, no matter how
far down they had fallen

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:06.710 align:middle line:84%
or how far up they had risen,
that all beings everywhere

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:09.260 align:middle line:84%
could come together
and love again.

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:12.430 align:middle line:84%
And when he heard that, he
just stepped away and says,

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:14.730 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'll leave you alone.

00:42:14.730 --> 00:42:18.206 align:middle line:84%
And he has not
hindered me at all.

00:42:18.206 --> 00:42:20.680 align:middle line:90%
He has not tried to stop me.

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:22.940 align:middle line:84%
This goes right
down the governments

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:25.530 align:middle line:84%
and the secret governments
and all the various people

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:26.840 align:middle line:90%
that are associated with that.

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:29.070 align:middle line:90%
I can move right through them.

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:31.380 align:middle line:84%
They just step
aside and let me go.

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:35.880 align:middle line:84%
They won't try and stop
me, because I am looking

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:39.330 align:middle line:90%
for a universal solution.

00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:43.550 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, if I was looking
just to save the good guys,

00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:48.530 align:middle line:84%
he would have fought tooth and
nail to try to save himself

00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:52.770 align:middle line:84%
and all that were connected
of him, which is his right.

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:54.030 align:middle line:90%
I recognize that road.

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:57.490 align:middle line:84%
>>One other thought that keeps
coming in stronger and stronger

00:42:57.490 --> 00:43:02.090 align:middle line:84%
is that the solution to
unity is very, very simple.

00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's as simple
as just accepting

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:08.620 align:middle line:84%
with gratitude and love Lucifer
and everything they've done.

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And that will be a catalyst for
the reuniting of the spirit.

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, a lot of
times, things are very

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:22.270 align:middle line:90%
simple to say it like that.

00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:25.770 align:middle line:84%
But to actually get
all people-- it's like,

00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:29.620 align:middle line:84%
a good example is the
Israelites and the Arabs.

00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:31.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's really
easy to say, well,

00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:37.120 align:middle line:84%
all you guys gotta do is
just love one another.

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:41.580 align:middle line:84%
But they've got so many roots
of hatred and pain and stuff

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:45.650 align:middle line:84%
inside of there that the
solution is very, very

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:49.007 align:middle line:84%
difficult. And it's
still going on.

00:43:49.007 --> 00:43:51.340 align:middle line:84%
One goes over and bombs the
other one, and the other one

00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:53.560 align:middle line:84%
bombs the other one, and
it's just this ping pong

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:54.970 align:middle line:90%
match going back and forth.

00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:56.880 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, if
someone's going

00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:58.880 align:middle line:84%
to find the solution
over there, it's

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:03.120 align:middle line:90%
going to have to be pure genius.

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:05.580 align:middle line:84%
Something of pure genius
is going to take place.

00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:08.066 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
it will take place.

00:44:08.066 --> 00:44:13.840 align:middle line:84%
>>The one thought that also came
in very strong is to actually--

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:16.780 align:middle line:84%
and this is contrary to
how we all probably feel,

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:20.920 align:middle line:84%
is ask Lucifer to assist
in the unification.

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:23.720 align:middle line:84%
Instead of fighting
him, ask for assistance.

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:26.850 align:middle line:90%
>>He already is.

00:44:26.850 --> 00:44:30.730 align:middle line:84%
The assistance actually
between Lucifer and Jesus,

00:44:30.730 --> 00:44:33.659 align:middle line:84%
though they have a polarity
and they have their places

00:44:33.659 --> 00:44:35.200 align:middle line:84%
on the dark side
and the light side--

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:36.860 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather, instead
of giving names

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:39.490 align:middle line:84%
to a particular people just
say the dark brotherhood

00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:42.230 align:middle line:84%
and the light brotherhood,
because there's

00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:46.530 align:middle line:84%
many more people involved
in either side than those.

00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:51.900 align:middle line:84%
But the two forces
of dark and light,

00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:55.725 align:middle line:84%
who have not really been
resisting each other

00:44:55.725 --> 00:44:59.590 align:middle line:84%
but resisting the third
component in the middle,

00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:05.470 align:middle line:84%
or controlling the component
that the forces are working on,

00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:12.240 align:middle line:84%
like whatever the life form
is-- and the very principle

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:16.350 align:middle line:84%
of this way of moving
between dark and light

00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:20.100 align:middle line:84%
has failed in the
past every time.

00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:21.020 align:middle line:90%
It's always failed.

00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:24.070 align:middle line:90%
It's always ended up in war.

00:45:24.070 --> 00:45:25.950 align:middle line:84%
It's always ended
up in both sides--

00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:29.790 align:middle line:84%
instead of cooperating or
working together in love

00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:33.100 align:middle line:84%
and trying to find
a way for all life,

00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:35.140 align:middle line:84%
it's always resulted
in both sides ending up

00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:39.270 align:middle line:84%
in an all-out battle
on every level,

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:42.020 align:middle line:84%
resulting in Mars being
totally wiped out,

00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:44.380 align:middle line:84%
along with thousands and
thousands and thousands

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:46.770 align:middle line:84%
and thousands of
other places that

00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:49.430 align:middle line:90%
were just totally destroyed.

00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:51.580 align:middle line:84%
All out, full tilt
war, which has

00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:53.850 align:middle line:90%
happened time and time again.

00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And we're right on the
verge of that right

00:45:57.730 --> 00:45:59.290 align:middle line:90%
now throughout the universe.

00:45:59.290 --> 00:46:01.200 align:middle line:90%
There's more of that.

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:02.890 align:middle line:90%
We're just a reflection.

00:46:02.890 --> 00:46:05.390 align:middle line:84%
The Earth is simply a
reflection of what's out there.

00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And there's a similar kind
of thing stretching out

00:46:09.070 --> 00:46:10.710 align:middle line:90%
where life wants to do that.

00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And yet there is-- what's now
occurring is for the first time

00:46:16.330 --> 00:46:21.600 align:middle line:84%
ever, it appears as
though God, meaning us

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:26.110 align:middle line:84%
from outside the system
before it was created,

00:46:26.110 --> 00:46:30.685 align:middle line:84%
has decided to
intervene directly.

00:46:30.685 --> 00:46:32.166 align:middle line:90%
It never did before, ever.

00:46:32.166 --> 00:46:33.540 align:middle line:84%
There was no
intervention before,

00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:35.490 align:middle line:84%
and we always ended up
with [CRACKING SOUND]

00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:40.160 align:middle line:84%
But now there appears to be
something totally different

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:41.420 align:middle line:90%
happening here.

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:42.810 align:middle line:90%
It's never happened before.

00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:45.562 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I'm going to have
to explain it and get into it,

00:46:45.562 --> 00:46:47.190 align:middle line:84%
because we haven't
talked about it yet.

00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:52.020 align:middle line:84%
But it's almost as
though neither side,

00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:54.270 align:middle line:84%
neither the dark brotherhood
or the light brotherhood,

00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:59.020 align:middle line:84%
were able to find an
answer on their own.

00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And what the
interesting part is is

00:47:01.310 --> 00:47:04.570 align:middle line:84%
that God had the answer, if
this is the answer that's

00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:06.600 align:middle line:84%
occurring right now,
had the answered

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:11.210 align:middle line:84%
buried as a little tiny
seed in between the two,

00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:13.790 align:middle line:90%
along from the very beginning.

00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:15.470 align:middle line:90%
From the very, very beginning.

00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:17.340 align:middle line:90%
And nobody ever saw it.

00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:19.550 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knew it was there.

00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:22.390 align:middle line:84%
Until it came down
to, we needed to find

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:28.030 align:middle line:84%
an answer for a certain problem,
and there was only one answer

00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:29.670 align:middle line:90%
in the entire universe.

00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:32.580 align:middle line:90%
The little seed was hidden.

00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And when that little
seed was used,

00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:37.810 align:middle line:84%
no one dreamed
that the seed would

00:47:37.810 --> 00:47:40.210 align:middle line:84%
grow to something
of the proportions

00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:42.190 align:middle line:90%
that it's growing to.

00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:45.480 align:middle line:84%
It was only meant
to work on a planet,

00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:47.310 align:middle line:84%
and instead the
seed was growing,

00:47:47.310 --> 00:47:54.060 align:middle line:84%
and is now affecting all life
everywhere, without exception.

00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:55.990 align:middle line:90%
And this is occurring right now.

00:47:55.990 --> 00:48:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's only been 21
years in Earth time

00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:02.150 align:middle line:90%
since the seed was planted.

00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:05.530 align:middle line:90%


00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>>A lot of the teachers
were saying about two years

00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:11.600 align:middle line:84%
or so ago that each
individual had already

00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:16.210 align:middle line:84%
decided that polarity, light
or dark, and that the way had

00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:20.010 align:middle line:90%
been divided, so to speak.

00:48:20.010 --> 00:48:22.470 align:middle line:84%
It always sounded
rather hopeless to me

00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:25.260 align:middle line:84%
that somebody couldn't change
their mind and say, oh wow,

00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:26.890 align:middle line:90%
I see it now.

00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:29.470 align:middle line:84%
But what you're
saying is that we now

00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:31.980 align:middle line:84%
have a chance that the whole
thing can move forward,

00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:36.000 align:middle line:84%
or is there still that
faction that have said,

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.430 align:middle line:90%
no, I will stay with the dark?

00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:41.370 align:middle line:90%


00:48:41.370 --> 00:48:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, everybody has to choose
either the dark or the light

00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:45.020 align:middle line:90%
or both.

00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:50.030 align:middle line:90%


00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And these guys, that's
what these guys have done.

00:48:55.130 --> 00:48:57.710 align:middle line:84%
These guys have chosen
both, this particular group.

00:48:57.710 --> 00:49:02.640 align:middle line:84%
These are the Pleiadians
that come from [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And they sometimes play
the dark brotherhood

00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:09.350 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes play
the light brotherhood,

00:49:09.350 --> 00:49:12.040 align:middle line:84%
depending on what they
feel will bring the best

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:13.464 align:middle line:90%
balance for the whole thing.

00:49:13.464 --> 00:49:15.630 align:middle line:84%
If the light gets too strong,
they'll play the dark.

00:49:15.630 --> 00:49:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And if the dark gets too
strong, they'll play the light.

00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And right now they're
playing the dark,

00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:26.662 align:middle line:84%
because the light is
now getting stronger.

00:49:26.662 --> 00:49:28.370 align:middle line:84%
The light's considerably
getting stronger

00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:29.880 align:middle line:90%
than the darkness on earth.

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>>So these are Pleiadians
rather than the Greys?

00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:36.220 align:middle line:90%
>>They're Pleiadian, yes.

00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:37.880 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, are some
of the Pleiadians

00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:40.510 align:middle line:90%
actually mixed with the Greys?

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:43.020 align:middle line:90%
>>They're supporting the Greys

00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>>But I thought the Greys had
been taken off the planet.

00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:47.690 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, this was all
done a long time ago.

00:49:47.690 --> 00:49:50.950 align:middle line:84%
These photographs were
taken a long time ago.

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:57.470 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I don't know if
she's allows the Pleiadians--

00:49:57.470 --> 00:49:59.330 align:middle line:84%
when we say Pleiadians,
that's a big place.

00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:01.170 align:middle line:90%
There's lots of Pleiadians.

00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:03.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking
about the Pleiadians

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:05.290 align:middle line:84%
that most people
are familiar with.

00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:08.330 align:middle line:84%
This is another group, though
they're very beautiful people.

00:50:08.330 --> 00:50:12.200 align:middle line:84%
Almost all the Pleiadians
are very beautiful.

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:15.270 align:middle line:84%
This group has a long time
ago seen the situation.

00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:17.340 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they saw it
from the very beginning,

00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:20.040 align:middle line:84%
the moment Lucifer
made the division.

00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:22.624 align:middle line:84%
And most people went,
whoosh, like this.

00:50:22.624 --> 00:50:23.540 align:middle line:90%
They just sorta went--

00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:31.170 align:middle line:90%


00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:33.940 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the vast majority
didn't even do this.

00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:36.040 align:middle line:90%
It moved back.

00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:41.420 align:middle line:84%
The vast majority did not
react one way or the other

00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:46.190 align:middle line:84%
because they knew that once
you react, then you're in it.

00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:47.390 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:49.880 align:middle line:84%
So the vast majority
is silent, and it

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:53.340 align:middle line:84%
just witnesses and
watches and does not

00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:55.840 align:middle line:90%
do-- I don't care what happens.

00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:56.680 align:middle line:90%
They won't react.

00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:59.150 align:middle line:90%
They won't help, nor not help.

00:50:59.150 --> 00:51:01.690 align:middle line:90%
They won't assist or unassist.

00:51:01.690 --> 00:51:04.710 align:middle line:90%
They'll just witness.

00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's the position that
the huge majority of life

00:51:09.550 --> 00:51:12.050 align:middle line:90%
has taken.

00:51:12.050 --> 00:51:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And this little thing
is happening inside.

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:20.810 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like a body
that is with, you might say,

00:51:20.810 --> 00:51:23.825 align:middle line:90%
a small area of disease in it.

00:51:23.825 --> 00:51:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And so you've got a part that's
polarized inside of here,

00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:31.060 align:middle line:84%
where the rest of
the body is watching.

00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:33.840 align:middle line:90%
It's definitely watching.

00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:40.640 align:middle line:84%
It's very concerned about it,
but it won't interact directly.

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:46.750 align:middle line:84%
Arcturus has decided
to come into this

00:51:46.750 --> 00:51:49.330 align:middle line:90%
on the side of the light.

00:51:49.330 --> 00:51:56.700 align:middle line:90%
And they have done a lot.

00:51:56.700 --> 00:52:03.030 align:middle line:84%
Very, very subtle, subtle
work, trying to balance things,

00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:07.100 align:middle line:84%
especially when they've
been around for a long time.

00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:12.070 align:middle line:84%
They're just kind of being known
in the last 15, 20 years or so.

00:52:12.070 --> 00:52:14.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm only going by the
ones that-- one time they

00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:17.089 align:middle line:84%
sat down and talked to
me about various things.

00:52:17.089 --> 00:52:18.047 align:middle line:90%
>>What about Andromeda?

00:52:18.047 --> 00:52:21.370 align:middle line:90%


00:52:21.370 --> 00:52:23.170 align:middle line:84%
>>I believe, if
I remember right,

00:52:23.170 --> 00:52:25.410 align:middle line:84%
that they're also on
the side of the light.

00:52:25.410 --> 00:52:28.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm pretty sure they are.

00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:30.664 align:middle line:90%
So I only know a few of them.

00:52:30.664 --> 00:52:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, there
seems to be a-- they're not

00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:38.435 align:middle line:84%
a real advanced race,
compared to the Arcturians,

00:52:38.435 --> 00:52:42.720 align:middle line:90%
who are light years apart.

00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:48.330 align:middle line:84%
We discovered on Mars first
of all, this photograph.

00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:53.180 align:middle line:84%
I think this was the
Mariner 9, I think it was.

00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:58.700 align:middle line:84%
It's Mariner frame 1205-78E,
whatever that means.

00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And they discovered these
tetrahedral pyramids on Mars.

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:06.696 align:middle line:90%
They're enormous and huge.

00:53:06.696 --> 00:53:07.820 align:middle line:90%
You can see them down here.

00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:11.190 align:middle line:84%
That's the actual
NASA frame up here.

00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And you can see these
pyramids or tetrahedrons,

00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:18.060 align:middle line:84%
to be more precise,
these enormous,

00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:22.030 align:middle line:84%
who knows how many miles
high, tetrahedrons.

00:53:22.030 --> 00:53:27.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course that could have
just been a phenomenon of Mars,

00:53:27.050 --> 00:53:29.680 align:middle line:84%
which would have
been interesting.

00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:33.440 align:middle line:84%
But there they were, these very
accurate tetrahedral structures

00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:35.480 align:middle line:90%
that were sitting on Mars.

00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And then later, it
was Richard Hoagland,

00:53:41.790 --> 00:53:45.790 align:middle line:84%
who found-- it was this
photograph up here,

00:53:45.790 --> 00:53:50.310 align:middle line:84%
this one shot of a
region called Cydonia,

00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:52.450 align:middle line:84%
which has that name--
we've given names

00:53:52.450 --> 00:53:54.930 align:middle line:90%
to all the areas on Mars.

00:53:54.930 --> 00:53:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And they noticed this
little thing right here.

00:53:57.840 --> 00:53:59.404 align:middle line:84%
This looks like the
surface on Mars.

00:53:59.404 --> 00:54:00.820 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't have
thought a thing,

00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:03.870 align:middle line:84%
except that that little
thing right there looks

00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:07.700 align:middle line:90%
a whole lot like a human face.

00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:10.765 align:middle line:84%
NASA said, nah,
and kept on going.

00:54:10.765 --> 00:54:14.140 align:middle line:84%
But Richard Hoagland
took this one face

00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:17.430 align:middle line:84%
and started looking at
it and thinking about it

00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:19.320 align:middle line:84%
and wrote a book
about it, I think,

00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:21.590 align:middle line:84%
called "The Face on
Mars," I believe.

00:54:21.590 --> 00:54:23.660 align:middle line:84%
But he didn't have
a lot of proof.

00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:26.480 align:middle line:84%
He only had one photograph
when he wrote that,

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:28.730 align:middle line:90%
if I remember this correctly.

00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And there was very little
anything that was going on.

00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:35.840 align:middle line:84%
That book was written in
innocence pretty much.

00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:39.336 align:middle line:84%
And then I spent about two hours
and 15 minutes on the telephone

00:54:39.336 --> 00:54:41.835 align:middle line:84%
with Richard Hoagland, right
after he had written that book,

00:54:41.835 --> 00:54:46.640 align:middle line:84%
not too long after, and
he was very, very excited

00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:50.910 align:middle line:84%
because they had finally
found one more slide.

00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:56.300 align:middle line:84%
They went through I think
30,000 frames of the NASA

00:54:56.300 --> 00:55:00.067 align:middle line:84%
things of a person, and had
found another slide, which

00:55:00.067 --> 00:55:00.900 align:middle line:90%
is what they needed.

00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:02.941 align:middle line:84%
They needed the sun angle
at two different angles

00:55:02.941 --> 00:55:04.870 align:middle line:84%
to really be able to
see what was going on

00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:07.669 align:middle line:84%
or do any kind of
digital enhancement

00:55:07.669 --> 00:55:09.460 align:middle line:84%
with a computer or
anything else like that.

00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:12.340 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't do
it from one point.

00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And so they found
this one, which

00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:15.990 align:middle line:90%
had a different sun angle.

00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And when they did that and they
digitally enhanced the face,

00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:23.990 align:middle line:84%
they found eyeballs
and teeth in the face,

00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:27.700 align:middle line:84%
which made them suspect strongly
it wasn't just the wind.

00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:32.140 align:middle line:90%


00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:34.056 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:55:34.056 --> 00:55:41.500 align:middle line:90%


00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:44.622 align:middle line:84%
And so he was very
excited, because I just

00:55:44.622 --> 00:55:46.830 align:middle line:84%
happened to talk to him,
whenever the time was, right

00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:47.884 align:middle line:90%
when that had happened.

00:55:47.884 --> 00:55:52.820 align:middle line:90%


00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:55.340 align:middle line:84%
We talked, and I started
telling him, well,

00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:58.910 align:middle line:84%
what he was going to find about
the planets-- he wanted to know

00:55:58.910 --> 00:56:00.770 align:middle line:84%
about what I was
teaching, this meditation,

00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:02.760 align:middle line:90%
I was describing it to him.

00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:06.610 align:middle line:84%
I told him that he was going to
find that the star tetrahedral

00:56:06.610 --> 00:56:09.010 align:middle line:84%
field was around
people but it was also

00:56:09.010 --> 00:56:11.700 align:middle line:84%
around planets and
suns and galaxies

00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:14.220 align:middle line:84%
and everything else like
this, and eventually this

00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:17.090 align:middle line:90%
would be the area.

00:56:17.090 --> 00:56:19.360 align:middle line:84%
He had never even heard
of tetrahedral geometry

00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:21.390 align:middle line:90%
up until that point.

00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:30.029 align:middle line:84%
And as it turns
out, they started--

00:56:30.029 --> 00:56:31.820 align:middle line:84%
it was this thing which
you can barely see,

00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:33.660 align:middle line:84%
because this is blown
up so much here.

00:56:33.660 --> 00:56:36.660 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the clumps
that was near the face.

00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:38.570 align:middle line:84%
It's now been called
the D&M pyramid.

00:56:38.570 --> 00:56:40.960 align:middle line:84%
Originally it was called
the Empire State Building,

00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:42.850 align:middle line:84%
but then there was
these two men whose name

00:56:42.850 --> 00:56:44.225 align:middle line:84%
who starts with
the name D and M,

00:56:44.225 --> 00:56:45.650 align:middle line:84%
and I don't remember
their names.

00:56:45.650 --> 00:56:47.450 align:middle line:84%
Does anybody
remember their names?

00:56:47.450 --> 00:56:48.250 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:51.470 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't Doug and Marty.

00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:53.260 align:middle line:90%
Somebody else's names.

00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:59.004 align:middle line:84%
And though you can't see there,
it is a five-sided pyramid.

00:56:59.004 --> 00:57:03.705 align:middle line:90%
It's a pentagon of five sides.

00:57:03.705 --> 00:57:06.615 align:middle line:90%


00:57:06.615 --> 00:57:07.585 align:middle line:90%
Like this.

00:57:07.585 --> 00:57:10.500 align:middle line:90%


00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And the angle is
not a perfect one.

00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:17.790 align:middle line:84%
There is different angles
in here, each one of them.

00:57:17.790 --> 00:57:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And these angles are
very, very precise

00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:28.010 align:middle line:84%
and a whole spectrum of super
accurate and sacred geometry

00:57:28.010 --> 00:57:30.090 align:middle line:84%
and mathematics comes
out of these five

00:57:30.090 --> 00:57:32.560 align:middle line:90%
angles, which just couldn't be.

00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about pi
and e and everything else,

00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:37.860 align:middle line:84%
and all these things are
falling out of there.

00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:41.030 align:middle line:84%
This, by the way, is a very
high building or mountain,

00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:42.360 align:middle line:90%
whatever you want to call it.

00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:46.020 align:middle line:90%
It's 10 miles high.

00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:49.020 align:middle line:90%
50,000 feet plus.

00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:51.510 align:middle line:84%
They're enormous, the
faces, like a mile

00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:56.570 align:middle line:84%
and a half long, and
they're very, very big.

00:57:56.570 --> 00:57:59.066 align:middle line:84%
So this is where that
D&M pyramid sits.

00:57:59.066 --> 00:58:01.530 align:middle line:90%
This is where the face sits.

00:58:01.530 --> 00:58:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And there's other
structures on there

00:58:03.550 --> 00:58:05.258 align:middle line:84%
that they've been--
they started looking.

00:58:05.258 --> 00:58:08.250 align:middle line:84%
There's a circle with a
tetrahedron sitting over here.

00:58:08.250 --> 00:58:10.170 align:middle line:84%
There's a long line
thing here which

00:58:10.170 --> 00:58:15.200 align:middle line:84%
is very unusual and
strange by-- and all kinds

00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:19.780 align:middle line:84%
from a geological point of view,
and what they call the city now

00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:23.944 align:middle line:84%
over here, which is a whole
series of pyramids and things.

00:58:23.944 --> 00:58:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And when they started
looking at all of this--

00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:28.300 align:middle line:84%
there's three sided, four
sided, and five sided pyramids

00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:29.760 align:middle line:90%
all in there.

00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:31.770 align:middle line:84%
There's a wall that
exists up there that

00:58:31.770 --> 00:58:33.780 align:middle line:90%
extends for many miles.

00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:36.910 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds of
unusual structures there.

00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And when they started looking at
the precise angles between all

00:58:41.490 --> 00:58:46.665 align:middle line:84%
of these things, they found
that the exact angles that

00:58:46.665 --> 00:58:50.370 align:middle line:84%
were all in here, which
were duplicated-- they

00:58:50.370 --> 00:58:52.200 align:middle line:84%
weren't angles that
just felt once,

00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:54.730 align:middle line:84%
but they fell many, many
times throughout all

00:58:54.730 --> 00:58:55.760 align:middle line:90%
of this structure.

00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And all of these angles
were repeated constantly

00:58:59.110 --> 00:59:02.230 align:middle line:90%
inside the D&M pyramid.

00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:06.360 align:middle line:90%
So it was like redundant.

00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:09.805 align:middle line:84%
It was like a message, when
you get a message in space

00:59:09.805 --> 00:59:13.230 align:middle line:84%
or to someone else, if
you just get it one time,

00:59:13.230 --> 00:59:14.700 align:middle line:90%
it's like random.

00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:18.700 align:middle line:84%
But when a message is repeated
over and over and over and over

00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:22.320 align:middle line:84%
again, you realize it's
an intelligent message.

00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And this message was repeated
over and over and over again

00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:27.130 align:middle line:90%
in these angles.

00:59:27.130 --> 00:59:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And the message, when they
calculated it out and printed

00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:33.990 align:middle line:84%
it out to see what it was
saying mathematically,

00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:36.900 align:middle line:84%
it had to do with this
angle of 19.5 degrees,

00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:39.330 align:middle line:84%
the angle between the tip
of the pyramid, this one,

00:59:39.330 --> 00:59:41.477 align:middle line:84%
and this ridge that
was on here, which

00:59:41.477 --> 00:59:43.310 align:middle line:84%
is repeated throughout
here many, many times

00:59:43.310 --> 00:59:45.270 align:middle line:90%
and many, many times in the DNA.

00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:47.330 align:middle line:90%
It was this 19.5.

00:59:47.330 --> 00:59:51.740 align:middle line:84%
Mathematically this has a
very specific geometrical form

00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:53.670 align:middle line:84%
that it's talking
about, which happens

00:59:53.670 --> 01:00:00.450 align:middle line:84%
to be a star tetrahedron
inscribed in a sphere, which

01:00:00.450 --> 01:00:03.330 align:middle line:84%
is the key to
harmonics that we've

01:00:03.330 --> 01:00:06.690 align:middle line:84%
seen before and all these other
light and sound and dimensional

01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:10.320 align:middle line:84%
levels and so many other things,
that whoever was doing this,

01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:13.490 align:middle line:90%
they were talking about this.

01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And later, he
found out that they

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:24.430 align:middle line:84%
began to realize that this--
and I'm not allowed to show

01:00:24.430 --> 01:00:26.195 align:middle line:90%
his movie anymore to you.

01:00:26.195 --> 01:00:29.490 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't want me
to show it, and he's

01:00:29.490 --> 01:00:33.580 align:middle line:84%
trying to-- he's afraid to
be connected with me directly

01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:35.650 align:middle line:90%
because I'm a psychic.

01:00:35.650 --> 01:00:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And he's trying to do
things scientifically.

01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And he doesn't want to
be directly connected.

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:42.080 align:middle line:90%
So I respect that.

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:44.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to do that.

01:00:44.810 --> 01:00:47.730 align:middle line:84%
Maybe in a few years we'll
be able to come back together

01:00:47.730 --> 01:00:49.255 align:middle line:90%
when life on the planet--

01:00:49.255 --> 01:00:54.210 align:middle line:84%
>>I saw the movie
actually advertised on TV.

01:00:54.210 --> 01:00:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:57.727 align:middle line:84%
Well, I really recommend
that you see it,

01:00:57.727 --> 01:00:59.810 align:middle line:84%
and I'll give you the
address where you can get it

01:00:59.810 --> 01:01:01.060 align:middle line:90%
and all those kinds of things.

01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:03.050 align:middle line:84%
I found all the
addresses, by the way,

01:01:03.050 --> 01:01:04.180 align:middle line:90%
so you can get to them.

01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:07.020 align:middle line:90%


01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:12.330 align:middle line:84%
Whoever copied them
had put an old one,

01:01:12.330 --> 01:01:16.460 align:middle line:84%
an old set, an entirely separate
set-- they copied an old set,

01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:18.600 align:middle line:84%
but I got the new set,
which was also in there.

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:20.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand
what happened.

01:01:20.030 --> 01:01:21.030 align:middle line:90%
But anyway, we got them.

01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>>OK, it's called "Richard
Hoagland's The Face on Mars,"

01:01:30.330 --> 01:01:31.850 align:middle line:90%
I think is what it's called.

01:01:31.850 --> 01:01:34.275 align:middle line:84%
It was a presentation
to the United Nations.

01:01:34.275 --> 01:01:36.940 align:middle line:84%
He also gave a
presentation at NASA,

01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:38.790 align:middle line:84%
but the one of
the United Nations

01:01:38.790 --> 01:01:42.066 align:middle line:84%
is a lot better,
though he's dropped out

01:01:42.066 --> 01:01:43.690 align:middle line:84%
some real important
information that he

01:01:43.690 --> 01:01:46.980 align:middle line:84%
gave at NASA that he didn't
give at the United Nations.

01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:48.610 align:middle line:84%
If you saw both of
them, you'd have

01:01:48.610 --> 01:01:52.070 align:middle line:90%
much more complete information.

01:01:52.070 --> 01:01:56.610 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, they discovered
now first that there

01:01:56.610 --> 01:02:01.440 align:middle line:84%
is a star tetrahedral field
inscribed in the planet Mars,

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:05.550 align:middle line:84%
and that this angle,
if this was a planet,

01:02:05.550 --> 01:02:08.650 align:middle line:84%
this angle of this
plane right here,

01:02:08.650 --> 01:02:13.290 align:middle line:84%
and this one, the
flat top of this one

01:02:13.290 --> 01:02:16.940 align:middle line:84%
and the bottom of this one
here passes through the planet

01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:23.230 align:middle line:84%
or a sphere at 19.5 degrees
north and south latitude.

01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:middle line:84%
It's actually 19.47 is
a little more accurate,

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:29.350 align:middle line:90%
but to be precisely on.

01:02:29.350 --> 01:02:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And they found now that things
like Jupiter, the rotational--

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:35.440 align:middle line:84%
there's the dark
spot on Jupiter.

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:38.910 align:middle line:84%
It happens to be rotating
at exactly the 19.5

01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:41.910 align:middle line:84%
and precisely on one of
these points as it rotates.

01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:45.579 align:middle line:84%
And they're finding more and
more and more information.

01:02:45.579 --> 01:02:47.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to go into all
the depth of all the stuff

01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:51.390 align:middle line:84%
that he's into, but
when you look at it,

01:02:51.390 --> 01:02:56.490 align:middle line:84%
you will see how powerfully it
reinforces what we're talking

01:02:56.490 --> 01:02:59.160 align:middle line:90%
here, what they're discovering.

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Even the fact that
they now believe

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.175 align:middle line:84%
that the energy levels that
are coming off planets, which

01:03:03.175 --> 01:03:05.400 align:middle line:84%
are greater than the amount
of sun, energy that's

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:08.310 align:middle line:84%
coming from the sun, is
really a third and fourth

01:03:08.310 --> 01:03:10.490 align:middle line:90%
dimensional energy exchange.

01:03:10.490 --> 01:03:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And the hybrid
dimensional space that

01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:16.330 align:middle line:84%
is talked about in
mathematics that

01:03:16.330 --> 01:03:18.980 align:middle line:84%
would indicate that
from such a shape

01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:22.640 align:middle line:84%
there would be a hexagonal
pattern around the North Pole,

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:27.180 align:middle line:84%
and it could also explain at
the South Pole, when they looked

01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:30.450 align:middle line:84%
to the North Pole
of Saturn, they

01:03:30.450 --> 01:03:34.177 align:middle line:84%
found that the clouds were
moving in the hexagon.

01:03:34.177 --> 01:03:35.260 align:middle line:90%
You could actually see it.

01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:36.460 align:middle line:90%
You could see it.

01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:41.270 align:middle line:84%
The cloud pattern moving at
300 or 400 miles an hour,

01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:46.620 align:middle line:84%
these clouds making these
turns, just like this,

01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:50.570 align:middle line:84%
doing this at huge speeds,
going around there like that,

01:03:50.570 --> 01:03:53.570 align:middle line:84%
forming this pattern, right
around the North Pole.

01:03:53.570 --> 01:03:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And when they went
to Neptune, they

01:03:55.570 --> 01:03:59.400 align:middle line:84%
found that the ice had
been frozen in a hexagon

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:02.880 align:middle line:84%
around the North
Pole, clearly being

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:06.870 align:middle line:84%
able to see in this huge
hexagonal mountain range,

01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:09.453 align:middle line:84%
where you could see-- because
this is a hexagon from the top.

01:04:09.453 --> 01:04:15.260 align:middle line:90%


01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:17.580 align:middle line:84%
From the side, you're
seeing it like that.

01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:22.180 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at it like
that, rather than like that,

01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:24.480 align:middle line:84%
if you connected the
outer edges of this thing,

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:25.690 align:middle line:90%
it's a hexagonal pattern.

01:04:25.690 --> 01:04:30.040 align:middle line:90%


01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And since then they found
that the points like Hawaii

01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:41.140 align:middle line:84%
sits on the 19.5 latitude, and
the equator, the huge volcano

01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:46.124 align:middle line:84%
that's going off all the time is
sitting on one of these points.

01:04:46.124 --> 01:04:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And the same way on
Mars, the biggest volcano

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:55.290 align:middle line:84%
there is sitting in
the same place, 19.5.

01:04:55.290 --> 01:04:59.510 align:middle line:84%
The sun itself where the sun
spots come out of the sun

01:04:59.510 --> 01:05:02.292 align:middle line:90%
are 19.5 south latitudes.

01:05:02.292 --> 01:05:03.092 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

01:05:03.092 --> 01:05:08.280 align:middle line:90%


01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:09.080 align:middle line:90%
>>Degrees?

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:09.880 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:13.620 align:middle line:90%


01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:14.897 align:middle line:90%
>>It's degrees?

01:05:14.897 --> 01:05:16.885 align:middle line:84%
>>It's 19.5 degrees,
he showed in the film.

01:05:16.885 --> 01:05:22.730 align:middle line:84%
In Hawaii, the volcanoes
there are 19.5 degree--

01:05:22.730 --> 01:05:24.010 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, it's not latitude.

01:05:24.010 --> 01:05:25.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm saying it's latitude.

01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:27.070 align:middle line:90%
What is the latitude?

01:05:27.070 --> 01:05:27.870 align:middle line:90%
>>21.

01:05:27.870 --> 01:05:28.670 align:middle line:90%
>>21?

01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:30.520 align:middle line:90%
So it's degrees.

01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:31.480 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK.

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:32.813 align:middle line:90%
>>--on a tetrahedron [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:32.813 --> 01:05:37.240 align:middle line:90%


01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>>All right, thank
you for saying that.

01:05:41.290 --> 01:05:46.670 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, however,
Richard is only aware

01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:49.220 align:middle line:84%
right now of the shape
of the energy field

01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:53.680 align:middle line:84%
that's inside the planets and
the sun, being this shape,

01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:57.210 align:middle line:84%
and that it rotates
counterclockwise.

01:05:57.210 --> 01:06:01.840 align:middle line:84%
He's not aware yet that there
is two counter-rotating fields,

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:04.470 align:middle line:84%
and it's the difference
in speed between them

01:06:04.470 --> 01:06:06.750 align:middle line:84%
that caused the planet
to slowly rotate

01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:08.100 align:middle line:90%
in that counterclockwise field.

01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And there's actually three
fields sitting there.

01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:14.020 align:middle line:84%
This is something that he
has not arrived at yet.

01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:16.160 align:middle line:84%
But that's all described
here mathematically.

01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happened
here, now we can go back

01:06:19.330 --> 01:06:21.540 align:middle line:90%
to what happened at Atlantis.

01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:24.820 align:middle line:84%
Before I even talked
to Richard Hoagland--

01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:27.680 align:middle line:84%
and I've got on videos going
back two and a half years

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:32.620 align:middle line:84%
even before all of that, back
seven and a half years ago,

01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:35.060 align:middle line:84%
where we talked about
how the Martians had

01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:39.610 align:middle line:84%
come from Mars approximately
1 million years before.

01:06:39.610 --> 01:06:43.480 align:middle line:84%
Remember I said that their
planet was being destroyed

01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:47.647 align:middle line:84%
according to Thoth,
and that they

01:06:47.647 --> 01:06:49.480 align:middle line:84%
decided to get out of
there and they created

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:50.535 align:middle line:90%
this space-time vehicle.

01:06:50.535 --> 01:06:53.220 align:middle line:84%
At the time, I didn't
tell you what it was.

01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And they were able to
look ahead in time.

01:06:55.870 --> 01:06:56.990 align:middle line:90%
Remember how I said that?

01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:59.820 align:middle line:84%
It all sounded kind of weird
when you're first hearing that,

01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:02.700 align:middle line:84%
and they came into
back into our future.

01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:05.650 align:middle line:84%
But what they created, all
these buildings and everything,

01:07:05.650 --> 01:07:08.630 align:middle line:84%
they were creating
an external Merkaba,

01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:13.082 align:middle line:90%
a UFO, a space-time vehicle.

01:07:13.082 --> 01:07:15.640 align:middle line:84%
A UFO is not just something
that can go from one place

01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:16.440 align:middle line:90%
to another.

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:18.910 align:middle line:84%
It can also move
forward in time,

01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:21.640 align:middle line:84%
because time doesn't
exist, only space.

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And you can move through
the space continuum, which

01:07:24.670 --> 01:07:26.260 align:middle line:90%
is in a golden mean spiral.

01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And so you can move
through it and come back

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.190 align:middle line:84%
through the space continuum
and connect in at any point.

01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:39.340 align:middle line:90%
And so they created that.

01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And this is just the remnants
of the experimentation and all

01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:48.685 align:middle line:84%
that was going on
in all of this.

01:07:48.685 --> 01:07:54.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, Richard thinks, guessing,
that this is about half a

01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:55.810 align:middle line:90%
million years old.

01:07:55.810 --> 01:07:57.143 align:middle line:90%
He first started out at 200,000.

01:07:57.143 --> 01:07:58.530 align:middle line:84%
It keeps getting
older and older.

01:07:58.530 --> 01:08:00.700 align:middle line:84%
He's now at about
500,000 years old.

01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:03.150 align:middle line:84%
Eventually he's going to
find this to be closer

01:08:03.150 --> 01:08:08.330 align:middle line:84%
to a little over 900,000, if
Thoth is correct, because Thoth

01:08:08.330 --> 01:08:12.450 align:middle line:84%
said it was just a little
less than a million years

01:08:12.450 --> 01:08:13.470 align:middle line:90%
when this took place.

01:08:13.470 --> 01:08:17.100 align:middle line:90%


01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:19.125 align:middle line:84%
And they left there,
and they went to earth

01:08:19.125 --> 01:08:22.600 align:middle line:84%
and injected themselves
into us, which

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:26.314 align:middle line:84%
has been the problem from
the very, very beginning.

01:08:26.314 --> 01:08:30.189 align:middle line:90%


01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:33.134 align:middle line:84%
By the way, they also
found a complex on Venus,

01:08:33.134 --> 01:08:35.760 align:middle line:90%
I just want to put it out there.

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:37.520 align:middle line:84%
They found a complex
on Venus that

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:39.670 align:middle line:84%
is identical to
the one in Egypt,

01:08:39.670 --> 01:08:43.529 align:middle line:84%
with the three pyramids and
the Sphinx and all that.

01:08:43.529 --> 01:08:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And I know that because
I had a woman who

01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:54.470 align:middle line:84%
was on a mental health
committee in Washington, DC, who

01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:56.539 align:middle line:84%
was the primary one that
determined the rules

01:08:56.539 --> 01:08:58.580 align:middle line:84%
and regulations of the
mental health institutions

01:08:58.580 --> 01:09:01.229 align:middle line:90%
throughout the United States.

01:09:01.229 --> 01:09:04.939 align:middle line:84%
And I brought her to Peru, that
Peruvian trip I talked about.

01:09:04.939 --> 01:09:06.439 align:middle line:84%
She happened to be
one of the women.

01:09:06.439 --> 01:09:10.869 align:middle line:84%
She was 45, 50 years
old, something like that.

01:09:10.869 --> 01:09:12.350 align:middle line:90%
And we happened to be walking.

01:09:12.350 --> 01:09:14.620 align:middle line:84%
You walk for several days
through the mountains,

01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:16.529 align:middle line:90%
so we had a lot of time to talk.

01:09:16.529 --> 01:09:19.229 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking to her and
at one point she said that she

01:09:19.229 --> 01:09:20.460 align:middle line:90%
had just quit the committee.

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:27.779 align:middle line:84%
This was in July I think it
was, June or July of 1985.

01:09:27.779 --> 01:09:29.696 align:middle line:90%
She had just quit the committee.

01:09:29.696 --> 01:09:31.279 align:middle line:84%
And in that, she was
saying that there

01:09:31.279 --> 01:09:33.404 align:middle line:84%
was this real interesting
thing that happened right

01:09:33.404 --> 01:09:34.899 align:middle line:90%
before they left.

01:09:34.899 --> 01:09:40.120 align:middle line:84%
You see, there is a rule with
NASA in the United States

01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:44.420 align:middle line:84%
that if NASA finds anything out
there that indicates that there

01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:49.670 align:middle line:84%
is life or anything
incredible in any way at all,

01:09:49.670 --> 01:09:53.750 align:middle line:84%
they have to go to this specific
committee and the committee

01:09:53.750 --> 01:09:54.990 align:middle line:90%
and show them the evidence.

01:09:54.990 --> 01:09:56.550 align:middle line:90%
By law they have to.

01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And then the committee
has to decide

01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:01.834 align:middle line:84%
if we're going to all
go crazy if we see this,

01:10:01.834 --> 01:10:03.500 align:middle line:84%
whether or not it's
something that would

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:07.430 align:middle line:90%
be too unstable for us to see.

01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And so she said that she
sat there and watched over

01:10:09.870 --> 01:10:15.050 align:middle line:84%
200 very clear photographs
of an installation on Venus

01:10:15.050 --> 01:10:17.380 align:middle line:84%
that looked just like
the one on Earth.

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:20.600 align:middle line:84%
She said it was identical--
the whole Sphinx, the head,

01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:22.676 align:middle line:84%
the whole thing,
and they got lots

01:10:22.676 --> 01:10:24.300 align:middle line:84%
and lots and lots of
photographs of it,

01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:27.300 align:middle line:84%
because they mapped every
square inch of Venus,

01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:30.090 align:middle line:84%
every square inch of it, except
the North and South Pole.

01:10:30.090 --> 01:10:33.280 align:middle line:84%
90% of the planet,
very, very carefully.

01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And she said that was
in January of 1985

01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:40.830 align:middle line:84%
when they received
the photographs.

01:10:40.830 --> 01:10:46.550 align:middle line:84%
She said they studied them from
January, February, and March

01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:50.500 align:middle line:84%
and April, I think, for
about four months and thought

01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:52.950 align:middle line:84%
of all possibilities
of what would happen,

01:10:52.950 --> 01:10:56.160 align:middle line:84%
because this would indicate
absolutely beyond any doubt

01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:59.960 align:middle line:84%
that life had been
out there before,

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:01.560 align:middle line:84%
or that there was
more than just us,

01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:03.730 align:middle line:84%
or we had somehow
gotten to space before,

01:11:03.730 --> 01:11:04.939 align:middle line:90%
or something or someone else.

01:11:04.939 --> 01:11:07.396 align:middle line:84%
It would indicate there's got
to be something else going on

01:11:07.396 --> 01:11:08.920 align:middle line:90%
than what we normally thought.

01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And the committee
said yes, release it.

01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:18.694 align:middle line:84%
And so she didn't
have any kind of-- she

01:11:18.694 --> 01:11:20.360 align:middle line:84%
didn't have to be
censored in telling me

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:24.810 align:middle line:84%
this, because the committee said
that it was OK to talk about it

01:11:24.810 --> 01:11:26.930 align:middle line:90%
and to release it to the world.

01:11:26.930 --> 01:11:32.140 align:middle line:84%
But what NASA did was they put
it on one television station

01:11:32.140 --> 01:11:37.290 align:middle line:84%
one time late at night
in a Florida TV station.

01:11:37.290 --> 01:11:41.101 align:middle line:84%
And then pulled it off and said,
OK, that conforms to the law.

01:11:41.101 --> 01:11:43.010 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

01:11:43.010 --> 01:11:45.950 align:middle line:84%
>>Is it open to the public
though to go and get it?

01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>>Can we get a copy of it?

01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:48.790 align:middle line:90%
>>I don't know.

01:11:48.790 --> 01:11:51.920 align:middle line:84%
ABC has tried to
do it and it was

01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:54.596 align:middle line:90%
met with incredible resistance.

01:11:54.596 --> 01:11:58.250 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, what is NASA's problem?

01:11:58.250 --> 01:12:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>>OK, you understand-- I'm
going to explain to you what

01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:02.250 align:middle line:90%
NASA's problem is real soon.

01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:08.905 align:middle line:90%


01:12:08.905 --> 01:12:09.705 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

01:12:09.705 --> 01:12:15.180 align:middle line:90%


01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:16.050 align:middle line:90%
>>No, I don't.

01:12:16.050 --> 01:12:17.404 align:middle line:90%
I haven't figured that out.

01:12:17.404 --> 01:12:20.240 align:middle line:90%


01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:23.398 align:middle line:90%
>>Figured out what?

01:12:23.398 --> 01:12:27.370 align:middle line:90%
>>Does Richard Hoagland know?

01:12:27.370 --> 01:12:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>>He's been informed.

01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:29.988 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if he
wants to deal with it.

01:12:29.988 --> 01:12:34.720 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, actually he knows, because
I've talked to another person

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:37.740 align:middle line:84%
from ABC where all that was
discussed and everything.

01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:39.860 align:middle line:90%
They know.

01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:43.570 align:middle line:84%
They just it cannot get the
hardcore evidence because they

01:12:43.570 --> 01:12:45.140 align:middle line:90%
just won't release it.

01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:47.910 align:middle line:90%
>>Did Venus destroy themselves?

01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>>I don't know that.

01:12:49.130 --> 01:12:50.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
that was the case,

01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:52.910 align:middle line:84%
or if it just was
never developed

01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:56.822 align:middle line:84%
or if it naturally-- they
know that there was oceans.

01:12:56.822 --> 01:12:58.280 align:middle line:84%
The new evidence
that's coming out,

01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:00.470 align:middle line:84%
it just was released
in the last month,

01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:02.690 align:middle line:84%
they know that--
they believe strongly

01:13:02.690 --> 01:13:05.910 align:middle line:84%
that Venus was covered
with water and oceans

01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:08.670 align:middle line:84%
and that was held
lots of water on it.

01:13:08.670 --> 01:13:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And any time a planet
has lots of water on it,

01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:12.400 align:middle line:90%
it generally develops life.

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:16.570 align:middle line:90%


01:13:16.570 --> 01:13:21.302 align:middle line:84%
But exactly what
happened, I don't know.

01:13:21.302 --> 01:13:23.010 align:middle line:84%
Thoth's never talked
to anybody about it.

01:13:23.010 --> 01:13:24.990 align:middle line:84%
Thoth says that
the life of Venus

01:13:24.990 --> 01:13:27.150 align:middle line:84%
is on the fourth
dimensional higher level

01:13:27.150 --> 01:13:32.740 align:middle line:84%
and that it's very healthy and
very alive and real together.

01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:35.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a really, really,
really healthy planet.

01:13:35.170 --> 01:13:38.308 align:middle line:90%
It's the healthiest one of all.

01:13:38.308 --> 01:13:39.108 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

01:13:39.108 --> 01:13:46.090 align:middle line:90%


01:13:46.090 --> 01:13:47.500 align:middle line:90%
>>I don't know.

01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the
Egyptians keep talking

01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:52.610 align:middle line:84%
about how they keep leaving
here and going to Venus.

01:13:52.610 --> 01:13:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And so maybe that was
like a beacon or a marker

01:13:58.030 --> 01:13:59.947 align:middle line:90%
or something.

01:13:59.947 --> 01:14:00.780 align:middle line:90%
I don't really know.

01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:03.208 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:14:03.208 --> 01:14:05.560 align:middle line:84%
He just said that
the Egyptians have

01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:08.195 align:middle line:84%
had a great deal of
connection between there

01:14:08.195 --> 01:14:09.590 align:middle line:90%
and Venus for a long time.

01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:12.640 align:middle line:90%


01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:16.510 align:middle line:84%
But exactly what the
purpose was or why

01:14:16.510 --> 01:14:22.400 align:middle line:84%
duplicate that on-- just as
this one here is on here,

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:24.775 align:middle line:84%
Richard Hoagland now thinks
that this has been duplicated

01:14:24.775 --> 01:14:27.920 align:middle line:90%
in England, this very complex.

01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:28.720 align:middle line:90%
Who has that here?

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:29.676 align:middle line:90%
Somebody show me.

01:14:29.676 --> 01:14:30.670 align:middle line:90%
You have it?

01:14:30.670 --> 01:14:32.780 align:middle line:84%
He has it in this video,
but they're developing

01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:34.460 align:middle line:90%
it more and more now.

01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:38.330 align:middle line:84%
They believe that the entire
system of the rings, the thing,

01:14:38.330 --> 01:14:41.640 align:middle line:84%
the mountains, [INAUDIBLE]
pyramid, the face, et cetera,

01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:46.460 align:middle line:84%
and all these things have been
purposely-- someone purposely

01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:50.060 align:middle line:84%
went into England and
clearly marked out

01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:54.300 align:middle line:84%
every little detail onto
the English landscape

01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:57.320 align:middle line:90%
that was on Mars.

01:14:57.320 --> 01:15:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's all centered
around-- the primary one

01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:06.409 align:middle line:84%
is the Stonehenge, which is--
that's another one that's

01:15:06.409 --> 01:15:07.450 align:middle line:90%
coming up here real soon.

01:15:07.450 --> 01:15:09.642 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember why
I put that on there.

01:15:09.642 --> 01:15:13.200 align:middle line:90%


01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:18.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any idea why I
put that back on there again.

01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:23.261 align:middle line:84%
But Stonehenge has certain
lines going through it--

01:15:23.261 --> 01:15:25.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I have this on
here, where you mark them out

01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:27.490 align:middle line:84%
and everything
like this-- and one

01:15:27.490 --> 01:15:29.090 align:middle line:84%
of the primary
lines on Stonehenge

01:15:29.090 --> 01:15:32.850 align:middle line:84%
connects directly with the
apex of the Great Pyramid.

01:15:32.850 --> 01:15:35.500 align:middle line:90%
And so there's this connection.

01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:37.281 align:middle line:90%
