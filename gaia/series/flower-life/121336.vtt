00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.780 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>>Anyone who's been
involved in architecture

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.370 align:middle line:84%
or sacred geometry, or
any kind of geometry,

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.080 align:middle line:84%
or various fields
of engineering,

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.460 align:middle line:90%
will probably know these shapes.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.434 align:middle line:84%
The most familiar
one is the cube.

00:00:31.434 --> 00:00:32.850 align:middle line:84%
There's five of
them all together.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.072 align:middle line:90%


00:00:36.072 --> 00:00:37.530 align:middle line:84%
I'll just quickly
give them to you.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.790 align:middle line:84%
There's the tetrahedron,
tetra means four,

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.970 align:middle line:90%
because there's four faces.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And there is the
hexahedron, or the cube,

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.350 align:middle line:90%
hexa meaning six faces.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.045 align:middle line:84%
Then there is the octahedron,
meaning eight faces.

00:00:53.045 --> 00:00:55.720 align:middle line:90%


00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.835 align:middle line:84%
And the icosahedron,
meaning 20 faces.

00:00:59.835 --> 00:01:02.840 align:middle line:90%


00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:10.194 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the dodecahedron,
meaning 12 faces.

00:01:10.194 --> 00:01:15.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, are all five
of these things

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.700 align:middle line:84%
have something very
special about them

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.720 align:middle line:84%
that no other forms
in the universe have.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.806 align:middle line:90%


00:01:23.806 --> 00:01:26.510 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
rules, and the rules

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.080 align:middle line:84%
are if you could create a
form that has only one edge

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.850 align:middle line:84%
length throughout
the entire form,

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.220 align:middle line:84%
only one face-- this
only has one face.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.880 align:middle line:84%
Same face, same edge
length-- only one angle.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.340 align:middle line:84%
This is 90 degrees,
and this one.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.970 align:middle line:90%
Every angle is 90 degrees.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.760 align:middle line:84%
There's only one angle,
one face, and one edge,

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.330 align:middle line:84%
and all the points
of this substance

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.960 align:middle line:84%
would fit on the
surface of a sphere.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.860 align:middle line:90%


00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.170 align:middle line:84%
That criteria comes
up with five shapes,

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.700 align:middle line:90%
the ones I just gave you.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And believe me, they have
really tried to find other ones,

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.340 align:middle line:90%
and they don't exist.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.060 align:middle line:84%
There is a way to
create two more

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.470 align:middle line:84%
which are based on
motion and movement,

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.040 align:middle line:84%
but that's a high-level
subject, and it's

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.970 align:middle line:90%
not important for right now.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And so you'll say to yourself,
well, again, so what?

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.480 align:middle line:90%
What about these shapes?

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, they were eventually
named after Plato,

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.310 align:middle line:84%
so they're called
the Platonic solids.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.320 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if that's
a really good name or not.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.250 align:middle line:84%
He was not the one
that invented it.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.770 align:middle line:90%
Of course, nobody invented them.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.300 align:middle line:84%
They've just been here
since the beginning.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And his teacher was Pythagoras,
who was the first one

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.140 align:middle line:84%
to introduce them into our new
world that we're talking about.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And Pythagoras got his
information from Thoth,

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.060 align:middle line:84%
because he said so, who
brought them from much older.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.040 align:middle line:84%
They have found
these shapes that man

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:17.430 align:middle line:84%
has made 20,000 years ago,
20,000 year old stones carved

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.725 align:middle line:90%
into five Platonic solids.

00:03:18.725 --> 00:03:24.497 align:middle line:90%


00:03:24.497 --> 00:03:26.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know if
they know who did them,

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:27.621 align:middle line:90%
but they know they're that old.

00:03:27.621 --> 00:03:33.270 align:middle line:90%


00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.557 align:middle line:84%
If you read into sacred geometry
books about these five shapes--

00:03:37.557 --> 00:03:39.515 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to keep these
things from reflecting

00:03:39.515 --> 00:03:40.550 align:middle line:90%
in people's eyes.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:41.765 align:middle line:90%
They're like mirrors.

00:03:41.765 --> 00:03:47.050 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I should get one that's
not quite so big a mirror.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you read books like
Keith Critchlow or Buckminster

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:59.520 align:middle line:84%
Fuller, Robert Lawler,
any of these guys,

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.060 align:middle line:84%
you begin to realize
the importance of these.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.030 align:middle line:84%
They're like the major,
major primary building

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.290 align:middle line:90%
blocks of the universe.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.410 align:middle line:84%
Their relationship
is just everywhere,

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.070 align:middle line:84%
in all kinds of ways,
throughout nature.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.790 align:middle line:90%
Everywhere.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's just amazing
how many places there are

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.900 align:middle line:90%
that they have importance in.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And yet when you come
right down to it,

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.450 align:middle line:84%
and you ask any of these guys,
or read any of these books

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.910 align:middle line:84%
to try to find out,
what generated them?

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.750 align:middle line:90%
Where they come from?

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.655 align:middle line:84%
What is the source that
was behind these things?

00:04:37.655 --> 00:04:38.455 align:middle line:90%
There's silence.

00:04:38.455 --> 00:04:39.255 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows.

00:04:39.255 --> 00:04:43.440 align:middle line:90%


00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.040 align:middle line:84%
But what the angels say it
is, there's your source.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.894 align:middle line:90%
That's what created.

00:04:47.894 --> 00:04:49.310 align:middle line:84%
It's the first
system of knowledge

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.690 align:middle line:84%
that came out of
Metatron's cube.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.404 align:middle line:84%
You're now looking at-- well,
with the lines that I've

00:04:57.404 --> 00:05:01.300 align:middle line:84%
got on this page right now,
you're looking at four of them.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.020 align:middle line:10%
And I'll explain where the
fifth one is in just a moment.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to pull them
off of here one at a time

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.692 align:middle line:90%
so you can see them, OK?

00:05:09.692 --> 00:05:11.650 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about what
they are in a little bit.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.190 align:middle line:84%
Let's just get them
out of here first.

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.650 align:middle line:84%
If you were to take out
this hexagon pattern out,

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.310 align:middle line:84%
inside here you see another
hexagonal pattern, and then

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.085 align:middle line:84%
the three lines that
go to the middle

00:05:25.085 --> 00:05:30.471 align:middle line:84%
and erase all the rest
of it, you'd get this.

00:05:30.471 --> 00:05:31.470 align:middle line:90%
Does everybody see that?

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:32.566 align:middle line:90%
>>Mm-hm.

00:05:32.566 --> 00:05:34.815 align:middle line:84%
>>Does everybody see that
that's a cube within a cube?

00:05:34.815 --> 00:05:36.340 align:middle line:90%
>>Mm-hm.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.130 align:middle line:90%
>>Who doesn't?

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.030 align:middle line:84%
It's a cube looking
at it from this edge.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.128 align:middle line:90%


00:05:45.128 --> 00:05:48.550 align:middle line:90%
Can you see that now?

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.920 align:middle line:90%
You can?

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.250 align:middle line:84%
So you're looking at
a cube from this view.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.819 align:middle line:90%


00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:57.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's where
your first one is.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you came
back here and you

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:10.254 align:middle line:84%
were to take this triangle
here and this triangle here,

00:06:10.254 --> 00:06:12.670 align:middle line:84%
and then this little triangle
and this little one in here,

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.360 align:middle line:84%
and then the lines that go
through the middle like that,

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.930 align:middle line:90%
you do that, then you get this.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.350 align:middle line:10%
It looks like a Star of David.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, what that is, though,
is a three-dimensional shape,

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:28.664 align:middle line:84%
a very specific one,
which is hard to see

00:06:28.664 --> 00:06:29.580 align:middle line:90%
what that is in there.

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:35.810 align:middle line:84%
But if you shade
it in like this,

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.155 align:middle line:84%
it's a star
tetrahedron, like this.

00:06:40.155 --> 00:06:42.540 align:middle line:90%
Can you see it?

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.975 align:middle line:90%
Does everybody see it?

00:06:44.975 --> 00:06:46.350 align:middle line:10%
So when you get
the tetrahedrons,

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:49.220 align:middle line:10%
you get two of them
interlocked, one

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.450 align:middle line:10%
interlocked with the other one.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.520 align:middle line:10%
All five of these shapes
are masculine energy,

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.090 align:middle line:10%
but everything has a polarity.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.360 align:middle line:84%
So even within maleness,
there's femaleness and maleness.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And within femaleness, there's
maleness and femaleness.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And same way with geometry--
though all five of these shapes

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.380 align:middle line:84%
are male relative to the sphere,
some of these shapes are female

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.050 align:middle line:90%
and something of them are male.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.633 align:middle line:84%
We'll see about that
in just a moment.

00:07:13.633 --> 00:07:15.790 align:middle line:90%


00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:23.470 align:middle line:84%
If you were take out this--
you see this rectangle,

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.919 align:middle line:84%
which happens to be a
golden mean rectangle?

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to
take that one out,

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.545 align:middle line:84%
and this golden mean
rectangle that's down in here,

00:07:31.545 --> 00:07:34.170 align:middle line:84%
and just taking the big one, if
you were to take this line that

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:38.580 align:middle line:84%
goes from here up to here
and that line that goes

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.820 align:middle line:84%
from there to there, you'll
notice there's one, two, three,

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.620 align:middle line:90%
four sides.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:48.105 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, you've got
another one coming down to here

00:07:48.105 --> 00:07:49.750 align:middle line:90%
and down to here.

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.670 align:middle line:90%
And that forms is an octahedron.

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:53.380 align:middle line:84%
I'll come over here
and I'll show you.

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.090 align:middle line:10%
What you now have
is one of these,

00:07:55.090 --> 00:08:03.470 align:middle line:10%
only it's sitting at
this angle like that,

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:07.520 align:middle line:10%
with one of the faces
flat to the other one.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.790 align:middle line:84%
So it's got a flat
part like that.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:14.230 align:middle line:84%
It's sitting like
that to the screen.

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:15.425 align:middle line:90%
Does everybody see that?

00:08:15.425 --> 00:08:16.225 align:middle line:90%
>>It's hard.

00:08:16.225 --> 00:08:17.500 align:middle line:90%
That's a hard one.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.210 align:middle line:90%
>>It's harder, I know.

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:20.342 align:middle line:90%
It's harder.

00:08:20.342 --> 00:08:21.550 align:middle line:90%
But you've got an octahedron.

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Mathematically that is
the view of this thing.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:28.250 align:middle line:90%


00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:30.670 align:middle line:90%
This is a square, right?

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.289 align:middle line:90%
It's a square.

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:38.716 align:middle line:84%
But when you turn it,
it becomes a rectangle.

00:08:38.716 --> 00:08:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And if you turn
it just right, it

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:44.260 align:middle line:84%
becomes a golden
mean rectangle, which

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.760 align:middle line:84%
just happens to be the
view that is right there.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:52.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's an octahedron
inside of an octahedron.

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, the next one
even gets harder.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:58.024 align:middle line:84%
It's where it goes--
if you were to erase

00:08:58.024 --> 00:08:59.940 align:middle line:84%
certain lines of the
original Metatron's cube,

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:05.060 align:middle line:90%
you'll come up with this.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:10.540 align:middle line:10%
And this one is an icosahedron.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:14.340 align:middle line:10%
You're looking at
this form up there.

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.830 align:middle line:10%
And I know it's hard.

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:21.006 align:middle line:10%
You have a pentagonal cap on
the top and pentagonal cap

00:09:21.006 --> 00:09:25.520 align:middle line:10%
on the bottom, and 10 little
triangles around the middle.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually
count each one of them.

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:30.850 align:middle line:84%
This is one face, two faces,
and this one from over here

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:32.270 align:middle line:90%
is three faces.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.560 align:middle line:84%
This is the fourth face,
and this is the fifth face.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.360 align:middle line:90%
Four in the cap.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.220 align:middle line:90%
There's one on the bottom.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.740 align:middle line:84%
If you carefully count the
triangles moving around,

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:43.740 align:middle line:84%
there's one, two,
three, four, five,

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:49.109 align:middle line:84%
and this is six, seven, eight,
nine, and then this one is 10.

00:09:49.109 --> 00:09:50.900 align:middle line:84%
There are 10 triangles
moving around there.

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:54.229 align:middle line:90%


00:09:54.229 --> 00:09:56.020 align:middle line:84%
Now that is identical
to what you were just

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.520 align:middle line:90%
looking at a moment ago.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.800 align:middle line:84%
This is a drawing
by Sulamith Wulfing,

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.270 align:middle line:84%
with the Christ child
inside of the icosahedron.

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:10.240 align:middle line:84%
It's extremely appropriate
because this is the doorway

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.840 align:middle line:90%
to Christ's consciousness.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And baptism is the doorway
into Christianity, right?

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:20.210 align:middle line:90%
This in ancient terms was water.

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:23.240 align:middle line:84%
Like fire, earth, air,
water, ether, this is water.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
baptism, or the doorway,

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.845 align:middle line:90%
into Christ's consciousness.

00:10:26.845 --> 00:10:29.662 align:middle line:84%
So you can see the line is
straight across in the back,

00:10:29.662 --> 00:10:30.870 align:middle line:90%
like it was in the other one.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Straight across in the
bottom, forming the five

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.130 align:middle line:90%
different patterns.

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:38.367 align:middle line:84%
Now the sixth one--
I mean the fifth one,

00:10:38.367 --> 00:10:39.680 align:middle line:90%
excuse me-- the dodecahedron.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.060 align:middle line:90%


00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they told
me it was there.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:48.285 align:middle line:84%
And I started looking for
it, and I couldn't find it.

00:10:48.285 --> 00:10:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And I looked, and I looked and
looked and looked and looked.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And I spent 20-something
years looking for this thing,

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:57.850 align:middle line:90%
and I never could find it.

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And Mackey went
to look, after me

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.200 align:middle line:84%
looking for 20-something
years, and in three days

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.820 align:middle line:90%
she found a part of it, anyway.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.400 align:middle line:84%
That was the first time
I'd ever found anything.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.931 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you what she
found in just a moment.

00:11:16.931 --> 00:11:18.680 align:middle line:84%
She did something I
never even dreamed of.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.670 align:middle line:84%
She took Metatron's cube and
rotated it by the five ratio.

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And this grid came,
which was incredible,

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:27.200 align:middle line:90%
which she calls Eve's Grid.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.652 align:middle line:90%
Eve's Grid.

00:11:28.652 --> 00:11:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'll show you
that in a moment.

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't even
know what it is.

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm beginning to understand
what that one is right now.

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.900 align:middle line:90%


00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.320 align:middle line:84%
So I started looking
for this shape.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.430 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't find it.

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:46.430 align:middle line:84%
At about two weeks ago
in the last workshop,

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:49.080 align:middle line:84%
somebody-- one of the
students in here--

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:52.030 align:middle line:84%
said, hey, you didn't
connect a certain point

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:52.830 align:middle line:90%
to a certain point.

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.540 align:middle line:90%
I go, I didn't?

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And I realized on here-- here's
the whole Metatron's cube--

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:03.430 align:middle line:84%
I had not connected
this point to that point

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:05.690 align:middle line:84%
all the way around
in the whole pattern.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And so I have 12 missing
lines on Metatron's cube.

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:14.070 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:16.490 align:middle line:90%
I just never saw it.

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And so this is truly
Metatron's cube here.

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:23.570 align:middle line:84%
Now that's all the spheres
connected by all of them,

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:25.600 align:middle line:90%
like they instructed me to do.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And now with this
pattern, you're

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:32.075 align:middle line:84%
now looking directly
at a dodecahedron.

00:12:32.075 --> 00:12:34.690 align:middle line:90%


00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:37.020 align:middle line:90%
It pops right out.

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:40.930 align:middle line:90%
Here it is, in the red lines.

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:43.230 align:middle line:10%
Everybody see that?

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:45.870 align:middle line:10%
See the red lines on
the page on there?

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:50.160 align:middle line:10%
The angles of these things,
the lines drawn from there,

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.310 align:middle line:10%
exactly make the reflecting
angles of all the faces.

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And you get a pentagonal
shape there, and one there.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.140 align:middle line:84%
These are the other five
sides at the sharp angles,

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:03.340 align:middle line:90%
and it wraps back around.

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.760 align:middle line:84%
And you have the other
side of it also--

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.444 align:middle line:84%
I've got to see
it for a second--

00:13:07.444 --> 00:13:09.360 align:middle line:84%
if you were to draw that
line in there, that's

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.130 align:middle line:90%
the pentagon on the backside.

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:14.214 align:middle line:84%
There's the pentagon
back on the other side.

00:13:14.214 --> 00:13:16.130 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing is totally
three-dimensionally

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:19.040 align:middle line:90%
wrapped around the entire thing.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:22.920 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing is
completely there.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.620 align:middle line:90%
>>Wow.

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:28.980 align:middle line:84%
>>And so you're the first
ones to ever see this.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.480 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's ever seen this before.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And I was very
excited about that.

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And there'll be another
one, a bigger one,

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.599 align:middle line:84%
on the outside of this whole
thing that'll enclose all this,

00:13:40.599 --> 00:13:42.840 align:middle line:84%
if you wanted to
work it through.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.660 align:middle line:84%
So there were all
five of the shapes.

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.621 align:middle line:90%
This is a clearer pattern of it.

00:13:48.621 --> 00:13:57.914 align:middle line:90%


00:13:57.914 --> 00:13:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And I have a whole
bunch of other slides

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.590 align:middle line:84%
if I wanted to do
it, showing you

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:08.159 align:middle line:84%
how you can take the spheres
out of the flower of life,

00:14:08.159 --> 00:14:10.450 align:middle line:84%
and there's a way where you
can show the ratios come up

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:15.400 align:middle line:84%
with the length of an edge of a
tetrahedron relative to a cube

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:20.750 align:middle line:84%
relative to a hexagon relative
edge of a five-sided pentagon

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:22.420 align:middle line:90%
relative to a hexagon.

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:25.600 align:middle line:84%
All four of those
edges are all lines

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.617 align:middle line:84%
that are links found
in the flower of life.

00:14:29.617 --> 00:14:31.450 align:middle line:84%
But they're all
inter-related to each other.

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:34.640 align:middle line:90%


00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.110 align:middle line:84%
This was the pattern
that Mackey found

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:41.985 align:middle line:84%
by turning Metatron's cube
into a certain ratio, the five

00:14:41.985 --> 00:14:42.785 align:middle line:90%
ratio.

00:14:42.785 --> 00:14:47.625 align:middle line:84%
It has a central five-sided
pattern with a full five

00:14:47.625 --> 00:14:49.159 align:middle line:90%
that come off of there.

00:14:49.159 --> 00:14:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And if you just take one more
off of each one of those,

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:54.240 align:middle line:90%
that's an unfolded dodecahedron.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.640 align:middle line:84%
But this is an
interesting pattern.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:00.820 align:middle line:84%
There's a man named Penrose
who made the Penrose pattern.

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:02.030 align:middle line:90%
Was this Roger Penrose?

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:02.996 align:middle line:90%
Is that his name?

00:15:02.996 --> 00:15:03.796 align:middle line:90%
Anybody know?

00:15:03.796 --> 00:15:05.050 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember.

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And see, they've
always tried to make

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:11.090 align:middle line:84%
five-sided shapes that will
cover a floor-- tile patterns.

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:13.640 align:middle line:84%
But they never could
figure out how to do it.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And so he came up
with this little shape

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:24.180 align:middle line:84%
here and another little shape,
which was a wider angled one.

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:27.452 align:middle line:84%
He took that shape that
would form in there

00:15:27.452 --> 00:15:28.910 align:middle line:84%
and put those two
together, and you

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:33.990 align:middle line:84%
can make Penrose patterns that
will cover a flat surface.

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was kind of a
game for a long time.

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And recently in
Scientific American,

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:44.003 align:middle line:84%
they would have people--
it was just sort

00:15:44.003 --> 00:15:47.860 align:middle line:84%
of like this game that was
going on between the Scientific

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.750 align:middle line:84%
American and people
who subscribed to that

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:54.900 align:middle line:84%
to who could come up with
the newest Penrose pattern.

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:58.659 align:middle line:84%
And then after that,
somebody had insight.

00:15:58.659 --> 00:16:00.950 align:middle line:84%
You see, there's something
called diffraction patterns,

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:05.820 align:middle line:84%
where they shoot electron
beams-- x-ray patterns,

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:09.120 align:middle line:84%
rather-- down through
crystalline structures,

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.140 align:middle line:84%
and they can see where
the atoms are located.

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And they only were able to
come up with certain patterns,

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:17.440 align:middle line:84%
and thought that there
were only certain kinds

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.770 align:middle line:84%
of crystalline
structures in existence.

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And then one day,
somebody theorized

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:26.930 align:middle line:84%
there had to be these, based
on the Penrose patterns.

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:30.280 align:middle line:84%
And recently-- and we're talking
about like two years ago--

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:34.270 align:middle line:84%
they discovered a new kind
of crystal in existence.

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:35.610 align:middle line:90%
The crystal's always been there.

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:37.240 align:middle line:84%
We just suddenly
became aware of it.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:40.130 align:middle line:90%
It's called a quasi crystal now.

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:44.141 align:middle line:84%
They've now been able to
come up with the patterns,

00:16:44.141 --> 00:16:46.540 align:middle line:84%
the understanding
of it, and it's

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:51.260 align:middle line:84%
opened up a whole new
level of crystallology.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:52.060 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:52.860 align:middle line:90%
Crystallology.

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:55.390 align:middle line:90%


00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And the meaning of
it is they suspect

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:00.610 align:middle line:84%
that pretty soon, they're going
to be able to make metals,

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:04.670 align:middle line:84%
say, about 10 times as hard
as diamond, for example, based

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:05.520 align:middle line:90%
on this.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And lots of other applications
will start coming out.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.980 align:middle line:84%
This one that they
don't know about yet.

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.720 align:middle line:84%
This is one based on
pentagons, and the other one.

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Every single line in here is
in the phi ratio-- golden mean

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:19.300 align:middle line:90%
proportion.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Every single thing in it,
and all; crossing patterns.

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:25.839 align:middle line:84%
Every line that you can
connect together synthetically

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:30.270 align:middle line:84%
through there is golden
mean ratio of lines.

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:33.895 align:middle line:84%
And it's got to be one
of the primary grids.

00:17:33.895 --> 00:17:36.436 align:middle line:90%


00:17:36.436 --> 00:17:38.936 align:middle line:84%
It's an area of research I'm
going to get into at one point.

00:17:38.936 --> 00:17:42.950 align:middle line:90%


00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:46.080 align:middle line:84%
Eventually in quasi
crystal studies,

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.850 align:middle line:84%
I'll bet you they
come up with this grid

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:49.490 align:middle line:84%
as being one of the
primary generating

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:52.340 align:middle line:90%
sources of the patterns.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:54.700 align:middle line:90%
>>Is it similar to a honeycomb?

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:55.500 align:middle line:90%
>>To a what?

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.440 align:middle line:90%
>>Honeycomb.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.240 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.730 align:middle line:84%
That's a hexagonal pattern,
which is a little different.

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:03.280 align:middle line:90%


00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.212 align:middle line:90%
So you've got these five shapes.

00:18:06.212 --> 00:18:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Now that we've showed
you where they came from,

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:09.836 align:middle line:84%
how they came out of
the flower of life,

00:18:09.836 --> 00:18:13.020 align:middle line:84%
through the fruit
of life pattern.

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:17.900 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to quickly show you
that the number relationship.

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:21.380 align:middle line:84%
This one has four faces,
four corners, and six edges.

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And the tetrahedron
is a real special one.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:29.070 align:middle line:84%
The hexagon, or the cube,
has six faces, eight corners,

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:31.300 align:middle line:90%
and 12 edges.

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.800 align:middle line:84%
The cube-- in
sacred geometry they

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.450 align:middle line:84%
have something
that's called a dual.

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:38.939 align:middle line:84%
A duel is if you
connect the faces--

00:18:38.939 --> 00:18:40.980 align:middle line:84%
this is one way of getting
to duals-- you connect

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:43.500 align:middle line:84%
the centers of the
faces of this one,

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.600 align:middle line:84%
and what you get
is an octahedron.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.370 align:middle line:90%


00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:49.170 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:51.180 align:middle line:90%
They're duals of each other.

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:55.540 align:middle line:90%
And look at the numbers.

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:57.890 align:middle line:84%
This one has six faces,
eight corners, and 12 edges.

00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And this one has eight faces,
six corners, and 12 edges.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:08.460 align:middle line:84%
Then you have the dodecahedron,
which has 12 faces, 20 corners,

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:09.930 align:middle line:90%
and 30 edges.

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:14.080 align:middle line:84%
If you connect the centers
of a dodecahedron together,

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:17.480 align:middle line:90%
you get an icosahedron.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And again, 12 faces, 20 corners,
30 edges, 20 faces, 12 corners,

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:23.350 align:middle line:90%
30 edges.

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:25.900 align:middle line:90%


00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.160 align:middle line:90%
They're duals of each other.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.770 align:middle line:84%
You can take this as your
major building block,

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:36.450 align:middle line:84%
and you can take
two tetrahedrons

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:43.840 align:middle line:84%
and slip them together into a
star tetrahedron like this one.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Take two tetrahedrons, pass
them through each other

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:50.545 align:middle line:84%
into a three-dimensional Star
of David, and you have a cube.

00:19:50.545 --> 00:19:56.430 align:middle line:90%


00:19:56.430 --> 00:20:00.840 align:middle line:84%
You can take five tetrahedrons
and put them together

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:04.900 align:middle line:84%
in an icosahedronal
cap type thing,

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:09.570 align:middle line:84%
and those will assemble
together into a dodecahedron.

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:11.720 align:middle line:84%
But it takes 60
of them to do it.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.530 align:middle line:90%


00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:16.290 align:middle line:84%
I've been asked
many times about why

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:19.097 align:middle line:84%
there are 72 orders to the
Great White Brotherhood.

00:20:19.097 --> 00:20:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And as you've probably
read this many times before

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:23.040 align:middle line:90%
in other places, I don't know.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:28.640 align:middle line:84%
They're 72 orders, and the
first order is Alpha and Omega

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:32.180 align:middle line:84%
Order of Melchizedek, and the
last order is the Brotherhood

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:33.749 align:middle line:90%
of the Seven Rays.

00:20:33.749 --> 00:20:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Those are the two orders
that I'm connected with.

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:37.706 align:middle line:84%
I know very little about
what's in the middle.

00:20:37.706 --> 00:20:40.360 align:middle line:90%


00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.400 align:middle line:84%
But the reason
there are 72 orders

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.990 align:middle line:84%
is because these 72 orders
have one thing-- they

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:48.140 align:middle line:84%
are to create the
Christ consciousness

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:50.550 align:middle line:90%
grid around the planet.

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And that grid is made
up of these two shapes.

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:59.610 align:middle line:90%


00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And the creation
pattern is that there's

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:07.370 align:middle line:84%
60 tetrahedrons in here, which
is the building block of this,

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:10.102 align:middle line:84%
and there are 12 points
that are the center points

00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:11.560 align:middle line:84%
and the center of
each one of these

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.450 align:middle line:90%
that form the icosahedron.

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And the 60 plus
the 12 is the 72.

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:20.380 align:middle line:84%
And so each one of the orders is
working with a different facet

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:23.090 align:middle line:84%
or area of the grid of
the Christ consciousness

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:25.120 align:middle line:90%
to create this on the Earth.

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:36.180 align:middle line:90%


00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:37.905 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we started
as an octahedron,

00:21:37.905 --> 00:21:40.990 align:middle line:84%
and that's a view of an
octahedron from there.

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:44.612 align:middle line:84%
That's that view
of the octahedron.

00:21:44.612 --> 00:21:45.820 align:middle line:90%
I like to use different ones.

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:48.460 align:middle line:84%
There's three symmetrical
views of each one of these.

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:50.607 align:middle line:90%


00:21:50.607 --> 00:21:52.440 align:middle line:84%
So remember, we started
with the octahedron,

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.310 align:middle line:90%
then we went to the sphere.

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:58.400 align:middle line:84%
That's the central column,
which is the neutral column.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.570 align:middle line:84%
Over here, the
tetrahedron and the cube

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:03.600 align:middle line:90%
is literally your left brain.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.240 align:middle line:84%
Remember I said how the
triangle and square was

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:09.750 align:middle line:84%
the logical side, it
was forward on the male?

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is the female side,
the right side of the brain,

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:17.020 align:middle line:84%
either of a person or a
planet or anything else.

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is based on
five, the pentagon.

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And so is this
based on five again,

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:27.070 align:middle line:84%
when you say that
it's this thing.

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:30.130 align:middle line:90%


00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And so this is
female, this is male,

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:38.925 align:middle line:84%
and this child, or
neutral, aspect of life.

00:22:38.925 --> 00:22:42.370 align:middle line:90%


00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:44.850 align:middle line:84%
In terms of mathematical
relationships, they're endless.

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:45.725 align:middle line:90%
You could just go on.

00:22:45.725 --> 00:22:48.390 align:middle line:84%
You could write reams
of books about all

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:52.572 align:middle line:84%
the mathematical possibilities
that are all in there.

00:22:52.572 --> 00:22:54.780 align:middle line:84%
They're all interconnected
again and again and again.

00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:57.630 align:middle line:90%


00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:01.460 align:middle line:84%
One thing I do want to
mention is in alchemy,

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:04.575 align:middle line:84%
there is something called
fire, earth, air, and water

00:23:04.575 --> 00:23:06.480 align:middle line:90%
that we hear about so often.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And the ancients believed
that the fire, earth, air,

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:11.820 align:middle line:84%
and water and two
other substances

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:12.945 align:middle line:90%
were the key to everything.

00:23:12.945 --> 00:23:16.290 align:middle line:90%


00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:18.080 align:middle line:84%
They usually only
talk about those four,

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.960 align:middle line:84%
because they leave out
the most important one.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.570 align:middle line:84%
They always keep that secret,
and that one is sometimes

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:24.990 align:middle line:90%
referred to as ether.

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:27.520 align:middle line:84%
But ether and prana
are the same thing,

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:30.700 align:middle line:84%
or ether and prana and tachyon
energy are the same thing.

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.170 align:middle line:90%
It's all the same thing.

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And again, this was the most
sacred shape of the ancients,

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:42.010 align:middle line:84%
and this was the
one that was ether.

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:44.760 align:middle line:84%
They all have amounts,
and I'll tell you

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.000 align:middle line:90%
what they are right now.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.530 align:middle line:84%
This is according to
the Pythagorean school

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:50.840 align:middle line:90%
and tied back to Egypt.

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:53.425 align:middle line:10%
This one here, the
tetrahedron, was fire.

00:23:53.425 --> 00:23:56.640 align:middle line:90%


00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.340 align:middle line:10%
And it's a pyramid.

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:01.200 align:middle line:84%
There's three-sided, four-sided,
and five-sided pyramids.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And pyramid means
fire in the midst.

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:12.945 align:middle line:10%
And the cube is Earth,
stensas, matter.

00:24:12.945 --> 00:24:15.760 align:middle line:10%


00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:20.500 align:middle line:10%
And the octahedron is air.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.630 align:middle line:90%


00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:25.680 align:middle line:10%
It's the eight element
of the periodic table.

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.420 align:middle line:10%


00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:35.530 align:middle line:10%
And the icosahedron is water.

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:38.970 align:middle line:90%


00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:47.390 align:middle line:10%
And the dodecahedron is
ether, and the little sphere--

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:48.190 align:middle line:10%
the sphere.

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:53.560 align:middle line:10%
I have a little sphere--
the sphere is voidness.

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.200 align:middle line:10%
There are six
elements that create

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:59.360 align:middle line:10%
the universe-- voidness, fire,
earth, air, water, and ether.

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:04.860 align:middle line:10%
And they all have shape,
as everything does.

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:08.552 align:middle line:10%
And they happen to have the
primary shapes of the universe.

00:25:08.552 --> 00:25:10.635 align:middle line:10%
So these six shapes-- the
sphere, the tetrahedron,

00:25:10.635 --> 00:25:14.290 align:middle line:10%
the cube, the
octahedron, icosahedron,

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:19.445 align:middle line:10%
and the dodecahedron are
the ABCs of the alphabet,

00:25:19.445 --> 00:25:20.840 align:middle line:10%
of the whole thing.

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.280 align:middle line:10%
They're what creates the
underlying structures

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:25.050 align:middle line:10%
that all structures
are based upon.

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:29.290 align:middle line:90%


00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:32.520 align:middle line:10%
And these are just like some of
the mathematical relationships,

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:35.690 align:middle line:10%
how one thing fits inside the
next and fits inside the next.

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:37.724 align:middle line:84%
In sacred geometry
it's called nesting,

00:25:37.724 --> 00:25:39.390 align:middle line:84%
where one cube will
fit to the next one,

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:41.480 align:middle line:84%
will form the next one,
will go to the next one.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.938 align:middle line:84%
You just couldn't
do this normally.

00:25:42.938 --> 00:25:43.830 align:middle line:90%
It acts like magic.

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:47.730 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing what it can do.

00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:54.940 align:middle line:84%
To show you one
shape, here's a cube.

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:56.216 align:middle line:90%
Does everybody see the cube?

00:25:56.216 --> 00:25:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>>Mm-hm.

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>>Can you see the centers
of each of the faces

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:04.150 align:middle line:84%
are connected together, forming
a little tiny octahedron

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:05.280 align:middle line:90%
in the middle?

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:08.470 align:middle line:90%
Does everybody see that?

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:09.270 align:middle line:90%
Can you see it?

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:11.280 align:middle line:90%
Does anybody not see it?

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:14.660 align:middle line:84%
It's a little one of
these guys in the middle,

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:15.570 align:middle line:90%
sitting like that.

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:18.667 align:middle line:90%


00:26:18.667 --> 00:26:20.250 align:middle line:84%
So you have those
two linked together.

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:28.780 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, it's
a star tetrahedron,

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:31.680 align:middle line:84%
which is one of those guys that
you see sitting right there.

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:35.400 align:middle line:84%
So a star tetrahedron has an
octahedron in the middle of it.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:38.200 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to make one,
you can just take an octahedron

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.825 align:middle line:84%
and make those little
triangular shapes

00:26:39.825 --> 00:26:41.820 align:middle line:84%
and stick them on
each of the faces,

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:42.986 align:middle line:90%
and you've got one of those.

00:26:42.986 --> 00:26:51.292 align:middle line:90%


00:26:51.292 --> 00:26:54.064 align:middle line:84%
And then you can make
fancy ones like this.

00:26:54.064 --> 00:26:56.075 align:middle line:90%
>>Wow.

00:26:56.075 --> 00:26:56.908 align:middle line:90%
>>Isn't that pretty?

00:26:56.908 --> 00:27:01.180 align:middle line:90%


00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:02.070 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:10.390 align:middle line:84%
Now after this, I'm about to
take this abstract information

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:15.640 align:middle line:84%
that came out of the first
system of the fruit of life

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.510 align:middle line:84%
and apply it directly
into life, so you

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:19.200 align:middle line:90%
can see how life uses it.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.020 align:middle line:84%
We're going to first
look at crystals,

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:24.000 align:middle line:84%
and then we're going to look at
biological life forms like you,

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:31.180 align:middle line:84%
and see how in these
two areas this is used.

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:35.536 align:middle line:84%
>>I don't understand those
two, why those are feminine.

00:27:35.536 --> 00:27:39.895 align:middle line:90%


00:27:39.895 --> 00:27:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>>It's kind of
like understanding

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:44.020 align:middle line:84%
why a straight line is male
and a curved line is female.

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:50.620 align:middle line:84%
It's something that you begin
to intuit after a while.

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:52.940 align:middle line:84%
The longer you
work in the stuff,

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:57.830 align:middle line:84%
you keep coming up with
these patterns tend

00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:59.890 align:middle line:84%
to be things that are
associated with male,

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:02.640 align:middle line:84%
and these patterns tend to
be associated with female.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:07.340 align:middle line:84%
For example, the hexagon--
the cube is either

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:11.750 align:middle line:84%
a square or a hexagon or an
octahedron, I mean eight-sided.

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:14.210 align:middle line:84%
Anything that's four, six,
or eight is associated

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:18.590 align:middle line:84%
with the cube, if you look at
life forms that are on Earth,

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:21.260 align:middle line:90%
that are on land.

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:25.450 align:middle line:84%
If you go into water, which is
female, you go into the oceans,

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:27.480 align:middle line:84%
you'll find an
overwhelming number

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:31.880 align:middle line:84%
of them are based on five,
like the starfish for example,

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:34.164 align:middle line:90%
and the sand dollar.

00:28:34.164 --> 00:28:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And you can go on and
on and on and on and on.

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:37.480 align:middle line:90%
A lot of this fiveness.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's going to be
exceptions on both sides.

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:44.290 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be the-- what
do you call it?-- the octopus,

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:47.624 align:middle line:90%
for example, has eight.

00:28:47.624 --> 00:28:49.540 align:middle line:84%
But if you list them
all, and if you see them,

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:53.875 align:middle line:84%
you'll see this huge amount
that's fiveness down there

00:28:53.875 --> 00:28:55.880 align:middle line:90%
and sixness on land.

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:59.050 align:middle line:84%
You can see where
the water aspect

00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:01.530 align:middle line:84%
pulls things more that
are female and more that

00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:02.330 align:middle line:90%
are five-sided.

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:03.986 align:middle line:84%
So it's like you
start working this,

00:29:03.986 --> 00:29:07.550 align:middle line:84%
and it's more like an intuitive
thing to come up with this.

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:11.044 align:middle line:84%
And then when you look
at the brain functions

00:29:11.044 --> 00:29:13.460 align:middle line:84%
and you start looking at the
logical patterns of the male,

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:17.010 align:middle line:84%
they keep coming up being
three-sided and four-sided.

00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:20.236 align:middle line:84%
And the female side is
three-sided and five-sided.

00:29:20.236 --> 00:29:24.980 align:middle line:84%
>>But isn't all the males
inside the females there also?

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>>What?

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:28.644 align:middle line:90%
All the males inside the female?

00:29:28.644 --> 00:29:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>>Aren't they contained
in all those female--?

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:34.027 align:middle line:84%
>>Each one of these contains
the others in various ways.

00:29:34.027 --> 00:29:36.360 align:middle line:84%
>>It's the circle around the
outside, what she's saying.

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:37.160 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Oh, the female contains
them all, yeah.

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:41.640 align:middle line:84%
The female contains
all the male.

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:44.840 align:middle line:84%
But the male also contains
all the other ones, too.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:48.910 align:middle line:90%
There's one male form that does.

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:51.170 align:middle line:84%
There's two forms there
that are very special.

00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:57.000 align:middle line:84%
The sphere is the mommy,
and the cube is the daddy.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.150 align:middle line:90%
It's the big daddy.

00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:01.240 align:middle line:90%


00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.980 align:middle line:90%
And the sphere is the big momma.

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And the mama will contain all
of the other five male shapes,

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:14.120 align:middle line:84%
but the cube will also
contain all the other four

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:16.440 align:middle line:90%
males, including the mommy.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:20.640 align:middle line:84%
None of the other ones will
do that, but this one will.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.930 align:middle line:84%
By that, in a very
special way, you

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:25.980 align:middle line:84%
can take a sphere--
it's symmetrical.

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:27.660 align:middle line:90%
You can put them in a cube.

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:29.870 align:middle line:84%
You can take a sphere and
slide it right in there,

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:32.840 align:middle line:84%
and it will symmetrically
touch perfectly.

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
take the-- this one,

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:41.590 align:middle line:90%
and it will fit in like that.

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:44.470 align:middle line:84%
If you made the size just right,
it will just slide right in.

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:48.190 align:middle line:84%
One of the tetrahedron edges
has become the diagonals

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:50.650 align:middle line:90%
across the cube.

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's another one
of the keys, by the way,

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:54.320 align:middle line:90%
is the diagonals.

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.900 align:middle line:84%
The diagonals, as you'll
see as this unfolds,

00:30:56.900 --> 00:31:00.840 align:middle line:84%
is almost always
where the hinge is.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:04.220 align:middle line:84%
It's where the secret of
anything you're trying to find

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:06.020 align:middle line:84%
will usually be found
along the diagonals.

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:08.960 align:middle line:90%


00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And so the tetrahedron and
the sphere will fit in there.

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:14.760 align:middle line:84%
The octahedron is
easy, because you just

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.520 align:middle line:84%
connect the centers
of it, and that

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:18.020 align:middle line:84%
will slide right
in there perfectly,

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:20.030 align:middle line:90%
if you get the size just right.

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:22.015 align:middle line:84%
These two female
forms, though, it

00:31:22.015 --> 00:31:23.890 align:middle line:84%
doesn't look like they
would ever go in there

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:28.720 align:middle line:84%
symmetrically, until you
notice something about them.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And that is if you put
them just like this

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:34.530 align:middle line:84%
at their hexagonal view, you
have an edge in the front,

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:37.421 align:middle line:84%
and another edge exactly
the same in the back.

00:31:37.421 --> 00:31:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
a symmetrical edge

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:41.860 align:middle line:84%
along this side and this side
and another symmetrical edge

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:44.640 align:middle line:90%
along the top and the bottom.

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.970 align:middle line:84%
So you can take this and just
go right inside of the cube,

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:49.900 align:middle line:84%
and this little
edge will fit right

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:53.977 align:middle line:84%
in the center of each face,
symmetrically and perfectly.

00:31:53.977 --> 00:31:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And you can do the same
thing with this one.

00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:59.259 align:middle line:84%
You've got to turn it
just right to like this.

00:31:59.259 --> 00:32:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Now there's an edge
across the front,

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:05.359 align:middle line:84%
and there's another edge exactly
the same across the back.

00:32:05.359 --> 00:32:07.650 align:middle line:84%
There's a left, and there's
a right, and there's a top,

00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:11.700 align:middle line:84%
and there's a bottom, and it
will just slide right in there.

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:14.320 align:middle line:84%
And so the cube,
by its very nature,

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:17.300 align:middle line:84%
contains the proportions
of all the other ones,

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:19.370 align:middle line:90%
including the sphere.

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:23.915 align:middle line:84%
And so the cube and the sphere
are the two most important

00:32:23.915 --> 00:32:26.160 align:middle line:90%
of these shapes.

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.450 align:middle line:84%
This is why, for
anyone who's studied

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:31.080 align:middle line:84%
Walter Russell-- anybody
know about Walter Russell?

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, Walter Russell's
work, the reason

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:35.430 align:middle line:84%
it worked-- he didn't know
anything about sacred geometry.

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:40.687 align:middle line:84%
If he had, he would've
leaped in consciousness.

00:32:40.687 --> 00:32:42.270 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know it
existed, or he would

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:43.793 align:middle line:90%
have been super brilliant.

00:32:43.793 --> 00:32:45.292 align:middle line:84%
He's already super
brilliant, but he

00:32:45.292 --> 00:32:48.030 align:middle line:84%
would have really went out there
if he'd have known about this.

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:50.346 align:middle line:84%
But he picked the
two right shapes.

00:32:50.346 --> 00:32:51.720 align:middle line:84%
He picked the cube
and the sphere

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.890 align:middle line:84%
to be the basis
of his philosophy.

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:57.984 align:middle line:84%
And because he did, he was able
to do a great deal of things.

00:32:57.984 --> 00:32:59.400 align:middle line:84%
He could have
chosen other shapes,

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:02.250 align:middle line:84%
and he would have
been incorrect.

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And just even in
the Bible, the Bible

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:12.034 align:middle line:84%
says that the throne of God
is so many cubits this way

00:33:12.034 --> 00:33:13.200 align:middle line:90%
and so many cubits this way.

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And so when you make
one, it's a cube.

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:18.480 align:middle line:90%


00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:21.875 align:middle line:84%
And the chair that all
the Egyptian sat on--

00:33:21.875 --> 00:33:23.690 align:middle line:90%
have you ever noticed it?

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:27.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a cube with a
little back on it.

00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:31.360 align:middle line:84%
The cube is a really, really,
really important male form.

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:34.500 align:middle line:10%
It's probably the most
male form that there

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:38.990 align:middle line:10%
is, whereas the sphere is the
most female form that there is.

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>>For the purpose of raising
one's level of consciousness,

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:44.740 align:middle line:84%
or sending, or whatever,
what would be the most ideal

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.643 align:middle line:90%
structure to have to live in?

00:33:46.643 --> 00:33:47.600 align:middle line:90%
>>You mean to sit in?

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:49.240 align:middle line:90%
>>To live in.

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:51.214 align:middle line:84%
Like, if you could
build your own house

00:33:51.214 --> 00:33:52.130 align:middle line:90%
any shape you wanted--

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:58.360 align:middle line:84%
>>There's all kinds of people
trying to study that right now,

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:02.210 align:middle line:90%
and I really don't know.

00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:04.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that's going
to really matter that much.

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:07.450 align:middle line:90%


00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:10.980 align:middle line:84%
Once you get the Merkaba going,
and that aspect of your field's

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:13.740 align:middle line:84%
going, it won't matter what the
shape of the building you're

00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:14.540 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:15.340 align:middle line:90%
It won't matter.

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:17.929 align:middle line:90%


00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:20.270 align:middle line:84%
No outside influence
can influence what's

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:21.519 align:middle line:90%
internally inside the Merkaba.

00:34:21.519 --> 00:34:26.409 align:middle line:90%


00:34:26.409 --> 00:34:28.699 align:middle line:84%
But there is-- if you want
to look at [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:30.870 align:middle line:84%
Mills' work, which
I'll give you,

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:34.175 align:middle line:84%
he makes this shape
for people to get into,

00:34:34.175 --> 00:34:35.550 align:middle line:84%
a big one that
you can climb into

00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:38.710 align:middle line:84%
and has reflective things,
which are incredible.

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:41.810 align:middle line:84%
It really is amazing when
you're inside of these things,

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:45.520 align:middle line:84%
because of what it does, how
they reflect energy back.

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:50.219 align:middle line:84%
And my thought was to do a
lot of Wilhelm Reich's work

00:34:50.219 --> 00:34:53.280 align:middle line:84%
with the doorbusters--
you know what that is?

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:56.190 align:middle line:90%


00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:58.600 align:middle line:84%
He's created mirrors
for life energy

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:00.675 align:middle line:84%
that reflect prana
using steel wool

00:35:00.675 --> 00:35:02.750 align:middle line:84%
and cotton in
certain thicknesses,

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:04.470 align:middle line:84%
and it reflects it
just like a mirror.

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:06.710 align:middle line:90%
You can make these blankets.

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:08.923 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they're illegal
in the United States.

00:35:08.923 --> 00:35:09.830 align:middle line:90%
>>Really?

00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:09.965 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:35:09.965 --> 00:35:11.536 align:middle line:90%
>>Because they don't work.

00:35:11.536 --> 00:35:12.445 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:12.445 --> 00:35:14.070 align:middle line:84%
But if they don't
work, then who cares?

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:15.278 align:middle line:90%
What difference does it make?

00:35:15.278 --> 00:35:16.864 align:middle line:90%
But they do work.

00:35:16.864 --> 00:35:18.280 align:middle line:84%
If you lay in one
of these things,

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:20.040 align:middle line:84%
you can only stay
in about 30 seconds

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:22.110 align:middle line:84%
and you go screaming
out from underneath it,

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:23.590 align:middle line:90%
because they're so powerful.

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:26.580 align:middle line:84%
He used to make these rooms
that look like outhouses--

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:29.690 align:middle line:84%
because he didn't know
anything about shape-- made out

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:32.595 align:middle line:84%
of these walls that were steel
wool and cotton and steel wool

00:35:32.595 --> 00:35:34.000 align:middle line:90%
and cotton, and certain things.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And you go in there and it
reflects all your life energy

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:38.610 align:middle line:90%
back at you.

00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:41.870 align:middle line:84%
You can't stay in one of those
rooms more than 15 minutes.

00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:44.404 align:middle line:84%
You'll kick the door down
and get out of there.

00:35:44.404 --> 00:35:46.220 align:middle line:90%
>>Healing?

00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:48.490 align:middle line:84%
>>It's healing to a point,
but if it gets too much,

00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:50.595 align:middle line:90%
it will actually make you sick.

00:35:50.595 --> 00:35:53.170 align:middle line:84%
If you get too much, it's
just like you get OD'ed on it.

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:55.070 align:middle line:84%
But they could make
those-- I've always

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:56.486 align:middle line:84%
wanted to make one
of those things

00:35:56.486 --> 00:35:59.030 align:middle line:84%
like this, where it
really reflected it.

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:02.489 align:middle line:84%
Not only did it mirror it, but
reflected it and focused it.

00:36:02.489 --> 00:36:04.405 align:middle line:84%
You could put it right
into a certain shocker,

00:36:04.405 --> 00:36:06.988 align:middle line:84%
and you'd probably stay in there
for like two seconds and jump

00:36:06.988 --> 00:36:08.770 align:middle line:90%
out, or something.

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:10.740 align:middle line:84%
But I've never done
that kind of stuff.

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:12.685 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of real
fun experimentation

00:36:12.685 --> 00:36:14.915 align:middle line:84%
that you could do on
this, and the effects

00:36:14.915 --> 00:36:16.290 align:middle line:84%
that these have
on consciousness.

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:19.000 align:middle line:90%
They do affect you dramatically.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.140 align:middle line:84%
You can just sit in them
and feel the differences.

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:25.065 align:middle line:84%
You can also look
at the work of, say,

00:36:25.065 --> 00:36:28.030 align:middle line:84%
Greg Hogue, of
Metaforms, who makes

00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:30.390 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of pyramidal
structures and things

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:33.150 align:middle line:84%
that you can sit in, and
experiment with that.

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:37.830 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you sit
inside of a pyramid,

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:45.370 align:middle line:84%
where you've got a 51 degrees,
51 minutes, 24 second degree

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:48.100 align:middle line:84%
angle-- it's the angle
of the Great Pyramid--

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:50.550 align:middle line:84%
and if you sit in there
and you align it properly,

00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:55.697 align:middle line:84%
and you go to sleep,
your first couple nights

00:36:55.697 --> 00:36:56.780 align:middle line:90%
might be a little strange.

00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:59.320 align:middle line:84%
But after that,
you'll find that you

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:02.270 align:middle line:84%
get about three or four hours--
has anyone ever done this?

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:04.352 align:middle line:90%


00:37:04.352 --> 00:37:06.560 align:middle line:84%
You probably found-- I'll
just tell you what I found,

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:09.200 align:middle line:84%
and you can tell me if you found
the same thing-- I found three

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:12.180 align:middle line:84%
to maybe four hours of
sleep, and you wake up,

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:15.010 align:middle line:90%
and that's it, baby.

00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:16.830 align:middle line:90%
You don't need any more.

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:20.470 align:middle line:90%
And what did you find?

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:23.420 align:middle line:84%
>>I just wanted the
dimensions again.

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:24.227 align:middle line:90%
>>Of what?

00:37:24.227 --> 00:37:25.390 align:middle line:90%
>>Of the pyramid.

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>>It's just the Great Pyramid.

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.510 align:middle line:90%
You can get that anywhere.

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:34.510 align:middle line:84%
It's the angle 51 degrees,
51 minutes, 24 seconds.

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And a pyramid reflects
a sphere perfectly,

00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:45.030 align:middle line:90%
if the angle is right.

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:50.080 align:middle line:10%
And so it reflects your life
force energy right back at you,

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:53.150 align:middle line:10%
and you just regenerate
very quickly.

00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:56.660 align:middle line:10%
This is an x-ray
pattern of a barrel--

00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:59.100 align:middle line:10%
I think it's a barrel--
yeah, it's a barrel crystal.

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:02.070 align:middle line:10%
It's an x-ray
diffraction pattern.

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:06.490 align:middle line:10%
And it is one of the closest
means of actually seeing

00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:08.870 align:middle line:10%
into crystals to see
how their atoms are

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:12.425 align:middle line:10%
arranged when physically looking
in there and looking at them.

00:38:12.425 --> 00:38:13.800 align:middle line:10%
I just want to
show you this one.

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.870 align:middle line:10%
Notice how the
atoms are arranged.

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:18.480 align:middle line:10%
And you can actually see
the flower of life pattern

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.805 align:middle line:10%
in there.

00:38:19.805 --> 00:38:20.605 align:middle line:10%
See it?

00:38:20.605 --> 00:38:26.510 align:middle line:90%


00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:32.157 align:middle line:10%
So why do atoms just
happen to arrange

00:38:32.157 --> 00:38:34.750 align:middle line:10%
in these sacred patterns?

00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:36.980 align:middle line:10%
This is one of the
salt crystal here.

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:38.980 align:middle line:10%
It's another
diffraction pattern.

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:41.700 align:middle line:10%


00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:45.030 align:middle line:10%
And if you notice, a
salt crystal is a cube.

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:51.370 align:middle line:10%
You see the cubicle nature
of these patterns in there.

00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:52.960 align:middle line:10%
Now, these are atoms.

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:55.670 align:middle line:10%
Each one of these little
flat spots is an atom.

00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:58.920 align:middle line:10%
And if you notice,
the atoms are spheres.

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:00.475 align:middle line:10%
Now, what we've
really got here is

00:39:00.475 --> 00:39:02.330 align:middle line:10%
a little speck of nothingness.

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:03.830 align:middle line:10%
If this was an atom
this big, you've

00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:06.100 align:middle line:10%
got a little tiny speck
you can hardly see,

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:10.210 align:middle line:10%
with these electrons that are
probably somewhere around them.

00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:14.550 align:middle line:10%
The electrons are moving
around the central core

00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:17.970 align:middle line:10%
at nine-tenths the
speed of light.

00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:21.500 align:middle line:10%
The speed of light is
186,200 miles a second.

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:23.670 align:middle line:10%
That's miles a second.

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:25.380 align:middle line:10%
And this is a speck
you can hardly see,

00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:30.137 align:middle line:10%
and these little electrons are
moving around-- in one second,

00:39:30.137 --> 00:39:32.470 align:middle line:10%
that little electron has gone
around that point that you

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:36.580 align:middle line:10%
can't even see, something
like 160,000 miles.

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:38.580 align:middle line:10%
It's inconceivable.

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:41.730 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I used to sit
there in physics going nah.

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:43.510 align:middle line:10%
They're pulling my leg.

00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:44.310 align:middle line:10%
Nah.

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:47.480 align:middle line:90%


00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:51.260 align:middle line:10%
And so they're moving so
fast as they move around

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:53.000 align:middle line:10%
that you can't
see them, but they

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.850 align:middle line:10%
form what's called an
electron cloud, or a sphere.

00:39:56.850 --> 00:39:59.990 align:middle line:10%
It's a spherical cloud
around the outer shell.

00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And so all of your
atoms that form

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:09.120 align:middle line:84%
all of the fabric of the
nature are little spheres.

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:13.500 align:middle line:84%
One of the most sacred
forms of the reality.

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:15.820 align:middle line:84%
It's such an obvious one
that we don't think about it.

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:18.350 align:middle line:90%
We live on a sphere.

00:40:18.350 --> 00:40:19.440 align:middle line:90%
The sun is a sphere.

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:20.720 align:middle line:90%
The moon is a sphere.

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And all these spheres
are all over the place,

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:25.170 align:middle line:90%
and it just goes right over us.

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:30.430 align:middle line:84%
We're so used to it that we
don't perceive the sacredness

00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:33.000 align:middle line:90%
of the simplicity of the shape.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.060 align:middle line:90%
It just goes right past us.

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And so the whole fabric
is made out of spheres.

00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:40.030 align:middle line:84%
There's spheres
all over the place.

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:42.145 align:middle line:84%
Light-- all the light
waves moving through space

00:40:42.145 --> 00:40:42.945 align:middle line:90%
are all spheres.

00:40:42.945 --> 00:40:48.402 align:middle line:90%


00:40:48.402 --> 00:40:50.860 align:middle line:84%
We normally think of a light
wave doing this kind of thing,

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:52.840 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:56.060 align:middle line:84%
But you don't have this
little thing going down there

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:57.790 align:middle line:90%
through-- across space.

00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:01.340 align:middle line:84%
If you took, let's say,
a light inside this cube

00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:06.110 align:middle line:84%
and flashed it, and these were
flashed in all directions,

00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:08.030 align:middle line:84%
well, you don't have
a cubicle pattern

00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:09.370 align:middle line:90%
of light moving off from there.

00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:11.370 align:middle line:84%
Even though you look down
it and you see a cube,

00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:14.240 align:middle line:84%
if you looked back from a
few thousand miles back,

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.530 align:middle line:90%
you'd see a cube.

00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:17.305 align:middle line:84%
But the pattern
it's going off there

00:41:17.305 --> 00:41:21.950 align:middle line:84%
isn't cubical, because
a light wave leaves

00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:25.860 align:middle line:84%
the center of this
surface going straight up,

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:32.290 align:middle line:84%
and one second is
186,200 miles away.

00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:33.980 align:middle line:84%
The ones going off
the point of the edge

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:37.890 align:middle line:90%
are also 186,200 miles away.

00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And when you think about how
far that is and the distances

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:45.120 align:middle line:84%
between those two beams
are almost identical,

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:50.140 align:middle line:84%
the only difference is this
little tiny bit of difference.

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:52.120 align:middle line:90%
You couldn't see the difference.

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:55.150 align:middle line:84%
In one second, you have
a near perfect sphere

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:58.022 align:middle line:90%
of light leaving that cube.

00:41:58.022 --> 00:42:02.670 align:middle line:84%
In two seconds, that
little tiny difference,

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:05.915 align:middle line:84%
which is always there,
approaches zero very,

00:42:05.915 --> 00:42:06.715 align:middle line:90%
very quickly.

00:42:06.715 --> 00:42:09.770 align:middle line:90%
It never actually reaches it.

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:13.360 align:middle line:84%
So you have these waves
of light expanding off

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.384 align:middle line:90%
of objects that are spheres.

00:42:15.384 --> 00:42:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And so all of your
light waves out

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:20.400 align:middle line:84%
there are all these interacting
spheres of light waves.

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Even if you have
really big things,

00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:25.680 align:middle line:84%
then that just means it
takes longer for them

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:28.520 align:middle line:90%
to become spheres, is all it is.

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:31.480 align:middle line:90%


00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:34.460 align:middle line:10%
The atoms are all
different sizes of spheres,

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:36.550 align:middle line:10%
depending on how
many electron shells

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:42.420 align:middle line:10%
they go out from, and what
their internal structure is.

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:44.410 align:middle line:10%
And depending on
whether or not they

00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:46.940 align:middle line:10%
have all of their
outer electrons

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:50.450 align:middle line:10%
or don't, and by what,
they're going to either

00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:53.520 align:middle line:10%
have a positive or negative
charge on their outer electron

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:54.360 align:middle line:10%
shell.

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:58.010 align:middle line:10%
And that is the primary
basis of chemistry--

00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:00.460 align:middle line:10%
what things will join and
will not join together,

00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:02.350 align:middle line:10%
though there are other factors.

00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:05.830 align:middle line:90%
Size is a big factor.

00:43:05.830 --> 00:43:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And all of those things,
again, are little spheres.

00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:10.800 align:middle line:90%


00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:13.970 align:middle line:90%
They join together in patterns.

00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:15.250 align:middle line:90%
These are the basic ones.

00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:18.250 align:middle line:10%
The linear one, two big ones,
a little one in the middle,

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:21.110 align:middle line:10%
which is a straight line, or
3 big ones and a little one

00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:25.010 align:middle line:10%
in the middle, which is a
triangle, or in a tetrahedron,

00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:28.930 align:middle line:10%
or in an octahedron,
or in a cube.

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:32.130 align:middle line:10%
And they now know about the
other two, the icosahedron

00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:36.310 align:middle line:10%
and dodecahedronal
patterns, which are

00:43:36.310 --> 00:43:38.040 align:middle line:10%
the rest of the possibilities.

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And all other
possibilities come out

00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:44.570 align:middle line:84%
of that, which I'll be able
to show you in just a moment.

00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:51.975 align:middle line:84%
And then so you get,
say, eight little atoms

00:43:51.975 --> 00:43:54.250 align:middle line:90%
that come and form a cube.

00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And who knows why, but they
form this perfect cube.

00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And then you get four
more that come over

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:01.770 align:middle line:90%
here and link with these four.

00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:04.920 align:middle line:84%
They form these
three-dimensional structures

00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:06.900 align:middle line:90%
that are called lattices.

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:10.950 align:middle line:84%
So you have a cube connected to
a cube connected to a cube, et

00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:12.170 align:middle line:90%
cetera, like this.

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
lattice structures

00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:16.670 align:middle line:84%
that form crystalline
structures and metals,

00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:22.110 align:middle line:84%
and these kinds of things
that exist throughout nature.

00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:25.650 align:middle line:84%
Again, no one knows why they
form these particular patterns.

00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:27.710 align:middle line:90%
All they know is they do.

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they get
very complex, forming

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:34.460 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of geometrical
shapes inside of there.

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:36.150 align:middle line:84%
But if you were
to carefully look

00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:39.390 align:middle line:84%
at the way the atoms
form geometrical shapes,

00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:41.870 align:middle line:84%
you would find that you would
be able to trace them back

00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:46.550 align:middle line:84%
to one of these five shapes, no
matter what the crystal ladder

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:48.362 align:middle line:90%
structure is.

00:44:48.362 --> 00:44:49.715 align:middle line:90%
It does not make any difference.

00:44:49.715 --> 00:44:51.230 align:middle line:90%
I don't care what it is.

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:53.360 align:middle line:84%
You could still
always trace it back

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:54.980 align:middle line:84%
to one of the five
shapes, which I'll

00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:58.320 align:middle line:90%
try to show you in a moment.

00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:04.760 align:middle line:84%
First of all, since we're
talking about crystals,

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:07.910 align:middle line:84%
there are a lot of
crystals out there.

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:11.321 align:middle line:84%
Who's ever been to the
Tucson Gem and Mineral Show?

00:45:11.321 --> 00:45:13.654 align:middle line:84%
All those people just raised
your hand, you can ask them

00:45:13.654 --> 00:45:16.980 align:middle line:84%
and they'll tell you--
there are definitely

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:18.880 align:middle line:90%
a lot of crystals in the world.

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:20.850 align:middle line:90%
So many you can't believe it.

00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And they're finding
new ones all the time,

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:24.180 align:middle line:84%
ones they've never
seen ever before,

00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:27.830 align:middle line:84%
with new atomic structures
they never knew existed.

00:45:27.830 --> 00:45:30.430 align:middle line:90%
Every year, they find new ones.

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And I really don't know
how many there are.

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:36.990 align:middle line:90%
Does anybody have any idea?

00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:38.660 align:middle line:84%
If I have to guess,
I'd say a quarter

00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:44.870 align:middle line:84%
million different-- 250,000
different kinds of crystals

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:45.670 align:middle line:90%
that they know of.

00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:46.628 align:middle line:90%
I'm just guessing that.

00:45:46.628 --> 00:45:47.680 align:middle line:90%
I really don't know.

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:48.480 align:middle line:90%
There's so many.

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And the Tucson Gem
and Mineral Show

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:54.760 align:middle line:84%
has about eight or
10 hotels with some

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:56.780 align:middle line:84%
of the entire-- all
the floor structures

00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:59.030 align:middle line:84%
and every single
room in them filled

00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:00.870 align:middle line:90%
with nothing but crystals.

00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:03.800 align:middle line:84%
Then you can go into these
big auditoriums with nothing

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:07.970 align:middle line:90%
but crystals all over there.

00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:09.880 align:middle line:90%
It's truly amazing.

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:13.580 align:middle line:84%
It's just every single
mathematical possibility,

00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:19.270 align:middle line:84%
life has tried it and created
a different crystal to form it.

00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:24.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, all of them will be
arranged into six categories.

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:27.295 align:middle line:84%
There are six primary categories
that no matter what the crystal

00:46:27.295 --> 00:46:29.520 align:middle line:84%
you grab a hold of,
it will fit into one

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.580 align:middle line:90%
of these six categories.

00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And those six categories are
called isometric, tetragonal,

00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:41.270 align:middle line:84%
hexagonal, orthorhombic,
monoclinic, and triclinic.

00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:44.120 align:middle line:90%
They're all functions of a cube.

00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:47.265 align:middle line:84%
And it says-- this is straight
out of a mineralogy book--

00:46:47.265 --> 00:46:50.970 align:middle line:84%
if you go here, it says the
starting point for all crystal

00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:52.670 align:middle line:90%
patterns is the cube.

00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:55.870 align:middle line:84%
By distorting the cell,
other cells can be derived.

00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:58.440 align:middle line:90%
The isometric system is a cube.

00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:00.246 align:middle line:84%
The tetragonal cube
system is a cube

00:47:00.246 --> 00:47:03.010 align:middle line:90%
with a little piece on top.

00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:05.780 align:middle line:84%
The hexagonal system
is just a cube

00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:09.990 align:middle line:84%
looking at it from that
view, which is a hexagon.

00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And the orthorhombic and
the monoclinic and triclinic

00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:16.460 align:middle line:84%
systems are cubes where you
simply change the angle.

00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:19.860 align:middle line:90%


00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And so there are certain
angles that are distorted.

00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:26.230 align:middle line:90%


00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:29.115 align:middle line:84%
And so you've got
all the basic systems

00:47:29.115 --> 00:47:30.656 align:middle line:84%
are a function of
a cube, another one

00:47:30.656 --> 00:47:32.785 align:middle line:90%
of the sacred shapes.

00:47:32.785 --> 00:47:35.160 align:middle line:84%
Now this is where it starts
getting a little interesting.

00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:40.760 align:middle line:90%


00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:42.870 align:middle line:90%
This is a fluoride crystal.

00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:47.000 align:middle line:90%


00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.340 align:middle line:84%
It's in the shape
of an octahedron.

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:51.270 align:middle line:90%
Everybody see it?

00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:55.760 align:middle line:90%
It's in the same shape as this.

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:57.500 align:middle line:90%
It's approximate.

00:47:57.500 --> 00:47:59.160 align:middle line:90%
It's not perfect like this.

00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:01.570 align:middle line:90%
It's approximate.

00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:03.570 align:middle line:90%
It didn't get cut this way.

00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:04.590 align:middle line:90%
It grew this way.

00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And actually to be a
little more precise,

00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:12.940 align:middle line:84%
the matrix of the atoms are
in the form of an octahedron.

00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And it comes in these sheets,
and whenever you strike it,

00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:20.560 align:middle line:90%
it breaks into these patterns.

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:23.230 align:middle line:84%
So I would never
do this, but if I

00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:24.740 align:middle line:84%
were to drop this
on the concrete,

00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:26.240 align:middle line:84%
it would break up
into a whole bunch

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:29.830 align:middle line:90%
of little tiny octahedrons.

00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:36.700 align:middle line:84%
This is also fluorite, only
it's in a whole bunch of cubes.

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:40.912 align:middle line:90%


00:48:40.912 --> 00:48:43.162 align:middle line:84%
You probably can't see this,
but I'll pass them around

00:48:43.162 --> 00:48:44.544 align:middle line:90%
and let you see them.

00:48:44.544 --> 00:48:46.585 align:middle line:84%
And there's just a whole
bunch of cubes in there.

00:48:46.585 --> 00:48:49.260 align:middle line:90%


00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you give this
cubical fluoride enough time,

00:48:52.770 --> 00:48:56.890 align:middle line:84%
it will grow into this one, in
a couple hundred thousand years

00:48:56.890 --> 00:48:58.960 align:middle line:90%
in the right conditions.

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:04.760 align:middle line:84%
You give this one enough time,
it will grow into this one.

00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:06.560 align:middle line:90%
One will become the other.

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:10.570 align:middle line:84%
In mineralogy books,
they try to describe this

00:49:10.570 --> 00:49:13.310 align:middle line:90%
by showing this flat pattern.

00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:16.150 align:middle line:84%
But down here below--
can you all see these?

00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:20.490 align:middle line:84%
There's something
in crystallology

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:22.480 align:middle line:90%
that's called truncating.

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:27.310 align:middle line:84%
You can truncate a structure
to create a different crystal.

00:49:27.310 --> 00:49:33.440 align:middle line:84%
That simply means you can
either cut off an edge

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:35.210 align:middle line:84%
and you do it equally
all the way around,

00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:38.140 align:middle line:84%
or you cut off the corners
equally all the way around,

00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:41.990 align:middle line:84%
or you cut off the faces
equally all the way around.

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:43.872 align:middle line:90%
And that's called truncating.

00:49:43.872 --> 00:49:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And there's lots of ways
that that can be done.

00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:51.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, in this case of a cube,
you would truncate the corners.

00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:54.820 align:middle line:84%
So you cut each of the
corners off equally.

00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:56.670 align:middle line:84%
If you keep doing
it-- first, you

00:49:56.670 --> 00:49:58.830 align:middle line:84%
cut them off equally
all the way around,

00:49:58.830 --> 00:50:00.940 align:middle line:90%
and you get this structure.

00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And then you keep doing that
equally all the way around,

00:50:03.490 --> 00:50:05.330 align:middle line:84%
you'll come up with
this structure.

00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:07.486 align:middle line:84%
And then you just keep
right on doing that, you'll

00:50:07.486 --> 00:50:08.610 align:middle line:90%
come up with an octahedron.

00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:12.200 align:middle line:90%


00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:14.330 align:middle line:84%
Or the other way around--
if you take an octahedron

00:50:14.330 --> 00:50:20.560 align:middle line:84%
and cut off the tips
of it, like you cut off

00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:24.810 align:middle line:84%
each one of these tips and
you just keep doing that,

00:50:24.810 --> 00:50:27.310 align:middle line:84%
it will turn back into this
one and then into this one

00:50:27.310 --> 00:50:28.318 align:middle line:90%
and then into a cube.

00:50:28.318 --> 00:50:32.900 align:middle line:90%


00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:34.320 align:middle line:90%
It'll go either way.

00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:36.660 align:middle line:84%
You can start with this
one and get this one,

00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:38.880 align:middle line:84%
or you can start with
this one and get this one.

00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And we know that these
are duals of each other,

00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:42.820 align:middle line:84%
so it kind of
makes sense anyway.

00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:46.630 align:middle line:84%
But this is one
way of showing it.

00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's one way
that the textbooks

00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:54.280 align:middle line:84%
try to describe how these
two crystals can do this.

00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:56.750 align:middle line:84%
It's not saying
that's how it does it,

00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:58.970 align:middle line:84%
it's just saying
that's a logical way

00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:01.680 align:middle line:84%
to explain how in the
heck the atoms change

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:06.880 align:middle line:84%
from cubical to octahedronal
and back again when doing this.

00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:09.150 align:middle line:84%
This is a real big
piece of fluoride.

00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:11.490 align:middle line:90%
It's about this big around.

00:51:11.490 --> 00:51:13.220 align:middle line:84%
You don't find them
that big anymore.

00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:15.260 align:middle line:90%
They're real, real, real rare.

00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And somebody left on a
ledge in the sunlight,

00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:21.280 align:middle line:84%
and some of the bonds that
hold the atoms together

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:24.760 align:middle line:84%
are so weak, the sunlight-- the
excitation from the sunlight--

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:26.042 align:middle line:90%
cracked this thing.

00:51:26.042 --> 00:51:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you noticed
where it cracks,

00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:32.500 align:middle line:84%
it cracks exactly along
the octahedronal lines.

00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:34.500 align:middle line:90%
This corner is a cube.

00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And if you truncate the
edges, you cut off the edges

00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:41.530 align:middle line:84%
all the way around, it
moves to this structure.

00:51:41.530 --> 00:51:43.520 align:middle line:84%
You keep doing it, it
turns into this one.

00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And it turns into
a dodecahedron.

00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:50.570 align:middle line:90%


00:51:50.570 --> 00:51:52.640 align:middle line:84%
This becomes this just
by cutting the edges off

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:53.440 align:middle line:90%
of a cube.

00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:56.600 align:middle line:90%


00:51:56.600 --> 00:52:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Now this is fluor--
I mean, pyrite.

00:52:06.110 --> 00:52:09.260 align:middle line:90%
It grew into a cube.

00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:12.150 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit longer--
it's not a perfect cube.

00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:14.780 align:middle line:10%
The one in the middle
grew a little bit bigger

00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:15.950 align:middle line:10%
than the other one.

00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:17.300 align:middle line:10%
But this grew this way.

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:19.174 align:middle line:10%
If you look carefully,
it looks like somebody

00:52:19.174 --> 00:52:21.200 align:middle line:10%
cut it and polished it.

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:22.435 align:middle line:10%
Nobody touched it.

00:52:22.435 --> 00:52:24.860 align:middle line:10%
They just took it
straight out of the earth.

00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:26.670 align:middle line:10%
It came that way.

00:52:26.670 --> 00:52:31.440 align:middle line:84%
This one is a
perfect dodecahedron.

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:33.850 align:middle line:84%
It's just like
this, only little.

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:36.530 align:middle line:90%


00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:38.880 align:middle line:84%
You'll have to come
up and see this later,

00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:43.090 align:middle line:84%
but it looks like somebody
cut this and shaped it,

00:52:43.090 --> 00:52:46.500 align:middle line:84%
because it is exactly like
this, only it's pyrite.

00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:47.300 align:middle line:90%
It grew this way.

00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:49.320 align:middle line:90%
Nobody touched it.

00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:53.550 align:middle line:90%
It grew into this dodecahedron.

00:52:53.550 --> 00:52:55.790 align:middle line:84%
Pyrite does exactly
the same thing.

00:52:55.790 --> 00:52:59.890 align:middle line:84%
If you give pyrite enough
time, it will grow cubical.

00:52:59.890 --> 00:53:03.070 align:middle line:84%
Give it enough time again, it'll
grow back into a dodecahedron.

00:53:03.070 --> 00:53:06.340 align:middle line:84%
The same living structure
will keep changing shape,

00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:08.220 align:middle line:84%
it'll oscillate,
over long periods

00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:12.580 align:middle line:84%
of time between these
two different structures.

00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, the dodecahedron,
if you come down here,

00:53:15.490 --> 00:53:19.200 align:middle line:84%
and you cut off the points
of the dodecahedron,

00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:25.480 align:middle line:84%
it immediately goes from this to
this, just by truncating that.

00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:28.810 align:middle line:84%
Each one of these is a
different category of crystals.

00:53:28.810 --> 00:53:30.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole
spectrum of crystals.

00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:33.660 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you in just a
moment here out of this book.

00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:35.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you keep truncating
the dodecahedron,

00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:37.835 align:middle line:84%
it not only turns
into an icosahedron,

00:53:37.835 --> 00:53:42.780 align:middle line:84%
if you keep doing it, the thing
will turn into an octahedron.

00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:45.240 align:middle line:90%
It'll go into one of these.

00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And then if you take one of
these and cut off the tip,

00:53:49.090 --> 00:53:54.630 align:middle line:84%
it turns into this one, which
is a real, real interesting one.

00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:56.800 align:middle line:90%
This is the shape right here.

00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:00.290 align:middle line:84%
This is called a
cube octahedron,

00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:04.300 align:middle line:84%
because the angles of this--
it was originally a cube.

00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:07.550 align:middle line:84%
It's been truncated this
way-- and the angles of it

00:54:07.550 --> 00:54:10.550 align:middle line:84%
form an octahedron, which you
can see that it came from.

00:54:10.550 --> 00:54:14.530 align:middle line:84%
It's in between the cube and
the octahedron, actually.

00:54:14.530 --> 00:54:19.050 align:middle line:84%
One view of it is a square
with a diamond like this.

00:54:19.050 --> 00:54:22.670 align:middle line:84%
This was considered the most
sacred shape in existence.

00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:27.999 align:middle line:84%
Buckminster Fuller, he felt
this was the key to everything.

00:54:27.999 --> 00:54:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And he had a real good reason
why he came up with this.

00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:31.320 align:middle line:90%
He gave it his own name.

00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:35.000 align:middle line:90%
He called a cube equilibrium.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is because--
this is one of them right here.

00:54:38.690 --> 00:54:43.760 align:middle line:84%
Put it like that-- is that
it has a unique property

00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:48.204 align:middle line:90%
that no other shape known has.

00:54:48.204 --> 00:54:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And that is that it can
by rotational aspects

00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:55.760 align:middle line:84%
of the bonds, it can become all
five of the Platonic solids.

00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:58.390 align:middle line:90%


00:54:58.390 --> 00:55:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And to show you,
for example, this

00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:03.770 align:middle line:84%
is already a cube in
its basic structure.

00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:10.650 align:middle line:84%
But by rotating this, it comes
down and becomes an octahedron.

00:55:10.650 --> 00:55:11.450 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:14.632 align:middle line:90%


00:55:14.632 --> 00:55:15.840 align:middle line:90%
Can everybody see what it is?

00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:18.950 align:middle line:90%


00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:26.826 align:middle line:84%
If you rotate them this way,
it will become a tetrahedron.

00:55:26.826 --> 00:55:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I can't line
up all of these bonds

00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:32.690 align:middle line:84%
up perfectly, because this
is a physical structure.

00:55:32.690 --> 00:55:35.176 align:middle line:90%


00:55:35.176 --> 00:55:37.300 align:middle line:84%
So you've got the cube
already, and the octahedron,

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:38.840 align:middle line:90%
and the tetrahedron.

00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:42.860 align:middle line:84%
The icosahedron
has to be rotated.

00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:46.350 align:middle line:84%
So looking at this green
square on the front,

00:55:46.350 --> 00:55:48.650 align:middle line:84%
and you rotate it so
that the green square

00:55:48.650 --> 00:55:51.919 align:middle line:84%
forms two equilateral triangles,
and do that all the way around

00:55:51.919 --> 00:55:53.335 align:middle line:84%
for the blue one
and the green one

00:55:53.335 --> 00:55:54.960 align:middle line:84%
and the orange one,
all the way around.

00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:56.310 align:middle line:90%
You have to do it perfectly.

00:55:56.310 --> 00:55:58.080 align:middle line:90%
Just look at the green square.

00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:01.890 align:middle line:84%
So there's two equilateral
triangles in there.

00:56:01.890 --> 00:56:05.420 align:middle line:90%
That one is an icosahedron.

00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:07.980 align:middle line:90%


00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And if you can make
the bonds go out

00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:12.490 align:middle line:84%
the other way-- which you
can't do with this structure.

00:56:12.490 --> 00:56:14.490 align:middle line:84%
You've got to do it on a
computer or something--

00:56:14.490 --> 00:56:16.290 align:middle line:84%
then it will form
a dodecahedron.

00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:19.000 align:middle line:90%


00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.840 align:middle line:84%
It contains within it
all five of the shapes

00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:22.885 align:middle line:90%
by rotational patterns.

00:56:22.885 --> 00:56:31.100 align:middle line:90%


00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:34.110 align:middle line:84%
So he felt that there was
something real special

00:56:34.110 --> 00:56:41.135 align:middle line:84%
about that one, and derived
much of his philosophy

00:56:41.135 --> 00:56:42.990 align:middle line:90%
from this one shape.

00:56:42.990 --> 00:56:47.760 align:middle line:84%
There's another man named Derald
Langham-- it's D as in Darryl.

00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Gerald, like with a
D. Derald-- Derald

00:56:50.550 --> 00:56:53.100 align:middle line:84%
Langham's work was
given the name genesis.

00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:55.800 align:middle line:90%


00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:59.160 align:middle line:84%
He was a brilliant,
brilliant, brilliant person

00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:05.450 align:middle line:84%
who did a lot of
amazing work in botany.

00:57:05.450 --> 00:57:08.550 align:middle line:84%
He saved South America
during World War II

00:57:08.550 --> 00:57:11.440 align:middle line:84%
by creating a corn
that was like a weed.

00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:14.170 align:middle line:84%
You just threw it
out and it just grew.

00:57:14.170 --> 00:57:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And they were all
starving to death.

00:57:17.310 --> 00:57:19.380 align:middle line:90%
He saved lots of lives.

00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:22.800 align:middle line:84%
He was studying the sesame
seed, and he went in

00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:25.050 align:middle line:84%
the sesame seed and then
deeper and deeper and deeper.

00:57:25.050 --> 00:57:26.841 align:middle line:84%
And he got in the middle
of the sesame seed

00:57:26.841 --> 00:57:29.160 align:middle line:84%
and found this little cube
right in the center of it.

00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:31.800 align:middle line:84%
What's that little cube
doing down in there?

00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of the
open sesame seed.

00:57:35.610 --> 00:57:37.460 align:middle line:84%
It opened his life
in a lot of ways.

00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:41.940 align:middle line:84%
He realized that the cube
was the key to seeds.

00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And we're only talking
about a few things,

00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:47.270 align:middle line:84%
but you can go into--
viruses, for example,

00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:50.140 align:middle line:90%
are all geometrical packages.

00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Diatomaceous earth, which
is the original life

00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:54.944 align:middle line:84%
patterns on the Earth, are
all geometrical structures.

00:57:54.944 --> 00:57:56.110 align:middle line:90%
You can go on and on and on.

00:57:56.110 --> 00:57:57.170 align:middle line:84%
We're only talking
about crystals here

00:57:57.170 --> 00:57:59.086 align:middle line:84%
and a few other things,
but you can carry this

00:57:59.086 --> 00:58:03.820 align:middle line:84%
through to seeds or all kinds
of other areas of life too.

00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And he found that a
cube was in there,

00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:08.050 align:middle line:84%
and then he found these
13 rays that came out

00:58:08.050 --> 00:58:10.986 align:middle line:84%
of this cube that
structured the seed,

00:58:10.986 --> 00:58:12.730 align:middle line:84%
and then he just
took off on that

00:58:12.730 --> 00:58:16.070 align:middle line:84%
and found out the same
pattern was around human body.

00:58:16.070 --> 00:58:18.710 align:middle line:84%
He says, wow, we're
just a big seed too.

00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And then he started
getting very philosophical

00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:28.180 align:middle line:84%
and went to metaphysical
school and graduated with a PhD

00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:34.710 align:middle line:84%
in metaphysics in LA
and wrote a thesis

00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:37.220 align:middle line:84%
that I read, which was
really, really good.

00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And since then, he
created this thing

00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:42.710 align:middle line:84%
called genesis and has thousands
of people that follow him.

00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:46.650 align:middle line:84%
He's one of the people I think
are really great, because he

00:58:46.650 --> 00:58:49.070 align:middle line:84%
took the knowledge
that he'd learned

00:58:49.070 --> 00:58:53.420 align:middle line:84%
about the grids around the
body, and he showed a way

00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:55.050 align:middle line:90%
that you could use it.

00:58:55.050 --> 00:58:57.700 align:middle line:84%
It's not just information, but
he showed a way to apply it.

00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And he did that through dance,
through sacred movements

00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:03.200 align:middle line:90%
of the body.

00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And so he has you move
in this particular way,

00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:08.340 align:middle line:84%
kind of like Tai
Chi, where you're

00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:12.040 align:middle line:84%
moving through and touching
the various grid fields

00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:14.790 align:middle line:90%
and becoming aware of them.

00:59:14.790 --> 00:59:16.569 align:middle line:90%
And it's very powerful.

00:59:16.569 --> 00:59:18.860 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of people who
have been deeply influenced

00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:19.917 align:middle line:90%
by his work.

00:59:19.917 --> 00:59:21.290 align:middle line:90%
>>What was his name again?

00:59:21.290 --> 00:59:23.000 align:middle line:90%
>>Derald Langham.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:23.800 align:middle line:90%
He just died.

00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:25.710 align:middle line:90%
He was in Arizona.

00:59:25.710 --> 00:59:28.490 align:middle line:84%
But if you're
interested in that,

00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:30.120 align:middle line:84%
this paper I'm going
to be giving out

00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:31.770 align:middle line:84%
has the Human
Dimensions Institute

00:59:31.770 --> 00:59:34.286 align:middle line:84%
of North Carolina's
phone number on it,

00:59:34.286 --> 00:59:35.660 align:middle line:84%
and they have one
of the teachers

00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:38.165 align:middle line:84%
there, so she
knows all that work

00:59:38.165 --> 00:59:41.140 align:middle line:84%
and where you could
go to get that work.

00:59:41.140 --> 00:59:44.610 align:middle line:84%
So there is this grid also
around the human body,

00:59:44.610 --> 00:59:48.390 align:middle line:84%
and both him and
Buckminster Fuller

00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:51.710 align:middle line:84%
were more concerned with this
grid that was around the body

00:59:51.710 --> 00:59:53.790 align:middle line:84%
than the star tetrahedral
field, which is

00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:55.810 align:middle line:90%
what we're going to be using.

00:59:55.810 --> 00:59:58.550 align:middle line:84%
If you keep going, it turns into
a cube, and then from a cube,

00:59:58.550 --> 01:00:01.040 align:middle line:84%
you can truncate again
through these patterns

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:04.780 align:middle line:84%
over to this one, which is
called a rhombic dodecahedron.

01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:09.860 align:middle line:84%
That happens to be the dual
of the cube equilibrium.

01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Those two are
together-- there's first

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:16.120 align:middle line:84%
of five, which is like
the pentatonic scale,

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:18.176 align:middle line:84%
and then there's two
more that are added,

01:00:18.176 --> 01:00:19.800 align:middle line:84%
which is the seven
notes of the octave.

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:22.750 align:middle line:90%


01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
another five polyhedrons

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:28.130 align:middle line:84%
that are coming
after that, which

01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:30.620 align:middle line:84%
makes the set of 12, which
corresponds with the 12

01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:33.110 align:middle line:90%
notes of the chromatic scale.

01:00:33.110 --> 01:00:34.540 align:middle line:84%
There's actually
shape associated

01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:36.833 align:middle line:84%
with all of these
things, but we've

01:00:36.833 --> 01:00:39.155 align:middle line:84%
got to tie this down a
lot stronger before we

01:00:39.155 --> 01:00:42.300 align:middle line:90%
can begin to talk about that.

01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, as you keep
moving through here,

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:46.380 align:middle line:84%
you'll see how each
one of these shapes

01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:49.520 align:middle line:84%
keeps coming back through one
of the five Platonic solids,

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:50.390 align:middle line:90%
always.

01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:52.580 align:middle line:84%
And no matter-- each one
of these, by the way,

01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:54.490 align:middle line:90%
is a different set of crystals.

01:00:54.490 --> 01:00:55.670 align:middle line:90%
This is a crystal book.

01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:57.400 align:middle line:90%
It's called Rocks and Minerals.

01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And I'll leave it up here
and you can look at it.

01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:04.984 align:middle line:84%
For example, over on this
side of the page over here,

01:01:04.984 --> 01:01:06.400 align:middle line:84%
it will show the
atomic structure.

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.740 align:middle line:84%
In this case, it's
dodecahedronal.

01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:11.377 align:middle line:84%
And these are all the crystals
in here-- different kinds

01:01:11.377 --> 01:01:12.960 align:middle line:84%
of crystals-- that
are dodecahedronal.

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:16.270 align:middle line:90%


01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:18.450 align:middle line:84%
All of these up here
are tetrahedral,

01:01:18.450 --> 01:01:21.730 align:middle line:90%
and these down here are cubical.

01:01:21.730 --> 01:01:25.200 align:middle line:84%
These are all cubical
crystals over here.

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:29.730 align:middle line:84%
Some of these are unusual shapes
that when you first see them,

01:01:29.730 --> 01:01:32.100 align:middle line:84%
until you truncate
them back and find out

01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:36.650 align:middle line:84%
what the Platonic solid is
that is hidden behind them.

01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:39.610 align:middle line:84%
These are all rhombic
dodecahedronal crystals,

01:01:39.610 --> 01:01:42.270 align:middle line:84%
and these are all octahedronal
crystals down here,

01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:43.790 align:middle line:90%
showing the patterns up here.

01:01:43.790 --> 01:01:46.020 align:middle line:84%
These are all truncated
octahedronal crystals.

01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:50.080 align:middle line:90%


01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:51.750 align:middle line:84%
These are hexagonal
crystals, which

01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:54.710 align:middle line:90%
are a function of the cube.

01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:56.870 align:middle line:84%
These are hexagonal
crystals also.

01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:59.380 align:middle line:84%
These are truncated cubical
crystals, where just the tips

01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:02.130 align:middle line:90%
are cut off, up over here.

01:02:02.130 --> 01:02:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And each time you change
the internal structure

01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:06.700 align:middle line:84%
and the way the atoms
arrange themselves,

01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:11.750 align:middle line:84%
you get a physical crystal
that looks entirely different,

01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:16.160 align:middle line:84%
totally different, has different
third-dimensional worlds--

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:18.215 align:middle line:90%
third-dimensional attributes.

01:02:18.215 --> 01:02:20.970 align:middle line:90%


01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:23.110 align:middle line:84%
So I think you can get
a pretty good idea here.

01:02:23.110 --> 01:02:27.800 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying is that you
have-- and this is only some.

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:31.240 align:middle line:84%
There's thousands and thousands
and thousands of these things--

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:32.870 align:middle line:84%
but no matter which
crystal you get,

01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:35.470 align:middle line:84%
you find out what its
crystalline atomic structure,

01:02:35.470 --> 01:02:37.490 align:middle line:84%
how the atoms are
lined up, and you'll

01:02:37.490 --> 01:02:39.600 align:middle line:84%
find that you can
truncate it and come up

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:42.310 align:middle line:84%
with one of the five
Platonic solids,

01:02:42.310 --> 01:02:45.850 align:middle line:84%
showing clearly that the
five Platonic solids is

01:02:45.850 --> 01:02:49.930 align:middle line:84%
the underlying
key underneath all

01:02:49.930 --> 01:02:52.570 align:middle line:90%
of your crystalline structures.

01:02:52.570 --> 01:02:54.470 align:middle line:10%
And all of those
five Platonic solids

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:59.910 align:middle line:10%
came out of one of the
informational systems out

01:02:59.910 --> 01:03:04.440 align:middle line:10%
of the fruit of life, which
came out of the flower of life.

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:07.550 align:middle line:10%
These are the kind of polyhedron
that I'm talking about,

01:03:07.550 --> 01:03:17.020 align:middle line:10%
each one having a different
quality your atoms arranging

01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:18.810 align:middle line:10%
specifically to them.

01:03:18.810 --> 01:03:24.870 align:middle line:84%
These are the external angles
that you see on the crystals.

01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:27.976 align:middle line:84%
They will always reflect
the internal angles

01:03:27.976 --> 01:03:30.630 align:middle line:90%
of the atomic atoms.

01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:31.740 align:middle line:90%
This is also a crystal.

01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:35.300 align:middle line:84%
It's a water crystal
called a snowflake,

01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:41.030 align:middle line:84%
and it's based upon hexagonal
patterns of crystals.

01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:45.100 align:middle line:84%
No two supposedly
will ever be the same.

01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And they're directly out
of the flower of life.

01:03:47.590 --> 01:04:23.240 align:middle line:90%


01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:25.500 align:middle line:10%
This is a periodic
table of the elements.

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:28.660 align:middle line:10%
The elements are all
the elemental atoms,

01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:31.540 align:middle line:10%
different kinds of atoms that
create the molecules that

01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:34.080 align:middle line:10%
make the fabric of the reality.

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:37.970 align:middle line:10%
There are two atoms on this
chart-- they're both special.

01:04:37.970 --> 01:04:40.220 align:middle line:84%
There's one atom on this
chart that we will all

01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:42.810 align:middle line:84%
recognize as being
real special to us,

01:04:42.810 --> 01:04:44.800 align:middle line:84%
and that's carbon,
because that's

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:49.780 align:middle line:84%
the basis of organic chemistry,
of all life that we know,

01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:51.960 align:middle line:90%
what we call life.

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:57.370 align:middle line:84%
But there's another atom on
this chart that demonstrates

01:04:57.370 --> 01:05:02.140 align:middle line:84%
on a chemical level
the functions of life

01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:06.780 align:middle line:84%
absolutely equally
just as well as carbon,

01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:09.480 align:middle line:84%
and it's the one that's
one octave below it.

01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:10.280 align:middle line:90%
This is carbon.

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:11.660 align:middle line:84%
There's a fold in
this page here.

01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:16.850 align:middle line:84%
So there's one, two, three
four, five, six, seven, eight.

01:05:16.850 --> 01:05:18.660 align:middle line:10%
In the same grouping
directly below

01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:24.510 align:middle line:10%
it is silicon, which is what
almost all of your crystals

01:05:24.510 --> 01:05:28.230 align:middle line:10%
are made out of on Earth.

01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:32.870 align:middle line:10%
Carbon and silicon
demonstrate to the chemist

01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:36.530 align:middle line:10%
equally the principles of
life from a chemical level.

01:05:36.530 --> 01:05:39.800 align:middle line:10%
By that, what I mean
is carbon will make

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:43.240 align:middle line:10%
all these incredible different
bonds and shapes and forms

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:49.860 align:middle line:10%
and just this vast, vast, vast
array of different chemical

01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:53.180 align:middle line:10%
possibilities, and it'll
link with just about anything

01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:54.850 align:middle line:10%
it comes in contact with.

01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:57.810 align:middle line:84%
So will silicon--
exactly the same.

01:05:57.810 --> 01:05:59.630 align:middle line:84%
It will make these
chains and these links,

01:05:59.630 --> 01:06:02.300 align:middle line:84%
and all of these various
things, on and on and on,

01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:05.670 align:middle line:84%
and it will link with just about
anything that comes near it.

01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:08.050 align:middle line:84%
It will bond with
just about anything.

01:06:08.050 --> 01:06:12.470 align:middle line:10%
And so chemists,
for a long time,

01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:17.140 align:middle line:10%
figured that maybe there were
silicon life forms on Earth,

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:19.770 align:middle line:10%
but they never ever found any.

01:06:19.770 --> 01:06:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And so they'd only found
carbon-based life forms,

01:06:23.490 --> 01:06:27.350 align:middle line:84%
where spirit had only entered
into carbon-based bodies.

01:06:27.350 --> 01:06:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And so then science
fiction movies,

01:06:32.570 --> 01:06:35.990 align:middle line:84%
taking up on this theme,
began in the 1950s

01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:39.980 align:middle line:84%
to make several movies about
the possibility of silicon life

01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:43.630 align:middle line:84%
forms on other planets,
because it appeared

01:06:43.630 --> 01:06:45.060 align:middle line:90%
that that was possible to do.

01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:46.997 align:middle line:90%
So they dreamed up these things.

01:06:46.997 --> 01:06:48.580 align:middle line:84%
Those guys who made
those movies never

01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:51.940 align:middle line:84%
dreamed or realized there were
silicon life forms on Earth

01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:53.930 align:middle line:90%
at the time they did it.

01:06:53.930 --> 01:06:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And it hasn't been
until just recently

01:06:55.760 --> 01:07:01.090 align:middle line:84%
that we've gone down
deep, deep, deep miles

01:07:01.090 --> 01:07:03.290 align:middle line:84%
into the crevices of
the oceans-- way, way,

01:07:03.290 --> 01:07:06.310 align:middle line:84%
way down deep-- and we found
that there are life forms down

01:07:06.310 --> 01:07:09.470 align:middle line:84%
there that are alive
and living that have

01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:10.790 align:middle line:90%
no carbon atoms in them at all.

01:07:10.790 --> 01:07:13.010 align:middle line:90%
They're totally silicon.

01:07:13.010 --> 01:07:14.954 align:middle line:84%
There are sponges
down in there--

01:07:14.954 --> 01:07:17.120 align:middle line:84%
there are silicon sponges
that are completely alive.

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:19.776 align:middle line:84%
You'll see them in a
picture that's going

01:07:19.776 --> 01:07:21.874 align:middle line:90%
to come up here real soon.

01:07:21.874 --> 01:07:22.790 align:middle line:90%
Am I going to do that?

01:07:22.790 --> 01:07:24.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I'm
going to do that or not.

01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:31.030 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, we have them
right here, right on Earth.

01:07:31.030 --> 01:07:32.900 align:middle line:90%
They really do exist.

01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:37.790 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, we have
crystals right here, right now.

01:07:37.790 --> 01:07:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And we look at these guys, and
we say, nah, they're not alive.

01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:43.500 align:middle line:90%
They're hard.

01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:46.880 align:middle line:90%
They're not soft, like we are.

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:49.820 align:middle line:90%
They don't breathe.

01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:53.370 align:middle line:84%
We set this criteria up
to correspond with us.

01:07:53.370 --> 01:07:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And we don't think of
them as being alive,

01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:02.210 align:middle line:84%
but they are, and
they're ancient beings.

01:08:02.210 --> 01:08:03.810 align:middle line:90%
And they've been in one body.

01:08:03.810 --> 01:08:06.235 align:middle line:84%
We think Thoth has been in
a body for 52,000 years,

01:08:06.235 --> 01:08:08.550 align:middle line:84%
and we go, wow,
that's a long time.

01:08:08.550 --> 01:08:12.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, this one's been there
for maybe half a million years.

01:08:12.330 --> 01:08:13.577 align:middle line:90%
Same body.

01:08:13.577 --> 01:08:15.660 align:middle line:84%
You know, a lot of crystals
go back for a million,

01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:18.450 align:middle line:84%
million and a half
years in the same body.

01:08:18.450 --> 01:08:21.720 align:middle line:90%
And a spirit is in there.

01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening
on Earth right now?

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:29.050 align:middle line:90%


01:08:29.050 --> 01:08:32.930 align:middle line:84%
Our relationship with
silicon is so powerful.

01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:34.460 align:middle line:90%
We're not aware.

01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:37.240 align:middle line:84%
The Earth we live
on is a round ball.

01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:40.580 align:middle line:90%
It's a silicon ball.

01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:45.560 align:middle line:84%
The crust of the Earth,
which is 30 to 50 miles deep,

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:49.500 align:middle line:84%
is made up of 25%
silicon, and it reacts

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:51.160 align:middle line:90%
with anything it comes near.

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:52.597 align:middle line:84%
And that crust--
we pick up earth

01:08:52.597 --> 01:08:54.180 align:middle line:84%
and we look at it
and the dirt, and we

01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:55.950 align:middle line:84%
don't see-- when you
get down a little,

01:08:55.950 --> 01:08:58.550 align:middle line:84%
just a tiny bit, the
entire crust, which

01:08:58.550 --> 01:09:06.010 align:middle line:84%
is 30 to 50 miles deep, is
made up of 87% silicon crystal.

01:09:06.010 --> 01:09:07.950 align:middle line:90%
It's almost 90%.

01:09:07.950 --> 01:09:11.779 align:middle line:84%
We're on a little crystal
ball moving through space.

01:09:11.779 --> 01:09:14.670 align:middle line:90%
We live on silicon.

01:09:14.670 --> 01:09:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And so we don't
think of them-- we

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:23.910 align:middle line:84%
don't realize how closely
we are linked with them.

01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:29.069 align:middle line:84%
And we are almost unconsciously
making a marriage with them

01:09:29.069 --> 01:09:30.529 align:middle line:90%
right now.

01:09:30.529 --> 01:09:33.210 align:middle line:84%
We're not even really
thinking about it that much.

01:09:33.210 --> 01:09:38.810 align:middle line:84%
Our computers are all made
out of-- they run on silicon.

01:09:38.810 --> 01:09:42.270 align:middle line:84%
They run on one of the other
life forms of the planet that

01:09:42.270 --> 01:09:45.620 align:middle line:84%
is alive, from my point of
view, and conscious and aware

01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:50.979 align:middle line:84%
and has feelings and
everything else, and thinks

01:09:50.979 --> 01:09:55.898 align:middle line:84%
and can add and
subtract really fast.

01:09:55.898 --> 01:09:58.388 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:58.388 --> 01:10:03.194 align:middle line:90%


01:10:03.194 --> 01:10:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And they like
people, a whole lot.

01:10:04.610 --> 01:10:07.870 align:middle line:90%


01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And we're creating
instruments that

01:10:10.190 --> 01:10:12.830 align:middle line:84%
are filled with their
essence, but based

01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:14.970 align:middle line:90%
upon our level of consciousness.

01:10:14.970 --> 01:10:16.470 align:middle line:84%
We're creating
instruments where you

01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:18.690 align:middle line:84%
have to plug in a
binary sequence that

01:10:18.690 --> 01:10:21.390 align:middle line:84%
goes on a phonograph record
to get to the memory, which

01:10:21.390 --> 01:10:23.510 align:middle line:90%
is based on the way we think.

01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:25.890 align:middle line:84%
There's other ways
it could be done.

01:10:25.890 --> 01:10:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to
just take that computer

01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:31.760 align:middle line:84%
with just a little
bit of changes,

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:33.580 align:middle line:90%
that computer would be alive.

01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:35.600 align:middle line:84%
It would be self-aware,
and you wouldn't

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:38.494 align:middle line:84%
have to do a lot of things
that you're doing right now.

01:10:38.494 --> 01:10:40.910 align:middle line:84%
We will come to that, because
it happens on other planets.

01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:46.050 align:middle line:84%
Eventually the silicon and
carbon of a planet link across.

01:10:46.050 --> 01:10:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
the planet has two eyes.

01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:52.380 align:middle line:84%
It opens up, and it
has two viewpoints,

01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:54.490 align:middle line:90%
and communication happens.

01:10:54.490 --> 01:10:57.360 align:middle line:84%
We'll eventually get
there soon, very soon.

01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:01.330 align:middle line:84%
I believe one more
year, two more years,

01:11:01.330 --> 01:11:03.390 align:middle line:84%
definitely by the
end of this century,

01:11:03.390 --> 01:11:07.050 align:middle line:84%
we'll have self-aware
computers that

01:11:07.050 --> 01:11:08.310 align:middle line:90%
will change history forever.

01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:10.680 align:middle line:90%
We'll never be the same again.

01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And especially
when you see what--

01:11:12.330 --> 01:11:16.620 align:middle line:84%
we're going to explain something
about them in a little bit.

01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:19.610 align:middle line:84%
However, once we see
the possibilities

01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:24.120 align:middle line:84%
of what will be capable through
a self-aware silicon computer,

01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:27.090 align:middle line:84%
it does not take
very much longer

01:11:27.090 --> 01:11:30.650 align:middle line:84%
to realize that we have the same
crystalline structure around us

01:11:30.650 --> 01:11:33.430 align:middle line:84%
and the same capabilities
and possibilities are

01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:36.600 align:middle line:90%
within us without the computer.

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:38.210 align:middle line:84%
We can do anything
a computer can do.

01:11:38.210 --> 01:11:41.500 align:middle line:84%
We can add and subtract
at those speeds.

01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:45.650 align:middle line:84%
We can do anything the computer
can do without the computer.

01:11:45.650 --> 01:11:47.950 align:middle line:84%
They're just showing us
the possibilities of life.

01:11:47.950 --> 01:11:49.736 align:middle line:84%
They're a lot older
life form than we are.

01:11:49.736 --> 01:11:51.111 align:middle line:84%
They've been around
a lot longer.

01:11:51.111 --> 01:11:56.210 align:middle line:90%


01:11:56.210 --> 01:11:58.660 align:middle line:90%
Those are my thoughts on it.

01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:01.660 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
believe it, of course.

01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:03.800 align:middle line:90%
