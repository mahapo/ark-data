00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.100 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.150 align:middle line:84%
>>But this one I'm about to
talk about is more for important

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.590 align:middle line:90%
for this group.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.870 align:middle line:84%
The shape of the room, by
the way, the halls of records

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:28.748 align:middle line:90%
looks like this.

00:00:28.748 --> 00:00:31.880 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.110 align:middle line:84%
This would be the floor
pattern, and these raised areas

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.424 align:middle line:84%
and around there will be where
the objects will be found.

00:00:40.424 --> 00:00:45.000 align:middle line:90%


00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.100 align:middle line:84%
There are three
schools in Egypt.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.740 align:middle line:90%
One is the Left Eye of Horus.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.265 align:middle line:90%
One is the Right Eye of Horus.

00:00:51.265 --> 00:00:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And one is the
Middle Eye of Horus.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.340 align:middle line:84%
The left eye is
the feminine path.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.550 align:middle line:84%
The right eye is
the masculine path.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.890 align:middle line:84%
The middle eye is
the child path.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.747 align:middle line:84%
The left eye, which we're going
to talk about right now-- we've

00:01:05.747 --> 00:01:07.580 align:middle line:84%
been talking about the
right eye, basically,

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.450 align:middle line:84%
but we're now going to just
lightly discussed the left eye.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.540 align:middle line:84%
The middle eye, I can't
really talk about.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.480 align:middle line:90%
It's just life.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.280 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.080 align:middle line:90%
It's just life.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.108 align:middle line:84%
It's applying the left
and the right eye.

00:01:19.108 --> 00:01:21.980 align:middle line:90%


00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Here again, you'll
see these two eyes.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.172 align:middle line:90%
This is a better one here.

00:01:27.172 --> 00:01:31.570 align:middle line:90%


00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.866 align:middle line:90%
These are the three schools.

00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:35.240 align:middle line:84%
This, by the way,
for some of you

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.630 align:middle line:84%
who are familiar with
Zecharia Sitchin's work,

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.350 align:middle line:84%
this sphere with the
two snakes and the wings

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.840 align:middle line:84%
is a symbol for
the planet Marduk.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.420 align:middle line:90%


00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.230 align:middle line:10%
The 12th planet-- the planet
which the Nephilim and Annunaki

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.260 align:middle line:10%
come from.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And this is the symbol
for metamorphose.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:07.390 align:middle line:84%
This is the symbol
of the Ibis bird.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And the sphere, the oval, is a
symbol for Chiquetet, or Thoth,

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.690 align:middle line:84%
and it's also another
symbol for the right eye,

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.190 align:middle line:90%
the male training.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And this one over here of
the bee with the plant stalk,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.500 align:middle line:84%
if you can see that
there, is another symbol

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.840 align:middle line:84%
for the left eye of Horus,
or the feminine path.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.410 align:middle line:90%
These are names.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.892 align:middle line:84%
And this is the star
Sirius and eternal life

00:02:32.892 --> 00:02:33.850 align:middle line:90%
on either side of them.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Either path leads to eternal
life through the star Sirius.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.660 align:middle line:84%
You have to pass
through that star,

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.180 align:middle line:84%
from their particular way
of thinking of things.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.560 align:middle line:90%
>>Where was that found?

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.522 align:middle line:90%
>>This is the Cairo Museum.

00:02:50.522 --> 00:02:51.370 align:middle line:90%
>>Where was that--

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>>It's a capstone off
of one of the pyramids.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Not one of the great
pyramids-- just a pyramid.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.556 align:middle line:90%
I really don't know which one.

00:02:58.556 --> 00:03:00.227 align:middle line:90%


00:03:00.227 --> 00:03:01.060 align:middle line:90%
One of the pyramids.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.090 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
pyramids in there.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.100 align:middle line:84%
In the belief of the ankh--
you see the Ankh down here?

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.230 align:middle line:84%
The belief in the
ankh is that the ankh

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.490 align:middle line:90%
is the key to eternal life.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.100 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the primary major
pieces to the whole thing.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And according to Thoth,
the ankh can only

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.735 align:middle line:90%
be received from behind.

00:03:27.735 --> 00:03:29.720 align:middle line:84%
I'll explain what that
means a little bit,

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.710 align:middle line:84%
but you can see here where
the ankh is from behind.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.110 align:middle line:84%
He's also holding the three
tools of resurrection.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.920 align:middle line:84%
This is Osiris,
and this is Isis.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.540 align:middle line:84%
These are the actual tools,
and these are King Tut's tools.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.960 align:middle line:84%
These are the real ones,
with the frail and the hook.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:57.760 align:middle line:90%


00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the
rare, rare photographs

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:07.550 align:middle line:84%
of this holy family
actually using these tools.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.200 align:middle line:90%
It was a tantric practice.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.296 align:middle line:84%
Obviously there's sexual
energy involved here.

00:04:11.296 --> 00:04:15.090 align:middle line:90%


00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is Isis and
Horus and Osiris.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.730 align:middle line:84%
You see they're
holding the Ankh.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Horus is holding
the rod to the back

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.050 align:middle line:84%
of his father's head
to the chakra point

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.790 align:middle line:84%
back here, which has
a 45 degree on it.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.950 align:middle line:84%
They must have the tuning fork
pretty well already figured out

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.380 align:middle line:84%
for him, because they're not
using the frail to tune it

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.260 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And look what he's
doing with the hook.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.420 align:middle line:84%
Look what he's doing
with the frail.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.640 align:middle line:84%
He's holding the frail with
a single finger up like this,

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.910 align:middle line:84%
so that you can tune
the vibration precisely

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.252 align:middle line:90%
down the spine.

00:04:55.252 --> 00:04:59.510 align:middle line:84%
You can get down there, and
then as the sexual energy rises,

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.150 align:middle line:84%
it moves up around in
the form of an ankh

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.840 align:middle line:84%
in a certain way, which
leads to eternal life,

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.774 align:middle line:90%
from their point of view.

00:05:09.774 --> 00:05:14.750 align:middle line:84%
I'll talk about this
exactly a little bit more--

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.020 align:middle line:90%
what was really going on there.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.700 align:middle line:84%
Here you see Isis-- this
is another person here--

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.010 align:middle line:84%
is showing, giving the
understanding of eternal life

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.563 align:middle line:90%
to him through the breath.

00:05:25.563 --> 00:05:30.160 align:middle line:90%


00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.890 align:middle line:84%
Same thing here, and she's
gently holding his hand.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And she has not just
the sphere over him,

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.840 align:middle line:84%
but a red oval, which is the egg
of metamorphosis, communicating

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:52.950 align:middle line:84%
to him through the breath
he will change physical form

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.470 align:middle line:90%
to a different form.

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:01.290 align:middle line:90%


00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.370 align:middle line:84%
All of the temples
that run up the Nile

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.360 align:middle line:84%
correlate with the chakra
points in the human body.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.080 align:middle line:10%
This is the second temple,
and it's called Kom Ombo,

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.080 align:middle line:10%
and it's the sexual chakra.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.140 align:middle line:10%
It is the only temple
that is it is dedicated

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.720 align:middle line:10%
to polarity, to the
male and the female,

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.990 align:middle line:10%
and it is the only
temple in Egypt

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.420 align:middle line:10%
that is dedicated
to two gods at once.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And there is a line down
the middle of this temple,

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.270 align:middle line:84%
and one side is one
God, and one side

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.390 align:middle line:84%
is the other-- the
principal of polarity.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.370 align:middle line:84%
It's real interesting, when
Gregg Braden was over there

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.970 align:middle line:84%
with his group just recently--
remember that big earthquake

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.230 align:middle line:90%
they had just recently?

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:44.030 align:middle line:90%
When was that?

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.150 align:middle line:84%
That was November, or
something like that.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.830 align:middle line:90%
Last December?

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:55.460 align:middle line:84%
Real recently-- he said
that you could tell,

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.220 align:middle line:84%
and the guards told
him the same thing.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.630 align:middle line:84%
One side is dark, and
one side is light.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And the side that was dark was
almost completely destroyed.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And the side that was
light, not one thing moved.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.650 align:middle line:90%


00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:11.450 align:middle line:90%
Sign of the times.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:15.630 align:middle line:90%


00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.530 align:middle line:84%
Here you see the two
left eyes of Horus

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:23.830 align:middle line:84%
and the little 45 degree rod
for Resurrection over here.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:31.980 align:middle line:84%
This temple is dedicated to--
this is the left eye of Horus.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And in each one
of these temples,

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:36.929 align:middle line:84%
they dealt with various
aspects of your feminine side,

00:07:36.929 --> 00:07:38.970 align:middle line:84%
whether you're male or
female, it doesn't matter.

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.230 align:middle line:90%
It's your right brain, OK?

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And so they dealt with
things like psychic energy

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:52.195 align:middle line:84%
and your fears and sensitivities
and all these kinds of things

00:07:52.195 --> 00:07:54.734 align:middle line:90%
and feelings and emotions.

00:07:54.734 --> 00:07:56.400 align:middle line:84%
These were the kinds
of things that they

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.100 align:middle line:84%
worked with the people as
you went through there.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And that was what your
beginning training was.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.180 align:middle line:84%
But one of them was
this thing with fear,

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:04.830 align:middle line:84%
and you can begin
to understand why,

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:05.900 align:middle line:90%
with what I just talked about.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.400 align:middle line:84%
They knew that they
were going to go

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.850 align:middle line:90%
into fourth dimensional spaces.

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:11.845 align:middle line:84%
And if you go into those fourth
dimensional spaces with fears,

00:08:11.845 --> 00:08:13.470 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
to deal with them,

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.740 align:middle line:90%
because they will become real.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And so they went through a
tremendous amount of work

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:22.240 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of these
fears out of people.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And every temple-- each chakra
relates to a different thing.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.760 align:middle line:84%
The first one is
survival, the sexual,

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.110 align:middle line:84%
and power of things, and
heart chakras, and throat,

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:36.115 align:middle line:84%
and sound currents, and all
the various things going up

00:08:36.115 --> 00:08:39.450 align:middle line:84%
the different
levels, and each one

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.690 align:middle line:84%
has a different kind of
fear associated with it

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:44.980 align:middle line:84%
and a different kind
of emotion associated

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:47.850 align:middle line:90%
with that they focus in on.

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to talk
about one of the fears

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:54.000 align:middle line:84%
that they dealt with
in this temple here.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.942 align:middle line:84%
And I went there
the second time--

00:08:57.942 --> 00:08:59.400 align:middle line:84%
I took Katrina over
the first time.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.630 align:middle line:84%
The second time, Katrina
took me over there,

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.800 align:middle line:90%
which was kind of reciprocal.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I went with her group
the second time that she gave.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And she was giving
a ceremony where

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:13.860 align:middle line:84%
we went down in this little
hole in the ground here.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:21.330 align:middle line:90%


00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.800 align:middle line:84%
Here's the floor, and
then it goes like this.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:34.810 align:middle line:90%


00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:38.760 align:middle line:84%
So that hole that he's going
in is like this one here.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And you go in there, and
then there's a big granite

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.400 align:middle line:84%
slab hanging down, so
that you have to come in,

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.520 align:middle line:84%
and if you just go real fast,
you just run into a wall.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.690 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to go underneath
it and then come back up

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:55.490 align:middle line:90%
and come out the other side.

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:59.812 align:middle line:84%
And they talked about how
this was filled with water.

00:09:59.812 --> 00:10:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And we all went in
and did this ceremony.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.936 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking, boy, this
ceremony seems awful simple.

00:10:03.936 --> 00:10:07.780 align:middle line:90%


00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:11.091 align:middle line:84%
It was real beautiful, what we
did, but when we were all done,

00:10:11.091 --> 00:10:13.380 align:middle line:84%
I had the advantage then
of having Thoth with me,

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:18.390 align:middle line:84%
and I said, OK, what
really went on here?

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:23.000 align:middle line:90%
And he began to describe to me.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.355 align:middle line:90%
He says, look around.

00:10:24.355 --> 00:10:25.970 align:middle line:90%
He said, be observant.

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:27.070 align:middle line:90%
You see this right here?

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:32.650 align:middle line:90%


00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:35.220 align:middle line:84%
They put metal in
here, so that when

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:38.880 align:middle line:84%
they put two blocks together,
it would keep them from moving.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.970 align:middle line:84%
You see there's another one
over there, right by the foot,

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:42.840 align:middle line:90%
over here.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.940 align:middle line:84%
They ran all along there
and along-- this was a wall.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.780 align:middle line:90%
This was a wall.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:52.300 align:middle line:84%
He told me to climb up on the
other side of there, and I did.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And I climbed up over here,
and I got up high over here.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, that hole was
right down in here.

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:00.080 align:middle line:84%
You see this person
standing down there.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And that hole was
right in the middle

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:07.630 align:middle line:90%
here, between these two things.

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:08.430 align:middle line:90%
So this was a wall.

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:10.256 align:middle line:90%
You could see these pigs.

00:11:10.256 --> 00:11:13.982 align:middle line:84%
The wall went all the way up
to here, maybe even higher, up

00:11:13.982 --> 00:11:14.870 align:middle line:90%
to here.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And there's another
wall over here.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And this was the center line
between the two temples.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.480 align:middle line:84%
This side was the
temple of darkness.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.410 align:middle line:84%
This side was the
temple of light.

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And right in the
middle was this one.

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:31.170 align:middle line:84%
So I asked him what happened,
and this is what he said.

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:34.860 align:middle line:90%


00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:38.950 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the first time that
they told me to give this,

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:42.060 align:middle line:84%
I gave it to one, and I
had a lady go in shock.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:45.310 align:middle line:84%
She couldn't even talk
for about an hour.

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:48.070 align:middle line:84%
She was just sitting next
to the wall quivering,

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:49.990 align:middle line:84%
because she had done it
and failed this test,

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:53.810 align:middle line:90%
and she remembered it in detail.

00:11:53.810 --> 00:12:02.604 align:middle line:84%
I hope there's nobody here-- Let
me know if you start quivering.

00:12:02.604 --> 00:12:06.940 align:middle line:84%
Do you see those little
steps up over there?

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.380 align:middle line:90%
Those are the steps.

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:13.400 align:middle line:90%
And then it came down like this.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.810 align:middle line:90%
There was a slab that came down.

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:17.740 align:middle line:90%


00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And then there was
another one down here.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.660 align:middle line:90%


00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And then there was another wall
that came higher than this time

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:31.800 align:middle line:84%
with another slab like
this, like that, and then

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:35.680 align:middle line:90%
over right there.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.100 align:middle line:90%
This is part of it.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, this one came
over like this.

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And this was the thing that
we just went in over here.

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:47.000 align:middle line:90%


00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.108 align:middle line:90%
And that's not too good.

00:12:52.108 --> 00:13:03.820 align:middle line:90%


00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.768 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm just
going to draw it.

00:13:05.768 --> 00:13:09.970 align:middle line:90%


00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:13.470 align:middle line:90%
This is where I was, over here.

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:43.570 align:middle line:90%
And

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:49.180 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you have these two
walls sandwiched together.

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And the whole thing was filled
with water-- water here.

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:58.812 align:middle line:84%
These are little steps
facing that way, and then

00:13:58.812 --> 00:13:59.612 align:middle line:90%
water over here.

00:13:59.612 --> 00:14:06.120 align:middle line:84%
So this whole thing would
fill up with water, like this.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:12.909 align:middle line:90%
And in here, was alligators.

00:14:12.909 --> 00:14:21.830 align:middle line:90%


00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:24.825 align:middle line:84%
This temple was dedicated to
alligators and crocodiles.

00:14:24.825 --> 00:14:27.630 align:middle line:90%


00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And the little,
innocent initiate

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.610 align:middle line:84%
would come over
here and be looking

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:39.640 align:middle line:84%
at a blank wall with
these three little steps

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.310 align:middle line:90%
and this little square of water.

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:46.380 align:middle line:84%
That's all they could
see, nothing else, just

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:48.500 align:middle line:90%
this little square of water.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:53.854 align:middle line:84%
And they were told to go in and
don't come back out this way

00:14:53.854 --> 00:14:59.216 align:middle line:90%


00:14:59.216 --> 00:15:00.016 align:middle line:90%
and to be careful.

00:15:00.016 --> 00:15:03.590 align:middle line:90%


00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:07.515 align:middle line:84%
So with one breath-- and they
had to do a lot of training

00:15:07.515 --> 00:15:08.390 align:middle line:90%
before they did this.

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:09.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they didn't just
throw them in there.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.100 align:middle line:84%
They did a lot of
training and breathing

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.450 align:middle line:84%
and everything else like
that-- they would come in here.

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't go
real fast, because they'd

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:16.200 align:middle line:90%
hit their heads on here.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.700 align:middle line:84%
They had to move slowly
around these things.

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:19.960 align:middle line:90%
And they'd come down here.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.350 align:middle line:90%
And this is lit up.

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:23.560 align:middle line:90%
Lights coming in here.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And they'd come in here, and
right when they get down here,

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.090 align:middle line:90%
they look up.

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And there's all
these alligators,

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:39.760 align:middle line:84%
which probably cause the little
innocent person to experience

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.940 align:middle line:90%
a certain amount of fear.

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And the alligators were actually
fed, according to Thoth.

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:49.000 align:middle line:90%
They didn't eat anybody.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.492 align:middle line:90%
But it wouldn't matter.

00:15:50.492 --> 00:15:53.450 align:middle line:90%


00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:55.650 align:middle line:84%
It just simply wouldn't
make any difference

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:56.960 align:middle line:90%
once you were down here.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.854 align:middle line:90%
You know you can't go back.

00:15:59.854 --> 00:16:02.145 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is you
got to weave your way around

00:16:02.145 --> 00:16:05.030 align:middle line:84%
through these alligators
and come up to this step

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:07.030 align:middle line:90%
and get out.

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:09.090 align:middle line:84%
That's what happens almost
always the first time.

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And then when you get
out, you get up here,

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.590 align:middle line:84%
you were told that
you just failed.

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:19.240 align:middle line:90%


00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.530 align:middle line:90%
And you have to do it again.

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:24.360 align:middle line:90%
It's not the way out.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And so now, the person has to
go through a whole bunch more

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:29.370 align:middle line:84%
training, comes
back a second time,

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:31.120 align:middle line:84%
though they could do
it on the first time,

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.330 align:middle line:90%
but almost never, he said.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:35.080 align:middle line:84%
They come back a second
time, and now they

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:38.310 align:middle line:84%
know the alligators
are in there.

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And they also know that
that's not the way out.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.610 align:middle line:84%
So they have to come back
down here a second time,

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:50.320 align:middle line:84%
and when they get here, at the
moment of their greatest fear,

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.390 align:middle line:84%
they have to go
deeper into this place

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:55.740 align:middle line:84%
here-- find it and
go deeper into it--

00:16:55.740 --> 00:17:01.750 align:middle line:84%
and come out over here on
this other side of the wall,

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:04.300 align:middle line:84%
at which point, they
go on to the next one.

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:09.030 align:middle line:90%


00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And they had devised all these
systems and things to get you--

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:17.589 align:middle line:84%
and he says hardly
anyone ever died,

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:23.099 align:middle line:90%
but occasionally they did.

00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:24.980 align:middle line:90%
But that's life.

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:27.662 align:middle line:90%


00:17:27.662 --> 00:17:30.120 align:middle line:84%
From an Egyptian
point of view, you

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.590 align:middle line:90%
got to push things sometimes.

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:36.010 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, they had
another one over here,

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:38.680 align:middle line:90%
which I wanted him to ask me.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.970 align:middle line:84%
It was a big, huge
hole that was maybe

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:45.390 align:middle line:84%
30 feet around with stairs that
spiraled down into the water.

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And you could just see them
disappearing down, down, down,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:48.800 align:middle line:90%
down.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:53.175 align:middle line:84%
I figure there was probably
some weird thing with that too.

00:17:53.175 --> 00:17:56.450 align:middle line:84%
But he wouldn't
tell me what it was.

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:58.760 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know what it was.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:00.050 align:middle line:90%
This is out of Memphis.

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:03.550 align:middle line:84%
It's a new temple they just
discovered when I was there.

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:05.180 align:middle line:84%
This is the ground
level up here.

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And this was only about four
or five feet under the ground,

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:11.961 align:middle line:84%
and this is the top of about
a 40 or 50-foot pillar.

00:18:11.961 --> 00:18:15.560 align:middle line:10%
So it's a huge temple
that's totally buried.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.770 align:middle line:10%
And this is Hathor.

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:21.190 align:middle line:10%
Only Hathor is not
a single person.

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:23.964 align:middle line:10%
It is a race of being,
according to Thoth

00:18:23.964 --> 00:18:25.130 align:middle line:10%
and to the ancient writings.

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:27.520 align:middle line:90%


00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.395 align:middle line:84%
There's a Hathor race,
and they live on Venus

00:18:29.395 --> 00:18:31.850 align:middle line:90%
in the fourth dimension.

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And they are the most advanced
souls in this solar system.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And they are very much
like the dolphins.

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:38.900 align:middle line:90%
They are tall.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.650 align:middle line:90%
They're 10 to 16 feet tall.

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:43.670 align:middle line:84%
The females are
about 10 to 12 feet,

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:47.180 align:middle line:84%
and the males are about
14 to 16 feet tall.

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:52.858 align:middle line:84%
And they function almost
totally with sound.

00:18:52.858 --> 00:18:57.630 align:middle line:84%
The sounds that they can
make with their voice

00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:00.720 align:middle line:90%
can do just about anything.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And the dolphins
are real similar.

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:06.350 align:middle line:84%
They function almost
totally on sound also.

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:11.405 align:middle line:84%
And they're on real similar
levels of consciousness,

00:19:11.405 --> 00:19:18.590 align:middle line:84%
though they have very
different physical forms.

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.580 align:middle line:90%
And they're just pure love.

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:22.560 align:middle line:90%
They just love people.

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.290 align:middle line:90%
They love everything.

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:29.010 align:middle line:84%
They don't have a mean
bone in their body.

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And I did witness the-- one
of the people I was with

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:41.800 align:middle line:84%
had an initiation
with a Hathor, where

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.420 align:middle line:84%
they had to learn what
sound the ankh was.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's a continuous
sound that you

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:48.410 align:middle line:84%
do for about two hours--
one continuous sound

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:52.650 align:middle line:84%
that you never stop, you
know, like the Aboriginals do

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:54.410 align:middle line:84%
the didgeridoo,
and they learn how

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:55.830 align:middle line:84%
to make a sound
that never stops?

00:19:55.830 --> 00:20:12.610 align:middle line:90%


00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:13.920 align:middle line:90%
You can do the same thing.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.961 align:middle line:84%
There's a sound you can
make that they teach you,

00:20:15.961 --> 00:20:17.610 align:middle line:84%
that once you get
the sound going,

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:19.730 align:middle line:90%
the sound just never stops.

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:23.210 align:middle line:84%
You learn how to breath
in through your nostrils

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:27.280 align:middle line:84%
and out through your
mouth and some of the air

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:30.401 align:middle line:84%
goes into your lungs, so you
ever have to ever breath.

00:20:30.401 --> 00:20:32.442 align:middle line:84%
It's just one continuing
in breath and out breath

00:20:32.442 --> 00:20:33.242 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:20:33.242 --> 00:20:35.436 align:middle line:90%


00:20:35.436 --> 00:20:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
think that's possible,

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:38.430 align:middle line:90%
then talk to an Aboriginal.

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:40.910 align:middle line:90%
They do it all the time.

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:43.460 align:middle line:84%
I had someone who--
you can train.

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.377 align:middle line:84%
A simple way of training is
you put a straw into water,

00:20:46.377 --> 00:20:47.960 align:middle line:84%
and you start blowing
bubbles, and you

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.044 align:middle line:84%
learn how to blow
bubbles continuously,

00:20:50.044 --> 00:20:50.960 align:middle line:90%
without ever stopping.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:55.406 align:middle line:90%


00:20:55.406 --> 00:20:58.998 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I'll talk about
the Hathors later.

00:20:58.998 --> 00:21:01.850 align:middle line:10%
They're pretty good people.

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:05.390 align:middle line:90%


00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:08.040 align:middle line:10%
And this is the temple that
was dedicated to Hathor.

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:14.232 align:middle line:10%
It's the Dendera.

00:21:14.232 --> 00:21:15.886 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, right, thank you.

00:21:15.886 --> 00:21:17.320 align:middle line:90%
It's Dendera.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.310 align:middle line:90%
That's Katrina Raphaell.

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:23.424 align:middle line:90%
I don't know who that is.

00:21:23.424 --> 00:21:26.238 align:middle line:84%
And somebody came in
here and destroyed

00:21:26.238 --> 00:21:30.685 align:middle line:84%
all the faces of the Hathors
and all these pillars that

00:21:30.685 --> 00:21:35.029 align:middle line:84%
go all-- inside are these huge,
huge, huge pillars with Hathors

00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:36.184 align:middle line:90%
all around them.

00:21:36.184 --> 00:21:37.770 align:middle line:90%
They destroyed all of them.

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:40.470 align:middle line:90%
>>Do you know why?

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:43.830 align:middle line:90%
>>I don't know.

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:49.090 align:middle line:84%
The Christians that came
in saw all of this as evil

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:52.450 align:middle line:84%
and tried to destroy
a great deal of it.

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:54.710 align:middle line:90%
This was pagan to them.

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And like I said,
a lot of it was.

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:02.740 align:middle line:84%
It was a cult. Certain
aspects of this,

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:06.696 align:middle line:84%
because of the mistaken idea
that each one of these nefers

00:22:06.696 --> 00:22:07.496 align:middle line:90%
were gods.

00:22:07.496 --> 00:22:08.787 align:middle line:90%
That was where the problem was.

00:22:08.787 --> 00:22:11.800 align:middle line:84%
If it had not been for
that, both the Christians

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:16.370 align:middle line:84%
and the Egyptians probably
would have been very agreeable

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:17.920 align:middle line:90%
in all kinds of ways.

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.870 align:middle line:90%
But it didn't work out that way.

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:27.856 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, inside this is the
temple that has the up on that

00:22:27.856 --> 00:22:29.730 align:middle line:84%
side over there and way
back-- and this thing

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:31.360 align:middle line:90%
is so big you can't imagine.

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:37.620 align:middle line:84%
It's like a half a mile
around in all directions,

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:41.330 align:middle line:84%
with a huge wall
around it and all that.

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:44.240 align:middle line:84%
This is just the central
part, and it's enormous.

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And up over in here is where
the astrological wheel is on it.

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:54.460 align:middle line:84%
But over on this side, here, is
where I wanted to talk about.

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:56.390 align:middle line:84%
You can't see this
picture very well.

00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:57.290 align:middle line:90%
This is a doorway.

00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:58.090 align:middle line:90%
It's dark.

00:22:58.090 --> 00:22:59.950 align:middle line:90%
It goes into a dark area.

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And over here is a symbol
for Marduk, the 12th planet.

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And down here is a circle with
a left eye of Horus in it.

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is Thoth
pointing to it.

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And inside of there is the
story of Isis and Osiris.

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And what many
people don't realize

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:27.460 align:middle line:84%
is that Horus was a
virgin birth, like Jesus.

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:33.815 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, almost all of
the people, like Krishna,

00:23:33.815 --> 00:23:37.400 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, were all immaculate
conceptions and virgin births.

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.410 align:middle line:90%


00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Whether or not they're a
virgin doesn't really matter,

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:46.630 align:middle line:84%
but anyway, we'll
talk about that now.

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:48.840 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm going
to discuss right now

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:52.880 align:middle line:84%
is immaculate conception,
which we tend to think

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:57.770 align:middle line:90%
is myth, in 1992.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:02.680 align:middle line:84%
We think that that's just
not true, that we can accept,

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.261 align:middle line:90%
if we're Christian-- what?

00:24:04.261 --> 00:24:05.061 align:middle line:90%
>>'93.

00:24:05.061 --> 00:24:05.861 align:middle line:90%
>>'93.

00:24:05.861 --> 00:24:09.540 align:middle line:90%
>>Are we still in that year?

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:11.955 align:middle line:90%
I want to go back the other way.

00:24:11.955 --> 00:24:12.905 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:12.905 --> 00:24:14.810 align:middle line:90%
'93.

00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:17.160 align:middle line:90%
OK, 1993.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:21.950 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I still haven't quite
got here yet, I don't think.

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:24.690 align:middle line:84%
We still think that it's
myth, that it isn't true.

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:27.860 align:middle line:84%
We think if we're
Christian, we can

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:32.351 align:middle line:84%
see that there's an immaculate
conception that produced Jesus.

00:24:32.351 --> 00:24:35.146 align:middle line:90%
And we can accept that.

00:24:35.146 --> 00:24:38.250 align:middle line:84%
But we don't think that
it could possibly ever

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:42.330 align:middle line:84%
have anything to do with us
or that anyone else has ever

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:44.090 align:middle line:90%
done it.

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:46.495 align:middle line:84%
Most Christians only think
that Jesus was the only one,

00:24:46.495 --> 00:24:49.160 align:middle line:84%
though there are many, many,
many, many, many examples

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:49.960 align:middle line:90%
of this.

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:54.120 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the AMA has
over 200 examples of it--

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:58.990 align:middle line:84%
documented,
absolutely documented,

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:06.630 align:middle line:84%
no doubt, immaculate
conception births on record.

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:10.870 align:middle line:84%
But let me even go
much deeper than that.

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:15.780 align:middle line:84%
In here I want to talk about
the story of Isis and Osiris.

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:17.386 align:middle line:90%
I think did describe it, right?

00:25:17.386 --> 00:25:19.260 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing that
he's cut up in 14 pieces

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:21.220 align:middle line:84%
and brought back--
the whole thing.

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And she flew to him
and it shows this hawk.

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:28.400 align:middle line:84%
She turns from a human into
a hawk and flies to him

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.930 align:middle line:84%
and wraps the wings
around the penis,

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:33.590 align:middle line:84%
and then immediately
after that becomes

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:37.230 align:middle line:84%
pregnant with this baby, which
becomes this hawk-headed baby,

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:38.840 align:middle line:90%
which is Horus.

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And through the birth of
Horus, the three of them

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:46.840 align:middle line:84%
become immortal beings,
very much like what happened

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:50.022 align:middle line:90%
with Ay and Tiya in Lemuria.

00:25:50.022 --> 00:25:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me make an
introduction to this.

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Again, most people don't believe
that immaculate conception

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:05.976 align:middle line:90%
can take place.

00:26:05.976 --> 00:26:08.460 align:middle line:90%
But let's look at the evidence.

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:10.790 align:middle line:84%
First of all,
immaculate conception

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:15.880 align:middle line:84%
takes place all around you,
every day, all the time,

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:22.850 align:middle line:84%
all over the place
in nature, all over.

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:28.210 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds
of plants and trees

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:33.505 align:middle line:84%
and insects that do it all
the time, lots and lots.

00:26:33.505 --> 00:26:34.630 align:middle line:90%
I don't even know how many.

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:36.810 align:middle line:84%
It's probably in the
hundreds of thousands of them

00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:38.101 align:middle line:90%
that are capable of doing this.

00:26:38.101 --> 00:26:40.087 align:middle line:84%
Now, just pick one so
you can see clearly

00:26:40.087 --> 00:26:41.295 align:middle line:90%
the image of what I'm saying.

00:26:41.295 --> 00:26:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And that one is the bee
that we're so familiar with.

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:51.500 align:middle line:84%
The bee-- a female bee--
can make a male bee

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:52.890 align:middle line:90%
anytime she wants.

00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:55.510 align:middle line:84%
She does not need to
mate with a male bee

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:56.955 align:middle line:90%
if she wants to make a male.

00:26:56.955 --> 00:27:00.729 align:middle line:84%
She can just say, I think
I'll make a male bee today.

00:27:00.729 --> 00:27:03.100 align:middle line:90%
Make a male bee.

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:04.820 align:middle line:84%
But if she wants to
make a female bee,

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:08.850 align:middle line:84%
she has to physically
mate with the male

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:10.930 align:middle line:90%
to make the female bee.

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:12.980 align:middle line:84%
That's the arrangement
that they've made.

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:14.070 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at this.

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:17.560 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at the
family tree of a male bee.

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:20.272 align:middle line:90%
A male be only needs a mommy.

00:27:20.272 --> 00:27:21.672 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is fact.

00:27:21.672 --> 00:27:22.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm not making this up.

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:24.220 align:middle line:90%
This is fact.

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:26.330 align:middle line:90%
The male bee only needs a mommy.

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:28.914 align:middle line:84%
But the mommy needs
a daddy and a mommy.

00:27:28.914 --> 00:27:30.580 align:middle line:84%
But the mommy needs
a mommy and a daddy.

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:32.374 align:middle line:84%
But the daddy only
needs a mommy.

00:27:32.374 --> 00:27:37.740 align:middle line:84%
But the mommy--
and it comes down

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:42.680 align:middle line:84%
in this funny
looking tree, right?

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:55.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you come over here,
there's 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:58.970 align:middle line:84%
and you see the Fibonacci
sequence unfolding.

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:01.620 align:middle line:10%
But if you have a
family tree of a couple

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:04.090 align:middle line:10%
of an animal or anything
else that is not

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:10.940 align:middle line:10%
using immaculate conception,
it comes down 1, 2, 4, 8, 16,

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:14.200 align:middle line:10%
and it's the binary sequence.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:17.480 align:middle line:84%
The two primary sequences
of life-- one is male.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.355 align:middle line:90%
And one is female.

00:28:18.355 --> 00:28:24.880 align:middle line:90%


00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:29.740 align:middle line:10%
Peter C. Hoppe, Karl
Illmensee, announced in 1977

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:32.020 align:middle line:10%
the successful birth at
the Jackson Laboratory

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:36.590 align:middle line:10%
in Bar Harbor, Maine, of
seven single-parent mice.

00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:38.420 align:middle line:10%
The process was called
parthenogenesis,

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:39.590 align:middle line:10%
or virgin birth.

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:42.940 align:middle line:10%
However, immaculate conception
would be a more accurate term,

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:45.760 align:middle line:10%
since the female does
not have to be a virgin.

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:52.940 align:middle line:10%
Two people took animals
and created-- took a female

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:57.080 align:middle line:10%
and got the female pregnant
without any interaction

00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:02.200 align:middle line:10%
from the male whatsoever, sip.

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.170 align:middle line:90%
They made virgin birth mice.

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:08.610 align:middle line:84%
That was the first time it took
place, only in 1977, recently.

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:12.770 align:middle line:84%
All they had to do
was to take the ovum

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:17.060 align:middle line:84%
and stick a little
pin through it,

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:23.360 align:middle line:84%
and mitosis began-- no
sperm at all, nothing.

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And now, since then,
they've done it

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:26.735 align:middle line:84%
with all kinds of things--
rabbits, blah blah

00:29:26.735 --> 00:29:28.065 align:middle line:90%
blah, and everything like that.

00:29:28.065 --> 00:29:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And humans-- they've done
it with human beings.

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:34.750 align:middle line:84%
There are virgin
birth humans that have

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:36.910 align:middle line:90%
been done in the laboratory.

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:38.410 align:middle line:84%
I've even talked
to the doctor who's

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:42.862 align:middle line:84%
done it, which was in North
Carolina, one of them.

00:29:42.862 --> 00:29:44.820 align:middle line:84%
Though we don't hear
about this stuff too much.

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:49.332 align:middle line:84%
We don't know this kind of
experimentation is going on.

00:29:49.332 --> 00:29:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And in the old journals before
1900-- medical journals--

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:04.120 align:middle line:84%
they claimed that some females
had a particular gland that

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:07.950 align:middle line:84%
could excrete an acid,
and that that acid

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:10.470 align:middle line:90%
would begin the process.

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:14.550 align:middle line:84%
I asked him about this, and
he had never read the journal,

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:17.750 align:middle line:84%
but he said that from
everything he knew about this,

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:20.870 align:middle line:84%
there probably was no
reason why an acid couldn't

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:22.795 align:middle line:84%
work as anything that
broke the surface so.

00:30:22.795 --> 00:30:24.420 align:middle line:84%
It could either eat
through the surface

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:27.580 align:middle line:84%
or break the
surface of the ovum,

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:35.000 align:middle line:90%
and the birth process begins.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.530 align:middle line:84%
However, when a
human baby is born

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:41.840 align:middle line:84%
from immaculate conception,
or parthenogenisis--

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:47.080 align:middle line:84%
what it's called-- it is
a female, always, so far.

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And the female looks
identical to the mom,

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.790 align:middle line:84%
because that's where she
drew all the genes from.

00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:57.510 align:middle line:90%
All of them came from her.

00:30:57.510 --> 00:31:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And as far as they know,
the female is sterile.

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:06.320 align:middle line:84%
As far as they know--
is she really sterile?

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.650 align:middle line:84%
Or is she now only able to
mate interdimensionally?

00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:11.510 align:middle line:90%


00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:13.642 align:middle line:84%
She can mate physically
all she wants.

00:31:13.642 --> 00:31:15.910 align:middle line:84%
If she's an
interdimensional being now,

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:17.957 align:middle line:84%
she won't be able
to mate that way.

00:31:17.957 --> 00:31:19.540 align:middle line:84%
She'd have to mate
interdimensionally.

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:23.450 align:middle line:90%


00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:27.552 align:middle line:84%
There's so much that is
not learned about this.

00:31:27.552 --> 00:31:29.265 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that
they're discovering

00:31:29.265 --> 00:31:32.070 align:middle line:84%
is that the length
of time of birth,

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:34.480 align:middle line:84%
instead of being 9 months,
is about 10 and 1/2 months.

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:37.560 align:middle line:90%


00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And my wife believes that she
had an immaculate conception.

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:44.570 align:middle line:90%


00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:47.840 align:middle line:84%
Before I met her, she
had not been with anyone.

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:50.730 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have any
reason to not say this.

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:51.530 align:middle line:90%
It didn't matter.

00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:53.945 align:middle line:84%
She had had children before
we married and everything.

00:31:53.945 --> 00:31:56.830 align:middle line:84%
But she said that
with the last baby,

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:59.660 align:middle line:90%
she hadn't been with anybody.

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And when she got pregnant, she
didn't believe the doctors.

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.191 align:middle line:84%
She went to another
doctor, and the doctor

00:32:03.191 --> 00:32:04.357 align:middle line:90%
said, yeah, you're pregnant.

00:32:04.357 --> 00:32:06.517 align:middle line:84%
She didn't believe that
one, went to another one.

00:32:06.517 --> 00:32:09.100 align:middle line:84%
Went to three doctors, and they
all told her she was pregnant.

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:10.710 align:middle line:90%
They thought she was crazy.

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And it took 10 and 1/2 months
for the baby to be born.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:19.240 align:middle line:84%
And when the baby came
out, and even now, it

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:21.556 align:middle line:90%
is like a mirror image of her.

00:32:21.556 --> 00:32:26.380 align:middle line:84%
I saw the picture of her
when she was two years old,

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:28.620 align:middle line:84%
and I had the baby there
when it was two years old.

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:31.560 align:middle line:84%
I remember sitting in front
of this picture of the baby

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:35.660 align:middle line:84%
and the image of my wife
when she was two years old,

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:41.870 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't even see
not even the slightest

00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:44.607 align:middle line:90%
difference at all, not a thing.

00:32:44.607 --> 00:32:46.440 align:middle line:84%
I sat there for a long
time looking at this.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:48.370 align:middle line:90%
It was like nothing.

00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
women today in 1993--

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:59.600 align:middle line:84%
at least in 1992
there were, anyway--

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:07.640 align:middle line:84%
that are having 10 and
1/2-month pregnancies.

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.320 align:middle line:84%
According to this doctor
there-- because we

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.837 align:middle line:90%
discussed this whole thing.

00:33:11.837 --> 00:33:13.920 align:middle line:84%
There may be something
going on in this right now.

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:15.340 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:17.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm not saying
that any of this is true.

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:21.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying that this
is what is known so far.

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And you can make up your
own mind about all of this.

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:27.070 align:middle line:84%
I remember at one
point when it was

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:29.920 align:middle line:84%
Thoth who wanted me to
put this out and study it.

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:33.573 align:middle line:84%
And I remember at
one point Thoth,

00:33:33.573 --> 00:33:36.156 align:middle line:84%
while I was studying some of the
geometry, I was sitting here,

00:33:36.156 --> 00:33:37.864 align:middle line:84%
and I was trying to
figure something out.

00:33:37.864 --> 00:33:39.460 align:middle line:84%
He's sort of sitting
here watching me.

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to
figure something.

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:42.974 align:middle line:84%
And he was just sort of
making conversations.

00:33:42.974 --> 00:33:45.340 align:middle line:90%


00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:48.110 align:middle line:84%
There isn't really anytime when
he just makes conversation,

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:52.020 align:middle line:84%
but he said, would you like
to hear a story about my mom?

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yeah, sure,
and I'm sitting here

00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:56.040 align:middle line:90%
trying to figure this thing out.

00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:59.187 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well-- this
is actually right before,

00:33:59.187 --> 00:34:00.770 align:middle line:84%
because at the time,
I didn't know why

00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:02.019 align:middle line:90%
he was trying to tell me this.

00:34:02.019 --> 00:34:04.660 align:middle line:90%


00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:07.430 align:middle line:90%
His mom's name was Sekhmet.

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:08.754 align:middle line:90%
Chiquetet is a title.

00:34:08.754 --> 00:34:12.650 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like Rinpoche,
which means the precious one.

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:15.020 align:middle line:84%
Chiquetet means the
seeker of wisdom.

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And Sekhmet means
the holder of wisdom.

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:21.580 align:middle line:90%


00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And he says mom went right
after the race was created.

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:33.570 align:middle line:84%
She was one of the
first ones that became

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:35.670 align:middle line:90%
where they could have children.

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:38.918 align:middle line:90%


00:34:38.918 --> 00:34:42.219 align:middle line:84%
And while all the other
ones were mating physically

00:34:42.219 --> 00:34:44.960 align:middle line:84%
and having babies
in binary sequence,

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:48.780 align:middle line:84%
she elected to go
in another way,

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:51.980 align:middle line:84%
and she found this man
that she fell in love with.

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:57.300 align:middle line:84%
But they made love
interdimensionally

00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:01.620 align:middle line:84%
without physical contact
from two different places.

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:02.870 align:middle line:90%
There are still orgasm.

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:05.140 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
things that go on.

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:10.060 align:middle line:84%
But a different kind
of connection is made.

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:16.030 align:middle line:90%
And she became pregnant.

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:19.240 align:middle line:84%
And in having this baby,
the same thing that

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:22.230 align:middle line:84%
happened with Tiya
and Ay-- they became

00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:26.020 align:middle line:84%
aware of their nature and
their relationship to God.

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:27.381 align:middle line:90%
And they became immortal beings.

00:35:27.381 --> 00:35:31.310 align:middle line:90%


00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:42.931 align:middle line:84%
Only the baby was
a boy, not a girl,

00:35:42.931 --> 00:35:45.180 align:middle line:84%
like we would get through
parthenogenesis in this way.

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:46.920 align:middle line:90%
It came out a boy.

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And when the little boy
grew up and became an adult,

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:56.150 align:middle line:84%
then the father knew
what he was to do.

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:58.890 align:middle line:90%
And he left his body.

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:04.510 align:middle line:84%
He let go of it and
migrated to Venus

00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:10.150 align:middle line:84%
and became part of the Hathor
race, took on a Hathor body

00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:12.867 align:middle line:84%
and changed
evolutionary patterns.

00:36:12.867 --> 00:36:14.575 align:middle line:84%
This is a story You
can take it as a myth

00:36:14.575 --> 00:36:16.750 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you
want to take it as.

00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And then the mommy mated
interdimensionally with the son

00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:33.040 align:middle line:90%
and had another baby boy.

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And then that baby grew up,
then the son dropped the body

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.870 align:middle line:84%
and went to Venus and
became part of the race.

00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And the father then left Venus
and went on through the sun,

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:53.880 align:middle line:84%
right into the sun, to Sirius
and became part of that race.

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.340 align:middle line:90%
And this process continued on.

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And they would keep
mating, having another son.

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:01.745 align:middle line:90%
That son would go to Venus.

00:37:01.745 --> 00:37:03.100 align:middle line:90%
The next one would go to Sirius.

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:04.558 align:middle line:84%
The next one would
go to-- Pleiades

00:37:04.558 --> 00:37:06.870 align:middle line:90%
was the next level out.

00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:07.870 align:middle line:90%
And they kept going out.

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And from Pleiades it
was till Aldebaran.

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And the original father kept
stretching further and further

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:17.930 align:middle line:84%
and further out
in consciousness,

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:28.080 align:middle line:84%
while the mother stayed anchored
to Earth, all the way up

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.860 align:middle line:90%
until the time of Atlantis.

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:33.540 align:middle line:84%
where-- Thoth's
father's name was Thome.

00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And Thome and his mother had
an interdimensional baby,

00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:38.420 align:middle line:90%
which was Thoth.

00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:42.000 align:middle line:90%


00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And when Thoth grew up,
then Thome left his body

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:49.160 align:middle line:90%
and went to Venus.

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And then Thoth and his mother
interdimensionally mated

00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:57.290 align:middle line:84%
and had a baby,
whose name was Tat.

00:37:57.290 --> 00:38:00.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, according to
the Egyptian records,

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:04.390 align:middle line:84%
Tat was born of
Seshat, his wife.

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:05.330 align:middle line:90%
He broke the lineage.

00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:07.760 align:middle line:90%
He got married.

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:16.269 align:middle line:84%
Thoth married a woman for the
first time, and it was Seshat.

00:38:16.269 --> 00:38:18.400 align:middle line:84%
And they assumed that
the baby that was born

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.987 align:middle line:90%
was from them, called Tat.

00:38:20.987 --> 00:38:22.570 align:middle line:84%
But according to
Thoth, it's not true.

00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:23.760 align:middle line:90%
It was from the mother.

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:26.740 align:middle line:90%


00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And then later, when Thoth
went to Peru along with Seshat,

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:38.680 align:middle line:84%
they had a baby together
down there, a girl,

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:43.150 align:middle line:84%
born of physical contact, and
began a binary sequence pattern

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:45.720 align:middle line:84%
as well as the Fibonacci
sequence pattern

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:48.230 align:middle line:90%
from the same lineage.

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And I just listened
to all that stuff,

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:57.990 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know what
to think about it.

00:38:57.990 --> 00:39:02.800 align:middle line:84%
I still don't know
what to think about it.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.808 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps there's more in
this universe than I know.

00:39:05.808 --> 00:39:06.736 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:39:06.736 --> 00:39:10.450 align:middle line:90%


00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:16.730 align:middle line:84%
Though I think that there is,
if you do study the world's

00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:21.430 align:middle line:84%
religions right back to
the core of who they are,

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:25.270 align:middle line:84%
you'll keep coming up with the
same thing over and over again.

00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:28.180 align:middle line:84%
It's usually a
brother and sister

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:32.707 align:middle line:84%
mating to form a
child who becomes

00:39:32.707 --> 00:39:33.873 align:middle line:90%
the leader of this religion.

00:39:33.873 --> 00:39:37.990 align:middle line:90%


00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:40.490 align:middle line:84%
So in his case, it was
a mother and a son.

00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:44.240 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know what
this is all about.

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And you can just look
at it, think about it.

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:49.970 align:middle line:90%
But it's real.

00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:51.065 align:middle line:90%
It's really real now.

00:39:51.065 --> 00:39:51.940 align:middle line:90%
It's really possible.

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:53.273 align:middle line:90%
It's not that it isn't possible.

00:39:53.273 --> 00:39:56.830 align:middle line:84%
It's absolutely, scientifically
proven beyond any doubt.

00:39:56.830 --> 00:39:59.160 align:middle line:10%
It's real.

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:03.810 align:middle line:84%
>>But we haven't been able
to scientifically find a male

00:40:03.810 --> 00:40:05.903 align:middle line:90%
from the immaculate conception?

00:40:05.903 --> 00:40:08.270 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:13.800 align:middle line:84%
But I think the reason is
because she's not really

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:15.370 align:middle line:90%
interdimensionally mating.

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:19.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a mechanical device
to get the process going.

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:22.410 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, in real
life, it's a real male

00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:24.925 align:middle line:84%
and a real female
interdimensionally mating,

00:40:24.925 --> 00:40:28.994 align:middle line:90%
and that's what creates a male.

00:40:28.994 --> 00:40:30.910 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that's
just happening right now,

00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:33.442 align:middle line:84%
today, right this
very minute, 1993,

00:40:33.442 --> 00:40:40.880 align:middle line:84%
is that they have just
discovered that a big law has

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:42.590 align:middle line:90%
just been broken.

00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:45.032 align:middle line:84%
They just discovered that
the number of chromosomes--

00:40:45.032 --> 00:40:46.990 align:middle line:84%
we have always thought
that 23 chromosomes came

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:50.530 align:middle line:84%
from the female, 23 chromosomes
came from the male, right?

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:52.030 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that what you
were all taught?

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:53.692 align:middle line:90%
It's wrong.

00:40:53.692 --> 00:40:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely wrong-- they've
proven it beyond any

00:40:55.650 --> 00:40:57.560 align:middle line:90%
doubt whatsoever now.

00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:59.870 align:middle line:90%
It just isn't true.

00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Any number whatsoever
can come from the female,

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:08.780 align:middle line:90%
all the way from 23 to all 46.

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, usually
more come from the female

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:13.620 align:middle line:90%
than from the male.

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And he contributes
a certain amount,

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:18.054 align:middle line:90%
and she fills in the rest.

00:41:18.054 --> 00:41:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
they've now discovered.

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:22.200 align:middle line:84%
This is like in the
last two months.

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:24.190 align:middle line:90%
They now know this.

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:28.780 align:middle line:84%
>>Just one more question--
can the male do more than 23?

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>>What they believe now is
that it's the other way around.

00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:34.181 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if the male
can do more than 23,

00:41:34.181 --> 00:41:35.680 align:middle line:84%
but they do know
that the female can

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:39.770 align:middle line:84%
contribute any amount from 23 to
all of them to create the baby.

00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:42.890 align:middle line:90%


00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:46.870 align:middle line:84%
And they're mapping
the genes now.

00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:49.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you're
follow all this.

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.120 align:middle line:84%
There's 100,000 genes
in the human body.

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:54.820 align:middle line:84%
They know what about
3,000 of them are,

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:56.902 align:middle line:84%
and within a few
more years, they're

00:41:56.902 --> 00:41:58.990 align:middle line:84%
going to know what all
100,000 of them are.

00:41:58.990 --> 00:42:00.490 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
know the blueprint.

00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:02.622 align:middle line:90%


00:42:02.622 --> 00:42:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And with all they know
about this kind of stuff

00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:06.038 align:middle line:84%
and everything else
like that, they

00:42:06.038 --> 00:42:07.940 align:middle line:84%
would be able to
make a brand new race

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:11.010 align:middle line:84%
of any kind of conceivable
thing you can want.

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:14.135 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of diseases that have
never been able to be solved

00:42:14.135 --> 00:42:16.480 align:middle line:84%
will be able to solve
really easily very

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:19.822 align:middle line:84%
soon-- Lots. and
lots of stuff They'll

00:42:19.822 --> 00:42:24.410 align:middle line:84%
know if you've got the diseases
even from the day you're born

00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:25.700 align:middle line:90%
and be able to correct them.

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:28.430 align:middle line:84%
We're heading in a
real interesting level.

00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:30.070 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be
there real soon.

00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And the United States, by the
way, is trying to patent them.

00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:36.330 align:middle line:90%
You know about this?

00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:42.710 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to patent
all the genes, so that they

00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:45.460 align:middle line:90%
can control all of this.

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, spending lots and
lots of money doing it,

00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:52.140 align:middle line:90%
but the French did it.

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:53.080 align:middle line:90%
Yay, for the French.

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:56.007 align:middle line:90%


00:42:56.007 --> 00:42:58.020 align:middle line:84%
The United States
has spent billions--

00:42:58.020 --> 00:42:59.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
it is-- to do this,

00:42:59.590 --> 00:43:02.840 align:middle line:84%
and this one man in France,
using a very low budget,

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:06.530 align:middle line:84%
has figured out a very
rapid way to determine

00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:07.875 align:middle line:90%
what the genes are.

00:43:07.875 --> 00:43:09.875 align:middle line:84%
And he's mapping the whole
thing really quickly.

00:43:09.875 --> 00:43:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And he's going to
beat the United

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:14.462 align:middle line:90%
States almost for certain.

00:43:14.462 --> 00:43:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And he's going to give
it to the United Nations

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:19.300 align:middle line:84%
as a gift, which will
mean that they can't

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:22.490 align:middle line:90%
be patented at that point.

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:24.608 align:middle line:90%
