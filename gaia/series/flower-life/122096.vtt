00:00:16.885 --> 00:00:18.260 align:middle line:84%
>>Look at them
out in the oceans.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.670 align:middle line:90%
They're completely free.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.830 align:middle line:84%
They don't have any
technology, but they did.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.540 align:middle line:90%
They were immersed in it also.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.740 align:middle line:84%
Remember when they came down,
the Dogons, a long time ago.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.680 align:middle line:90%
They came down in a spaceship.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.980 align:middle line:84%
They were involved in UFOs
and all the other stuff.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.770 align:middle line:84%
They were part of the
Lucifer Rebellion,

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.410 align:middle line:84%
but they made the decision
at one point to break away.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And about 200 years ago,
they totally broke away,

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.900 align:middle line:84%
and they're still
emerging out of it.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.850 align:middle line:84%
Their planet is almost
totally out of it.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.880 align:middle line:84%
Sirius, it's almost
totally gone,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.880 align:middle line:84%
except for just the
humanoid part, which

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.570 align:middle line:90%
is the part we saw up here.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.100 align:middle line:84%
The humanoids are slowly turning
into dolphins and dropping off,

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.420 align:middle line:84%
and they're almost out
of-- they've almost

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.200 align:middle line:84%
extracted themselves out
of that whole pattern.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.339 align:middle line:84%
And they're proof
that it can be done.

00:01:10.339 --> 00:01:11.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.600 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, you said
that the Sirians are

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.290 align:middle line:84%
in Christ's
consciousness, and yet--

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.390 align:middle line:84%
>>They're on a very,
very low level of it.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.770 align:middle line:90%
They're--

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.977 align:middle line:84%
>>So the Lucifer Rebellion
has gotten into that?

00:01:23.977 --> 00:01:27.190 align:middle line:90%


00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.150 align:middle line:84%
>>The Lucifer Rebellion has
got into a lot of areas.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:37.440 align:middle line:84%
Anybody in existence that is
involved in external technology

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.033 align:middle line:84%
is part of the
Lucifer Rebellion.

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:43.963 align:middle line:90%


00:01:43.963 --> 00:01:46.440 align:middle line:90%
>>Isn't is a shorter list.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.157 align:middle line:84%
>>Oh, no, she said, who
isn't is a shorter list.

00:01:49.157 --> 00:01:50.240 align:middle line:90%
It's the other way around.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.280 align:middle line:90%
Who isn't is a greater list.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.220 align:middle line:84%
Most people are
not involved in it.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.370 align:middle line:84%
The vast majority does
not involve themself

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.730 align:middle line:90%
in this kind of stuff at all.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.070 align:middle line:84%
There are only certain
levels that do,

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.850 align:middle line:84%
and we happen to be
some of those people,

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:07.810 align:middle line:90%
though it's a spectrum.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.580 align:middle line:84%
It's not a day-and-night,
black-and-white thing.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.190 align:middle line:84%
There are people
like the Greys who

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.670 align:middle line:84%
are 100% totally,
absolutely, irrevocably

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.740 align:middle line:84%
connected to the technology,
you know, the Darth Vader type

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.910 align:middle line:90%
thing that can't leave it.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And they have biologically
linked themselves in so deeply

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.870 align:middle line:84%
that they can't leave
it without dying.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.895 align:middle line:84%
And then there is this whole
spectrum going all the way

00:02:33.895 --> 00:02:38.294 align:middle line:84%
through to people like the
Sirians who are lightly into it

00:02:38.294 --> 00:02:40.210 align:middle line:84%
and to people like us
who are lightly into it.

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.840 align:middle line:90%
We still have emotional bodies.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.910 align:middle line:84%
We still are able
to love and to feel.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.360 align:middle line:84%
Where we are emerging is
we could extract ourselves

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.260 align:middle line:84%
from this, and we could get out
of it and become free again.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.980 align:middle line:84%
We're not totally
addicted to it.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.450 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is kind of on
different levels of addiction

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.943 align:middle line:90%
to all of this stuff.

00:03:03.943 --> 00:03:06.408 align:middle line:90%

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.150 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.920 align:middle line:84%
>>I thought the dolphins knew
how to create the wormhole.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.790 align:middle line:90%
>>They do.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>>I thought they
travelled through it.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.640 align:middle line:84%
>>They do now, but
a few years ago they

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.290 align:middle line:84%
did it by growing their
ships and creating

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:26.110 align:middle line:84%
these UFOs, flying ships,
that were external to them.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.895 align:middle line:90%
They were involved in it also.

00:03:27.895 --> 00:03:31.013 align:middle line:84%
It was the means that they
were able to get through

00:03:31.013 --> 00:03:33.480 align:middle line:90%
from Sirian to here.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.390 align:middle line:84%
This whole thing with
the living fuel merkabas

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.100 align:middle line:84%
is really relatively
new to them.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.740 align:middle line:84%
Considering how old they
are, this is brand new.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.155 align:middle line:84%
They've only been in it about
200 years, which is brand new,

00:03:48.155 --> 00:03:51.580 align:middle line:90%
and they're not fully extracted.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.196 align:middle line:84%
There is a part of them, which
is the humanoid aspect, which

00:03:55.196 --> 00:03:56.820 align:middle line:84%
we're going to see
that on their planet

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.980 align:middle line:84%
they've got beings
that look like that.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.105 align:middle line:84%
And they also have beings
that look like Akhenaten.

00:04:01.105 --> 00:04:03.830 align:middle line:90%


00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.630 align:middle line:84%
They have humanoid
type beings there also,

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.790 align:middle line:84%
which live on the land
part, and those are still

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.580 align:middle line:84%
involved with the
technology, though they

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.320 align:middle line:90%
are trying to get out of it.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.048 align:middle line:84%
They are really, really
trying to get out of it.

00:04:16.048 --> 00:04:19.042 align:middle line:90%
>>So when we shift, they shift.

>>Yeah, we're all
linked together.

00:04:27.194 --> 00:04:29.332 align:middle line:84%
If this shift happens
that we think,

00:04:29.332 --> 00:04:30.540 align:middle line:90%
it's definitely going to be--

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.170 align:middle line:84%
>>We're all going
to shift together.

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.110 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes, we will.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.990 align:middle line:90%
I believe so.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't really see
how we could not.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:45.130 align:middle line:84%
So they are great examples for
us because they have done it.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.040 align:middle line:90%
They've got out of there.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.960 align:middle line:84%
We can't imagine what level of
existence they're on right now

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.830 align:middle line:84%
and the joy that they've
got because they're free.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.470 align:middle line:90%
They are completely free.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:56.970 align:middle line:84%
They can just
disappear out of water

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.200 align:middle line:84%
any time they want and within
just a three-day period

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.560 align:middle line:84%
end up back on Sirius
and go back over there.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.220 align:middle line:84%
It's just a little jaunt,
hang out over there

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.170 align:middle line:90%
and come right back again.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.770 align:middle line:84%
They can move right
through space.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.940 align:middle line:84%
They can fly in space
as well as in water,

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.200 align:middle line:84%
and they have no
vehicle whatsoever.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.440 align:middle line:84%
They have just total
understanding of the Merkaba.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.815 align:middle line:84%
We could see their Merkaba
fields on the computer screens

00:05:23.815 --> 00:05:25.610 align:middle line:90%
when we were working with them.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.810 align:middle line:84%
>>Drunvalo, you spoke yesterday
on the polluted oceans

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.270 align:middle line:84%
and the dolphins
being evolved beings.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:42.060 align:middle line:84%
What effect are they having on
the oceans or of light aspect,

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:47.290 align:middle line:84%
and how are the polluted
oceans affecting them?

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.060 align:middle line:84%
>>The oceans are affecting
them pretty strongly,

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.080 align:middle line:84%
and they know that
we are the problem.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.975 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the
reason why they

00:05:57.975 --> 00:05:59.950 align:middle line:84%
are trying to
communicate with us

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.035 align:middle line:84%
and to help change
the situation.

00:06:04.035 --> 00:06:07.312 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.312 --> 00:06:09.020 align:middle line:84%
The whales, for example,
which are really

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.100 align:middle line:84%
the real powerful
beings in this world,

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.786 align:middle line:84%
prior to about
1950 or so, '56-- I

00:06:16.786 --> 00:06:20.560 align:middle line:84%
don't remember what it was--
no human being or country

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.937 align:middle line:84%
or anyone had ever captured
a killer whale alive.

00:06:23.937 --> 00:06:24.770 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't do it.

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.010 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't get the
nets that could hold them,

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.350 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly in one
year, six of these killer

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:32.897 align:middle line:84%
whales just come up the ships
and sit there, kind of wag

00:06:32.897 --> 00:06:38.410 align:middle line:84%
their tales and allow themselves
to be taken into captivity.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And this was when
the cetaceans began

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.860 align:middle line:84%
to try to make
communication with us

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:52.130 align:middle line:84%
and try to heal us
through their examples.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.720 align:middle line:84%
You know, the dolphins come up,
and all they do is just say,

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.520 align:middle line:90%
it's love.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.245 align:middle line:90%
It's all love.

00:06:57.245 --> 00:06:58.060 align:middle line:90%
It's joy.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.110 align:middle line:90%
Have a good time, you know?

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And they're giving the
example by themselves,

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.830 align:middle line:84%
and their examples are
definitely affecting us.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.165 align:middle line:90%
We're beginning to understand.

00:07:10.165 --> 00:07:16.420 align:middle line:90%


00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.600 align:middle line:90%
I had a friend, Dr. Paul Spong.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:25.590 align:middle line:84%
Just to show you the
whales and the dolphins

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:30.520 align:middle line:84%
are in very high
level communication,

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Paul Spong was trained at a
college to be a whale trainer,

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.380 align:middle line:84%
and he became the whale
trainer at the Vancouver Zoo.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And he started training
this killer whale there.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.810 align:middle line:84%
But then after about
a year, he began

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:51.680 align:middle line:84%
to realize that the
whale was training him.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.930 align:middle line:90%
It became real obvious to him.

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.410 align:middle line:90%
He says, wait a minute.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:58.065 align:middle line:84%
The whales actually,
you know, are

00:07:58.065 --> 00:08:01.270 align:middle line:84%
having more influence on his
life than he is having on them.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:09.012 align:middle line:84%
And the whale got him to
tell him about all the whales

00:08:09.012 --> 00:08:10.720 align:middle line:84%
that were being killed
all over the world

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:15.780 align:middle line:84%
and started to influence him to
stop the whaling in the world.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:16.580 align:middle line:90%
So what did he do?

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.350 align:middle line:90%
He started Greenpeace.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:19.827 align:middle line:84%
He was the founder
of Greenpeace.

00:08:19.827 --> 00:08:21.910 align:middle line:84%
He got the six people
together, at this one table,

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.060 align:middle line:84%
which I got to introduce with
each one of these people,

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.489 align:middle line:84%
and got them to go out
and start this movement.

00:08:28.489 --> 00:08:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And he went out on these ships,
and he'd been arrested, like,

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:31.831 align:middle line:90%
100 times.

00:08:31.831 --> 00:08:33.289 align:middle line:84%
He'd go out in
these ships and just

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:35.841 align:middle line:90%
start shutting down everything.

00:08:35.841 --> 00:08:37.840 align:middle line:84%
But they aggressively
tried to get them to stop,

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:38.673 align:middle line:90%
and, yeah, they did.

00:08:38.673 --> 00:08:40.555 align:middle line:84%
They eventually got
stopped the whaling in I

00:08:40.555 --> 00:08:41.805 align:middle line:90%
don't know how many countries.

00:08:41.805 --> 00:08:44.460 align:middle line:84%
There's, like, lots and lots
of countries that Greenpeace

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.540 align:middle line:90%
has stopped all of this on.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And one day he came to me and
he said the whales told him--

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.410 align:middle line:84%
he says he believed that he
was in direct communication

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:57.470 align:middle line:84%
with them telepathically, that
he could just talk to them.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:00.475 align:middle line:84%
He could tell them in his
head to do any of the things

00:09:00.475 --> 00:09:02.100 align:middle line:84%
that he wanted them
to do in the water,

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.580 align:middle line:90%
and they would just do it.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:07.275 align:middle line:84%
And he got to the place
where he just knew

00:09:07.275 --> 00:09:09.830 align:middle line:90%
that it was just like talking.

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And they told him that
there was no such thing

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:17.162 align:middle line:84%
as an individual whale
or an individual dolphin

00:09:17.162 --> 00:09:18.620 align:middle line:84%
in the world, that
they were really

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:22.680 align:middle line:84%
cells in a larger
body of consciousness,

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.169 align:middle line:90%
and that communication occurred.

00:09:26.169 --> 00:09:28.460 align:middle line:84%
If there was a dolphin, there
only needed to be another

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:32.200 align:middle line:84%
dolphin within a
1,000-mile radius,

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.660 align:middle line:84%
and that dolphin could
communicate to the whole

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.910 align:middle line:90%
through that one.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:40.640 align:middle line:84%
They did have a 1,000-mile
limit in their communication,

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.990 align:middle line:84%
and this whale wanted
to prove this to him.

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:46.780 align:middle line:84%
He says, I will prove to
you that this is true,

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.320 align:middle line:84%
so he asked me if he
could have my house.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:53.450 align:middle line:84%
I had a house 450 miles inland
in this place called Kootenai

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:58.310 align:middle line:84%
Lake, and he says, can I borrow
your house for the winter?

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:01.070 align:middle line:90%
So I gave it to him.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And he went in, and he was going
to set up a sensory deprivation

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.280 align:middle line:84%
tank to float in there
to get still enough to be

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.900 align:middle line:90%
able to make the communication.

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.280 align:middle line:84%
But he never even
put it together,

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:19.570 align:middle line:84%
and so I came back a few months,
three or four months later.

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And he had removed a
few walls in my house--

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:28.345 align:middle line:84%
it was a funny feeling, I'll
tell ya-- and put these windows

00:10:28.345 --> 00:10:30.320 align:middle line:84%
there that weren't
there before and things.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.285 align:middle line:84%
It was really beautiful,
but it was shocking.

00:10:32.285 --> 00:10:36.890 align:middle line:90%


00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:39.005 align:middle line:84%
And he had still
not made contact.

00:10:39.005 --> 00:10:40.270 align:middle line:90%
He said, I need more time.

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:41.130 align:middle line:90%
I need more time.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:43.205 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, OK,
so then I was there.

00:10:43.205 --> 00:10:45.080 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, we were
all living together.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Him and his wife were living
there, and me and my wife

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:50.630 align:middle line:90%
were living there, and my kids.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And about two weeks later--
who knows Dr. Paul Spong?

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:58.745 align:middle line:90%
Do you know Paul Spong?

00:10:58.745 --> 00:11:00.950 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, he's got kind
of short hair now,

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:03.170 align:middle line:84%
and he looks very kind
of professional-like.

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:06.790 align:middle line:84%
But he used to have really long
hair and a really long beard

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:08.030 align:middle line:90%
in those days.

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And he came into the room one
morning after about two weeks,

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:16.606 align:middle line:84%
and he had shaved his beard
off on one side of his head

00:11:16.606 --> 00:11:18.860 align:middle line:84%
and cut the hair short
on one side of his head.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.644 align:middle line:90%


00:11:21.644 --> 00:11:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And I said to Paul, Paul,
I know something's up.

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:32.314 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure of it.

00:11:32.314 --> 00:11:35.042 align:middle line:84%
And he says, yeah, I
made contact last night.

00:11:35.042 --> 00:11:37.611 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I'm
sure that I did it.

00:11:37.611 --> 00:11:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And he says, they
told me that I was

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:43.580 align:middle line:84%
going to be a large influence
in the world and all of this

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:46.800 align:middle line:84%
and that I had to
look respectable.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.525 align:middle line:84%
And he says, so today
is my transition day.

00:11:49.525 --> 00:11:52.854 align:middle line:90%


00:11:52.854 --> 00:11:55.260 align:middle line:84%
So for about a day, he
walked around half and half,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.710 align:middle line:84%
and then the next day he
shaved off the other side.

00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:00.315 align:middle line:84%
And what they told
him was is the way

00:12:00.315 --> 00:12:01.940 align:middle line:84%
they were going to
prove it was he said

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:05.935 align:middle line:84%
that he was to go to this
bay north of Vancouver,

00:12:05.935 --> 00:12:08.500 align:middle line:90%
a very specific spot.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And he was to go there with
video equipment and everything

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:17.370 align:middle line:84%
so that he could prove
what was about to happen.

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:19.810 align:middle line:84%
He had a whole group of
people that worked with him.

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:23.110 align:middle line:84%
He was to tell them what was
to happen so that it would be,

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:28.090 align:middle line:84%
like, no backing out of
this whole thing and that

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:30.550 align:middle line:84%
on a certain day at a
certain time-- which I think

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:32.942 align:middle line:84%
it was 12:00 noon on
a certain day-- all

00:12:32.942 --> 00:12:34.900 align:middle line:84%
the whales, of which
there were about a hundred

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:38.520 align:middle line:84%
of them of this certain species
would come into this bay,

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.905 align:middle line:84%
would swim up to the shoreline,
lift out of the water,

00:12:41.905 --> 00:12:45.490 align:middle line:90%
and look him in the eyes.

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what happened.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:50.364 align:middle line:84%
He went up there
with about 30 people,

00:12:50.364 --> 00:12:52.821 align:middle line:84%
and they put their microphones
in the water and everything.

00:12:52.821 --> 00:12:55.315 align:middle line:84%
And they sat around, and
they waited for this time.

00:12:55.315 --> 00:12:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And, sure enough,
all these whales

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.120 align:middle line:84%
came swimming up to
the shore, lifted out,

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.280 align:middle line:90%
and looked him in the eyes.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And obviously he was
never the same after that.

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:11.740 align:middle line:84%
He started the Orca Lab, which
was started in that very spot,

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:15.670 align:middle line:84%
and he's totally been
emerged into whale research

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:18.481 align:middle line:84%
ever since then on
his own, not using

00:13:18.481 --> 00:13:20.230 align:middle line:84%
through the government's
or anything else,

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:21.890 align:middle line:90%
like he did before.

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:23.870 align:middle line:90%
And he spends all his time.

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:26.190 align:middle line:84%
I taught him how to
play the silver flute,

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.790 align:middle line:84%
and he spends all his time
out in canoes with them,

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:31.720 align:middle line:84%
playing flutes to them and
communicating with them,

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.170 align:middle line:84%
that he has now
learned how to do.

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:36.700 align:middle line:90%


00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And so the whales, they
have an extraordinary level

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:43.760 align:middle line:90%
of awareness.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:48.110 align:middle line:90%
We can't really talk about it.

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:50.890 align:middle line:84%
Later, I'm going
to try to tell you

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:52.990 align:middle line:84%
when I talk about the
electromagnetic spectrum

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:54.440 align:middle line:84%
and light and all of these
other kinds of things

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.356 align:middle line:90%
when we get into this.

00:13:55.356 --> 00:13:57.850 align:middle line:90%


00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Like, right now, we're
looking at just a little,

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.010 align:middle line:84%
tiny sliver of the
electromagnetic spectrum

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:07.680 align:middle line:84%
which we call light,
which we receive about 90%

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.850 align:middle line:84%
of our information
from, and then you

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:12.780 align:middle line:84%
get a little bit of
information from sound.

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And those two things,
which are also

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:19.060 align:middle line:84%
another little, tiny sliver of
the electromagnetic spectrum,

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:23.530 align:middle line:84%
and those two things are where
we get almost all of our input

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.320 align:middle line:90%
into the world.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.560 align:middle line:90%
But the dolphins are 100%.

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:31.400 align:middle line:84%
They see the entire
electromagnetic spectrum,

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.220 align:middle line:84%
which is a world
you wouldn't believe

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.670 align:middle line:90%
if you could see it all.

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:36.470 align:middle line:90%
It's here.

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:42.460 align:middle line:90%
We're just about blind almost.

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:45.395 align:middle line:84%
We don't really see
much, and so they

00:14:45.395 --> 00:14:48.970 align:middle line:84%
are in really another world,
another dimensional level

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:56.720 align:middle line:84%
of experience that
we're not there yet.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.180 align:middle line:90%
But we will be.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:00.115 align:middle line:84%
Dolphins are
conscious breathers.

00:15:00.115 --> 00:15:04.360 align:middle line:90%


00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.690 align:middle line:84%
If they do not purposely
decide to take a breath,

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:10.260 align:middle line:90%
they will die.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:16.190 align:middle line:84%
They have no automatic
breathing system in them at all,

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:18.883 align:middle line:84%
and so they don't
sleep like we sleep.

00:15:18.883 --> 00:15:22.480 align:middle line:90%
In fact, they don't sleep.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.275 align:middle line:84%
They have a different
mechanism, which

00:15:24.275 --> 00:15:26.150 align:middle line:84%
I guess I'll describe
real quickly right now.

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:30.090 align:middle line:90%


00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:34.990 align:middle line:84%
When we go to sleep at
night, first of all,

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:38.300 align:middle line:84%
we are either usually on the
left side or the right side.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.080 align:middle line:84%
Hardly anybody's got both
sides going on at once.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.260 align:middle line:84%
We use only one side or the
other, and of that side,

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:49.300 align:middle line:84%
we are maybe 5% or 10% of
that side is functioning.

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.110 align:middle line:84%
100% of one side and about
90% of the other side

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:53.710 align:middle line:90%
is unconscious.

00:15:53.710 --> 00:16:00.880 align:middle line:84%
It's not functioning, so we're
almost an unconscious being.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.840 align:middle line:84%
But we're even more than that
from a dolphin perspective

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:07.314 align:middle line:84%
because what they do is
they come into a circle,

00:16:07.314 --> 00:16:09.730 align:middle line:84%
like I talked about with the
whales when they go to sleep.

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:11.480 align:middle line:84%
They all point their
noses together,

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.900 align:middle line:84%
floating on the surface,
and they begin to rotate.

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.420 align:middle line:90%


00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure which way
they rotate actually.

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:21.570 align:middle line:90%
They begin to rotate around.

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:24.417 align:middle line:90%


00:16:24.417 --> 00:16:26.250 align:middle line:84%
You said they would
rotate counterclockwise.

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:26.845 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you said?

00:16:26.845 --> 00:16:28.600 align:middle line:84%
>>Most of the time,
counterclockwise.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:32.730 align:middle line:84%
>>Counterclockwise,
OK, and they start

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:35.320 align:middle line:90%
rotating counterclockwise.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And then at one point,
one of them takes a breath

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.630 align:middle line:84%
and goes in the water,
and then they're

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:43.290 align:middle line:84%
followed by the next one,
followed by the next one,

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:46.260 align:middle line:84%
forming this helical
pattern as they're

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:47.635 align:middle line:90%
going down into the water.

00:16:47.635 --> 00:16:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's copying
where they would

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:52.160 align:middle line:84%
be on the top of the
circle as they keep

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.880 align:middle line:90%
moving down into the water.

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:56.630 align:middle line:84%
But as they take this
breath and go down in,

00:16:56.630 --> 00:17:02.132 align:middle line:84%
the dolphins have both sides
of their brain on 100%.

00:17:02.132 --> 00:17:03.840 align:middle line:84%
So even though they've
got a brain that's

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.119 align:middle line:84%
about 350 grams
bigger than ours,

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:09.005 align:middle line:84%
it's really a lot
bigger than ours

00:17:09.005 --> 00:17:10.630 align:middle line:84%
because they've got
the whole thing on.

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:14.280 align:middle line:90%


00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:20.690 align:middle line:84%
We've got a 1,500-gram brain,
and that's functioning on about

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:22.040 align:middle line:90%
30 grams or something.

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.740 align:middle line:90%
It's not a lot.

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And so they started
coming down in here.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.030 align:middle line:84%
They turn off one
side of their brain

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:32.370 align:middle line:90%
and leave the other side on.

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:34.490 align:middle line:90%
That's called sleep.

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:36.699 align:middle line:84%
And so they come down here,
and then when they either

00:17:36.699 --> 00:17:38.906 align:middle line:84%
get to the bottom, or when
they get back to the top--

00:17:38.906 --> 00:17:41.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't know from the
research that I've read.

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.690 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember anymore.

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:48.210 align:middle line:84%
But when they get down at the
bottom-- where they turn this

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:49.010 align:middle line:90%
off, I don't know.

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:51.184 align:middle line:90%
They then start coming back up.

00:17:51.184 --> 00:17:53.600 align:middle line:84%
As the other ones are coming
down, they're coming back up,

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.197 align:middle line:84%
forming a double
helical pattern,

00:17:56.197 --> 00:17:58.530 align:middle line:84%
coming back up until they
match back up in the circling.

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:00.565 align:middle line:84%
When they get at
the top-- let's say

00:18:00.565 --> 00:18:04.968 align:middle line:84%
it's up there-- they
switch sides the brain so

00:18:04.968 --> 00:18:06.429 align:middle line:90%
that the other side can rest.

00:18:06.429 --> 00:18:11.300 align:middle line:84%
It allows one side to rest
with every other breath.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.770 align:middle line:84%
It's a very slow
delta, you would say,

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:17.500 align:middle line:84%
if you know how
delta and theta work.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:20.385 align:middle line:84%
Delta sleeping state,
really, we're just

00:18:20.385 --> 00:18:23.190 align:middle line:84%
going back and forth, turning
off one side of our brain,

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:25.875 align:middle line:84%
turning on the other, but
it's at a rate about like--

00:18:25.875 --> 00:18:28.785 align:middle line:90%
[CLICKING LIKE A CLOCK]

00:18:28.785 --> 00:18:31.210 align:middle line:90%


00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:35.480 align:middle line:84%
About like that is what we're
doing when we're asleep,

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:39.760 align:middle line:84%
and they're just
doing it much slower.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And so when a dolphin
looks at a human being,

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:46.320 align:middle line:84%
we're all sleeping
because we have one

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.560 align:middle line:90%
side of our brain turned off.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.837 align:middle line:90%
