00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.409 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:17.070 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.270 align:middle line:84%
>>OK, I'm going to,
I guess, in order

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.230 align:middle line:84%
to make this work-- nope, I can
go a little bit further here,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.182 align:middle line:90%
a little bit further.

00:00:26.182 --> 00:00:29.040 align:middle line:90%


00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.550 align:middle line:84%
OK, the other question was
what is it about this time

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.405 align:middle line:84%
in 1992 or approximately
this time, that

00:00:37.405 --> 00:00:41.785 align:middle line:84%
is causing this acceleration
in knowledge and growth

00:00:41.785 --> 00:00:44.180 align:middle line:84%
and everything is happening
here, this awakening that's

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.400 align:middle line:90%
taking place?

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's tied in,
according to Thoth

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.080 align:middle line:84%
and also according to the
Hindus and also according

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.830 align:middle line:84%
to the Egyptians,
and ancient Sanskrit

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:58.260 align:middle line:84%
says the same thing, with a
wobble in the earth's axis.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.810 align:middle line:84%
If this was the
axis of the Earth,

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.700 align:middle line:84%
there's a wobble in
it and that wobble,

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.160 align:middle line:84%
like I described before,
the primary one, there's

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.240 align:middle line:84%
other ones, that are called the
precession of the equinoxes.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.100 align:middle line:84%
So if you were to look at
that wobble at any moment,

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.324 align:middle line:84%
it forms an elliptical
pattern on one end.

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
elliptical pattern

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.870 align:middle line:90%
that I'm putting up there.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:18.850 align:middle line:90%
This is what happens.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.910 align:middle line:84%
Right now, here's moving
around, like this.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.480 align:middle line:90%
This is the wobble.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.360 align:middle line:90%
Freeze it at any one moment, OK?

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.160 align:middle line:90%
It's frozen there.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.710 align:middle line:90%


00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And that angle, if
it was from 1992,

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.220 align:middle line:84%
it would be
approximately 23 degrees.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.270 align:middle line:90%
Our sun is over here.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.970 align:middle line:84%
We move like this
around the sun.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.790 align:middle line:84%
So as we move around
the sun, the angle

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.225 align:middle line:84%
to the earth facing the sun
changes and so the light

00:01:47.225 --> 00:01:48.766 align:middle line:84%
strikes the Earth
differently and you

00:01:48.766 --> 00:01:51.970 align:middle line:84%
get your four different seasons
depending on where you are.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.510 align:middle line:84%
But slowly, this angle
will keep changing.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And so, over time, as
this moves around the sun,

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.010 align:middle line:90%
we get a different pattern.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And slowly, this
point aims to all 12

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.790 align:middle line:84%
of the different constellations
as it goes around over one

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.699 align:middle line:90%
time, over 26,000 years.

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:15.120 align:middle line:84%
The actual angle itself
rocks back and forth

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.620 align:middle line:84%
over approximately, I think,
it's a 40,000 year cycle.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And it goes from about
23-something to about 26

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.420 align:middle line:90%
and 1/2 or something degrees.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.130 align:middle line:84%
So you get another
angle in there.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.544 align:middle line:84%
Then inside that, you've
got another little wobble.

00:02:27.544 --> 00:02:29.210 align:middle line:84%
So as this one's going
around like that,

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.835 align:middle line:84%
you've got another
little-- it's really

00:02:30.835 --> 00:02:34.500 align:middle line:84%
doing a thing like this,
which is about every 14 years.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And then inside that one, you've
got another little tiny one

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.380 align:middle line:90%
that does it every 14 months.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.934 align:middle line:84%
And then, I think, they've
now discovered a new one

00:02:42.934 --> 00:02:44.850 align:middle line:84%
that they're all talking
about and they're all

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.950 align:middle line:84%
excited about where there's
another wobble inside of all

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.670 align:middle line:90%
these other wobbles.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's just the influences of
all the gravitational fields.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:53.740 align:middle line:90%
They're all over.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.420 align:middle line:84%
At least, probably
that's what it is.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.260 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, going back, just the
precession of the equinoxes.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.100 align:middle line:84%
What the ancients
have said, and you

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.940 align:middle line:84%
can read this in the
Sanskrit writings,

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.920 align:middle line:84%
and you can read it even in more
modern day Tibetan and Hindu

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:19.480 align:middle line:84%
philosophies, is that if this
was the wobble seen from above

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.000 align:middle line:84%
and this was when this-- when
it's pointing as the wobble

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.710 align:middle line:84%
comes around, there is a
place where that is pointing

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:29.880 align:middle line:90%
to the center of the galaxy.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.590 align:middle line:90%


00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And that is different than
when it's pointing away

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.510 align:middle line:90%
from the center of the galaxy.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.050 align:middle line:90%
The galaxy was toward that door.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.354 align:middle line:84%
And so, what the
ancients-- so here's

00:03:43.354 --> 00:03:45.270 align:middle line:84%
that point where it's
at center of the galaxy,

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.430 align:middle line:84%
and there's the
point away from it,

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.020 align:middle line:84%
or you could say
when it's pointing

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.665 align:middle line:84%
toward the galactic wind or
away from the galactic wind.

00:03:51.665 --> 00:03:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And what they've
discovered, it's

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.640 align:middle line:84%
not here, but about
900 years on either

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.950 align:middle line:84%
side that there is this
amazing thing that takes place.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And, in essence, we fall
asleep coming down this side,

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.330 align:middle line:84%
and then very
quickly [FINGER SNAP]

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.790 align:middle line:90%
like that, we wake up.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.215 align:middle line:84%
Just pretty quickly, like
relative to a 24-hour period,

00:04:15.215 --> 00:04:17.089 align:middle line:84%
your wake-up period, at
least, for most of us

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.040 align:middle line:90%
unless we got [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Some of us take two
hours to wake up

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.510 align:middle line:84%
but most people
wake up and get up.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And if you do, that would
be just [FINGER SNAP]

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.560 align:middle line:84%
a click of the finger
relative to your 24-hour day.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.380 align:middle line:90%
We wake up very quickly.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.810 align:middle line:90%
In fact, it's usually one year.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.180 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's really
down to 24 hours.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.006 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's really
only about 20 hours long,

00:04:40.006 --> 00:04:41.880 align:middle line:84%
the primary wake-up
time, and the whole thing

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.290 align:middle line:90%
is about three and a half days.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And we wake up and then we go
through a series of awakenings

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.490 align:middle line:84%
all the way up to
this point again.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And then we fall
back asleep again,

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.650 align:middle line:90%
and then we wake up again.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.110 align:middle line:84%
So there's a dark
side and a light side.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.360 align:middle line:84%
It's just the
image of the Earth.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.340 align:middle line:84%
The earth is dark--
half of it's dark on one

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.560 align:middle line:90%
side and half of it's light.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And the side that's dark
is pretty much asleep.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And the side that's light
is pretty much awake

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.030 align:middle line:90%
at any particular moment.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:18.110 align:middle line:90%


00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Only, we do this in stages, and
these stages are called yugas.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.430 align:middle line:84%
There's very specific
periods in there

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.603 align:middle line:84%
where you awaken and you
fall asleep and such.

00:05:28.603 --> 00:05:30.311 align:middle line:84%
And there's much more
to it because there

00:05:30.311 --> 00:05:33.540 align:middle line:84%
are dimensional levels
connected to all of this.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.360 align:middle line:84%
We have always
assumed that time is

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:45.550 align:middle line:84%
linear in the past of the Earth
and it isn't linear at all.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And without truly understanding
the nature of time

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.000 align:middle line:84%
and the nature of the dimensions
and what is happening there,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.040 align:middle line:84%
to try to date something
is just ridiculous.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.031 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to do
with anything at all

00:06:00.031 --> 00:06:04.350 align:middle line:90%
but we do it anyway.

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:13.220 align:middle line:84%
So and to be clear here,
right at this moment in 1990,

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:20.100 align:middle line:84%
1991, 1992, we're sitting
right there in the orbit.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:27.830 align:middle line:84%
We're sitting right on that
place between being asleep

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:28.900 align:middle line:90%
and waking up.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.285 align:middle line:90%
We're sitting right at sunrise.

00:06:30.285 --> 00:06:33.230 align:middle line:90%


00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was the male
that kept us alive

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.580 align:middle line:84%
and protected us
into the darkness.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.120 align:middle line:84%
It's now been shifted
to the female,

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.030 align:middle line:84%
and the female will take
us back into the light.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And, again, the male
will protect us back

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.010 align:middle line:90%
into the darkness.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is not a static
circle repeating itself

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:52.710 align:middle line:90%
like a phonograph record.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.120 align:middle line:90%
This is a piece of a helix.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.740 align:middle line:84%
So every time we fall
asleep and when we wake up,

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.740 align:middle line:84%
we wake up a little
bit more and hopefully,

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.310 align:middle line:90%
don't fall quite as asleep.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:07.380 align:middle line:84%
We wake up a little bit more
each time repeating this.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:14.320 align:middle line:84%
Only thing is is that last
time-- we're here right now.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.290 align:middle line:84%
When we come back to just
here, just 13,000 years ago,

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:19.720 align:middle line:84%
a little less than
that, right there,

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.350 align:middle line:84%
something happened that
when we fell asleep,

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:25.570 align:middle line:84%
we went more than asleep,
we went unconscious.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.730 align:middle line:90%


00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:30.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we, I want
to say got a big blow

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.490 align:middle line:90%
on the top of the head.

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.340 align:middle line:84%
Something dramatically
happened, which

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to describe
in just a little bit.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.224 align:middle line:84%
It actually started
about 16,000 years ago,

00:07:39.224 --> 00:07:40.765 align:middle line:84%
the result that
happened here and I'm

00:07:40.765 --> 00:07:43.230 align:middle line:84%
going to spend a lot of time
explaining what happened.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:46.675 align:middle line:84%
When you know this image
here and you apply it

00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:49.100 align:middle line:84%
to the history of the Earth
and you look at the archeology

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.930 align:middle line:84%
and what happened
and all those things,

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.660 align:middle line:90%
it will make perfect sense.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.640 align:middle line:84%
Without understanding this, you
cannot understand archeology.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Cannot possibly understand
why the Egyptian culture,

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:04.300 align:middle line:84%
which started right about in
here would come out in full

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:09.310 align:middle line:84%
bloom in its greatest
glory and then go downhill.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:13.140 align:middle line:84%
Why the Sumerians went downhill,
the Babylonians went downhill,

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.380 align:middle line:90%
the Arcadians went downhill.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:19.410 align:middle line:84%
The oldest part always being
the clearest, most intelligent,

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:22.059 align:middle line:84%
most awake part of the
culture and systematically

00:08:22.059 --> 00:08:24.600 align:middle line:84%
going worse and worse and worse
and worse and worse and worse

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.950 align:middle line:90%
until they just died out.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's because
they were falling

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.170 align:middle line:84%
more and more and
more and more sleep

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:33.280 align:middle line:84%
and this is the
most asleep time.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.030 align:middle line:90%
This is called the Kali Yuga.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:39.250 align:middle line:84%
These are the yugas,
Hindu philosophy.

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:41.020 align:middle line:84%
This part of the yuga
is called the Satya.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.140 align:middle line:84%
There's the descending
and ascending yugas.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:48.960 align:middle line:84%
This is the Satya, the Treta,
the Dwapara, and the Kali Yuga.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got a decent, an
ascending Kali, Dwapara, Treta,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.060 align:middle line:90%
and Satya Yuga.

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
Kali Yuga down here.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:05.540 align:middle line:84%
It's about, roughly a
couple thousand years long.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.799 align:middle line:84%
They put them at
different lengths of time.

00:09:08.799 --> 00:09:10.340 align:middle line:84%
There's a period in
here that we just

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.990 align:middle line:84%
came out of just 900 years
ago where we were just

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.490 align:middle line:90%
sound asleep and snoring.

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:17.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, I
mean, they call it

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.040 align:middle line:90%
the Dark Ages and everything.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:19.840 align:middle line:90%
It really was.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.000 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we were just sleep.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.020 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know
what we were doing.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:24.812 align:middle line:84%
There's all these
people running around.

00:09:24.812 --> 00:09:26.186 align:middle line:84%
All the books and
everything that

00:09:26.186 --> 00:09:28.280 align:middle line:84%
were written during
that time, they

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.310 align:middle line:84%
were written by people
who weren't awake.

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:32.750 align:middle line:84%
Gotta be really careful about
anything that was written

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:36.810 align:middle line:90%
in the last 2,000 years.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And there was a lot of
secrecy that was done.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.450 align:middle line:84%
They knew that the people
that were kind of awake

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:47.480 align:middle line:84%
knew that we weren't in
position yet for us to wake up

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.400 align:middle line:84%
and so the people
that were keeping,

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.490 align:middle line:84%
that had some kind of
awareness, would keep things

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.250 align:middle line:84%
and they would
put it in secrecy.

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.530 align:middle line:84%
They would write
it down purposely

00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:00.720 align:middle line:84%
incorrect so that if
anybody got a hold of it--

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.550 align:middle line:84%
but their school, they would
tell them what the key was.

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:06.670 align:middle line:90%
But then those books survived.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Then we read these
books and we think,

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:12.160 align:middle line:84%
well, this must be how it is
when it was a lie to begin with

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.190 align:middle line:84%
or they didn't even understand
what the heck it was.

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:17.390 align:middle line:84%
Somebody was talking about
the yugas, lot of people,

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:19.934 align:middle line:84%
especially Hindus put some
these yugas at 100,000,

00:10:19.934 --> 00:10:23.340 align:middle line:84%
150,000, 200,000
years when they're

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:27.930 align:middle line:84%
talking about a cycle that's
only 26,000 years long.

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:29.560 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't know that.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.530 align:middle line:84%
They didn't even understand
what the patterns

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:33.590 align:middle line:90%
were that were underneath it.

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:37.790 align:middle line:84%
There was some Hindus that knew
what they were talking about.

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:42.650 align:middle line:10%
One of them was Sri Yukteswar,
who was Yogananda's guru.

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:45.460 align:middle line:10%
He put the cycle
at 24,000 years,

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:49.790 align:middle line:10%
which considering where they
were at that point, that

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:51.205 align:middle line:10%
was really pretty good.

00:10:51.205 --> 00:10:55.440 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's only off by
800 or 900 years on each side

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.460 align:middle line:90%
and that was pretty good.

00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.330 align:middle line:84%
But look what-- there's
one thing I want

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.550 align:middle line:90%
you to notice about this one.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:05.750 align:middle line:84%
Here he has the
yugas on the outside.

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:09.420 align:middle line:84%
Here's the nearest point to
the galaxy, the distance point.

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.150 align:middle line:84%
He's got us put
right here, only this

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:12.590 align:middle line:90%
was done in the late 1800s.

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:15.110 align:middle line:84%
So we're not exactly
in place, yet.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And inside here, he
has the constellations

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:19.770 align:middle line:84%
because the precession points
to all 12 of the constellations

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:21.230 align:middle line:90%
as it moves around.

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:22.800 align:middle line:84%
So you can tie
the constellations

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.270 align:middle line:84%
to the yugas, which
is what he did here.

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And now, where we sit at
this moment, he has us here,

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:32.510 align:middle line:84%
but where we are right now
is this line right here

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:34.380 align:middle line:90%
between Virgo and Leo.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:36.330 align:middle line:84%
We're right on the
line and depending

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.291 align:middle line:84%
on the astrologer
that you talk to,

00:11:38.291 --> 00:11:40.290 align:middle line:84%
everybody has different
ideas about these things

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:45.970 align:middle line:84%
and where you're starting
from, but many of them

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:49.350 align:middle line:84%
see us physically, we're
talking about physically,

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.530 align:middle line:90%
right in between Virgo and Leo.

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:55.060 align:middle line:90%


00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:58.260 align:middle line:84%
Some see us in the third
eye of the virgin, which

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:03.030 align:middle line:84%
is that place right in
the middle between them.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:05.000 align:middle line:84%
But that's physically
in the order.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.320 align:middle line:84%
But if you were to look
out across the heavens,

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.355 align:middle line:84%
you see us going from
Pisces into Aquarius.

00:12:11.355 --> 00:12:15.200 align:middle line:90%


00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.320 align:middle line:84%
So we're moving from--
we're right on that line

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.750 align:middle line:90%
between Pisces and Aquarius.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:21.560 align:middle line:84%
We're about to move into
the new age of Aquarius.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.320 align:middle line:84%
That's not just a song,
it's literally the truth.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.500 align:middle line:90%


00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.430 align:middle line:84%
But this Virgo-Leo
is real interesting

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:33.590 align:middle line:84%
when we start looking at
the Egyptian artifacts

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:34.990 align:middle line:90%
and the whole thing.

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And you look at
the Sphinx, which

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:40.260 align:middle line:90%
was half virgin and half lion.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.060 align:middle line:10%
And when you see
that there is one

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:45.190 align:middle line:10%
of these calendars in the
sand from the air, three

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:49.570 align:middle line:10%
miles in diameter, marking
all this stuff on the ground,

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:52.070 align:middle line:10%
invisibly but clearly.

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:57.000 align:middle line:10%
And when you calculate all
that back and you put all the--

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.810 align:middle line:10%
we're going to do this
a little bit later.

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:02.420 align:middle line:10%
And where the Sphinx
physically is sitting on there,

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:05.550 align:middle line:10%
right in between Virgo and Leo.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And the Sphinx
originally was a female

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:12.410 align:middle line:84%
though many people
think now it's a male.

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:16.700 align:middle line:84%
Because for awhile, they changed
it and they put a beard on it,

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:17.850 align:middle line:90%
but the beard fell off.

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:20.185 align:middle line:84%
But they changed the
outer look of the face

00:13:20.185 --> 00:13:22.050 align:middle line:84%
to look more like a
male but originally,

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:23.680 align:middle line:84%
according to all the
ancient writings,

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.770 align:middle line:84%
was that it was a
female and a lion.

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:34.730 align:middle line:84%
So this understanding
here of the precession

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:39.940 align:middle line:84%
of the equinoxes and
the astrological signs,

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:43.460 align:middle line:84%
it's real important
to understand

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:48.390 align:middle line:84%
why this moment of 1990s is
so important because we're

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:51.710 align:middle line:84%
in that place right when
the sun's coming up.

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:53.965 align:middle line:84%
And you can read about in
the ancient Sanskrit, how

00:13:53.965 --> 00:13:57.080 align:middle line:84%
they talk of-- they describe
each of the yugas, what happens

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.970 align:middle line:84%
to us normally as we fall
asleep and we wake up

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:01.750 align:middle line:90%
in each one of these things.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And when they talk about
coming into the Dwapara Yuga

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:05.820 align:middle line:84%
where we are right
now, they talk

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.830 align:middle line:84%
about how we start becoming
involved in inventions.

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:10.600 align:middle line:84%
They even talk
about electricity.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.494 align:middle line:84%
They even talk about flying
in the sky and the airplanes

00:14:14.494 --> 00:14:16.660 align:middle line:84%
and all this stuff that
we've become involved in all

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.140 align:middle line:90%
this technology and everything.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And then they draw this
line down the middle

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:23.390 align:middle line:90%
and suddenly we throw it away.

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:26.590 align:middle line:90%
We throw it out the window.

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
is, at this point,

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:32.590 align:middle line:84%
is when we-- these become
like toys to children,

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:37.230 align:middle line:84%
our cars and our all this
stuff, because we wake up

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:44.440 align:middle line:84%
and we come into the awareness
that we can do anything

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.370 align:middle line:84%
that technology can do
from within ourselves

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:50.820 align:middle line:90%
and we don't need it anymore.

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And a whole new level
of human experience

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.860 align:middle line:84%
takes off from this
point on, which

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.710 align:middle line:90%
is where we are right now.

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:00.831 align:middle line:84%
We'll all, we'll experience
this in our lifetimes.

00:15:00.831 --> 00:15:04.180 align:middle line:90%


00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>>On the progression
of the equinoxes,

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:09.390 align:middle line:84%
what is the reason that we have
to keep going through the going

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:10.460 align:middle line:90%
asleep period?

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:12.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know that we
have to go through that--

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:14.075 align:middle line:84%
>>Why do you go
to sleep at night?

00:15:14.075 --> 00:15:17.350 align:middle line:90%


00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:19.825 align:middle line:84%
>>I guess to reconnect with
that other part of the,

00:15:19.825 --> 00:15:21.280 align:middle line:90%
that other part.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:26.060 align:middle line:84%
>>It seems to be part
of us that we need to,

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.680 align:middle line:84%
when we're reaching
out into something

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.930 align:middle line:84%
that, into the unknown it's
like we could stay there

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:32.730 align:middle line:90%
for a while.

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:36.640 align:middle line:84%
We can get to this highest,
highest point and part of us

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.790 align:middle line:84%
feels like we need
to go back and rest

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:41.620 align:middle line:84%
and recuperate and then climb
the mountain again and keep

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:42.450 align:middle line:90%
going up.

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:44.770 align:middle line:90%
And so we do it in this spiral.

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Even the informational
spiral that

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.930 align:middle line:84%
creates your bodies
and everything

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:52.926 align:middle line:84%
is a helical pattern,
the DNA and the RNA.

00:15:52.926 --> 00:15:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And so this circular pattern
seems to be something

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.300 align:middle line:90%
that we desire to do.

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:03.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, maybe we don't
have to do it that way.

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:06.430 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we can just go schwok,
right up there, I don't know.

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:07.990 align:middle line:84%
>>Actually, that's
what I was asking

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:11.360 align:middle line:84%
was whether at this point,
given the shift that's occurred,

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.490 align:middle line:90%
do we still need to repeat that?

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:16.130 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, normally
you keep repeating

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:20.737 align:middle line:84%
that 100 million times just
to go around the galaxy one

00:16:20.737 --> 00:16:22.820 align:middle line:84%
time, just to get a basic
pattern of what it's all

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:28.520 align:middle line:90%
about, which is a long time.

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:36.985 align:middle line:84%
But we may just take the shot
right out of here right now.

00:16:36.985 --> 00:16:38.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if we're
going to do this.

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:41.310 align:middle line:84%
I will explain what's
going on on every level

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:46.000 align:middle line:84%
that I can understand and
you make your own decision.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.400 align:middle line:84%
It looks like we
are about to make

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:55.500 align:middle line:84%
some kind of incredible,
enormous, awesome jump

00:16:55.500 --> 00:17:01.920 align:middle line:84%
in awareness that would
be extremely accelerated

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.610 align:middle line:90%
evolutionary pattern.

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:05.619 align:middle line:90%
We're already in it.

00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:07.779 align:middle line:84%
We're already right
now, right now at this

00:17:07.779 --> 00:17:12.036 align:middle line:84%
very minute, moving so fast
that-- and you can't tell it.

00:17:12.036 --> 00:17:13.160 align:middle line:90%
That's what's really funny.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.022 align:middle line:84%
It's because we're
inside the system.

00:17:16.022 --> 00:17:17.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can kind
of feel it, you know.

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:20.910 align:middle line:84%
We can look at how information's
doubled and things like this,

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:22.520 align:middle line:90%
but we can't really feel it.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:27.940 align:middle line:84%
We're like if we're inside
of a car going down a highway

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:31.980 align:middle line:84%
and we're in there and
we can't see out of it.

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.401 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we know we're
moving, you know,

00:17:34.401 --> 00:17:36.400 align:middle line:84%
and we might think we're
going 60 miles an hour,

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.460 align:middle line:84%
but maybe it's a
really smooth road

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:42.190 align:middle line:84%
and we may be really
going 2,000 miles an hour.

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:44.292 align:middle line:90%
But how can you tell?

00:17:44.292 --> 00:17:46.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, well, you would know
if you were going 2,000,

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.916 align:middle line:84%
I guess, because
you'd be breaking

00:17:47.916 --> 00:17:50.340 align:middle line:90%
the sound barrier and things.

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.430 align:middle line:84%
But, I mean, if you were
going 60 miles an hour,

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:56.110 align:middle line:84%
or say, 400 miles
an hour, you really

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:59.400 align:middle line:84%
couldn't tell the difference
if you couldn't see anything

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.375 align:middle line:84%
relative outside
that you're moving by

00:18:01.375 --> 00:18:02.670 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And we're inside of this
evolutionary system.

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:07.801 align:middle line:84%
We can't tell how fast
we're really moving.

00:18:07.801 --> 00:18:11.840 align:middle line:84%
We're moving really,
really, really fast.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.747 align:middle line:84%
But the speed up has only been
going now for just about 20,

00:18:14.747 --> 00:18:17.130 align:middle line:90%
21 years.

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:19.300 align:middle line:84%
We've sort of been, choo,
choo, choo, choo, choo,

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.350 align:middle line:90%
choo, going faster and faster.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:24.830 align:middle line:84%
The kinds of subjects that
we're discussing here right now,

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:29.170 align:middle line:84%
do you think we could have
done this 20 years ago?

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:30.652 align:middle line:90%
No way.

00:18:30.652 --> 00:18:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And the kinds of
things that we may

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:34.741 align:middle line:84%
start discussing
in a year or two we

00:18:34.741 --> 00:18:36.574 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't even begin to
talk about right now.

00:18:36.574 --> 00:18:39.230 align:middle line:90%


00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:42.218 align:middle line:84%
So we really are,
we're just flying.

00:18:42.218 --> 00:18:43.890 align:middle line:90%
We're just flying.

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:49.020 align:middle line:84%
All over the world, and we, the
industrial, white, Anglo type

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:53.200 align:middle line:84%
people here are really
behind most of the world

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.520 align:middle line:84%
but we think we're ahead
of it in a lot of ways.

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:59.310 align:middle line:84%
The Aboriginals, the natives,
the Native Americans,

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:01.540 align:middle line:84%
and the native
peoples of the world

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:05.890 align:middle line:84%
are way ahead of us
in this transition.

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:09.240 align:middle line:84%
They are more attuned to
these kinds of changes

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.590 align:middle line:84%
and they are well aware
that it was taking place

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:17.280 align:middle line:84%
and they're way into it and
they're way ahead of us.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And Thoth was
teaching, like I said,

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:22.840 align:middle line:84%
he could be intuitive
in 33 places at a time.

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.270 align:middle line:84%
He said that almost everybody
he was communicating with

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:27.916 align:middle line:84%
was native peoples
around the world.

00:19:27.916 --> 00:19:33.284 align:middle line:90%


00:19:33.284 --> 00:19:34.315 align:middle line:90%
Any other questions?

00:19:34.315 --> 00:19:37.590 align:middle line:90%


00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:41.190 align:middle line:84%
>>Yes, this prophecy
around about how,

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:44.012 align:middle line:84%
you know, '97 or whatnot, none
of our electrical equipment

00:19:44.012 --> 00:19:46.220 align:middle line:84%
is going to work but it
sounds like that's backwards.

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.094 align:middle line:84%
It's that we're not
going to need it to work.

00:19:48.094 --> 00:19:49.920 align:middle line:90%
Is that it?

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.440 align:middle line:90%
>>By '97?

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.740 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:54.540 align:middle line:90%
>>Who said that?

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:55.597 align:middle line:84%
Said that everything's
going to be in a, something

00:19:55.597 --> 00:19:57.570 align:middle line:90%
about electromagnetic flow.

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:00.530 align:middle line:84%
That it's going to be-- this
is part of Scallion's stuff.

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, there's a lot
of prophecies like that.

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:05.840 align:middle line:90%


00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'll give my two
cents on that, too.

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:11.130 align:middle line:90%


00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:14.970 align:middle line:84%
I really don't think, from
everything that I know,

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:19.540 align:middle line:84%
that it's not real safe
to prophesize right now.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:24.190 align:middle line:84%
Because even if you are
correct at this moment,

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:27.990 align:middle line:84%
you may be wrong anyway
because we're making changes

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:31.780 align:middle line:84%
that don't conform
to the normal laws.

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like
all the stuff--

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:38.150 align:middle line:84%
we're going to talk about
something that happened in 1972

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:39.870 align:middle line:90%
that's changed everything.

00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And the prophecies
before that experiment

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:49.672 align:middle line:84%
took place in 1972, like Edgar
Cayce was almost 100% accurate.

00:20:49.672 --> 00:20:53.846 align:middle line:84%
He gave 12,000 predictions
with only one error.

00:20:53.846 --> 00:20:56.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's-- I'd
say that's pretty good.

00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And that one error was that
he gave a reading, a health

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.660 align:middle line:84%
reading on a person in France
and got his twin brother

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.450 align:middle line:90%
by mistake.

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:12.700 align:middle line:84%
But after 1972, his predictions
started going way off.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:17.850 align:middle line:84%
Nostradamus was the same way
He was 80% correct until 1972.

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:20.793 align:middle line:90%
And then, whoosh, way down.

00:21:20.793 --> 00:21:22.272 align:middle line:90%
>>This guy is current.

00:21:22.272 --> 00:21:29.174 align:middle line:84%
I don't know. [INAUDIBLE] He's
viewing it from one perspective

00:21:29.174 --> 00:21:31.146 align:middle line:84%
and as you're reading
sort of [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:31.146 --> 00:21:34.597 align:middle line:90%


00:21:34.597 --> 00:21:42.520 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, the ascendant masters
that I communicate with,

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:47.630 align:middle line:84%
they're very reluctant to
say what's going to happen,

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:54.000 align:middle line:84%
and they have a real good
wide view of the whole thing.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And they've never
seen anything like it.

00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:59.740 align:middle line:84%
They don't even know
what to think about it,

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:03.720 align:middle line:84%
and this informational level
is also up on their level.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:07.110 align:middle line:84%
They have received
information that normally

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:14.020 align:middle line:84%
a planet like this wouldn't get
probably 100 million years down

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:20.140 align:middle line:84%
the line somewhere, and they're
acting on it, successfully.

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:22.480 align:middle line:84%
We're making-- I
just, I don't know.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.644 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all I can tell
you-- I will tell you

00:22:24.644 --> 00:22:27.060 align:middle line:84%
what normally happens in these
kind of things, which we'll

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:31.644 align:middle line:84%
get into later, and
I know that there

00:22:31.644 --> 00:22:33.560 align:middle line:84%
are certain things that
will happen, you know,

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.990 align:middle line:84%
like the poles are
going to shift.

00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:39.590 align:middle line:84%
But it does not have to
be this violent change.

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:42.167 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'm not so sure it's
going to be violent at all.

00:22:42.167 --> 00:22:44.375 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we're going
to have any warning at all,

00:22:44.375 --> 00:22:46.255 align:middle line:90%
or very little.

00:22:46.255 --> 00:22:47.630 align:middle line:84%
The kinds of things
that normally

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:52.180 align:middle line:84%
happen, the kinds
of things-- maybe it

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:53.410 align:middle line:90%
will, but I don't think so.

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:54.990 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you everything
I know about that

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:55.948 align:middle line:90%
when the time is right.

00:22:55.948 --> 00:22:58.301 align:middle line:84%
But when you use the
word soon, there really

00:22:58.301 --> 00:22:59.250 align:middle line:90%
isn't any timeframe.

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, we do have an outer
limit on all of this.

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:07.440 align:middle line:84%
We're going to hit that
wall in the year 2012,

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.720 align:middle line:90%
late in that year.

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:13.870 align:middle line:84%
By January, 2013, we
can't be here anymore.

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:18.890 align:middle line:84%
So that is our
outer limit of time.

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And the original
predictions, which

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:25.229 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk about,
when they started the Christ

00:23:25.229 --> 00:23:27.020 align:middle line:84%
consciousness geomancy
of the planet, which

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:32.180 align:middle line:84%
was done about 13,000 years
ago, the original calculations

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:34.750 align:middle line:84%
were that we would be
completed with this

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:37.760 align:middle line:90%
by the winter of 1998.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:43.540 align:middle line:84%
But those don't mean
anything anymore.

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:46.550 align:middle line:90%


00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:50.830 align:middle line:84%
We're in place right
now, as of this minute.

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:57.970 align:middle line:84%
A transition could take place
tonight, could take place.

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:02.120 align:middle line:84%
We could have no more than
a five or six hour warning.

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you,
this is a warning

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:06.980 align:middle line:84%
that once you know what
it is there's no doubt

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:10.440 align:middle line:90%
once it starts taking place.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And that may be all
the time you have.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.650 align:middle line:84%
It really depends a lot
on the people of the world

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:20.620 align:middle line:84%
and how much love we
have for each other

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:23.072 align:middle line:90%
and what our dreams are.

00:24:23.072 --> 00:24:26.490 align:middle line:90%
And we're in control right now.

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:29.800 align:middle line:84%
We've eliminated most of
the negative forces that

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.900 align:middle line:90%
have been controlling things.

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.600 align:middle line:84%
We've eliminated, at
least temporarily,

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:37.210 align:middle line:84%
most of the
extraterrestrial forces that

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:39.480 align:middle line:90%
have been controlling things.

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:44.000 align:middle line:84%
We have eliminated most of
the governmental agencies that

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.460 align:middle line:84%
have been controlling
things, and the people

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:48.890 align:middle line:84%
are in more power than
they know and that's

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:50.810 align:middle line:84%
part of the problem
is they don't know.

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:53.060 align:middle line:84%
They don't know that what
they're thinking and feeling

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:56.196 align:middle line:84%
is literally creating the
world at each moment right now.

00:24:56.196 --> 00:25:00.100 align:middle line:84%
But I have to wait until we
get a lot more information laid

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:06.190 align:middle line:84%
down before that's going
to make a lot of sense.

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>>I understood that the wall
was between the 12th dimension

00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:11.990 align:middle line:84%
and the 13th
dimension and you said

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:16.490 align:middle line:84%
that we have until the year
2012 before we hit that wall.

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:17.990 align:middle line:84%
>>We're going to
hit the wall, yeah.

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>So I thought we were going
now into the 10th, 11th and 12th

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:22.810 align:middle line:90%
octave.

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:23.390 align:middle line:90%
>>That's correct.

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:25.139 align:middle line:84%
>>In the fourth
dimension, So where does--

00:25:25.139 --> 00:25:30.390 align:middle line:84%
>>We're going to make-- the
first step is to get into this

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:33.190 align:middle line:84%
relative to what we're--
this very dense body that

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:36.560 align:middle line:84%
we're in right now, we're
going to convert into energy.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And we will still
have atoms, just

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.990 align:middle line:84%
like we do now only they'll
be fourth dimensional atoms.

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:47.430 align:middle line:84%
They'll be different than
the atoms that we have here.

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:50.370 align:middle line:84%
They have a different
configuration.

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And their atomic bondings
are at phenomenal lengths

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:57.130 align:middle line:90%
rather than in close.

00:25:57.130 --> 00:26:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And so we will convert most
of the mass of this body

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:04.066 align:middle line:84%
into energy and
the atoms will be

00:26:04.066 --> 00:26:07.070 align:middle line:84%
linked by tremendous distances
but when you look at your body,

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:10.162 align:middle line:84%
it will look the same except
the colors coming off of it

00:26:10.162 --> 00:26:11.170 align:middle line:90%
will be different.

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And it will feel
solid and everything.

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:14.650 align:middle line:84%
But if you were to
walk through that wall,

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:16.046 align:middle line:84%
you'd just walk
right through it.

00:26:16.046 --> 00:26:17.230 align:middle line:90%
Like it's not even there.

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:19.529 align:middle line:84%
If your hand went
like this, you'd shoo,

00:26:19.529 --> 00:26:21.070 align:middle line:84%
you'd go right
through it because you

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:23.440 align:middle line:84%
would be at a different
density than this.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And you wouldn't be
visible in this room

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:26.880 align:middle line:90%
except to certain people.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.970 align:middle line:84%
If somebody could tune to that
level, then they could see you.

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:33.680 align:middle line:84%
If they couldn't tune to that,
you would be invisible to them.

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:38.420 align:middle line:90%
And so what was the--

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:40.396 align:middle line:90%


00:26:40.396 --> 00:26:42.950 align:middle line:84%
>>That's the first step to
the 10th, 11th, and 12th.

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:48.655 align:middle line:84%
>>Oh, well, the thing is, we're
going to-- the 10th, 11th,

00:26:48.655 --> 00:26:51.140 align:middle line:84%
and 12th, overtone is
sort of a transition

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:58.790 align:middle line:84%
place between having a physical
body and having no body.

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And you'll go into very
specific body forms

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:06.780 align:middle line:84%
that God has created that would
be considered light bodies

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:09.710 align:middle line:90%
compared to what we are now.

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:11.650 align:middle line:84%
They have physical
form and shape

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:14.680 align:middle line:84%
and they have brains and
all these kinds of things,

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:22.160 align:middle line:84%
but they are, like I
said, almost pure energy.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And we need to go
into that step first.

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:27.170 align:middle line:90%
We go through metamorphosis.

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:31.680 align:middle line:84%
We literally grow into
these new kinds of bodies.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.360 align:middle line:84%
We come out on the
other side as a baby,

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:38.717 align:middle line:84%
and this is called
a baby over there.

00:27:38.717 --> 00:27:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And we grow from
here very rapidly.

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:45.510 align:middle line:84%
What takes 21 years or so for
us to become an adult here

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:49.020 align:middle line:90%
takes about two years there.

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And experientially, not talking
about actual time ratios.

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.360 align:middle line:84%
Experientially, about
two years will go by

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:58.180 align:middle line:84%
and you will through a
very rapid metamorphose

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:00.430 align:middle line:84%
into something that's going
to look very different,

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:01.834 align:middle line:90%
though very similar to this.

00:28:01.834 --> 00:28:04.000 align:middle line:84%
You're going to see the
pictures of what we're going

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.690 align:middle line:90%
to go into when we're there.

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:10.570 align:middle line:84%
But then once we get in there
and we become an adult there,

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:14.040 align:middle line:84%
we're going to rapidly move
from there out of there

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.540 align:middle line:90%
into the fifth dimension.

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:21.850 align:middle line:84%
Leave all physical form and
then slingshot from there

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:24.180 align:middle line:84%
through a whole series of
dimensional levels, which

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:26.300 align:middle line:84%
it's beyond my imagination
how that's going to be.

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>>And that's the part
that the ascendant masters

00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:30.300 align:middle line:90%
are guessing about.

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:32.300 align:middle line:84%
>>No, they're guessing
at just about everything.

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:38.040 align:middle line:90%


00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:41.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really, like
from here all the way up.

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:42.330 align:middle line:90%
They just don't know.

00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:44.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everything
keeps changing.

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:47.300 align:middle line:84%
Every time they think it's
going to be certain way,

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:48.100 align:middle line:90%
then it changes.

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.896 align:middle line:84%
Though they're
getting better at it.

00:28:50.896 --> 00:28:52.880 align:middle line:90%
They're beginning to understand.

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:56.060 align:middle line:84%
See, they were thrown
off by the speed.

00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:57.330 align:middle line:90%
That's the thing.

00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:58.560 align:middle line:90%
It's not the pattern so much.

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:02.540 align:middle line:84%
It's the speed at which the
evolution is taking place.

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:05.110 align:middle line:84%
>>So if we were
thrown-- if we were

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:07.180 align:middle line:84%
able to slingshot
all the way to,

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:11.910 align:middle line:84%
let's say, the 12th dimension,
would that disallow or perhaps

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:15.030 align:middle line:84%
obviate the need for the
procession of the equinoxes

00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:18.420 align:middle line:84%
as far as our participation in
falling sleep and waking up?

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:23.850 align:middle line:84%
>>We're going to be out of this
level of earthly consciousness

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:26.890 align:middle line:90%
or awareness very quickly.

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:28.600 align:middle line:84%
I don't know when,
and I don't think

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.180 align:middle line:84%
it's even-- if I
did know the moment,

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:34.220 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't tell you because
it's not healthy to know.

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:36.100 align:middle line:84%
That's like knowing when
you're going to die.

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:38.160 align:middle line:84%
You know, I mean, it
doesn't help you at all.

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.010 align:middle line:90%
You're better not to know.

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:51.575 align:middle line:90%
And what was the question again?

00:29:51.575 --> 00:29:55.040 align:middle line:90%


00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:58.590 align:middle line:84%
>>I just wondered if we were
able to slingshot all the way

00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:01.170 align:middle line:84%
up to the 12th dimension,
if it would still,

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:03.910 align:middle line:84%
if we, as we are
right now would still

00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:06.530 align:middle line:84%
be required to go
through this experience

00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:08.327 align:middle line:84%
of this intense
darkness of sleep

00:30:08.327 --> 00:30:09.910 align:middle line:84%
and falling sleep
and waking up again.

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:12.180 align:middle line:84%
>>Oh, oh, oh, we're
going-- like I said,

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:15.290 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be out of
earthly consciousness, all

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:17.520 align:middle line:84%
the parameters and
everything going on here.

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:18.895 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
still be on Earth,

00:30:18.895 --> 00:30:21.550 align:middle line:84%
but we're going to first go
to the fourth dimension level.

00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Experientially, there's
almost no connection at all.

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:27.520 align:middle line:84%
Almost none except
that there are bodies

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:30.625 align:middle line:84%
but they're real different
and the experience

00:30:30.625 --> 00:30:32.540 align:middle line:90%
is totally different.

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And I will describe
all this stuff.

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:42.210 align:middle line:90%


00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:46.077 align:middle line:84%
It's just a different,
totally different way of being

00:30:46.077 --> 00:30:47.910 align:middle line:84%
and we're not going to
stay there very long.

00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:50.160 align:middle line:84%
We're going to move into
something that is really,

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.210 align:middle line:90%
really, really different.

00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And, then we're not even
going to stay there very long.

00:30:55.450 --> 00:31:00.970 align:middle line:84%
So all we can really talk about
is this one step of just kind

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:05.490 align:middle line:84%
of just moving from here over
to this next step where we still

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:07.100 align:middle line:90%
have bodies but they're--

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>>I have another question to
try to clarify about the yugas

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:18.816 align:middle line:84%
and the-- is that an
entirely different thing?

00:31:18.816 --> 00:31:20.232 align:middle line:84%
This is a historical
thing that we

00:31:20.232 --> 00:31:22.710 align:middle line:84%
go through these cycles of
waking up and falling asleep,

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:23.510 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:25.396 align:middle line:90%
Now, this has been going on--

00:31:25.396 --> 00:31:26.680 align:middle line:90%
>>Forever.

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.650 align:middle line:84%
>>And in this dimension it's
been going on forever and this

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:34.450 align:middle line:84%
change into the next dimension
is something different or--

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:38.750 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, the Earth has a
three-dimensional aspect.

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:39.660 align:middle line:90%
We do shift.

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:41.882 align:middle line:84%
As we come to this
place we normally--

00:31:41.882 --> 00:31:44.390 align:middle line:84%
normally what happens,
what's been happening,

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:46.740 align:middle line:84%
the level that we
were at is when

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:50.660 align:middle line:84%
we reached this place right
here at the nearest point

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:54.600 align:middle line:84%
and we were coming over
here to-- let's see,

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:59.430 align:middle line:84%
if we were physically where
we are right now between here,

00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:03.730 align:middle line:84%
at that place, that would
be the place where we were

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:05.300 align:middle line:84%
at our highest level
of consciousness

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:08.257 align:middle line:84%
that we could obtain,
which we were reaching

00:32:08.257 --> 00:32:10.215 align:middle line:84%
about the 12th overtone
of the sixth dimension.

00:32:10.215 --> 00:32:13.310 align:middle line:90%


00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And then we would drop down
but where we would drop down to

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:19.340 align:middle line:84%
is to Christ
consciousness to one

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:21.160 align:middle line:84%
of the overtones of
the fourth dimension.

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.070 align:middle line:90%
That's as low as we would get.

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And so, when you
say we were asleep,

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:30.780 align:middle line:84%
we were really awake
compared to where we are now.

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And then we come to
the waking place,

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:34.800 align:middle line:84%
where we go into the
fifth dimension it

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:37.730 align:middle line:84%
begins this light
process back up again.

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And so our sleep period
was vastly more expanded

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:49.250 align:middle line:84%
than what now but something
caused us to fall way down,

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:51.050 align:middle line:90%
to literally go unconscious.

00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:53.780 align:middle line:84%
>>So you're saying that whatever
happened 16,000 years ago is

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:55.850 align:middle line:90%
why this cycle is different?

00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:58.052 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, we have a
different cycle in here

00:32:58.052 --> 00:32:59.880 align:middle line:90%
than any one before.

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:03.410 align:middle line:90%
>>Also, you know, [? Solera? ?]

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:04.990 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>>She said something about
the helixes of the thing you

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:14.720 align:middle line:84%
described about the Sirius and
the way it moves in a helix

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:20.020 align:middle line:84%
and that our, somehow it's
going to cross over into another

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:22.840 align:middle line:84%
orbit or something and
that's why this is--

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:25.757 align:middle line:84%
>>We are going to change, we
are going to change orbits.

00:33:25.757 --> 00:33:27.840 align:middle line:84%
>>Like, we're going to
cross into the next, like--

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:30.089 align:middle line:84%
>>We're going to cross--
we're going to actually going

00:33:30.089 --> 00:33:31.735 align:middle line:90%
into a closer orbit.

00:33:31.735 --> 00:33:32.769 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:33:32.769 --> 00:33:34.310 align:middle line:84%
>>Though none of
that's going to make

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:36.684 align:middle line:84%
any difference because we're
not going to be here anyway.

00:33:36.684 --> 00:33:40.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's not going to really
make a big difference.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.670 align:middle line:90%
At least, I don't think so.

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:44.000 align:middle line:90%
