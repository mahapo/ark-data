00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.444 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.444 --> 00:00:16.236 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.236 --> 00:00:17.250 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm going to go--
this is a brand new subject.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.120 align:middle line:90%
And it has do with history.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.720 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.690 align:middle line:84%
In order to understand
our situation here

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.960 align:middle line:84%
in the world, how we got to
this place and what happened

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.240 align:middle line:84%
and everything, we need
to look into our past

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.799 align:middle line:84%
and begin to understand
the situation of the past.

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:40.715 align:middle line:90%
It's really important.

00:00:40.715 --> 00:00:43.760 align:middle line:90%


00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.010 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, people tend
to think that, well, we

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.301 align:middle line:90%
don't really need to know that.

00:00:47.301 --> 00:00:50.850 align:middle line:84%
We where we are now, and
we just need to go forward.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.552 align:middle line:84%
But that is not
the nature of life.

00:00:54.552 --> 00:00:56.760 align:middle line:84%
We're going to look at
something called the Fibonacci

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.500 align:middle line:90%
Series a little later.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:07.474 align:middle line:84%
It's a series that goes 1,
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34,

00:01:07.474 --> 00:01:09.590 align:middle line:90%
55-- it keeps going.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And all it is, is just if you
take three segments of it--

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.730 align:middle line:84%
3, 5, and 8-- it's just you're
adding 3 to 5, and you get 8.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.523 align:middle line:90%
Add 5 and 8, you get 13.

00:01:18.523 --> 00:01:20.295 align:middle line:90%
And 8 and 13, you get 21.

00:01:20.295 --> 00:01:21.950 align:middle line:90%
And 13 and 21, you get 34.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.030 align:middle line:90%
It's an adding.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.490 align:middle line:84%
This particular series is called
Fibonacci or "Fie-bonacci"

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.546 align:middle line:90%
Series.

00:01:28.546 --> 00:01:32.930 align:middle line:10%
And it is linked to
many different aspects

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.940 align:middle line:10%
of organic chemistry and organic
life, and specifically to one

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.940 align:middle line:10%
of the areas is plant life.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And plants, when
they grow, they tend

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.830 align:middle line:84%
to grow according to
this particular series.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.860 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
plant will grow one leaf.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.670 align:middle line:90%
And then it will grow one more.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And then it'll come out
with two, and then three,

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.610 align:middle line:90%
and then five, and then eight.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.260 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the series
that is used over, and over,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.840 align:middle line:90%
and over again.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:14.180 align:middle line:84%
And the little plant, it needs
to be able to have a pattern

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.730 align:middle line:90%
to know where to go.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.240 align:middle line:84%
And so the plant, when it's
sitting here with five leaves,

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.770 align:middle line:84%
all it has to do is
look into its past

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.020 align:middle line:90%
to see that it grew three.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Combine that with where it is,
and it now knows where to go.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.220 align:middle line:84%
It knows that eight
is the amount.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.450 align:middle line:84%
When it gets to eight,
it looks into its past

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.196 align:middle line:84%
and see that it's
five, and knows

00:02:36.196 --> 00:02:38.530 align:middle line:90%
that 13 is the place to go.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way, we
need to-- time is also

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.990 align:middle line:90%
divided into this threeness.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And actually, just-- well,
I'll finish this statement

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.010 align:middle line:90%
and go back into that other one.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.560 align:middle line:84%
Time, we have this past,
present, and this future.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And in order for us to know
where the proper place for us

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.830 align:middle line:84%
to be or what to
do in the future,

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.550 align:middle line:84%
we have to combine our
present with our past.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.390 align:middle line:84%
If we don't know
what our past is,

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.422 align:middle line:90%
we're lost, absolutely lost.

00:03:12.422 --> 00:03:14.880 align:middle line:84%
No matter what you think of
yourself or where you're going,

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.560 align:middle line:90%
you don't know you're going.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.645 align:middle line:90%
You don't have a future.

00:03:17.645 --> 00:03:18.895 align:middle line:90%
That future could be anything.

00:03:18.895 --> 00:03:21.950 align:middle line:90%
You don't know where it goes.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And so we need to
know what happened

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.790 align:middle line:84%
and what got us to where
we are in order to proceed.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And just to take this
one step further,

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.350 align:middle line:84%
we live in what is often called
good and evil consciousness,

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.130 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes called
polarity consciousness.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.190 align:middle line:84%
You know, where things are good
and bad, and black and white,

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.950 align:middle line:90%
and et cetera.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.990 align:middle line:84%
But there is no
such thing as this.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.500 align:middle line:84%
We need to see this
point real quickly.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.160 align:middle line:84%
There is no polarity conscious,
and no polarity anything.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.730 align:middle line:84%
No matter what
polarity you think of,

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.310 align:middle line:84%
you're going to realize that
there is a third component.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.230 align:middle line:90%


00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.740 align:middle line:84%
If you think of the
Earth and the sun,

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.130 align:middle line:84%
or male and female, or black
and white, or up and down,

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.975 align:middle line:84%
or hot and cold-- with
the Earth and the sun,

00:04:16.975 --> 00:04:19.150 align:middle line:90%
there's going to be the moon.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.832 align:middle line:84%
With male and female, there's
going to be the child.

00:04:21.832 --> 00:04:23.790 align:middle line:84%
With black and white,
there's going to be grey.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.260 align:middle line:84%
With up and down,
there's the middle.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.640 align:middle line:90%
With-- what was the other?

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.390 align:middle line:84%
Hot and cold, there's
going to warm.

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.700 align:middle line:84%
No matter what a
polarity is, there's

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.500 align:middle line:84%
always this thing in the middle
because there's three parts.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.130 align:middle line:84%
The entire fabric
of the universe

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.720 align:middle line:84%
is made of proton,
electron, and neutron.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And this threeness, our time
is past, present, and future.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.064 align:middle line:90%
Our space is the X, Y, Z axis.

00:04:53.064 --> 00:04:54.730 align:middle line:84%
It's the nature of
this particular level

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:55.530 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.982 align:middle line:84%
This is how we
interpret our reality.

00:04:58.982 --> 00:05:00.440 align:middle line:84%
There's other ways
to interpret it,

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.260 align:middle line:84%
but this is the way
we interpret it.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.240 align:middle line:84%
Every mathematical
sequence in existence--

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.020 align:middle line:84%
except for one, which is
the Golden Mean, which

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.920 align:middle line:84%
created all the other
ones-- you only need

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.595 align:middle line:84%
three components in it to
know the entire sequence.

00:05:13.595 --> 00:05:16.590 align:middle line:90%


00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And so we live in a tri
world, the holy trinity.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.190 align:middle line:90%


00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And so we need to
know any-- we have

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.149 align:middle line:84%
to know two of the components
to know what the other one is.

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:34.690 align:middle line:84%
You could do it the
other way around.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.300 align:middle line:84%
You could subtract
this one from this one.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.990 align:middle line:84%
If you knew your future, you
could know what your past.

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.160 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.960 align:middle line:90%


00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.080 align:middle line:84%
You could subtract your
present from your future,

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.413 align:middle line:90%
and you'd know where you'd been.

00:05:45.413 --> 00:05:51.860 align:middle line:90%


00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And so for this reason, I have
been asked to discuss history,

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.620 align:middle line:84%
for about two hours or
something like that--

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:00.830 align:middle line:90%
for a long period of time.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.470 align:middle line:90%


00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.520 align:middle line:90%
And so here we go.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.840 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.600 align:middle line:90%


00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.990 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to
combine-- first of all,

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.770 align:middle line:84%
I used to give this
history lesson strictly

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.590 align:middle line:84%
from Thoth's point of view, who
is someone that's been around

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.290 align:middle line:90%
here for a long time.

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:26.680 align:middle line:84%
However, recently, another
man-- whom I haven't even

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.390 align:middle line:90%
met yet, Zecharia Sitchin.

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.770 align:middle line:84%
I was introduced to
his books and found out

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.175 align:middle line:84%
that they dovetailed
with what Thoth

00:06:34.175 --> 00:06:38.190 align:middle line:84%
was saying so closely that I
wanted to use both of them.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:42.950 align:middle line:10%
Though some of things that
Thoth is saying is beyond what

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.270 align:middle line:10%
Zecharia Sitchin is saying
from interpreting the records--

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.263 align:middle line:10%
and you'll understand I mean
by beyond in just a moment.

00:06:49.263 --> 00:06:55.840 align:middle line:90%


00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.580 align:middle line:84%
Thoth just started
saying-- and I've

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.770 align:middle line:84%
got this on the record going
back seven and a half years.

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:06.305 align:middle line:84%
Thoth just says, well, there
were these giants on the world.

00:07:06.305 --> 00:07:07.737 align:middle line:90%
And that's where he starts out.

00:07:07.737 --> 00:07:09.320 align:middle line:84%
He says, there were
these giants here.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.340 align:middle line:84%
He didn't say where they
came from, or who they were,

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:11.970 align:middle line:90%
or what they were.

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:13.553 align:middle line:84%
He just said, there
were these giants.

00:07:13.553 --> 00:07:16.760 align:middle line:90%


00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.500 align:middle line:84%
It isn't just Thoth
who says that.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.150 align:middle line:84%
If you take the Bible,
and you go into Genesis,

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:25.520 align:middle line:84%
and you go to chapter 6, which
is a very interesting chapter,

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.080 align:middle line:84%
it says, "And it
came to pass, when

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.610 align:middle line:84%
men began to multiply
on the face of the Earth

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.310 align:middle line:84%
and daughters were
born unto them,

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:38.450 align:middle line:84%
and that the sons of God--"
this is plural, people.

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.840 align:middle line:84%
"Sons of God saw the
daughters of men,

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.386 align:middle line:84%
and that they were fair,
and they took them wives,

00:07:45.386 --> 00:07:46.740 align:middle line:90%
of all of wish they chose.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And the Lord said, my
spiritual shall not always

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.370 align:middle line:90%
strive with man."

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:53.010 align:middle line:84%
This is another statement
people have wondered about.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:59.200 align:middle line:84%
"For that he also is flesh,
yet this day shall be 120."

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And then number 4 says,
"And there were giants

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:04.340 align:middle line:90%
in the Earth in those days.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And also after that
when, the sons of God

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:10.845 align:middle line:84%
came unto the daughters of men,
and they bear children to them,

00:08:10.845 --> 00:08:14.460 align:middle line:84%
and the same became
mighty men which

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:20.512 align:middle line:90%
were of old, men of renown."

00:08:20.512 --> 00:08:24.720 align:middle line:90%
Who are these sons of God?

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And plural-- this is not
talking about a single one.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is talking
about God being

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:36.780 align:middle line:84%
made of flesh and
that they were giants.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:42.989 align:middle line:84%
Well, according to Zecharia
Sitchin-- who's read his works?

00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:43.789 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:44.500 align:middle line:90%
Just a few people.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.850 align:middle line:90%
I really recommend you do this.

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:48.540 align:middle line:90%
It's on the reading list.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:50.540 align:middle line:84%
After you read it-- after
you see this workshop,

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.560 align:middle line:84%
you won't be able to put his
books down, I'll tell you.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.370 align:middle line:84%
He's just reading
the clay tablets.

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:01.220 align:middle line:90%
He's just saying what they say.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And they give a story
that is rather remarkable.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:11.560 align:middle line:84%
For number 1, suppose Moses
wrote justice in about 1250 BC.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:16.180 align:middle line:84%
I think that was the
approximate time.

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:19.300 align:middle line:84%
But Genesis is written
down in Sumerian records

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:27.850 align:middle line:84%
to 2,300 years before
that time, word for word.

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:29.450 align:middle line:10%
Coming right down
to Adam and Eve,

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.070 align:middle line:10%
and giving the names of
their sons and daughters,

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:32.528 align:middle line:10%
and da, da, da,
da, and all the way

00:09:32.528 --> 00:09:35.000 align:middle line:10%
down through there--
the whole thing.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.470 align:middle line:84%
2,300 years before
Moses even lived--

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.930 align:middle line:84%
or maybe not quite that
long before he lived-- it

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:45.350 align:middle line:84%
was written down in
the Sumerian tablets.

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:49.540 align:middle line:10%
It talks about this
rather incredible time

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.650 align:middle line:10%
when, according to
the tablets, there's

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:55.580 align:middle line:10%
another planet in our solar
system, which NASA has now

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.930 align:middle line:10%
located, absolutely.

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:01.130 align:middle line:84%
The satellite directions
knows exactly where it is.

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:02.420 align:middle line:90%
The planet's there.

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:05.450 align:middle line:84%
It's been scientifically
determined.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:07.740 align:middle line:84%
But they said that there
was another planet,

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.650 align:middle line:84%
and that the planet went
in retrograde relative

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:12.330 align:middle line:90%
to the rest of the planets.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.150 align:middle line:84%
As they were all
moving around this way,

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.180 align:middle line:84%
this one's coming
in the other way.

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And that it came in every
approximately 3,600 years.

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:23.400 align:middle line:90%
And [WHISTLES] just missed it.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And according to that, there
was this planet called Tiamat,

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:28.630 align:middle line:90%
which was this huge planet.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:30.360 align:middle line:90%
It had moons around it.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And one day, this
other planet, which

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:39.240 align:middle line:84%
they give the name Marduk--
at least the Babylonians did.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.810 align:middle line:84%
But what did the
Anunnaki call it?

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:42.070 align:middle line:90%
>>Nibiru.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:43.390 align:middle line:90%
>>Nibir-o.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:44.190 align:middle line:90%
Ni-bare-u?

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:45.654 align:middle line:90%
Nibiru?

00:10:45.654 --> 00:10:46.630 align:middle line:90%
>>Nibiru.

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>>And Nibiru [CHUCKLES] came in
one time very close to Tiamat,

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:58.260 align:middle line:84%
and one of the moons of Nibiru
struck Tiamat and shattered it

00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:59.410 align:middle line:90%
in half.

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And the big half came
to be known as Earth.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And the little half broke
into a million pieces

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.730 align:middle line:84%
and became known as the
Hammered Bracelet, which

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:11.836 align:middle line:84%
is the asteroid belt.
Stretches around between Mars

00:11:11.836 --> 00:11:12.960 align:middle line:90%
and Jupiter, I think it is.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.908 align:middle line:90%


00:11:16.908 --> 00:11:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And that was a long,
long, long, long time ago.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.900 align:middle line:84%
But according to the
Sumerian records,

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:28.960 align:middle line:84%
there's people on this planet
that are pretty far along,

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.170 align:middle line:90%
advanced.

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And about 400-and-something
thousand--

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.110 align:middle line:84%
I think it was 430, 40,
50 thousand years ago--

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:39.329 align:middle line:90%
they decided to come to Earth.

00:11:39.329 --> 00:11:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And they came to Earth,
according to the records,

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:44.980 align:middle line:84%
because they were having a
problem with their atmosphere,

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.120 align:middle line:90%
just like we are.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:51.590 align:middle line:84%
They are way out in space and
need the greenhouse effect

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:54.960 align:middle line:84%
to reflect the light back
on and keep them warm.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.470 align:middle line:90%
And they were losing their heat.

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And so they decided that
the best thing for them

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.600 align:middle line:84%
would be to put gold dust
into their atmosphere

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.220 align:middle line:90%
to reflect the heat back.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:08.240 align:middle line:84%
That was the decision
that was made.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.682 align:middle line:84%
And so they came to
Earth to get this gold.

00:12:11.682 --> 00:12:12.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm not making this up.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.440 align:middle line:90%
This is in--

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.950 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:18.760 align:middle line:84%
This is in the our end of the
records, along with Genesis,

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:22.580 align:middle line:84%
that you can read
about Adam and Eve.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.330 align:middle line:10%
And they came here
to get the gold,

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:28.810 align:middle line:10%
and they came in with 12
people who were their leaders.

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:31.940 align:middle line:10%
And I think it was 400
to 600 other people who

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:33.900 align:middle line:10%
were the workers.

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And so for about
200-and-something years,

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:43.670 align:middle line:84%
which-- and I differ slightly
with this figure with Zecharia.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:46.600 align:middle line:90%
He's calculating this thing.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.520 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, for a certain
length of time,

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.520 align:middle line:84%
they worked as-- they worked
planet Earth getting this gold.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.695 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't that far
along technologically.

00:12:55.695 --> 00:12:58.350 align:middle line:84%
They used rocket ships
to get back and forth.

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:02.150 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking about
high-tech vehicles here.

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And so they had to wait
till Marduk came around,

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:10.110 align:middle line:84%
so it was in the
atmosphere, closer.

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And then they would transfer
all the gold up to it

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:12.840 align:middle line:90%
and come back down again.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.270 align:middle line:84%
They had to wait another 3,600
years before they could put

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:17.640 align:middle line:90%
the gold back on to it again.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:23.470 align:middle line:84%
And these people had very,
very, very long lifespans.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:28.390 align:middle line:84%
Huge lifespans,
compared to what we are.

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:34.109 align:middle line:84%
And so here's these 600 people
digging gold for 100,000--

00:13:34.109 --> 00:13:36.400 align:middle line:84%
according to him, it was
about 100,000-something years,

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.569 align:middle line:90%
200,000 years.

00:13:38.569 --> 00:13:40.360 align:middle line:84%
It would've been longer
according to Thoth.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.997 align:middle line:84%
A little bit-- they're
all within 100,000 years

00:13:42.997 --> 00:13:43.830 align:middle line:90%
of each other or so.

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:46.340 align:middle line:90%


00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:49.091 align:middle line:84%
And then one day, there was this
revolt, where the workers just

00:13:49.091 --> 00:13:51.716 align:middle line:84%
said, (SPEAKING WITH ACCENT) I'm
not going to dig gold anymore.

00:13:51.716 --> 00:13:52.608 align:middle line:90%
I'm tired of it.

00:13:52.608 --> 00:13:54.392 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:54.392 --> 00:13:55.290 align:middle line:90%


00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:56.370 align:middle line:90%
Darn stuff.

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:57.583 align:middle line:90%
I've had it.

00:13:57.583 --> 00:14:00.480 align:middle line:84%
(NORMAL VOICE) And they just
wouldn't dig gold anymore.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:04.300 align:middle line:84%
And so the people
decided-- the leaders,

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.840 align:middle line:84%
the 12 leaders-- decided,
well, they would do something.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.631 align:middle line:84%
They thought about it
and thought about it.

00:14:08.631 --> 00:14:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And they decided what they'd
do is they'd make a sub-race.

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:15.406 align:middle line:84%
And the sub-race would
dig the gold for them.

00:14:15.406 --> 00:14:18.540 align:middle line:84%
The sub-race is us,
according to them.

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:23.540 align:middle line:84%
That they created this race
from clay, and blood, and sperm

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:25.720 align:middle line:84%
from the young
Anunnaki, which are

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.480 align:middle line:90%
the people that live on there.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it
says right in there.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And they used-- and you can see
them with a test tube flask,

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:35.890 align:middle line:84%
pouring stuff, and
all those things.

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:36.730 align:middle line:84%
It's written right
on the record.

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:38.759 align:middle line:84%
You can see it where
they did all these things

00:14:38.759 --> 00:14:40.300 align:middle line:84%
and created this
whole race, which we

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:41.820 align:middle line:90%
are capable of doing right now.

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.620 align:middle line:90%
We could create a new race.

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.726 align:middle line:84%
And if this came
out 100 years ago,

00:14:45.726 --> 00:14:47.100 align:middle line:84%
it would be like
science fiction.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:48.641 align:middle line:84%
But we can do
everything that they're

00:14:48.641 --> 00:14:50.120 align:middle line:90%
talking about, right now.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.640 align:middle line:84%
We are just about ready to
map all the genes on the DNA

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:56.370 align:middle line:84%
molecule-- all 100,000
of them-- and know

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:58.940 align:middle line:84%
every single one of them, by
name, and location, and what

00:14:58.940 --> 00:14:59.930 align:middle line:90%
they do.

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:02.000 align:middle line:90%
We're rapidly unfolding that.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.030 align:middle line:84%
Another two, three, four years,
we'll have it all figured out.

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.102 align:middle line:84%
And we could create any
kind of race you want.

00:15:07.102 --> 00:15:07.902 align:middle line:90%
You can name it.

00:15:07.902 --> 00:15:09.930 align:middle line:84%
You could just map
out what you want,

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:12.390 align:middle line:84%
and we could create a
whole, different kind

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:15.470 align:middle line:84%
of person, superior
race, anything you want.

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And so you imagine if we were
400,000 years farther down

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:20.910 align:middle line:90%
the line.

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:23.150 align:middle line:84%
What if we were a million
years or 10 million years

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:24.090 align:middle line:90%
further down the line?

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:25.220 align:middle line:90%
What we could do.

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:29.330 align:middle line:90%


00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.300 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, according to this,
they created a new race

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:36.670 align:middle line:84%
using that and using the
most advanced race that

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:37.660 align:middle line:90%
was on the Earth.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:39.160 align:middle line:84%
That's real interesting
because when

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.470 align:middle line:84%
you go to the most advanced
race, which is what?

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:42.270 align:middle line:90%
The Cro-Magnon?

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:43.440 align:middle line:90%
Is that what it is?

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, it
jumps to the Homo sapien.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:50.200 align:middle line:90%
There's this-- the missing link.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.650 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows how we
got from here to here.

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:53.480 align:middle line:90%
It isn't possible.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:54.280 align:middle line:90%
There's no way.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.140 align:middle line:84%
We can't see the
evolutionary jump.

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:57.330 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what happened.

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:58.746 align:middle line:84%
According to the
Sumerian records,

00:15:58.746 --> 00:16:01.190 align:middle line:84%
it's because an outside
alien race came in here

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:04.440 align:middle line:84%
and messed with us, and
created this jump up

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.620 align:middle line:90%
to where we are right now.

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:08.610 align:middle line:90%


00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And according to Thoth,
there were seven of them

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:11.800 align:middle line:90%
that came together.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Again, I got this back
seven years earlier.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.195 align:middle line:90%
Seven people came together.

00:16:17.195 --> 00:16:19.570 align:middle line:84%
See, everything that happens
on a third dimensional level

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:22.905 align:middle line:84%
has a fourth dimensional
counterpart and higher--

00:16:22.905 --> 00:16:24.230 align:middle line:90%
or very often higher.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.870 align:middle line:90%


00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And there's much more involved
to just creating a race

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.890 align:middle line:84%
than just throwing a bunch
of chemicals together.

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:35.000 align:middle line:90%
There are other things.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.625 align:middle line:84%
There are grids that
have to be formed.

00:16:36.625 --> 00:16:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of stuff
that has to take place.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.350 align:middle line:84%
It is not as simple
as it may seem.

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And according to Thoth, on
a fourth dimensional level,

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.810 align:middle line:84%
there were seven
of the giants that

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:54.330 align:middle line:84%
came together and
dropped their bodies

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:57.640 align:middle line:84%
and merged themselves
into spheres of light,

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:02.040 align:middle line:84%
and that these formed the
flower of life pattern.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And then a flame appeared,
which was about four feet tall--

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.770 align:middle line:84%
a blue-white flame, which
was pure prana, which

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:11.344 align:middle line:84%
is life force
energy, which became

00:17:11.344 --> 00:17:14.069 align:middle line:90%
the ovum, the female ovum.

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And then that was put
into the Halls of Amenti,

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:21.260 align:middle line:84%
which is a dimensional
fold in space

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.770 align:middle line:84%
that the Egyptians talk
about, which is really

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:28.480 align:middle line:84%
the womb of the Earth, which
is where the star seed and all

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:32.590 align:middle line:84%
the 500 million years of
races have been created from.

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:34.210 align:middle line:90%
This is a whole other subject.

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:38.380 align:middle line:84%
This Halls of Amenti is
usually out beyond the bubble.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.020 align:middle line:84%
There is a membrane outside
the Earth we don't know about,

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:43.460 align:middle line:90%
which is 440,000 miles out.

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And on the other side
of that is usually where

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:46.775 align:middle line:90%
the Halls of Amenti is located.

00:17:46.775 --> 00:17:50.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a dimensional fold time
that moves with the Earth,

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.850 align:middle line:84%
but on one overtone
higher than the Earth.

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:54.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's not visible
to the Earth,

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:56.140 align:middle line:90%
but it's very accessible.

00:17:56.140 --> 00:18:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's folded into the shape
outward-- the outside of it,

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.100 align:middle line:90%
anyway.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:02.641 align:middle line:84%
It's folded into
the shape of a womb.

00:18:02.641 --> 00:18:05.640 align:middle line:90%


00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, the flame
was placed there.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as it was placed
there, according to Thoth,

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:14.430 align:middle line:90%
there was a family.

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:18.060 align:middle line:84%
32 members-- of those,
16 males and 16 females--

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:22.840 align:middle line:84%
from the star Sirius, who
were the male outside,

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:26.340 align:middle line:84%
the sperm that comes
from outside the system.

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.100 align:middle line:84%
They came from out--
the alien aspect,

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:32.760 align:middle line:84%
it came from outside the system
to come in and be the daddy.

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And it was all
prearranged and ordained

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:37.390 align:middle line:90%
on all kinds of levels.

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And so they came from
outside the system.

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.680 align:middle line:84%
The Anunnaki put flame
inside the system,

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.470 align:middle line:84%
put it into the
womb of the Earth.

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:47.740 align:middle line:90%
And the Sirian race came in.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:52.130 align:middle line:84%
These are like
10-to-16-foot-high beings also.

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Both the Anunnaki
and the Sirians

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:58.650 align:middle line:84%
were these giants, these tall
people, and on very high level

00:18:58.650 --> 00:18:59.590 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:01.560 align:middle line:84%
They're on the part where
they think an orange,

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.790 align:middle line:84%
they could have one in
their hand and peel it.

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:07.770 align:middle line:84%
They thought that
there were 32 slabs

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:10.490 align:middle line:84%
of rose quartz granite laying
there around the flame,

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:11.620 align:middle line:90%
and there was.

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And they laid down male, female,
male, female around this flame,

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:19.480 align:middle line:84%
and merged or conceived
with the flame, the ovum.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:22.205 align:middle line:84%
For 2,000 years, they
merged with this.

00:19:22.205 --> 00:19:25.520 align:middle line:84%
You see, in human terms,
birth takes so long,

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.075 align:middle line:84%
and conception takes so
long, and the whole process

00:19:28.075 --> 00:19:31.180 align:middle line:84%
is nine months But on
the planetary level,

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.600 align:middle line:90%
it's much longer.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:36.660 align:middle line:84%
It's the same process, just
much, much, much longer.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And so they laid
there for 2,000 years

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:42.410 align:middle line:84%
conceiving until the
first one was created.

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And then meanwhile, on the
third dimensional level,

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:47.280 align:middle line:84%
according to the
Sumerian records,

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:51.300 align:middle line:84%
they were doing the flask tubes
and creating the proper one.

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:52.520 align:middle line:90%
And then what do they do?

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.300 align:middle line:84%
They bring seven
females together.

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.300 align:middle line:90%
It's right there in the records.

00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:59.150 align:middle line:90%
Seven females were brought in.

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And the ovums,
which were created,

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:06.390 align:middle line:84%
were placed into the wombs of
these seven females, which then

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:10.330 align:middle line:84%
gave birth to these seven
human babies, both male

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:12.167 align:middle line:90%
and female babies.

00:20:12.167 --> 00:20:13.375 align:middle line:90%
Only the babies were sterile.

00:20:13.375 --> 00:20:16.976 align:middle line:90%
They could not procreate.

00:20:16.976 --> 00:20:17.850 align:middle line:90%
And you can see them.

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:20.430 align:middle line:84%
Here's these big, tall
Anunnaki sitting there

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:22.895 align:middle line:84%
with these little,
tiny, naked humans.

00:20:22.895 --> 00:20:24.925 align:middle line:84%
And they're holding
them in their hands.

00:20:24.925 --> 00:20:28.040 align:middle line:84%
If they stood up, the humans
would be like about that high.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And here's these big, huge,
tall, 10-to16-foot tall

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.761 align:middle line:90%
Anunnaki that are doing this.

00:20:34.761 --> 00:20:36.010 align:middle line:90%
And it's right on the records.

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:39.780 align:middle line:84%
You can see for yourself,
because a lot of this

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.620 align:middle line:90%
is not just words.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:44.000 align:middle line:84%
But it's also visual,
drawing and stuff

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.395 align:middle line:90%
that they put on there.

00:20:45.395 --> 00:20:49.080 align:middle line:90%


00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:54.675 align:middle line:84%
And so our purpose, according to
the Sumerians, was to dig gold.

00:20:54.675 --> 00:20:57.740 align:middle line:90%
That's why we were created.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Then you go back to the actual
physical, archaeological

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:03.670 align:middle line:84%
records, and you go
back to-- well, first

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:05.940 align:middle line:84%
let me throw another
side trip in here.

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:09.880 align:middle line:84%
We had a theory called the Eve's
Theory, where they had checked

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:13.180 align:middle line:84%
the DNA-- and a particular
aspect of the DNA--

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.750 align:middle line:84%
and found an overlapping
process where

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:17.780 align:middle line:84%
they were able to
trace back through all

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:22.580 align:middle line:84%
the races of the world, back
to a single human being, which

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:26.870 align:middle line:84%
was this black female in
this very specific valley

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:29.600 align:middle line:90%
is in southeastern Africa.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.490 align:middle line:84%
Now some people are beginning
to debate that theory now.

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:35.370 align:middle line:84%
But still, the
evidence is incredible.

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:38.530 align:middle line:84%
Who knows about this and
what I'm talking about?

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:39.440 align:middle line:90%
Just a few people.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.240 align:middle line:90%
You'll see.

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.786 align:middle line:84%
It's, at the moment,
being debated.

00:21:41.786 --> 00:21:43.160 align:middle line:84%
But for a while,
it was accepted.

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And now they're
still debating it.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.180 align:middle line:10%
But it's real interesting to me.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And one point here is that the
very valley that they picked

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:52.990 align:middle line:84%
happened to be the one,
according to Sumerian records,

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:53.860 align:middle line:90%
where it all began.

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:56.620 align:middle line:90%


00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.080 align:middle line:90%
The same place.

00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And if you go into
that very valley--

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember the
name of it right now,

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:06.390 align:middle line:84%
but it's recorded in both the
books and in that other thing.

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:09.030 align:middle line:84%
You going into that valley,
they have found gold mines

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:18.480 align:middle line:84%
there-- ancient, ancient gold
mines going back 100,000 years,

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:23.260 align:middle line:84%
with Homo sapien bones in
and around the gold mine.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:30.805 align:middle line:84%
Homo sapiens mining gold
at least 100,000 years ago.

00:22:30.805 --> 00:22:36.780 align:middle line:84%
And what the heck are we hairy
barbarians mining gold for?

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:37.710 align:middle line:90%
It's a soft metal.

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:42.500 align:middle line:84%
It isn't something
that we can use

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:44.540 align:middle line:90%
to make tools or anything else.

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:45.962 align:middle line:90%
What's it for?

00:22:45.962 --> 00:22:52.514 align:middle line:84%
What good is gold, to
a primitive people?

00:22:52.514 --> 00:22:53.930 align:middle line:84%
These goal mines,
by the way, they

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:55.880 align:middle line:84%
found them all the way
from 100,000 years.

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.110 align:middle line:84%
They found them to
80, 60, and as early

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:00.680 align:middle line:90%
as only 20,000 years ago.

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:06.200 align:middle line:84%
We were still mining gold
only 20,000 years ago.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.494 align:middle line:90%
Still doing it.

00:23:07.494 --> 00:23:08.886 align:middle line:90%
>>Was that during the Ice Age?

00:23:08.886 --> 00:23:11.460 align:middle line:90%


00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:12.260 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, probably.

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:14.660 align:middle line:84%
You've got to realize these ice
ages are coming and going out

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:15.460 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:18.240 align:middle line:84%
The whole planet doesn't
go over with ice.

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:22.850 align:middle line:84%
Basically, you might say the
ice caps recede further down.

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:27.450 align:middle line:84%
The centers of the
Earth is still not

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:32.110 align:middle line:84%
frozen over, but very
cold compared to normal.

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:34.570 align:middle line:84%
We've survived this
for millions of years.

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:37.620 align:middle line:84%
We've managed to survive these
ice ages, one after another,

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:39.940 align:middle line:90%
for millions of years.

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:43.672 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, when you
look at everything

00:23:43.672 --> 00:23:45.880 align:middle line:84%
and you start throwing in
that whole thing of the ice

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:48.130 align:middle line:84%
age that's going on, it makes
stuff even more complex.

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:50.610 align:middle line:90%


00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:56.962 align:middle line:84%
So if this is true-- I
mean, it's outrageous.

00:23:56.962 --> 00:23:58.420 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to
think that we were

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.970 align:middle line:90%
made to be slaves to dig gold.

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:03.810 align:middle line:84%
We want to see us as
more noble than that.

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:07.520 align:middle line:90%
But who knows?

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.025 align:middle line:84%
This is what the most
ancient records in the world

00:24:10.025 --> 00:24:12.360 align:middle line:90%
have to say about ourselves.

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And these are not just
a few isolated records

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:15.760 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.869 align:middle line:84%
100,000 records that
are being un-found.

00:24:18.869 --> 00:24:20.785 align:middle line:84%
All the ancient cities
that were in the Bible,

00:24:20.785 --> 00:24:22.870 align:middle line:84%
which they thought for
a long time were myth,

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:25.020 align:middle line:90%
have now been uncovered.

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And they now know where
all the ancient Sumerian

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:30.370 align:middle line:84%
cities are, which run through
southern Iraq-- Babylonia

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:31.752 align:middle line:90%
is in southern Iraq.

00:24:31.752 --> 00:24:33.210 align:middle line:84%
All these ancient
ones, they've all

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:35.120 align:middle line:84%
discovered where they all
are and they're finding them.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.578 align:middle line:84%
And they're getting all records,
and they're being-- dig up

00:24:37.578 --> 00:24:39.170 align:middle line:90%
all this ancient stuff.

00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:42.240 align:middle line:84%
It's no longer
just myth anymore.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And so now according to
the Sumerian records, one

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:57.200 align:middle line:84%
of the-- two of these
brothers, Anunnaki and one

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.000 align:middle line:90%
of the other ones.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:58.960 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.710 align:middle line:84%
The major cities of
the Sumerian cities

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:03.840 align:middle line:84%
ran up through the
Middle East, up

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.350 align:middle line:84%
in there, which
was not a desert,

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:08.840 align:middle line:84%
but was a dense jungle
because the whole climate

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.080 align:middle line:90%
was different.

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And they had these incredible,
beautiful cities there,

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:14.790 align:middle line:84%
with these huge gardens
that surrounded in

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:18.440 align:middle line:84%
and around these cities,
which took a lot of work.

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And so according to
Sumerian records,

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:24.180 align:middle line:84%
a great deal of the
gold miner workers

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:29.150 align:middle line:84%
were brought up to these
gardens to work the gardens.

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And it was there that
one day, Anunnaki,

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:37.645 align:middle line:84%
whose name means "snake,"
told Adam and Eve, according

00:25:37.645 --> 00:25:41.640 align:middle line:84%
to the Sumerian records,
to eat of this tree.

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:45.830 align:middle line:84%
What the tree would do-- the
tree good and evil would do

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:49.000 align:middle line:84%
is that it would
make them procreate.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.190 align:middle line:84%
They'd be able to have babies
if they ate of this tree.

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:54.840 align:middle line:90%


00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And so they did it,
according to this.

00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:04.962 align:middle line:84%
And then, Enlil's brother came
in, who was the other one,

00:26:04.962 --> 00:26:06.670 align:middle line:84%
and remember, it says
right in the bible,

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:08.470 align:middle line:90%
he's walking through the garden.

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:10.520 align:middle line:84%
This is God walking
through the garden.

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:14.794 align:middle line:84%
And he comes across, and
they were hiding from him.

00:26:14.794 --> 00:26:15.960 align:middle line:90%
And he had to call for them.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And when they came
out-- I mean, he

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:22.690 align:middle line:84%
had no supernatural powers
or anything else like that.

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:25.390 align:middle line:84%
He saw them, that
they were naked,

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:26.940 align:middle line:90%
and saw that they were hiding.

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:29.147 align:middle line:84%
And then he realized
that what they

00:26:29.147 --> 00:26:30.980 align:middle line:84%
had done, that they had
eaten from the tree.

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:39.370 align:middle line:90%


00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And this was a
really gentle person.

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:43.750 align:middle line:90%
He did not kill them.

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:44.630 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:46.460 align:middle line:90%
He just made them leave.

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And he monitored them
and watched them.

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:51.860 align:middle line:90%
And they began to multiply.

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And he recorded all their
names and who they were.

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And we kept track of
all that, which was all

00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:57.670 align:middle line:90%
written down for a long time.

00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:00.610 align:middle line:90%


00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:03.410 align:middle line:84%
But then when you start
going out from there

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:07.560 align:middle line:84%
and you start studying
what happened after that,

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:11.250 align:middle line:84%
this is where I'm going to
start taking us out further.

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:13.910 align:middle line:84%
There's some important
points in all of this that

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:16.280 align:middle line:90%
need to be brought forward.

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:18.350 align:middle line:84%
So we have two kinds
of races going on here.

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:20.050 align:middle line:84%
We have the one that
they were working

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:21.462 align:middle line:90%
the mines, which were sterile.

00:27:21.462 --> 00:27:23.420 align:middle line:84%
The only way they can
make more of those babies

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:26.666 align:middle line:84%
is to put the ovum
inside the uterus of one

00:27:26.666 --> 00:27:29.830 align:middle line:84%
of the female Anunnaki
and for her to give birth

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:31.610 align:middle line:90%
to this little baby.

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:33.869 align:middle line:84%
That was the only way they
could get more of them,

00:27:33.869 --> 00:27:36.160 align:middle line:84%
and so they kept doing until
they got what they wanted.

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And I guess if one of them died,
they'd just make more of them.

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:42.395 align:middle line:84%
We also then had this other
race that was separate from us.

00:27:42.395 --> 00:27:45.560 align:middle line:84%
They could procreate on its
own, which they kept watching.

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:49.740 align:middle line:90%


00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And from there, you see
many, many travels around.

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:56.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, according to Thoth, when
he says is seven years ago,

00:27:56.830 --> 00:28:00.060 align:middle line:84%
the first human beings
came out on an island

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:03.564 align:middle line:84%
just to the west of
Africa, Southern Africa.

00:28:03.564 --> 00:28:05.980 align:middle line:84%
When he first told me this,
it all sounded kind of strange

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:07.605 align:middle line:84%
because I hadn't read
any of this stuff

00:28:07.605 --> 00:28:09.540 align:middle line:84%
about Africa and the
Sumerian records,

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:12.290 align:middle line:84%
because I always thought of
garden of Eden as being up,

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:15.840 align:middle line:84%
you know, more in
the where, you know,

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:18.320 align:middle line:90%
we generally think about it.

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.280 align:middle line:84%
But he was saying,
no, the original place

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:25.110 align:middle line:84%
was to the west of Africa
on this very large island.

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the first
human beings came out

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:30.320 align:middle line:90%
onto the surface.

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And the name of that island
is consistent throughout

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:38.347 align:middle line:90%
the African creation stories.

00:28:38.347 --> 00:28:39.555 align:middle line:90%
And it's called Gondwanaland.

00:28:39.555 --> 00:28:42.835 align:middle line:90%


00:28:42.835 --> 00:28:44.960 align:middle line:10%
You can read the creation
stories, which I've done.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.751 align:middle line:10%
I went out and read a
whole bunch of these.

00:28:46.751 --> 00:28:48.710 align:middle line:10%
Along all the western
shores of Africa,

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:51.750 align:middle line:10%
they all have different ideas
about how creation took place.

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:55.890 align:middle line:10%
But they all consistently say
that we came from an island

00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:58.120 align:middle line:10%
to the west, called
Gondwanaland.

00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:58.920 align:middle line:90%
They all say that.

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.590 align:middle line:84%
Every one of them
I read, anyway,

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:03.720 align:middle line:84%
though they have real different
ideas about the rest of it.

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And Thoth says that's
where we started out, which

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:13.110 align:middle line:90%
is this place down in here.

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:16.320 align:middle line:84%
It was a large-- it could
almost be a continent.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And it could've
been touching here.

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:22.280 align:middle line:84%
Or it may have been partly
touching and party separated.

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:23.240 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:26.210 align:middle line:84%
When he gave me all of
this [SNAP] like that,

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:29.800 align:middle line:84%
and that was the one piece that
I never got clear in my mind.

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:32.140 align:middle line:84%
Though from then on in,
I got it pretty clear.

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.060 align:middle line:90%
And I'm still not really sure.

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:38.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it was
this big, smaller.

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, I drew this
drawing a long time ago.

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And then we are-- they basically
isolated us for a long time

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:49.140 align:middle line:84%
until we got to a certain
level of development.

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And then they took us
into southeastern Africa

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:55.175 align:middle line:84%
and begin working the
mines, and then from there,

00:29:55.175 --> 00:29:58.940 align:middle line:84%
up into the area of
Iraq and up in there.

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And then from there,
I believe that it

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:08.620 align:middle line:84%
was Cain who went into the
Americas, what we now call

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:12.130 align:middle line:90%
South America, and in there.

00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And but there was
another aspect of this.

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:23.130 align:middle line:84%
The part that came out of
the Adam and Eve part, which

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:27.190 align:middle line:84%
evidently was the part that was
allowed to proceed after this

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:27.990 align:middle line:90%
went down.

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:33.900 align:middle line:84%
There was a huge-- we stayed in
here for a long period of time.

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And I don't really
know what it was.

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:38.130 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about tens
of thousands of years.

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:42.210 align:middle line:84%
Until finally, there was a point
here when we had a pole shift,

00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:45.190 align:middle line:84%
and this whole
aspect sank and left.

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:47.670 align:middle line:90%
And it was gone.

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:51.200 align:middle line:84%
Again, I'm not real clear on
the details of all of this.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:55.690 align:middle line:84%
But one way or another, the
survivors of Adam and Eves

00:30:55.690 --> 00:31:00.560 align:middle line:84%
up in here made their way
over to this area over here

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.420 align:middle line:90%
into the Pacific.

00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Exactly how that-- and
according to Thoth,

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:09.680 align:middle line:84%
this area here, when it went
down, this area came up.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.310 align:middle line:84%
They were simultaneously
on the same moment

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:13.185 align:middle line:90%
when this took place.

00:31:13.185 --> 00:31:15.890 align:middle line:90%


00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And whether or not the Anunnaki
deliberately brought them

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:23.920 align:middle line:84%
over to here, which may be part
of what happened, I don't know.

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't have Thoth here to
ask these questions anymore.

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:29.420 align:middle line:84%
So there's-- I don't have the
ability to find out these kind

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:30.500 align:middle line:90%
of details.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:33.640 align:middle line:84%
How they got there, what
happened, how-- I don't know.

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:36.640 align:middle line:84%
But at one point or another,
they got over to here.

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, we're now talking
about the procreation aspect,

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:45.130 align:middle line:84%
the Adam and Eve aspect,
not the other part of us,

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:48.460 align:middle line:84%
which is, at this
point, completely gone.

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:51.780 align:middle line:84%
Because when they
stopped, and they died,

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:53.310 align:middle line:90%
there's nobody to replace them.

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:54.110 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:54.910 align:middle line:90%
They were gone.

00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:56.700 align:middle line:90%
They were all sterile.

00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:58.850 align:middle line:84%
So at one point, we
began in this area

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:01.530 align:middle line:90%
here, which we now call Lemuria.

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:11.260 align:middle line:84%
However, Lemuria was to
us in the 20th century,

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:14.758 align:middle line:84%
we tend to think of it as a
kind of a myth or something that

00:32:14.758 --> 00:32:17.380 align:middle line:84%
maybe kind of happened
or didn't happen.

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:22.720 align:middle line:84%
But there was a time in about
1910, '11, '12 in there,

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:30.810 align:middle line:84%
1915 when we began
to rapidly waken up.

00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:34.150 align:middle line:84%
The process that's now going
on right now started then.

00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:37.365 align:middle line:84%
And then in 1914, World War
I came along and just blew

00:32:37.365 --> 00:32:38.680 align:middle line:90%
us right out the water.

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until
the '60s that we

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.700 align:middle line:90%
began to waken up again.

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:47.930 align:middle line:84%
But during that time
of the early 1900s,

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:51.190 align:middle line:84%
we have proof that
Lemuria was there.

00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And then at this point, we've
completely forgotten the proof

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:55.370 align:middle line:90%
that we had.

00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:56.990 align:middle line:84%
There was people
like James Churchward

00:32:56.990 --> 00:33:01.520 align:middle line:84%
and Le Plongean,
a Frenchman, who

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.854 align:middle line:90%
were very famous in tracking.

00:33:03.854 --> 00:33:05.520 align:middle line:84%
They were in the
papers all time talking

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:09.330 align:middle line:84%
about Lemuria and Atlantis,
and the possibilities

00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:11.430 align:middle line:90%
of all of this.

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And Churchward wrote
several books on it.

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:16.870 align:middle line:90%
So both of them did, actually.

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And one of the subjects,
there's a book written

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:22.970 align:middle line:84%
called "Atlantis, the
Mother of Empires."

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:26.590 align:middle line:84%
I think it was about 1913,
somewhere back in there.

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:29.330 align:middle line:84%
It's an old book that
I got my hands on.

00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And there was some
information in that book

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:36.740 align:middle line:84%
that was very, very amazing
that they had that information.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.200 align:middle line:10%
Back as far as
that time, they had

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:44.030 align:middle line:10%
discovered near the
area of Easter Island

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:50.090 align:middle line:10%
that there were these coral
rings that extended out

00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:54.760 align:middle line:10%
in the Pacific Ocean as far as
they could determine, going out

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:55.560 align:middle line:10%
in there.

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:58.360 align:middle line:10%
The coral rings were
unusual in the sense

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:01.100 align:middle line:10%
that coral can
only grow 150 feet

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:03.860 align:middle line:10%
below the surface of the water.

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:07.840 align:middle line:10%
These rings were
1,800 feet deep,

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:12.429 align:middle line:10%
meaning that the island
had to be above the water

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:16.280 align:middle line:10%
and slowly come down, very
slowly, so that the coral can

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.659 align:middle line:10%
continue to form.

00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:20.655 align:middle line:84%
And yet you could
see how slow that

00:34:20.655 --> 00:34:22.280 align:middle line:84%
would have to be for
the coral to form,

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:25.850 align:middle line:84%
and yet for it to continue
and not die, and then

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:28.243 align:middle line:90%
end up being 1,800 feet deep.

00:34:28.243 --> 00:34:30.659 align:middle line:84%
And so they saw these
things going off in there.

00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And then at the
same time, they had

00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:35.360 align:middle line:84%
discovered that the
fauna and the flora that

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.300 align:middle line:84%
stretched from Easter
Island all the way up--

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:40.880 align:middle line:84%
there's a series of islands
that goes up the-- from Easter

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:43.139 align:middle line:84%
Island, all the way up
through the Tahitian Islands,

00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:46.000 align:middle line:84%
all the way up to
the Hawaiian Islands.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.219 align:middle line:84%
And the fauna and the
flora on all that,

00:34:49.219 --> 00:34:52.180 align:middle line:84%
just that chain of islands
that stretches through there,

00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:52.980 align:middle line:90%
is all the same.

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:53.839 align:middle line:90%
It's identical.

00:34:53.839 --> 00:34:56.780 align:middle line:84%
There's the same plants, the
same trees, the same bugs,

00:34:56.780 --> 00:35:00.770 align:middle line:84%
the same bacteria, the same
everything else like that.

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And there's no way that
that could have taken place

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:08.490 align:middle line:84%
unless there had been a land
mass much closer, stretched

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:09.290 align:middle line:90%
in there.

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:11.980 align:middle line:84%
So the understanding of that,
along with all these coral

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:16.190 align:middle line:84%
rings that were stressed under
there that were on the floor,

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:18.770 align:middle line:84%
they surmised that there
had to be a continent.

00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:21.850 align:middle line:84%
Though the continent was not a
physical continent, according

00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:23.060 align:middle line:90%
to Thoth.

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:26.470 align:middle line:84%
It was a series of
islands, lots, and lots,

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:31.710 align:middle line:84%
and lots of islands, forming
what would be like a land mass,

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:35.070 align:middle line:84%
but with no solid,
total complete length.

00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:37.010 align:middle line:84%
There was just
thousands and thousands

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:39.860 align:middle line:84%
of islands that
stretched down there.

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:47.610 align:middle line:84%
That outer length running
from, basically, from Kauai,

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:49.250 align:middle line:84%
all the way down
to Easter Island

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:51.465 align:middle line:84%
was the western
shores of Lemuria.

00:35:51.465 --> 00:35:55.530 align:middle line:10%
And the rest of
it all went under.

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:59.955 align:middle line:10%
And we began to progress
in that spot to a level

00:35:59.955 --> 00:36:06.660 align:middle line:10%
that we are just now
beginning to return to.

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:09.720 align:middle line:84%
We progressed to a
very, very high level

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:12.450 align:middle line:84%
of technology, a different
kind of technology,

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:15.880 align:middle line:84%
totally unheard and
unknown these days.

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:18.720 align:middle line:84%
It was a right brain
technology, female,

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:24.700 align:middle line:84%
based upon psychotronics
and these kinds of things

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:27.490 align:middle line:84%
that we are just beginning
to become a little aware of.

00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Only they had developed
that to the level

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:34.134 align:middle line:84%
that we have developed our
left brain, logical technology.

00:36:34.134 --> 00:36:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And they were able to
do-- you can do anything

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:38.560 align:middle line:84%
from that aspect, as you
will, from a female aspect,

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.710 align:middle line:90%
as well as you can from there.

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:43.900 align:middle line:90%
And we were becoming a female.

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:47.810 align:middle line:84%
An evolutionary pattern has to
become either male or female,

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:49.640 align:middle line:84%
and we were becoming
a young female.

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:52.870 align:middle line:84%
By the time that Lemuria was
finished, before it went down,

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:58.210 align:middle line:84%
we were equivalent to
about a 12-year-old girl.

00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And everything was
going very well.

00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:07.814 align:middle line:84%
And the Sirians who monitored
all of this and have

00:37:07.814 --> 00:37:08.980 align:middle line:90%
remained-- they're immortal.

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:12.050 align:middle line:84%
They remained alive during
this whole time watching it.

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Everything was going
just great and fine.

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And the Anunnaki, also, were
not going to mess with this.

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:22.670 align:middle line:84%
Everything was going
just great and fine.

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:23.910 align:middle line:90%
There was no problems.

00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:26.656 align:middle line:84%
It was looking really,
really, really good.

00:37:26.656 --> 00:37:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And then something
happened that we

00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:33.790 align:middle line:90%
have never quite survived from.

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:37.622 align:middle line:90%
We've never come out of it.

00:37:37.622 --> 00:37:41.167 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to have to go
in about five minutes to lunch.

00:37:41.167 --> 00:37:43.250 align:middle line:84%
But when we get back, I'll
tell you what happened.

00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:43.613 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:37:43.613 --> 00:37:44.413 align:middle line:90%
[CHATTER]

00:37:44.413 --> 00:37:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's the most
important part.

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:49.595 align:middle line:84%
It's what happened when we
shifted from there to Atlantis.

00:37:49.595 --> 00:37:53.580 align:middle line:84%
Some things took place
that changed the course

00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:56.040 align:middle line:90%
of our evolutionary pattern.

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:58.970 align:middle line:84%
There is one more bit of
information I need to put out.

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And that is-- and
this is the part

00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:05.140 align:middle line:84%
that Zecharia Sitchin
did not understand.

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:12.610 align:middle line:84%
When Enlil came in to the
planet from the 13th--

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:14.970 align:middle line:84%
from the 12th planet, which
is really the 10th planet--

00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:18.410 align:middle line:84%
we're counting the sun
and the moon on that.

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:22.860 align:middle line:84%
When he came in, he
came into the oceans.

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:26.560 align:middle line:84%
He landed in the oceans, and
he spent a great deal of time

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:28.380 align:middle line:90%
in the oceans.

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And when he came
out of the oceans,

00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:33.110 align:middle line:90%
he was half fish and half man.

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:36.780 align:middle line:90%


00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:39.502 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly,
he becomes this man.

00:38:39.502 --> 00:38:41.210 align:middle line:84%
But the original
thing's shown coming out

00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:44.425 align:middle line:84%
of water with-- like
a mermaid or a merman

00:38:44.425 --> 00:38:46.090 align:middle line:90%
coming out of there.

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And Zecharia never
understood what that was.

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:51.830 align:middle line:84%
But what was going
on was the race,

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:54.830 align:middle line:84%
we had a race here, a
very conscious race,

00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:57.630 align:middle line:90%
more conscious than they were.

00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
dolphins and the whales.

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:05.980 align:middle line:84%
The dolphins have been here for
a minimum of 35 million years,

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:08.580 align:middle line:90%
I think is the minimum.

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:11.981 align:middle line:84%
But the whales go
back 500 million years

00:39:11.981 --> 00:39:13.480 align:middle line:84%
to the very beginning
of the memory.

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:15.550 align:middle line:84%
They hold the
memory of the Earth.

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And I don't remember
exac-- Elizabeth,

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:22.280 align:middle line:84%
do you remember how long
the whales-- the dolphins

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.260 align:middle line:90%
have been here?

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:24.730 align:middle line:90%
Just as what you said.

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:25.670 align:middle line:90%
35 million?

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:26.025 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:26.025 --> 00:39:27.286 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I think that's right.

00:39:27.286 --> 00:39:30.800 align:middle line:90%


00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:33.700 align:middle line:84%
So they were here long before
the Anunnaki came here,

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:38.340 align:middle line:90%
which was only 400,000 or so.

00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And they were on the
same, really, a higher

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:43.370 align:middle line:90%
level of consciousness.

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:45.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, what I haven't
explained of all

00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:50.920 align:middle line:84%
this is that the dolphins have
this connection back to Sirius.

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And on Sirius, again, not
to a star, but to Sirius B.

00:39:56.850 --> 00:39:59.980 align:middle line:84%
The third planet out,
there's this planet,

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:05.490 align:middle line:84%
which is almost pure water with
a little tiny bit of land mass.

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:08.376 align:middle line:84%
There's a land--
I've been there.

00:40:08.376 --> 00:40:09.750 align:middle line:84%
I knew of this
place for a while.

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:14.110 align:middle line:84%
There's a land mass there
about the size of California.

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And there's a land mass there
about the size of Australia.

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:18.080 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:19.190 align:middle line:90%
There's no more land.

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:20.950 align:middle line:84%
There might be a speck
or tow somewhere,

00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:23.180 align:middle line:84%
but there's no more
land up anywhere.

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And almost the whole
planet is cetacean

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:28.517 align:middle line:84%
except for a few
humanoid beings, which

00:40:28.517 --> 00:40:30.100 align:middle line:84%
you're going to look
and see what they

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:31.670 align:middle line:90%
look like here in a little bit.

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:34.270 align:middle line:90%
They look very human-like.

00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:36.430 align:middle line:90%
And they are being phased out.

00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:39.280 align:middle line:84%
They are slowly
turning into dolphins.

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:41.079 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't got
to the place where I

00:40:41.079 --> 00:40:42.370 align:middle line:90%
explain why they're doing that.

00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:45.174 align:middle line:90%


00:40:45.174 --> 00:40:46.590 align:middle line:84%
But when they're
on earth, they're

00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:51.540 align:middle line:90%
primarily the dolphin aspect.

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And Enlil, when he came in,
he went to the consciousness

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:55.400 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:57.000 align:middle line:84%
He went to the
dolphins, or perhaps

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.230 align:middle line:90%
the whales and the dolphins.

00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
direct communication

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:07.086 align:middle line:84%
first with that
before they came out.

00:41:07.086 --> 00:41:08.940 align:middle line:90%
It had to take place.

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:16.035 align:middle line:84%
And when the Anunnaki
began to create our race,

00:41:16.035 --> 00:41:18.350 align:middle line:84%
it was only natural
for them to ask

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:22.940 align:middle line:84%
the assistance of the Sumerians
because when you're talking--

00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:28.547 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Sirians,
rather-- because that's

00:41:28.547 --> 00:41:29.630 align:middle line:90%
what you're talking about.

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:31.005 align:middle line:84%
When you talking
about a dolphin,

00:41:31.005 --> 00:41:33.670 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about
a Sirian being.

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:35.230 align:middle line:84%
It's an extraterrestrial
race that's

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:36.780 align:middle line:90%
been here for a long time.

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:39.440 align:middle line:90%
So it's now a terrestrial race.

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:45.910 align:middle line:84%
But its original source
is off-planet from Sirius.

00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:46.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:48.790 align:middle line:90%
Whatever happened to the giants?

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:53.480 align:middle line:90%


00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:56.945 align:middle line:84%
The original 32 members of the
Sirian race are still here.

00:41:56.945 --> 00:42:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And a certain number
of the Anunnaki

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:03.630 align:middle line:84%
are also still here,
though they can't,

00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:09.250 align:middle line:84%
because of our level of
awareness where we are right

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:11.702 align:middle line:84%
now, they can make
themselves directly known,

00:42:11.702 --> 00:42:14.090 align:middle line:90%
though they did in the past.

00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:14.895 align:middle line:90%
And I'll show you.

00:42:14.895 --> 00:42:18.800 align:middle line:84%
They did in the time in
Egypt, only for a short time.

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:22.720 align:middle line:90%


00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:24.540 align:middle line:90%
And they will again.

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:26.940 align:middle line:90%
We will see them for sure.

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:27.740 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:29.239 align:middle line:84%
That's one guarantee
I can give you.

00:42:29.239 --> 00:42:30.615 align:middle line:84%
We will see them
again, for sure.

00:42:30.615 --> 00:42:31.414 align:middle line:90%
Is that--

00:42:31.414 --> 00:42:33.190 align:middle line:84%
Are some of these
Sirians, who might still

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:35.650 align:middle line:84%
be on our planet
living in the ocean,

00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:39.870 align:middle line:84%
like on a colony
of Oceana, perhaps?

00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:42.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, they have the
ability to do things

00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:45.380 align:middle line:84%
that we would say
are impossible.

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:47.540 align:middle line:84%
They can live
underwater, or they

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:51.880 align:middle line:84%
can live in-- they don't
need air like we need air,

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:55.930 align:middle line:84%
because they live on prana,
and prana's everywhere.

00:42:55.930 --> 00:42:59.280 align:middle line:84%
You could have them in a
totally, vacant, vacuumed-out

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:00.080 align:middle line:90%
room.

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:03.130 align:middle line:84%
They can do just fine
without any air whatsoever.

00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:05.730 align:middle line:90%


00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:10.660 align:middle line:84%
But this particular group, who
has been connected to us very

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:17.080 align:middle line:84%
strongly, and has been-- they
have a very specific place

00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:19.310 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of the
earth, inside the Earth

00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:21.620 align:middle line:90%
where they live.

00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And where the Anunnaki-- what
their relationship is and where

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:29.830 align:middle line:84%
they are, I don't really
know that one, though I

00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:31.540 align:middle line:90%
believe they're still here.

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:35.070 align:middle line:84%
When we get into the
more present-day time,

00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:41.330 align:middle line:84%
you'll understand what's going
on in their-- they're still

00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:45.230 align:middle line:84%
here, though I don't-- there
never has been very many

00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:46.582 align:middle line:90%
of them here.

00:43:46.582 --> 00:43:51.050 align:middle line:84%
You know, I mean, there
was only about 612 maximum.

00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:54.140 align:middle line:84%
It seems like
genetically engineered,

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:58.710 align:middle line:84%
interplanetary genetically
engineered slave labor

00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:01.810 align:middle line:84%
would be a big cosmic
no-no on the level

00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:05.486 align:middle line:84%
of violation of free will
and that sort of thing.

00:44:05.486 --> 00:44:08.630 align:middle line:84%
How does that fit
in with cosmic law,

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:12.160 align:middle line:84%
and also, why would beings
who are advanced enough

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:15.325 align:middle line:84%
to directly manifest things
not simply be able to manifest

00:44:15.325 --> 00:44:17.520 align:middle line:90%
the goal that they required?

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:21.279 align:middle line:84%
The Anunnaki were not advanced
enough to be able to do that.

00:44:21.279 --> 00:44:23.070 align:middle line:84%
They were not-- there
were in, like I said,

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:24.153 align:middle line:90%
they were in rocket ships.

00:44:24.153 --> 00:44:27.330 align:middle line:84%
You could see their ships with
flames coming out the back.

00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:29.290 align:middle line:90%
That's on the Sumerian records.

00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And so these are
people that are not

00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:38.970 align:middle line:84%
a whole lot evolved much further
than where we are right now.

00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And though they have
began to reach up

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:43.240 align:middle line:84%
into the higher
levels of awareness,

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:45.330 align:middle line:84%
you can just tell that
by their size, which

00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:47.370 align:middle line:90%
we'll talk about size later.

00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:54.830 align:middle line:84%
But they are-- our mommy aspect
was a rather low-level of life.

00:44:54.830 --> 00:44:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Our daddy was a much more
advanced level of life,

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:04.040 align:middle line:84%
far more advanced than the
mommy in terms of consciousness.

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.920 align:middle line:84%
But the one that
you must realize

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:10.150 align:middle line:84%
is that both of these races
were a product of the Lucifer

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:15.670 align:middle line:84%
rebellion and would
freely break laws.

00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And finally, connected with
that, what kind of soul

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:21.370 align:middle line:84%
would choose to
inhabit a body that

00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:25.190 align:middle line:84%
was designed to
slave labor, given

00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:27.820 align:middle line:84%
the idea that they would know
what their prospects were

00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:29.440 align:middle line:90%
in doing that.

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:30.690 align:middle line:90%
Well, we're one.

00:45:30.690 --> 00:45:33.966 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:33.966 --> 00:45:35.950 align:middle line:90%


00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:36.942 align:middle line:90%
We did it.

00:45:36.942 --> 00:45:37.934 align:middle line:90%
You and I did it.

00:45:37.934 --> 00:45:41.420 align:middle line:90%


00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Things aren't always
what they appear to be.

00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of a, you
known, an ego thought in a way.

00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:56.360 align:middle line:84%
From a higher level, if
there's an ultimate reason

00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:59.060 align:middle line:84%
beyond all of it down there,
there might be a reason.

00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:00.620 align:middle line:84%
We have obviously
taken for what's

00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:03.220 align:middle line:84%
been slave labor,
turned it around,

00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:05.110 align:middle line:90%
brought it in another direction.

00:46:05.110 --> 00:46:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're about to bring
it into another direction

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:13.276 align:middle line:84%
even beyond what the Lucifer
rebellion never dreamed of.

00:46:13.276 --> 00:46:20.240 align:middle line:90%
And so I mean, I don't know.

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:22.990 align:middle line:84%
What's happening here
is pretty remarkable

00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:26.380 align:middle line:84%
when we see the whole level of
what's going, which, I guess,

00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:29.600 align:middle line:90%
most of you have.

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:38.100 align:middle line:84%
This is a little more than what
the original intent ever was.

00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:41.520 align:middle line:84%
But the original, the beings
that were made to do gold,

00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:45.430 align:middle line:84%
to slave for gold,
realized that as soon

00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:48.550 align:middle line:84%
as the Anunnaki saw that
we had eaten of the tree,

00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:51.210 align:middle line:84%
they didn't have
us do gold anymore.

00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:53.260 align:middle line:84%
They had us go live on
our own and do our own

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:56.830 align:middle line:84%
and, OK, you're out
of this thing now.

00:46:56.830 --> 00:46:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Go over there and
start your own thing.

00:46:58.690 --> 00:47:00.649 align:middle line:84%
And they just allowed
us to keep going,

00:47:00.649 --> 00:47:01.940 align:middle line:90%
though they did try to kill us.

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Remember, if you read
the Sitchin books,

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:08.990 align:middle line:84%
according to the
records, they knew

00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:12.580 align:middle line:84%
that the Earth was going to be
destroyed by water, by flood.

00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:14.880 align:middle line:84%
They knew quite a
while in advance.

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And the plan was, according
to the Sumerian records,

00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:22.910 align:middle line:84%
was to get off the
surface in their ships

00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:25.700 align:middle line:90%
and allow us to be annihilated.

00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:27.815 align:middle line:84%
And it was Enlil
again, if i remember

00:47:27.815 --> 00:47:30.730 align:middle line:90%
right, who went to Moses.

00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:32.700 align:middle line:90%
And he was sworn not to tell.

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:33.500 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:34.490 align:middle line:90%
It was Enki.

00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:34.760 align:middle line:90%
Enki?

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:35.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:36.196 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm thinking of.

00:47:36.196 --> 00:47:37.160 align:middle line:90%
It was Enki.

00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:41.490 align:middle line:84%
It was Enki, again,
who was sworn not tell

00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:43.284 align:middle line:90%
that this was going to happen.

00:47:43.284 --> 00:47:45.200 align:middle line:84%
So what he did is he
didn't tell him directly.

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:46.640 align:middle line:90%
He went and told a wall.

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:48.130 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:51.340 align:middle line:84%
But he knew that Moses was on
the other side of the wall.

00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:52.140 align:middle line:90%
Moses?

00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:52.480 align:middle line:90%
Noah.

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:52.780 align:middle line:90%
Noah.

00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:54.620 align:middle line:84%
Noah was on the other
side of the wall.

00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:55.420 align:middle line:90%
Noah.

00:47:55.420 --> 00:48:02.925 align:middle line:84%
And so he violated, basically,
the trust they would not tell.

00:48:02.925 --> 00:48:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And he told Noah,
and prepared Noah.

00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:09.779 align:middle line:84%
When Anunnaki went up into
space, and they were all

00:48:09.779 --> 00:48:11.820 align:middle line:84%
crammed in their ships
because they didn't really

00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:13.760 align:middle line:84%
have enough ships for all
these people to get in there.

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.134 align:middle line:90%
They were all crammed in there.

00:48:15.134 --> 00:48:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And they were orbiting
around the earth,

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:20.090 align:middle line:84%
and they saw the incredible
destruction that was happening.

00:48:20.090 --> 00:48:24.150 align:middle line:84%
They all began to cry, and began
to realize how said it was,

00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:27.820 align:middle line:84%
and that they didn't
really want us to die.

00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's when they found
out that Noah survived.

00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:33.835 align:middle line:84%
And they were actually
happy that Noah

00:48:33.835 --> 00:48:38.500 align:middle line:84%
had survived this one, at
least according to the records.

00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:44.440 align:middle line:84%
But [LAUGHS] we have
an interesting race

00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:45.920 align:middle line:90%
that we have got there.

00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And so we are the
product and development

00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:52.460 align:middle line:84%
of the Lucifer rebellion,
all the way through

00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:56.280 align:middle line:90%
from beginning to end.

00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of things that are

00:48:58.060 --> 00:48:59.990 align:middle line:84%
going on in the
universe that are not

00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:02.924 align:middle line:90%
according to galactic law.

00:49:02.924 --> 00:49:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And though this may have
been allowed by galactic law.

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:10.200 align:middle line:84%
It could've been,
depending on-- I

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:12.950 align:middle line:84%
don't know if they had
permission to start this

00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:13.750 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:15.250 align:middle line:90%
Thoth never told me.

00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:16.703 align:middle line:84%
And it's not in
Sumerian records.

00:49:16.703 --> 00:49:19.286 align:middle line:84%
They don't talk about the higher
dimensional levels of things.

00:49:19.286 --> 00:49:22.060 align:middle line:84%
They talk about pretty much
what happened on earth,

00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:23.356 align:middle line:90%
and that's it.

00:49:23.356 --> 00:49:27.495 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't know if they had
permission to do that or not.

00:49:27.495 --> 00:49:31.490 align:middle line:90%


00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:32.970 align:middle line:84%
But I would imagine
they would not

00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:35.705 align:middle line:84%
have-- I don't think-- I
kind of doubt that they could

00:49:35.705 --> 00:49:38.295 align:middle line:84%
have got permission to do
that, at least not, you know,

00:49:38.295 --> 00:49:39.095 align:middle line:90%
legally.

00:49:39.095 --> 00:49:42.660 align:middle line:90%


00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:44.420 align:middle line:10%
They became aware.

00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:46.360 align:middle line:10%
It became the holy trinity.

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:50.060 align:middle line:10%
She became aware of
him as a divine being.

00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:52.190 align:middle line:10%
And he became aware of
her as a divine being.

00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And they both became aware of
the baby as a divine being,

00:49:56.130 --> 00:49:59.030 align:middle line:84%
in such a way that
it transformed them.

00:49:59.030 --> 00:50:04.084 align:middle line:90%
And they never died, anymore.

00:50:04.084 --> 00:50:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And after a long time went by,
and they were still around,

00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:07.775 align:middle line:90%
there was no doubt about it.

00:50:07.775 --> 00:50:09.690 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And everybody
else was dropping by,

00:50:09.690 --> 00:50:10.882 align:middle line:90%
and they kept staying on.

00:50:10.882 --> 00:50:12.215 align:middle line:90%
They eventually formed a school.

00:50:12.215 --> 00:50:15.820 align:middle line:10%
And the school's name was
the Naacal Mystery School.

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:21.490 align:middle line:10%
And it was one of the oldest
mystery schools in the world.

00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:26.267 align:middle line:10%
And it was N double-A
C-A-L or N double-A K-L,

00:50:26.267 --> 00:50:27.850 align:middle line:10%
depending on how you
want to spell it.

00:50:27.850 --> 00:50:32.835 align:middle line:84%
And they taught tantra
that led to immortality.

00:50:32.835 --> 00:50:35.970 align:middle line:90%


00:50:35.970 --> 00:50:38.030 align:middle line:84%
They were pretty
successful in this.

00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:46.400 align:middle line:84%
They managed to teach about
330 or so other families

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:49.270 align:middle line:84%
in the amount of total
of about 1,000 people,

00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:54.840 align:middle line:84%
including the children, to
led them into immortality.

00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:57.540 align:middle line:84%
The school was doing
very well and would

00:50:57.540 --> 00:51:02.130 align:middle line:84%
have probably succeeded
in transforming

00:51:02.130 --> 00:51:07.580 align:middle line:84%
the entire human race
if it had enough time.

00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:14.860 align:middle line:84%
However, about 1,000 years
into the school's functioning,

00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:16.070 align:middle line:90%
God changed that.

00:51:16.070 --> 00:51:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And there was another
shifting of the axis,

00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:21.110 align:middle line:90%
and Lemuria went under.

00:51:21.110 --> 00:51:23.635 align:middle line:84%
They knew long before
Lemuria was going

00:51:23.635 --> 00:51:25.050 align:middle line:90%
under that it was going under.

00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:29.430 align:middle line:84%
These people were
feminine and psychic.

00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:32.430 align:middle line:84%
They had clear signs
and fully understood

00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:34.310 align:middle line:90%
what was about to take place.

00:51:34.310 --> 00:51:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And there was very
little loss of life.

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:39.410 align:middle line:90%


00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:44.790 align:middle line:84%
Besides, they'd been slowly
sinking for a long time.

00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:48.320 align:middle line:84%
However, at one
point, it did sink.

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And when it did,
the survivors, which

00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:56.610 align:middle line:84%
they had gotten all their
sacred things-- whatever

00:51:56.610 --> 00:51:58.800 align:middle line:84%
you want to call them,
artifacts, or whatever-- out

00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:02.080 align:middle line:84%
of Lemuria long
before it ever sank.

00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:05.320 align:middle line:84%
They took them to various
places in the world.

00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:10.780 align:middle line:84%
But most of it was brought
to Lake Titicaca in Peru.

00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:13.080 align:middle line:84%
The golden sun disk
was brought there.

00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:16.560 align:middle line:10%
The survivors went in
advance to primarily

00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:19.160 align:middle line:10%
from Lake Titicaca
in Peru all the way

00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:23.380 align:middle line:10%
up the western shores of North
America, South America, and all

00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:26.270 align:middle line:10%
the way up to as far
north as Mount Shasta.

00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:30.510 align:middle line:10%
They didn't go, or if
there were any, very few

00:52:30.510 --> 00:52:34.770 align:middle line:10%
went to either ends
below or above that.

00:52:34.770 --> 00:52:37.270 align:middle line:10%
And the two areas that
most of them went to

00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:41.095 align:middle line:10%
was South America,
Peru, and to California.

00:52:41.095 --> 00:52:43.740 align:middle line:90%


00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:48.070 align:middle line:84%
However, the school, the
Naacal Mystery School

00:52:48.070 --> 00:52:51.230 align:middle line:84%
migrated by air,
according to Thoth.

00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:54.790 align:middle line:84%
They flew, and exactly
how, I don't know.

00:52:54.790 --> 00:53:01.790 align:middle line:84%
They flew to Atlantis
at one point.

00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:05.070 align:middle line:10%
And I don't know exactly
when that point was.

00:53:05.070 --> 00:53:10.076 align:middle line:10%
But they went here
to this island here.

00:53:10.076 --> 00:53:11.400 align:middle line:10%
And this is not exact.

00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:12.920 align:middle line:10%
This was not this big.

00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:14.473 align:middle line:10%
This is a lousy drawing.

00:53:14.473 --> 00:53:15.273 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:15.273 --> 00:53:16.967 align:middle line:10%
That's what this is.

00:53:16.967 --> 00:53:18.300 align:middle line:10%
I haven't really looked at this.

00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:20.250 align:middle line:10%
I have it drawn on
a globe over here.

00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:23.130 align:middle line:10%


00:53:23.130 --> 00:53:28.800 align:middle line:10%
And this is a-- the drawing on
here is really pretty accurate.

00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:31.120 align:middle line:10%
It's right here.

00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:35.500 align:middle line:10%
This is pretty much the
size and shape of Atlantis.

00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:37.730 align:middle line:90%
There were 10 primary islands.

00:53:37.730 --> 00:53:40.790 align:middle line:84%
There's one huge
big one that was

00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:43.600 align:middle line:84%
kind of in between an
island and a continent.

00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And there was an island to the
north, an island to the east,

00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:54.990 align:middle line:84%
a little tiny one to the south,
and six of them to the west.

00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:57.476 align:middle line:84%
But the islands continued
all into the Florida Keys,

00:53:57.476 --> 00:53:58.850 align:middle line:84%
except they, those
weren't there.

00:53:58.850 --> 00:54:00.600 align:middle line:90%
They were underwater.

00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:05.100 align:middle line:84%
All of this whole thing, in
fact, everything all the way up

00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:08.350 align:middle line:84%
over to Louisiana, and
this whole area up in here

00:54:08.350 --> 00:54:10.870 align:middle line:84%
wasn't there, just
simply wasn't there.

00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:13.320 align:middle line:90%
It was underwater.

00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And so and where they flew
to, according to Thoth,

00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:22.680 align:middle line:84%
was this Northern
island up here.

00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:26.250 align:middle line:84%
And they gave it
the name, Udall.

00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:31.572 align:middle line:84%
And when they got there, they
did something kind of-- I mean,

00:54:31.572 --> 00:54:34.030 align:middle line:84%
if you're watching them, you
would think they were probably

00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:36.470 align:middle line:84%
off their rocker trying
to-- first thing they did

00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:40.445 align:middle line:84%
was they made a wall
right down the middle,

00:54:40.445 --> 00:54:42.960 align:middle line:90%
dividing the island in two.

00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:47.890 align:middle line:84%
This wall was about 20 feet
thick and about 40 feet high.

00:54:47.890 --> 00:54:49.475 align:middle line:90%
It sealed it off.

00:54:49.475 --> 00:54:52.480 align:middle line:84%
There was no way to get
from one side to the other.

00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And then they built a minor
wall running this way,

00:54:57.330 --> 00:55:01.210 align:middle line:90%
dividing it into four quadrants.

00:55:01.210 --> 00:55:06.960 align:middle line:84%
What they were doing, without
understanding the human brain

00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:13.570 align:middle line:84%
too much, if this was a person's
head and that's their nose,

00:55:13.570 --> 00:55:17.810 align:middle line:84%
I guess, and you're
looking down from the top,

00:55:17.810 --> 00:55:22.170 align:middle line:84%
you have these left
and right hemisphere.

00:55:22.170 --> 00:55:24.720 align:middle line:84%
You have the left hemisphere
over here and the right one

00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:26.010 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:55:26.010 --> 00:55:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And the left one is male,
and the right one is female.

00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:33.850 align:middle line:90%


00:55:33.850 --> 00:55:37.880 align:middle line:84%
But then there's another
division in there, like this.

00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:41.220 align:middle line:10%
There's a front and a
back aspect of this.

00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:52.870 align:middle line:10%
And this front one, if you were
to put this word "love" here,

00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:58.160 align:middle line:10%
the left front aspect
of the human being

00:55:58.160 --> 00:55:59.490 align:middle line:10%
sees everything logically.

00:55:59.490 --> 00:56:00.770 align:middle line:10%
In other words, it
sees it like it is.

00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:02.978 align:middle line:10%
Of course, it sees it upside
down and all that stuff,

00:56:02.978 --> 00:56:05.360 align:middle line:10%
but anyway, it sees it
logically, like this.

00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:14.700 align:middle line:10%
But the right side over
here inverts it, like this,

00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:19.680 align:middle line:10%
and sees it in a mirror
image, one back to the other.

00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And this one is logical,
and this one you could say

00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:25.470 align:middle line:84%
is not logical, but it
has this logic to it.

00:56:25.470 --> 00:56:27.430 align:middle line:84%
But this one also
has a reflection.

00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:28.230 align:middle line:90%
It goes like this.

00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:33.340 align:middle line:90%


00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:36.150 align:middle line:10%
And then, there is another
reflection that goes like this.

00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:42.110 align:middle line:90%


00:56:42.110 --> 00:56:44.460 align:middle line:10%
So this side reflects
that side, and this side

00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:47.170 align:middle line:10%
reflects that side.

00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:53.680 align:middle line:10%
And this one up here is based
on the triangle and the square,

00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:55.606 align:middle line:10%
and that's the
logic, as you will--

00:56:55.606 --> 00:56:57.980 align:middle line:10%
when we get into the geometry,
this will make more sense,

00:56:57.980 --> 00:57:00.090 align:middle line:10%
but this is the logic
of the logic that's

00:57:00.090 --> 00:57:01.940 align:middle line:10%
behind the male side.

00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:05.990 align:middle line:84%
The female side doesn't
have a logical side forward.

00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:07.850 align:middle line:84%
I'll just use this
as a symbol for it.

00:57:07.850 --> 00:57:10.010 align:middle line:84%
She has an experiential
side forward.

00:57:10.010 --> 00:57:12.890 align:middle line:90%


00:57:12.890 --> 00:57:19.030 align:middle line:10%
And so the male and female seem
so different in their approach

00:57:19.030 --> 00:57:21.900 align:middle line:10%
to the reality, of
interpreting the reality.

00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:25.350 align:middle line:10%
But the male side that's based
on a triangle and a square--

00:57:25.350 --> 00:57:28.180 align:middle line:10%
the geometrical
aspect is so logical--

00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:31.640 align:middle line:10%
has an experiential
aspect to it also.

00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:33.200 align:middle line:10%
It's just that it's back.

00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:35.330 align:middle line:10%
It's hidden.

00:57:35.330 --> 00:57:40.800 align:middle line:10%
And the female has a logical
side to her unlogical nature,

00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:43.530 align:middle line:10%
which appears to man,
anyway, and which

00:57:43.530 --> 00:57:46.230 align:middle line:10%
is not based on the
triangle and the square,

00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:51.720 align:middle line:10%
but is based upon
the-- oops, I almost

00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:56.500 align:middle line:10%
made a hexagon in there--
is based on the pentagon.

00:57:56.500 --> 00:58:02.053 align:middle line:90%


00:58:02.053 --> 00:58:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And so there is this-- both
sides are absolutely logical,

00:58:07.070 --> 00:58:09.480 align:middle line:84%
if you understand
what's going on.

00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:11.560 align:middle line:84%
She's just as logical
as he is, but based

00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:13.740 align:middle line:90%
on a different kind of logic.

00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And she's got a
mirror image thing

00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:18.390 align:middle line:84%
where her experiential
thing is forward,

00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:20.806 align:middle line:84%
and his experiential
thing is to the back.

00:58:20.806 --> 00:58:23.060 align:middle line:10%
And by experiential,
as you'll see here,

00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:25.870 align:middle line:10%
and I'll try to demonstrate
this, even, to use here,

00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:29.950 align:middle line:10%
is that every single
line in sacred geometry

00:58:29.950 --> 00:58:33.390 align:middle line:10%
has a human experience
associated with it.

00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:36.780 align:middle line:90%


00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And so all your
geometry has experience,

00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:42.700 align:middle line:84%
but experience
always has geometry

00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:46.300 align:middle line:90%
associated with it, even love.

00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:51.140 align:middle line:84%
You would never think that
love is geometrical, but it is.

00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:53.490 align:middle line:84%
Our scientists have
already established this

00:58:53.490 --> 00:58:55.050 align:middle line:90%
beyond any doubt.

00:58:55.050 --> 00:58:58.240 align:middle line:84%
It's way back in there,
but later, you'll see this.

00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:00.040 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you the
geometries of it.

00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:01.900 align:middle line:90%
But there was a man.

00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:04.850 align:middle line:84%
One of the first
persons that I know of

00:59:04.850 --> 00:59:09.130 align:middle line:84%
was Dan Winter out of
New York-- in New York--

00:59:09.130 --> 00:59:12.170 align:middle line:84%
who was doing the research
of someone else, actually,

00:59:12.170 --> 00:59:13.270 align:middle line:90%
I believe.

00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And he was putting people
on biofeedback systems,

00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:23.160 align:middle line:84%
onto monitors so
they could see what

00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:26.920 align:middle line:84%
was happening in a
sine wave pattern

00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:33.670 align:middle line:84%
and discovered that-- no,
I don't need it, though.

00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Discovered that
there were people--

00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:39.200 align:middle line:84%
that there were a very
specific sine wave signature

00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:43.780 align:middle line:84%
associated specifically with
every emotional response.

00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And so that they
could get to the place

00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:47.450 align:middle line:84%
where they could have
people in other rooms

00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:49.790 align:middle line:84%
just looking at the screen
and just looking at sine wave

00:59:49.790 --> 00:59:53.120 align:middle line:84%
signatures and can tell you
just what that person's feeling.

00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:54.980 align:middle line:84%
But by studying the
sacred geometry,

00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:57.000 align:middle line:84%
around the sine-- see,
sine wave signatures

00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.450 align:middle line:84%
can be reduced to angles, and
all angles can then further

01:00:00.450 --> 01:00:03.291 align:middle line:84%
be reduced to
geometrical patterns,

01:00:03.291 --> 01:00:04.290 align:middle line:90%
or the other way around.

01:00:04.290 --> 01:00:06.120 align:middle line:84%
You can take geometrical
patterns or shapes

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:08.660 align:middle line:84%
and find out their
angles and reduce them

01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:09.980 align:middle line:90%
into sine wave signatures.

01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:13.020 align:middle line:84%
People like Michael Helios, is
one who's real good at that,

01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:14.350 align:middle line:90%
converting shape into sound.

01:00:14.350 --> 01:00:17.980 align:middle line:90%


01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And so what Dan found
out is that there

01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:23.710 align:middle line:84%
is a direct relationship
between emotions and sine wave

01:00:23.710 --> 01:00:26.420 align:middle line:84%
signatures, and
then through work,

01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:28.620 align:middle line:84%
discovered that there
were very specific shapes

01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:31.490 align:middle line:84%
associated with that, and
then through deeper work,

01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:35.080 align:middle line:84%
discovered that there was very
specific geometric pattern

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:40.200 align:middle line:84%
behind all emotion, that there
was one pattern that tied them

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:44.500 align:middle line:84%
all together, and that pattern--
we'll see a little bit later

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:45.630 align:middle line:90%
what that was.

01:00:45.630 --> 01:00:47.046 align:middle line:84%
And then, there
was another person

01:00:47.046 --> 01:00:49.640 align:middle line:90%
called Manford-- Man-- Huh?

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:50.440 align:middle line:90%
>>Kleins.

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>>Kleins, right, who I've got
an article in "Wall Street

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:58.910 align:middle line:84%
Journal" in here, where
he also has totally

01:00:58.910 --> 01:01:01.510 align:middle line:84%
on his own in another direction
come up the same thing,

01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:05.690 align:middle line:84%
that emotions have a shape
associated with them.

01:01:05.690 --> 01:01:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And so it seems so
weird to say this,

01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:11.800 align:middle line:90%
and you're like love has shape.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:14.276 align:middle line:84%
Except for when you see
it walking down the beach.

01:01:14.276 --> 01:01:16.070 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:16.070 --> 01:01:20.080 align:middle line:84%
But you don't think it was
angles, and cubes, and squares.

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:24.320 align:middle line:90%
But it does.

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:26.650 align:middle line:84%
I'll be able to go into
that deeper when we

01:01:26.650 --> 01:01:28.950 align:middle line:90%
get to that level of geometry.

01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:30.720 align:middle line:84%
We're still-- this
whole day is just

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:33.340 align:middle line:90%
introduction, is all it is.

01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:36.990 align:middle line:84%
So they were basing
this island in Atlantis

01:01:36.990 --> 01:01:40.750 align:middle line:84%
on this, according to Thoth,
on the basic qualities.

01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:43.710 align:middle line:84%
So what they did is they got--
about half of the immortals

01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:46.800 align:middle line:84%
from Lemuria got on one side,
and half got on the other side.

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:49.530 align:middle line:84%
Half became the
feminine psychic aspect,

01:01:49.530 --> 01:01:52.660 align:middle line:84%
and the other side being
the logical male thinkers.

01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:55.117 align:middle line:84%
And then, they made a reflective
quality with each other

01:01:55.117 --> 01:01:56.700 align:middle line:84%
and got on the other
sides of the wall

01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:58.235 align:middle line:90%
so they could mirror each other.

01:01:58.235 --> 01:02:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And so there's this
mirror quality,

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:05.176 align:middle line:84%
and they begin to function very
much like our brain functions.

01:02:05.176 --> 01:02:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And they did that
for a period of time.

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:08.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how long it
was, but it was a while.

01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:09.960 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't something
they did overnight.

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:12.560 align:middle line:84%
It was several hundred
years they did this.

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, one day, they
I guess felt they were ready.

01:02:17.210 --> 01:02:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And then on the main island,
they laid out the tree of life.

01:02:24.130 --> 01:02:29.120 align:middle line:90%
They did this-- is this right?

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:33.480 align:middle line:90%


01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:34.355 align:middle line:90%
No, that's not right.

01:02:34.355 --> 01:02:36.650 align:middle line:90%
There's another one somewhere.

01:02:36.650 --> 01:02:37.840 align:middle line:90%
It's not in here.

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:38.840 align:middle line:90%
>>The bottom.

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:39.090 align:middle line:90%
>>Where?

01:02:39.090 --> 01:02:39.650 align:middle line:90%
Here?

01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:40.451 align:middle line:90%
>>Three.

01:02:40.451 --> 01:02:41.250 align:middle line:90%
>>Here?

01:02:41.250 --> 01:02:42.150 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:42.985 align:middle line:90%
>>In there?

01:02:42.985 --> 01:02:43.915 align:middle line:90%
>>The bottom has two sides.

01:02:43.915 --> 01:02:44.715 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:02:44.715 --> 01:02:47.370 align:middle line:90%
It's something like that.

01:02:47.370 --> 01:02:49.775 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what it is.

01:02:49.775 --> 01:02:52.240 align:middle line:84%
They laid out the
tree of life on there.

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:55.790 align:middle line:84%
They did it with their
thoughts and their emotions,

01:02:55.790 --> 01:02:58.940 align:middle line:84%
and they created a
standing wave pattern

01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:04.900 align:middle line:84%
on the geographical surface of
Atlantis, according to Thoth,

01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:07.080 align:middle line:84%
and they kept this
pattern going.

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And they did something that-- I
don't know what he means by it.

01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:11.580 align:middle line:84%
He says they breathed
life into it.

01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:15.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what,
exactly, what that means.

01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:17.550 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't understand
what it meant,

01:03:17.550 --> 01:03:20.260 align:middle line:90%
but they made it a living form.

01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And he said it began to create
these vortex energies that

01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:36.370 align:middle line:84%
rotated out of each
one of these places,

01:03:36.370 --> 01:03:43.860 align:middle line:84%
and that there were eight of
these places that were-- let's

01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:48.560 align:middle line:84%
put it another way, that
the survivors from Lemuria

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:52.210 align:middle line:84%
were then called forth
to come, and they all--

01:03:52.210 --> 01:03:53.970 align:middle line:84%
in their own place,
and they just

01:03:53.970 --> 01:03:56.990 align:middle line:84%
knew that they were
supposed to go.

01:03:56.990 --> 01:04:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And they began to migrate
across the country,

01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:04.700 align:middle line:84%
over toward Atlantis, and they
made their way toward there.

01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:07.670 align:middle line:84%
However, remember, they
were equivalent to about

01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:08.780 align:middle line:90%
a 12-year-old girl.

01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:10.170 align:middle line:90%
They were immature.

01:04:10.170 --> 01:04:12.390 align:middle line:84%
They had not
completed themselves.

01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And there were certain
areas of human experience

01:04:16.690 --> 01:04:18.260 align:middle line:90%
that they had not completed.

01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And they had only completed
eight of the 10 areas.

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:25.920 align:middle line:84%
Again, I don't really know
what that means, either.

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:29.220 align:middle line:84%
But there are two
areas in here somewhere

01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:32.070 align:middle line:90%
that they have not completed.

01:04:32.070 --> 01:04:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And so when they were
pulled to Atlantis

01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:37.755 align:middle line:84%
and they were brought here,
they were pulled to these spots.

01:04:37.755 --> 01:04:39.530 align:middle line:84%
These spots, by
the way-- he said

01:04:39.530 --> 01:04:41.860 align:middle line:84%
this pattern was laid
out on the surface

01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:44.950 align:middle line:84%
to the accuracy
of a single atom.

01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:47.790 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about an
extremely accurate pattern.

01:04:47.790 --> 01:04:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And the cities were placed
on these exact spots.

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:56.680 align:middle line:84%
There were eventually 10
major cities in Atlantis.

01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:00.150 align:middle line:90%


01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:02.470 align:middle line:84%
But the survivors from
the left from Lemuria

01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:04.027 align:middle line:90%
went to eight of these places.

01:05:04.027 --> 01:05:06.110 align:middle line:84%
There were two places that
were completely vacant.

01:05:06.110 --> 01:05:09.430 align:middle line:90%
It was just nobody's nature yet.

01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:12.680 align:middle line:84%
Nobody had developed
into that nature.

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:16.565 align:middle line:84%
And then, and what
life does-- I don't

01:05:16.565 --> 01:05:19.322 align:middle line:84%
know if these guys thought about
this far enough along the line

01:05:19.322 --> 01:05:22.030 align:middle line:84%
when they were
doing this, but what

01:05:22.030 --> 01:05:30.050 align:middle line:84%
happens with life is you leave
a space open, and life fills it.

01:05:30.050 --> 01:05:31.500 align:middle line:90%
This is automatic.

01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:33.410 align:middle line:84%
What I like to use
is the freeway.

01:05:33.410 --> 01:05:34.010 align:middle line:84%
You know when you're
on the freeway

01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:35.670 align:middle line:84%
and you let the
car in front of you

01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:36.898 align:middle line:84%
get a little bit too
far ahead of you?

01:05:36.898 --> 01:05:37.774 align:middle line:90%
Fwooh!

01:05:37.774 --> 01:05:39.355 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:39.355 --> 01:05:42.390 align:middle line:90%
It fills right in.

01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:45.920 align:middle line:84%
The first one, the one
that came in first,

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:51.040 align:middle line:90%
was from extraterrestrial.

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:52.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where it
was from, and he never

01:05:52.970 --> 01:05:55.420 align:middle line:90%
really clearly made this clear.

01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:58.440 align:middle line:84%
But they were not a
problem when they came in,

01:05:58.440 --> 01:05:59.530 align:middle line:90%
and they got permission.

01:05:59.530 --> 01:06:00.905 align:middle line:84%
They asked permission
to come in.

01:06:00.905 --> 01:06:03.260 align:middle line:84%
So there was nothing illegal
or anything else like that,

01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:05.440 align:middle line:90%
but this was the Hebrews.

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:09.140 align:middle line:84%
According to Thoth, they
came from somewhere else.

01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:14.890 align:middle line:84%
They had failed-- they did
not make it to the next level

01:06:14.890 --> 01:06:15.690 align:middle line:90%
and had to repeat.

01:06:15.690 --> 01:06:17.912 align:middle line:84%
It was like a child going
to go to school all over

01:06:17.912 --> 01:06:19.350 align:middle line:90%
again in another grade.

01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:21.880 align:middle line:90%
They had to repeat it over.

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:24.120 align:middle line:84%
They were an extremely
advanced race relative to us

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:26.150 align:middle line:84%
because they had been
through a lot of things

01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:27.787 align:middle line:84%
that we were about
to go through.

01:06:27.787 --> 01:06:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And so when they
came in, they brought

01:06:29.370 --> 01:06:33.130 align:middle line:84%
in a great deal of information
that we didn't even

01:06:33.130 --> 01:06:35.090 align:middle line:90%
know about yet or anything.

01:06:35.090 --> 01:06:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And there was no real
problem with them,

01:06:40.050 --> 01:06:43.280 align:middle line:84%
and if it had not
been for the next one,

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:47.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it would
even be a problem today.

01:06:47.290 --> 01:06:53.470 align:middle line:84%
It would've been probably
a very clean integration.

01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:58.330 align:middle line:84%
However, the last one, the
tenth one that came in,

01:06:58.330 --> 01:07:00.140 align:middle line:84%
was a real problem
and is a problem

01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:03.070 align:middle line:84%
from the moment they came
in, the very moment that they

01:07:03.070 --> 01:07:07.120 align:middle line:84%
came in to this very
moment right now.

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And the struggle has
still been going on.

01:07:10.510 --> 01:07:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds funny
where they came from.

01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:17.570 align:middle line:84%
Again, realize I said this
on tape 7 and 1/2 years ago.

01:07:17.570 --> 01:07:20.360 align:middle line:84%
When I first started saying it,
it sounded even weird to me,

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:22.130 align:middle line:84%
but I had to repeated
what he told me,

01:07:22.130 --> 01:07:27.570 align:middle line:84%
and I had no external
evidence to support

01:07:27.570 --> 01:07:29.310 align:middle line:90%
this in any way at all.

01:07:29.310 --> 01:07:33.220 align:middle line:84%
But he said that
they came from Mars

01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:40.640 align:middle line:84%
and that it wasn't from Mars of
today or even close to today,

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:45.180 align:middle line:84%
but as from Mars from
a long, long time ago,

01:07:45.180 --> 01:07:50.560 align:middle line:84%
approximately just under
1 million years ago.

01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And what was going on about 1
million years ago, which we're

01:07:55.170 --> 01:07:57.660 align:middle line:84%
going to get into
detail-- scientists now

01:07:57.660 --> 01:08:01.310 align:middle line:84%
are suspecting-- are going
a date of about-- they're

01:08:01.310 --> 01:08:04.187 align:middle line:84%
giving dates on this at
about 500,000 years ago.

01:08:04.187 --> 01:08:06.520 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, they're going
to get back there, I know,

01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:09.500 align:middle line:84%
because Thoth has never
been wrong on anything,

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:12.352 align:middle line:84%
and I've really tried to
find him wrong on stuff.

01:08:12.352 --> 01:08:16.069 align:middle line:84%
I really-- everything he's
ever told me, I check.

01:08:16.069 --> 01:08:17.600 align:middle line:90%
I've tried to check.

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:21.640 align:middle line:84%
Even obscure details,
he's been right on.

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:25.470 align:middle line:84%
He said it was just
under a million years.

01:08:25.470 --> 01:08:28.750 align:middle line:84%
He said that Mars was
a beautiful planet,

01:08:28.750 --> 01:08:33.985 align:middle line:84%
that there was waters
and oceans and trees.

01:08:33.985 --> 01:08:35.359 align:middle line:84%
It was a lot like
Earth, he said.

01:08:35.359 --> 01:08:37.149 align:middle line:90%
It was a beautiful place.

01:08:37.149 --> 01:08:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
race of beings that

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:43.100 align:middle line:84%
was on that planet that was
warring amongst themselves,

01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:46.359 align:middle line:84%
constantly warring
amongst themselves.

01:08:46.359 --> 01:08:48.040 align:middle line:84%
According to Thoth,
there has been

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:50.979 align:middle line:84%
four times in the
creation of this universe

01:08:50.979 --> 01:08:56.500 align:middle line:84%
when life has decided to
rebel against the system,

01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:58.399 align:middle line:90%
you might say.

01:08:58.399 --> 01:09:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And this was the third
time that it'd taken place.

01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:04.149 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know
where it started,

01:09:04.149 --> 01:09:07.200 align:middle line:84%
but it ended approximately
a million years ago.

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:30.755 align:middle line:84%
And the Martians began-- they
knew that it was all over with.

01:09:30.755 --> 01:09:32.130 align:middle line:84%
At one point, they
knew that they

01:09:32.130 --> 01:09:35.050 align:middle line:84%
were going to
destroy each other,

01:09:35.050 --> 01:09:37.050 align:middle line:84%
just as our governments
know right now that it's

01:09:37.050 --> 01:09:39.149 align:middle line:90%
pretty much over with here too.

01:09:39.149 --> 01:09:42.770 align:middle line:84%
In a few more years down the
line, there won't be any doubt.

01:09:42.770 --> 01:09:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And they knew that
it was over with,

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:47.720 align:middle line:84%
and a small group
of them-- they began

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:52.750 align:middle line:84%
to try to find a way to escape,
just like our governments

01:09:52.750 --> 01:09:55.740 align:middle line:84%
are also doing the
same thing right now.

01:09:55.740 --> 01:10:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And they went to--
there was experiments

01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:04.890 align:middle line:84%
that were done
really all over Mars,

01:10:04.890 --> 01:10:06.810 align:middle line:84%
but the primary
place was in Cydonia,

01:10:06.810 --> 01:10:10.670 align:middle line:84%
which we will discuss later and
go into great detail on that.

01:10:10.670 --> 01:10:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And they built these huge
pyramidal structures there

01:10:13.090 --> 01:10:17.350 align:middle line:84%
that were tetrahedral in shape,
octahedronal, five-sided.

01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And these were immense,
immense structures,

01:10:19.450 --> 01:10:24.197 align:middle line:84%
structures that you can't
imagine on present-day Earth

01:10:24.197 --> 01:10:25.220 align:middle line:90%
terms.

01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:31.260 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a building being 10
miles high, but that's fact.

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:38.590 align:middle line:84%
The D&M pyramid on Cydonia--
it's 50,000 feet-plus high.

01:10:38.590 --> 01:10:42.340 align:middle line:84%
That it was over with,
and a small group of them

01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:46.670 align:middle line:84%
began to try to find
a way to escape, just

01:10:46.670 --> 01:10:50.770 align:middle line:84%
like our governments are also
doing the same thing right now.

01:10:50.770 --> 01:10:57.035 align:middle line:84%
And they went to--
there was experiments

01:10:57.035 --> 01:10:59.930 align:middle line:84%
that were done
really all over Mars,

01:10:59.930 --> 01:11:01.760 align:middle line:84%
but the primary
place was in Cydonia,

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:05.700 align:middle line:84%
which we will discuss later and
go into great detail on that.

01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And they built these huge
pyramidal structures there

01:11:08.130 --> 01:11:12.380 align:middle line:84%
that were tetrahedral in shape,
octahedronal, five-sided.

01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And these were immense,
immense structures,

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:19.227 align:middle line:84%
structures that you can't
imagine on present-day Earth

01:11:19.227 --> 01:11:20.250 align:middle line:90%
terms.

01:11:20.250 --> 01:11:26.300 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a building being 10
miles high, but that's fact.

01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:32.450 align:middle line:84%
The D&M pyramid on Cydonia--
it's 50,000 feet-plus high.

01:11:32.450 --> 01:11:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And we don't even have
mountains that high here,

01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:41.790 align:middle line:84%
but that's-- NASA determined--
they're the ones that

01:11:41.790 --> 01:11:44.240 align:middle line:84%
determined that's
how high this is.

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And these were all structures,
as you'll see later,

01:11:47.890 --> 01:11:51.370 align:middle line:84%
that describe
mathematically one thing,

01:11:51.370 --> 01:11:55.880 align:middle line:84%
and that is a star tetrahedron
inscribed in a sphere, which

01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:57.840 align:middle line:84%
is the basis of the
Merkaba that we're

01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:00.180 align:middle line:90%
going to talk about in here.

01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And again, I will
make that very clear

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:06.080 align:middle line:84%
and describe the work
in a little while.

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And what they were doing was
they were creating a Merkaba,

01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:13.360 align:middle line:84%
but they were recreating
an external Merkaba, not

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:16.650 align:middle line:84%
a living field based on
your thoughts and emotions

01:12:16.650 --> 01:12:21.000 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to discuss,
but an external Merkaba, which

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:26.710 align:middle line:84%
we call a UFO, or a
spaceship, or a craft.

01:12:26.710 --> 01:12:28.290 align:middle line:90%
But what is a Merkaba?

01:12:28.290 --> 01:12:32.120 align:middle line:84%
It's more than just a vehicle
that you get in and fly around.

01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:35.870 align:middle line:84%
It is a vehicle that can pass
through the dimensional levels.

01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:41.250 align:middle line:84%
It can go through
space as well as time

01:12:41.250 --> 01:12:44.060 align:middle line:84%
because time is a function
of size and the golden means

01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:45.330 align:middle line:90%
spiral.

01:12:45.330 --> 01:12:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And when all these
things are put together,

01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:49.590 align:middle line:84%
you can move back and
forth in time and space.

01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:51.480 align:middle line:90%
And time is really spherical.

01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:56.160 align:middle line:90%


01:12:56.160 --> 01:13:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And so the Martians
started looking around

01:13:00.890 --> 01:13:03.900 align:middle line:84%
in their Merkabas and
discovered that there

01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:08.870 align:middle line:84%
was this planet called--
what we call Earth that

01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:16.320 align:middle line:84%
was way into their future,
a million years or so

01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:19.920 align:middle line:84%
into their future, and
about 65,000 or 70,000

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:25.850 align:middle line:84%
years into our past, which was
when Atlantis first started,

01:13:25.850 --> 01:13:31.910 align:middle line:84%
and which was very much
like where they were.

01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And a small group-- it
wasn't billions of people.

01:13:35.850 --> 01:13:41.430 align:middle line:84%
It was somewhere
between a couple

01:13:41.430 --> 01:13:44.400 align:middle line:84%
thousand and the
absolute maximum

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:47.595 align:middle line:84%
that a group Merkaba, a single
group Merkaba can create

01:13:47.595 --> 01:13:49.140 align:middle line:90%
is about 150,000.

01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:52.234 align:middle line:84%
So it would be somewhere
between those figures.

01:13:52.234 --> 01:13:54.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what it was, but
I think it was much smaller.

01:13:54.650 --> 01:13:57.400 align:middle line:84%
I think it was only-- really,
from what Thoth was trying

01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:00.260 align:middle line:84%
to project out, it was
just a few thousand people

01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:02.300 align:middle line:84%
were projected off of
the surface of Mars

01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:04.450 align:middle line:84%
a million years ago,
projected into the future

01:14:04.450 --> 01:14:07.020 align:middle line:84%
and into past, and
into this 10th place

01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:08.135 align:middle line:90%
here without permission.

01:14:08.135 --> 01:14:10.455 align:middle line:90%


01:14:10.455 --> 01:14:11.580 align:middle line:90%
Probably Lucifer rebellion.

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:12.704 align:middle line:90%
They don't need permission.

01:14:12.704 --> 01:14:14.691 align:middle line:90%
They just do it.

01:14:14.691 --> 01:14:15.940 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't Lucifer, though.

01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:17.930 align:middle line:90%
It was someone else before them.

01:14:17.930 --> 01:14:19.460 align:middle line:90%
And they just did it.

01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:23.985 align:middle line:84%
And so we were, by this time,
approximately equal to maybe

01:14:23.985 --> 01:14:26.690 align:middle line:90%
a 13- or 14-year-old girl.

01:14:26.690 --> 01:14:29.220 align:middle line:90%
We were like a young girl.

01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And the Martians coming in were
like maybe a 70-year-old man.

01:14:36.610 --> 01:14:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And no permission-- they just
came in and merged with us.

01:14:40.970 --> 01:14:42.090 align:middle line:90%
It was rape.

01:14:42.090 --> 01:14:43.290 align:middle line:90%
They didn't ask.

01:14:43.290 --> 01:14:44.090 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

01:14:44.090 --> 01:14:45.830 align:middle line:90%
Just said "We're here.

01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Like it or not, that's
the way it goes."

01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And they immediately
tried to take us over

01:14:53.170 --> 01:14:58.020 align:middle line:84%
and tried to subdue
the Earth, and a war

01:14:58.020 --> 01:15:01.540 align:middle line:90%
ensued almost immediately.

01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:07.120 align:middle line:84%
However, there were
too many of us.

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:10.480 align:middle line:84%
I say us and them, but
for me, it's all the same.

01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:11.850 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm an earthling.

01:15:11.850 --> 01:15:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And there were too many
of us, and there was not

01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:15.310 align:middle line:90%
very many of them.

01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And finally, it was
decided from their side

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:22.670 align:middle line:84%
that they would stop fighting
and trying to control things,

01:15:22.670 --> 01:15:25.410 align:middle line:84%
and it was decided
from their side

01:15:25.410 --> 01:15:28.940 align:middle line:84%
that they would attempt
to try to understand what

01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:33.250 align:middle line:84%
this female thing was,
whatever this female thing was,

01:15:33.250 --> 01:15:35.530 align:middle line:84%
because they had no
understanding of it

01:15:35.530 --> 01:15:39.400 align:middle line:84%
at all because like the
greys, they had developed

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:43.890 align:middle line:84%
their intellectual
side to the NTH degree

01:15:43.890 --> 01:15:46.700 align:middle line:84%
and had no emotional
body whatsoever.

01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:49.270 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know what
love was, or compassion,

01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:51.140 align:middle line:84%
or any of these
kinds of feelings,

01:15:51.140 --> 01:15:52.670 align:middle line:90%
either negative or positive.

01:15:52.670 --> 01:15:55.112 align:middle line:84%
They had no emotional
structure within them at all.

01:15:55.112 --> 01:15:57.870 align:middle line:90%


01:15:57.870 --> 01:16:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And so it was pure logic that
they would stop trying to war

01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:05.490 align:middle line:84%
because they knew they couldn't
possibly win, and tried

01:16:05.490 --> 01:16:08.190 align:middle line:84%
to see if they could survive
this by understanding what this

01:16:08.190 --> 01:16:09.620 align:middle line:90%
was all about.

01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And so from that
time until-- though

01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:16.240 align:middle line:84%
they kept themselves very
separate from the rest

01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:17.040 align:middle line:90%
of Earth.

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:20.350 align:middle line:84%
They did not try to mingle
too much, though I'm

01:16:20.350 --> 01:16:23.280 align:middle line:84%
sure that there were
marriages and stuff like that,

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:27.050 align:middle line:84%
but it was not--
they tried to keep it

01:16:27.050 --> 01:16:29.750 align:middle line:84%
as-- they had their
own area where

01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:33.970 align:middle line:84%
they stayed, and they kept
to themselves a great deal.

01:16:33.970 --> 01:16:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And then, everything
went along pretty good.

01:16:37.410 --> 01:16:40.780 align:middle line:90%


01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:44.480 align:middle line:84%
For thousands, and thousands,
and thousands of years went by,

01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:45.647 align:middle line:90%
and we kept developing.

01:16:45.647 --> 01:16:47.230 align:middle line:84%
We kept getting
older, and growing up,

01:16:47.230 --> 01:16:48.690 align:middle line:90%
and getting stronger.

01:16:48.690 --> 01:16:51.740 align:middle line:84%
Only because of their
influence, because

01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:56.750 align:middle line:84%
of their sophisticated logical
science with crystals that they

01:16:56.750 --> 01:17:05.360 align:middle line:84%
had developed, they influenced
the science and the technology

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:08.310 align:middle line:84%
of Lemuria-- I mean, of
Atlantis-- dramatically,

01:17:08.310 --> 01:17:13.320 align:middle line:84%
to the point that, in time,
their influence became

01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:16.015 align:middle line:84%
overwhelming, and
we changed sex.

01:17:16.015 --> 01:17:18.950 align:middle line:90%


01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:23.870 align:middle line:90%
We went from female to male.

01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And by the time
Lemuria was over,

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:29.240 align:middle line:84%
we were a very
male race, where we

01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:31.950 align:middle line:90%
had been becoming very female.

01:17:31.950 --> 01:17:34.480 align:middle line:84%
We quit using this
side, and we started

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:36.670 align:middle line:84%
relying on the opposite
side of our brain.

01:17:36.670 --> 01:17:40.750 align:middle line:90%


01:17:40.750 --> 01:17:57.811 align:middle line:90%
And then, let's see.

01:17:57.811 --> 01:18:01.615 align:middle line:90%


01:18:01.615 --> 01:18:02.781 align:middle line:90%
Forgot where I was, exactly.

01:18:02.781 --> 01:18:05.763 align:middle line:90%


01:18:05.763 --> 01:18:07.254 align:middle line:90%
>>We switched over.

01:18:07.254 --> 01:18:08.939 align:middle line:90%
Switched from female to male.

01:18:08.939 --> 01:18:09.739 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:18:09.739 --> 01:18:13.578 align:middle line:90%


01:18:13.578 --> 01:18:15.536 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to think of
what the next thing that

01:18:15.536 --> 01:18:16.697 align:middle line:90%
occurred after that.

01:18:16.697 --> 01:18:17.710 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE CHATTER]

01:18:17.710 --> 01:18:19.961 align:middle line:84%
>>Oh, you guys know
this better than I.

01:18:19.961 --> 01:18:23.300 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:25.469 align:middle line:90%


01:18:25.469 --> 01:18:26.593 align:middle line:90%
That's what I had this for.

01:18:26.593 --> 01:18:27.730 align:middle line:90%
I should hold this thing.

01:18:27.730 --> 01:18:28.830 align:middle line:90%
It's all programmed and in here.

01:18:28.830 --> 01:18:28.956 align:middle line:90%
That way I don't have to think.

01:18:28.956 --> 01:18:29.756 align:middle line:90%
I can just do it.

01:18:29.756 --> 01:18:33.510 align:middle line:90%


01:18:33.510 --> 01:18:35.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to hold
this for a while.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.670 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:18:37.670 --> 01:18:38.850 align:middle line:90%
It kept going.

01:18:38.850 --> 01:18:42.710 align:middle line:84%
Everything went fine until
about 16,000 years ago,

01:18:42.710 --> 01:18:46.960 align:middle line:84%
which is an unusual
place in the orbit--

01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:50.610 align:middle line:84%
precession of the equinoxes
for this to do this.

01:18:50.610 --> 01:18:54.590 align:middle line:84%
But approximately
16,000 years ago,

01:18:54.590 --> 01:19:03.650 align:middle line:84%
this thing occurred
on Earth where--

01:19:03.650 --> 01:19:06.480 align:middle line:84%
here's the closest place to
the center of the galaxy,

01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:08.870 align:middle line:90%
and here's where we are now.

01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And if we go back
one cycle, right back

01:19:14.630 --> 01:19:20.200 align:middle line:84%
to where we are exactly
right now-- first of all,

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:22.180 align:middle line:90%
that's really when it began.

01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, right to the very
spot where we are right now,

01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:31.397 align:middle line:84%
the poles made a minor
adjustment, which our science

01:19:31.397 --> 01:19:32.480 align:middle line:90%
knows definitely occurred.

01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:35.382 align:middle line:90%
We've got that one tracked down.

01:19:35.382 --> 01:19:36.710 align:middle line:90%
It definitely happened.

01:19:36.710 --> 01:19:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And when it did, a
small piece of Atlantis

01:19:42.330 --> 01:19:44.190 align:middle line:90%
went into the ocean.

01:19:44.190 --> 01:19:47.000 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a whole lot of
it, but it was enough of it

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:53.200 align:middle line:84%
to cause fear to go
through Atlantis.

01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And the fear lasted, according
to Thoth, for about 200 years.

01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:04.060 align:middle line:84%
They were afraid they were
going to lose everything again,

01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:07.020 align:middle line:84%
and there was a
great deal of fear.

01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:11.507 align:middle line:84%
But slowly, that fear
went away as time went on,

01:20:11.507 --> 01:20:13.840 align:middle line:84%
and they knew that they were
getting further and further

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:17.650 align:middle line:84%
away from that poise and
moving back into the light.

01:20:17.650 --> 01:20:19.685 align:middle line:84%
And it slowly
started going away,

01:20:19.685 --> 01:20:22.810 align:middle line:84%
and everybody started to relax,
and the old evolutionary cycle

01:20:22.810 --> 01:20:33.460 align:middle line:84%
just one on business as usual
until approximately right here,

01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:38.750 align:middle line:84%
which was about-- don't hold
me to my figures exactly.

01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:40.342 align:middle line:84%
I'm within a little
bit-- give me

01:20:40.342 --> 01:20:44.450 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of leeway here--
approximately 16,000 years ago,

01:20:44.450 --> 01:20:47.380 align:middle line:84%
right about there in
the cycle right there.

01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:52.050 align:middle line:84%
This event occurred where
either an asteroid or a comet

01:20:52.050 --> 01:20:53.370 align:middle line:90%
was heading right toward Earth.

01:20:53.370 --> 01:20:56.600 align:middle line:90%


01:20:56.600 --> 01:21:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And the Lemurian
aspect of ourselves

01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:04.190 align:middle line:84%
wanted to just allow
it to hit the Earth.

01:21:04.190 --> 01:21:07.120 align:middle line:84%
That's the feminine nature
is the Taoist approach.

01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:08.410 align:middle line:90%
Just allow-- it's OK.

01:21:08.410 --> 01:21:09.360 align:middle line:90%
It's God.

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:10.160 align:middle line:90%
It's all natural.

01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:11.300 align:middle line:90%
It's nature.

01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:16.360 align:middle line:84%
But the Martian aspect
of ourselves said no way.

01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:18.070 align:middle line:84%
Let's blow this
baby out of the sky.

01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:20.950 align:middle line:90%
They had the ability to do it.

01:21:20.950 --> 01:21:23.710 align:middle line:90%
Let's just blow it up.

01:21:23.710 --> 01:21:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And they argued over this
and argued over this.

01:21:27.910 --> 01:21:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the
Lemurian aspect won,

01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:36.472 align:middle line:84%
and that's exactly
what they did.

01:21:36.472 --> 01:21:37.930 align:middle line:84%
They just allowed
it to take place.

01:21:37.930 --> 01:21:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And this thing came streaking
in and slammed and just missed

01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:43.530 align:middle line:90%
Atlantis.

01:21:43.530 --> 01:21:45.305 align:middle line:84%
It would have been
a total devastation.

01:21:45.305 --> 01:21:50.040 align:middle line:84%
It just missed it and hit
right offshore not too far

01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:52.000 align:middle line:84%
into a place that's
now above ground,

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.750 align:middle line:84%
which is called Charleston,
South Carolina, right now.

01:21:55.750 --> 01:22:02.200 align:middle line:84%
That was the dead center impact
of a very huge piece of matter

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:05.380 align:middle line:84%
that hit the Earth,
from which-- that still

01:22:05.380 --> 01:22:11.550 align:middle line:84%
spread out over four states,
and you can read about it.

01:22:11.550 --> 01:22:13.630 align:middle line:90%
It's all there.

01:22:13.630 --> 01:22:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And this cost a big piece--
a pretty good sized chunk

01:22:21.260 --> 01:22:23.770 align:middle line:84%
of Atlantis to go
into the ocean,

01:22:23.770 --> 01:22:28.290 align:middle line:84%
which almost destroyed a great
deal of the Martian aspect

01:22:28.290 --> 01:22:30.330 align:middle line:90%
of Atlantis.

01:22:30.330 --> 01:22:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And to say the very least,
they were pissed off.

01:22:35.670 --> 01:22:38.700 align:middle line:90%
