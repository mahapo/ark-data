00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.309 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.395 align:middle line:84%
>>Your own beingness,
that you have developed.

00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:22.920 align:middle line:90%


00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.330 align:middle line:84%
But the image that was
given to me to give to you

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:31.110 align:middle line:84%
is, that it is very similar--
at least the image is--

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.510 align:middle line:84%
is very similar to someone
who is in a canoe going down

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:43.600 align:middle line:84%
a river in a jungle, where you
are at this smooth wide river,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.605 align:middle line:84%
with blue skies, and dense
jungle on either side.

00:00:47.605 --> 00:00:49.960 align:middle line:90%
And it's beautiful.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And you are just rowing
gently down there,

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.130 align:middle line:90%
just humming a little song.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.015 align:middle line:84%
Row, row, row your boat,
gently down the stream.

00:01:00.015 --> 00:01:01.490 align:middle line:84%
Merrily, Merrily,
Merrily, Merrily.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.550 align:middle line:90%
Life is but a dream.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.740 align:middle line:90%


00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And you can look into your
past as far back as you can,

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.366 align:middle line:90%
until the last bend.

00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:12.920 align:middle line:84%
That you can
examine pretty well.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And then what you can see,
a certain distance back,

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.565 align:middle line:90%
that you can remember real well.

00:01:17.565 --> 00:01:23.160 align:middle line:84%
But when it goes around the
bend, you can't see anymore.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.270 align:middle line:84%
So you can look in
the back so far,

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.125 align:middle line:84%
but then you can't see very
far back and you can't see

00:01:29.125 --> 00:01:31.100 align:middle line:84%
the-- as the bends get
further and further

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.192 align:middle line:84%
and further back down that
river, the less and less

00:01:34.192 --> 00:01:35.650 align:middle line:84%
and less can you
remember where you

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.220 align:middle line:84%
were, because we're pretty much
a centralized consciousness.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And you can see ahead into the
future up until the next bend.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And then you can't
see around that bend,

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.497 align:middle line:84%
you don't have any
idea what's coming up.

00:01:51.497 --> 00:01:53.830 align:middle line:84%
You can tell what's coming
in your future a little ways,

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.360 align:middle line:90%
but that's about it.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.280 align:middle line:84%
So we have that
short little thing.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And you're just going down
there having a good old time.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.350 align:middle line:90%
Life is great.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Your higher self is
like a big bird flying

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.330 align:middle line:90%
over the top of your canoe.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.870 align:middle line:84%
You might say like an
eagle flying up there.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.090 align:middle line:90%
Coasting along.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.080 align:middle line:84%
From that fourth
dimensional point of

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.960 align:middle line:84%
view-- if you want to
see the third dimension

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.126 align:middle line:84%
as the surface of the Earth
and the fourth dimension

00:02:21.126 --> 00:02:22.260 align:middle line:90%
as this higher view.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.550 align:middle line:90%


00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.706 align:middle line:84%
That aspect of yourself can
see a lot further than you can.

00:02:30.706 --> 00:02:34.560 align:middle line:84%
It can look back along the river
and see all the bends really

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.200 align:middle line:84%
precisely in your past, for
a long, long, long ways.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.050 align:middle line:90%
It does have a limit.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Our higher self does have
a limit, just like you do.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.370 align:middle line:84%
But it's expanded like crazy,
and it can see much further.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And it can see ahead in
your future, a long ways,

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.080 align:middle line:90%
but it also has a limit.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.170 align:middle line:84%
There are higher
selves to higher selves

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.860 align:middle line:84%
to higher selves to higher
selves, until you get to God.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.630 align:middle line:90%


00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And so your higher self flying
up here can see real well,

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.420 align:middle line:84%
and you're down here
just floating along.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And the higher self comes to
you-- the bird comes to you--

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.450 align:middle line:84%
and says, you need to
get out of your canoe,

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.660 align:middle line:84%
go over to the side over
here, and walk your canoe

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.406 align:middle line:90%
through the forest.

00:03:23.406 --> 00:03:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And you're going, walk my
canoe through the forest?

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.455 align:middle line:90%
Are you crazy?

00:03:28.455 --> 00:03:31.392 align:middle line:84%
This thing weighs
about 200 pounds.

00:03:31.392 --> 00:03:33.350 align:middle line:84%
You're thinking to yourself
all these thoughts.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.760 align:middle line:84%
That's stupid and dumb and
everything else like that.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.660 align:middle line:90%
But you do it.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.990 align:middle line:90%
Reluctantly.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.230 align:middle line:84%
You go over to the edge
and you haul this canoe

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.160 align:middle line:84%
through the forest,
and over these logs,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.290 align:middle line:84%
and drag it here all the way
through this thing, which

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.080 align:middle line:84%
is called following
your higher self.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And you go down there
about two miles,

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.850 align:middle line:84%
when you look back to
we're right behind the bend

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.620 align:middle line:84%
that you couldn't
see, you look up

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.850 align:middle line:84%
and you see this 500 or 600 foot
waterfall coming straight down.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And you realize,
wow, if I hadn't of

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.370 align:middle line:84%
done that, I would be
mashed potatoes on the rocks

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.170 align:middle line:90%
down there.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.560 align:middle line:90%


00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.185 align:middle line:84%
And so often, in
my own experience,

00:04:21.185 --> 00:04:23.310 align:middle line:84%
this is what kept happening
over and over and over.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.160 align:middle line:84%
A higher self would
tell me to do something

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.630 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't understand why
I was doing it at the time.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.640 align:middle line:84%
But then after I did it, and
after I saw the reality unfold,

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.450 align:middle line:84%
then the wisdom of the move
of why I did what I did

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.040 align:middle line:90%
would usually take place.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.950 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I could understand,
but most of the time I

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:45.750 align:middle line:90%
couldn't.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.000 align:middle line:90%


00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what the
relationship is like, in a way.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Except, it's really
you up there flying,

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.493 align:middle line:84%
as well as down there
at the same time.

00:04:58.493 --> 00:05:11.030 align:middle line:90%


00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.580 align:middle line:84%
The actual connection
with a higher self

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.900 align:middle line:84%
has very subtle
aspects which I'm not

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.090 align:middle line:84%
really good at teaching and
trying to understand right now,

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.470 align:middle line:84%
and what it has to do with
things like self-esteem

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:38.170 align:middle line:84%
and being able to
believe in yourself,

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.170 align:middle line:90%
truthfulness, trusting.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:47.196 align:middle line:84%
Very subtle aspects that
I'm trying to identify

00:05:47.196 --> 00:05:49.320 align:middle line:84%
and trying to understand
so that I can communicate,

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.290 align:middle line:84%
and it's not one of my
great communication skills.

00:05:52.290 --> 00:06:00.680 align:middle line:90%


00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:09.140 align:middle line:84%
You have to believe in
yourself, here on Earth,

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.610 align:middle line:84%
that you are a divine being,
that you are connected to God

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.790 align:middle line:84%
and have purpose and meaning
in all of this world,

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.200 align:middle line:84%
that you're not
just an accident,

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.780 align:middle line:84%
and that you're not important
or anything else like this.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.240 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about
loving yourself.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.590 align:middle line:84%
These kinds of things
are all components

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.340 align:middle line:84%
that have to come together
before the connection

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.407 align:middle line:84%
with a higher self
can truly take place.

00:06:35.407 --> 00:06:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- like
I'm trying to say--

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.580 align:middle line:84%
this is what I'm
trying to understand,

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.660 align:middle line:84%
so that I can not only
put it into words,

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:48.340 align:middle line:84%
but to bring these components
together in someone that's

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.540 align:middle line:90%
before me, beside myself.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:51.620 align:middle line:90%
It just happened with me.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it just
appeared to just happen.

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:58.740 align:middle line:84%
I didn't seem to do
anything to make it happen.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And so some people have
no problems with this

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:02.780 align:middle line:90%
and others do.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is what I'm
studying, with this is about.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.520 align:middle line:84%
I think there's people here
that probably know more than me

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.320 align:middle line:90%
about this.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.550 align:middle line:90%


00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.420 align:middle line:84%
What I might do right now
is describe a technique

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.563 align:middle line:84%
that was given to me, in terms
of how to make this connection.

00:07:21.563 --> 00:07:24.110 align:middle line:90%


00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And then I might ask someone
else to come up here,

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:30.830 align:middle line:84%
in a little bit,
and talk about this.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.397 align:middle line:90%
So maybe they can help you.

00:07:32.397 --> 00:07:35.935 align:middle line:90%


00:07:35.935 --> 00:07:40.400 align:middle line:84%
But I think I'll give
this technique first.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:45.180 align:middle line:84%
The technique that I was
given is just a technique,

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.130 align:middle line:90%
there's other ways.

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:48.770 align:middle line:90%
There's other ways.

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:51.290 align:middle line:84%
But this is more or
less the way I did it.

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do
with, first of all,

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:59.620 align:middle line:84%
you get a pencil and paper--
in fact, you need one right now

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:07.290 align:middle line:84%
to write this down-- to write
down what I am about to say.

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:09.030 align:middle line:84%
You can try this,
and it does seem

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:10.790 align:middle line:90%
to work for certain people.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And I think what it is, it works
for the people that are ready.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:19.541 align:middle line:84%
If you're not ready, it
may not work right away.

00:08:19.541 --> 00:08:28.154 align:middle line:90%


00:08:28.154 --> 00:08:30.320 align:middle line:84%
First thing is, is that you
would go into the Christ

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.289 align:middle line:84%
consciousness-- first of all,
before you ever even begin,

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:40.420 align:middle line:84%
you are to write down on this
piece of paper now a question.

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:45.820 align:middle line:90%


00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:48.437 align:middle line:84%
Write down a question
to your higher self.

00:08:48.437 --> 00:08:49.895 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
like a polarity

00:08:49.895 --> 00:08:52.094 align:middle line:84%
here now, as though
you were two-ness,

00:08:52.094 --> 00:08:53.260 align:middle line:90%
though it's really one-ness.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.790 align:middle line:90%


00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:59.160 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning,
it is a two-ness.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And so you write
down on this paper

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:04.990 align:middle line:84%
a question that you're
going to ask yourself,

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:07.730 align:middle line:84%
when you make this
connection with yourself.

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And the question would be
something along this line-- I'm

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.290 align:middle line:90%
not going to tell you exactly.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:14.340 align:middle line:84%
You need to write it
down in your own words.

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And that is, you're going
to ask your own self what

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:24.830 align:middle line:84%
it is you can do that would
be an act-- a physical act--

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:28.650 align:middle line:84%
you can do in this world,
that would, a, first of all,

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:35.770 align:middle line:84%
be something that would be
spiritually healthy for you.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:40.600 align:middle line:84%
Something that would be good
for your spiritual evolution.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And second of all, by the
very act of doing this thing,

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:49.140 align:middle line:84%
would demonstrate to you-- in
order to prove to your heart--

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:52.650 align:middle line:84%
that you have made connection
with your higher self.

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:54.170 align:middle line:90%
You're testing higher self.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:57.390 align:middle line:84%
You're asking it to give
you something to test.

00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:02.972 align:middle line:90%


00:10:02.972 --> 00:10:04.930 align:middle line:84%
So you write this question
down of how you want

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:06.534 align:middle line:90%
to put it in your own words.

00:10:06.534 --> 00:10:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And you put it on
a piece of paper

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:11.330 align:middle line:84%
and you put the pencil right
down on the floor or wherever

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.366 align:middle line:84%
on your table wherever
you are, when you're

00:10:13.366 --> 00:10:14.491 align:middle line:90%
going to do the meditation.

00:10:14.491 --> 00:10:16.930 align:middle line:90%


00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And then you sit down and
you do this meditation.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.890 align:middle line:84%
I suggest that you
wait about two weeks,

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:25.350 align:middle line:84%
so that you do this meditation
till you get to the place--

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:28.590 align:middle line:84%
to the first 13, 14 breaths--
that you get to the place

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:33.080 align:middle line:84%
where you're comfortable
with it and you're

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.255 align:middle line:90%
familiar with the exercise.

00:10:35.255 --> 00:10:37.315 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have to
really think about it.

00:10:37.315 --> 00:10:39.190 align:middle line:84%
You know how to ride a
bicycle and you're not

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:41.100 align:middle line:84%
having to figure out
where everything is.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know how to do
it-- the mechanics of it.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And then, when you're feeling
you're ready, you go in,

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:51.042 align:middle line:84%
you sit down, you get somewhere
where you have turned off

00:10:51.042 --> 00:10:52.750 align:middle line:84%
your telephone, you've
locked your doors,

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:54.810 align:middle line:84%
no one is going to interfere
with you, and all these kinds

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:56.520 align:middle line:84%
of things, because
those kinds of things

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.360 align:middle line:90%
could come at the wrong moment.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.680 align:middle line:84%
So you just isolate
yourself a little bit,

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.860 align:middle line:90%
one time when you're ready.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And begin the breathing
and go until you

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:07.938 align:middle line:84%
get to the place
of the 14th breath.

00:11:07.938 --> 00:11:10.690 align:middle line:90%


00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:12.520 align:middle line:90%
Boy, we need to air this place.

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:00.080 align:middle line:90%
it's very, very still.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.440 align:middle line:84%

You don't have to be anything.

You just are.

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And if you stay long
enough in there,

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:20.260 align:middle line:84%
you won't even be aware
of your body or anything.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.450 align:middle line:90%

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening is you're
breathing fourth dimensionally.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And when you get that
still in that breathing,

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:34.460 align:middle line:84%
you're going to raise your
consciousness very slowly

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:39.150 align:middle line:84%
to a very high level of
fourth dimension-- not high

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.450 align:middle line:84%
compared to what is
possible, but higher compared

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:43.690 align:middle line:90%
to where you are now.

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:46.810 align:middle line:84%
You'll be breathing, you'll
be raising your frequency

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:49.430 align:middle line:84%
to a fourth dimensional
frequency, which

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:52.150 align:middle line:84%
will make it very
easy from that place

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:55.390 align:middle line:90%
to connect with higher self.

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:59.670 align:middle line:84%
You could do it in a Safeway
or a [? Furs ?] meat market

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:03.520 align:middle line:84%
or something, but it would
be a little harder there,

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.520 align:middle line:84%
than it would be in
this real quiet place.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:14.209 align:middle line:84%
And so once you get there, and
you stay there for a while,

00:13:14.209 --> 00:13:15.750 align:middle line:84%
and you feel like
it's right, and you

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:18.880 align:middle line:84%
feel like you've reached,
and your heart is open

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:26.840 align:middle line:84%
as much as you can, then, with
as much sincerity as you can,

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.680 align:middle line:84%
ask your higher self
to come down to you.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:34.090 align:middle line:84%
To come into your
presence where you are,

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:37.370 align:middle line:84%
so that you can feel this
higher aspect of yourself.

Either in or around you.

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:44.718 align:middle line:90%
You invoke it.

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:51.475 align:middle line:90%
You're asking it to come in.

00:13:51.475 --> 00:13:54.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, the next thing
that happens--

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:59.230 align:middle line:84%
assuming you are
ready-- is something

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:01.070 align:middle line:84%
that I can't say
what it will be,

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:04.020 align:middle line:84%
because it could
be almost anything.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:08.110 align:middle line:84%
Higher self can come
into you, or come to you,

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:11.940 align:middle line:84%
and that experience could
be almost anything at all.

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:16.255 align:middle line:84%
It's as limited as
your imagination.

00:14:16.255 --> 00:14:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's probably
tied to something

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.516 align:middle line:84%
that you have determined
a long time ago already.

00:14:21.516 --> 00:14:24.960 align:middle line:90%


00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.620 align:middle line:84%

come in and when it

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:33.350 align:middle line:84%
comes in you can
experience it in just about

of light and for my wife

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.200 align:middle line:90%
it was these big angels.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.140 align:middle line:90%
It might not be visual.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:39.820 align:middle line:84%

come in, and you know.

all, and there's just

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:59.757 align:middle line:84%
this feeling that comes
in that he's mean to you.

00:15:59.757 --> 00:16:01.340 align:middle line:84%
It may be that you're
sitting and then

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.589 align:middle line:84%
your hand picks up the pencil
and just starts writing.

00:16:03.589 --> 00:16:05.142 align:middle line:84%
And you're wondering
what's going on.

00:16:05.142 --> 00:16:08.150 align:middle line:84%
Because it's just
automatically doing it.

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:11.790 align:middle line:84%
It could be almost
anything at all,

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:16.760 align:middle line:84%
but the important part of
what I'm trying to say here

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:23.770 align:middle line:84%
is that-- assuming that you get
a communication of some sort,

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:27.560 align:middle line:84%
which, again, could take any
kind of form imaginable--

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.870 align:middle line:84%
but once you get the meaning
of what it means, you get it.

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:31.670 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it is.

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:34.010 align:middle line:84%
A series of geometrical
forms flashes across you

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:36.760 align:middle line:84%
and you go, oh,
OK, I understand.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.820 align:middle line:90%
And you get the message.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:44.100 align:middle line:84%
The next thing to do is to take
all of your fingers, all 10

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.850 align:middle line:84%
fingers-- assuming you're
down low on the ground--

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:49.730 align:middle line:90%
and put them on the ground.

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:52.550 align:middle line:84%
Take your 10 fingers
like this, if you're

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:56.710 align:middle line:84%
sitting down on the ground,
and put them down like this.

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:59.580 align:middle line:84%
This is the best thing if
you're low to the ground.

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.680 align:middle line:90%
What this will do is ground you.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:02.540 align:middle line:90%

getting sleepy and sleepy

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:52.073 align:middle line:90%
It's the pressure on that point.

00:17:52.073 --> 00:17:55.840 align:middle line:90%


00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:56.640 align:middle line:90%
This?

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.520 align:middle line:90%


00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:00.320 align:middle line:90%
This one.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.636 align:middle line:90%


00:18:03.636 --> 00:18:06.480 align:middle line:84%
>>Pulling the hair on the
back of the head, like this.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, that's getting
close, because you're

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.950 align:middle line:90%
doing the same thing.

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:10.866 align:middle line:84%
There's a place here,
if you just press on it,

00:18:10.866 --> 00:18:12.860 align:middle line:90%
you'll instantly wake up.

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And as long as you've
got your finger there,

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.080 align:middle line:90%
you can drive wide awake.

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:21.860 align:middle line:90%


00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.749 align:middle line:84%
You take it away and
after about 20 minutes,

00:18:23.749 --> 00:18:25.040 align:middle line:90%
you start getting sleepy again.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.000 align:middle line:84%
You've got to [SOUND EFFECT]
pinch yourself.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.250 align:middle line:84%
The same kind of thing,
you put your hands down

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:31.185 align:middle line:84%
and it'll just bring
you right back.

00:18:31.185 --> 00:18:33.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, getting back
fast is important,

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:35.980 align:middle line:84%
because I'll
explain in a moment.

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:36.870 align:middle line:90%
You got this message.

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:39.500 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you get your message
you just say, thank you.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:40.330 align:middle line:90%
Goodbye.

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:43.057 align:middle line:84%
And put your hands down
and come right out.

00:18:43.057 --> 00:18:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And without thinking
about the message

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:48.840 align:middle line:84%
or pondering it or anything
else, pick up your pen

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:52.050 align:middle line:84%
and write down the message,
and get the whole message

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:53.460 align:middle line:90%
far onto the paper.

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:55.000 align:middle line:90%
Don't discuss it with yourself.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.584 align:middle line:84%
Don't think about
any of the words.

00:18:56.584 --> 00:18:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Just get the whole
thing on there,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.170 align:middle line:84%
and put the last
period on there.

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:02.460 align:middle line:84%
It's very important that
in the initial stages

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.610 align:middle line:90%
you do this as fast as possible.

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:07.460 align:middle line:90%
It's almost critical.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:11.470 align:middle line:84%
The reason is, is because the
biggest problem, initially,

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:14.510 align:middle line:84%
with communication--
inter-dimensional

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:18.460 align:middle line:84%
communication-- is the
lower dimensional level

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:24.220 align:middle line:84%
aspect hears the communication
and then changes it,

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.020 align:middle line:84%
because the ego gets
in there and says,

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.852 align:middle line:90%
no, I'm not going to do that.

00:19:27.852 --> 00:19:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And so it just changes
something and then by the time

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:31.877 align:middle line:84%
you get it down you
get something else.

00:19:31.877 --> 00:19:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And so this is really important
that you get it on there

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:35.290 align:middle line:90%
as fast as possible.

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Get it written down so
you can't change it.

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.212 align:middle line:90%
And so you get it on there.

00:19:39.212 --> 00:19:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And then, after you
get it down, then you

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.890 align:middle line:90%
can pick it up and read it.

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Then you can think
about it all you want.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:48.410 align:middle line:84%
The first thing
I've got to say--

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:55.550 align:middle line:84%
and this almost
certainly will not occur.

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:57.530 align:middle line:84%
The likelihood of it
is just about zero,

00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:02.260 align:middle line:84%
but I must say it because
there is a slim chance.

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:05.890 align:middle line:84%
If the message tells
you to do something

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:08.910 align:middle line:84%
that you believe
is morally wrong,

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:13.600 align:middle line:84%
you did not-- repeat--
did not get higher self.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:17.610 align:middle line:84%
Take the message, burn
it, and wait a while,

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:20.932 align:middle line:84%
like a month or something,
and meditate deeper,

00:20:20.932 --> 00:20:22.390 align:middle line:84%
because you didn't
get higher self.

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:23.120 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what happened.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.930 align:middle line:84%
It's your ego, it's
something else.

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:27.870 align:middle line:90%
Because your higher self is you.

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:30.600 align:middle line:84%
It is a very pure aspect
of you, and it's not

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.270 align:middle line:90%
going to do anything like that.

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:33.215 align:middle line:90%
It won't.

00:20:33.215 --> 00:20:34.090 align:middle line:90%
It just simply won't.

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:36.527 align:middle line:90%


00:20:36.527 --> 00:20:38.110 align:middle line:84%
Not even to test you
or anything else.

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:40.160 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to do that.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.350 align:middle line:90%
Definitely in early stages.

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:46.250 align:middle line:90%


00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:48.810 align:middle line:84%
Assuming that did not happen--
you just got this message.

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:49.610 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:51.380 align:middle line:90%
You read the message.

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.310 align:middle line:90%
It's about the 71st one.

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:56.490 align:middle line:90%
Ah, there's the one I want.

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:58.610 align:middle line:90%
That's not it.

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:01.400 align:middle line:90%
You do it.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And I've been following
this for a really long time

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:12.850 align:middle line:84%
and, though there is
different opinions on this,

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:15.490 align:middle line:84%
it has served me very
well in this way.

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:17.165 align:middle line:90%
This is my way of doing it.

00:21:17.165 --> 00:21:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And now you may have a
slightly different way

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.490 align:middle line:84%
of working with your
higher self, and that's OK.

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:23.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that the
way that I'm telling you

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:24.330 align:middle line:90%
is the only way.

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:26.530 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of
ways-- lots and lots

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:30.450 align:middle line:84%
of ways of working
with this energy.

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:34.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, the higher self may
tell you to do something

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:37.390 align:middle line:90%
like-- I don't know.

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:42.480 align:middle line:90%


00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.020 align:middle line:90%
Let me think.

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:46.870 align:middle line:84%
You know this disk that
you see sitting here?

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:52.200 align:middle line:84%
My higher self told me, OK, it's
time for you to go study sound.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And I had to study sound
relative to the chakras.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.606 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what do I do?

00:21:56.606 --> 00:21:58.230 align:middle line:84%
They said, go for a
walk in the forest.

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:01.130 align:middle line:90%


00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:01.930 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:03.250 align:middle line:84%
What's going for a
walk in the forest

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:04.916 align:middle line:84%
got to do with studying
sound, you know?

00:22:04.916 --> 00:22:06.649 align:middle line:84%
So I go for a walk
in the forest.

00:22:06.649 --> 00:22:07.690 align:middle line:90%
And I walk in the forest.

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:09.560 align:middle line:84%
I walk for about
two or three miles,

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:12.700 align:middle line:84%
just walk and wonder why
I'm walking in this forest.

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And I walk up to a tree and,
out in the middle of nowhere,

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:25.060 align:middle line:84%
this disk and another
one about that big

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:29.050 align:middle line:90%
are leaned up against a tree.

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:29.960 align:middle line:90%
Sitting there.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And I go, I wonder
what these are.

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And I took them home
and I found that

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:39.930 align:middle line:84%
by striking this
thing, and the way

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:42.070 align:middle line:84%
the sound-- which is a
counter-rotating field going

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:45.800 align:middle line:84%
this way and a counter-rotating
field going this way-- that I

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:49.820 align:middle line:84%
was able to explore how
counter-rotating field sounds

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:51.260 align:middle line:90%
affect chakras.

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And I studied it for a
long, long, long time.

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:56.004 align:middle line:84%
I ended up putting a
pulley on this thing

00:22:56.004 --> 00:22:58.420 align:middle line:84%
and was able to raise it, and
put it at different chakras,

00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:59.220 align:middle line:90%
and strike it.

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:03.060 align:middle line:90%


00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:04.114 align:middle line:90%
I learned a whole lot.

00:23:04.114 --> 00:23:05.780 align:middle line:84%
It was a really
important lesson for me.

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:14.320 align:middle line:90%


00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:19.006 align:middle line:84%
The one that I have used
several times-- they've given me

00:23:19.006 --> 00:23:20.630 align:middle line:84%
certain ones to say,
and I don't really

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:22.500 align:middle line:84%
know why I'm supposed to--
There's so many other ones,

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:24.660 align:middle line:84%
but I keep using the ones
that they told me to say.

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:29.940 align:middle line:84%
So I go along by what
they tell me to do.

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:33.330 align:middle line:84%
The other one was
this guy from Japan,

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:36.090 align:middle line:84%
who has a form of
automatic writing.

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:39.420 align:middle line:84%
He goes into a trance and this
automatic writing comes out.

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:41.430 align:middle line:84%
But the writing itself,
when you look at it,

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:43.820 align:middle line:84%
is not a language
that's on this planet.

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:46.200 align:middle line:84%
So it looks like
something he made up.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:50.730 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't exist anywhere,
but he can read it.

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:52.300 align:middle line:90%
And he knows it's a language.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:55.340 align:middle line:84%
Nobody else can read
it, but he can read it.

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And he reads it and it tells
him what to do, and where to go,

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:02.570 align:middle line:84%
and what to do it in
his world, in his life.

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:03.450 align:middle line:90%
What his guidance.

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:05.120 align:middle line:90%
It tells him his direction.

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.895 align:middle line:84%
And in one of these
things-- I got

00:24:07.895 --> 00:24:09.520 align:middle line:84%
to know this person,
that's why I know.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:12.020 align:middle line:84%
In one of these
things it told him

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:15.610 align:middle line:84%
to go to Canada-- to
Vancouver, Canada--

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:18.640 align:middle line:84%
to a very specific street
corner, on a certain day,

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.900 align:middle line:84%
at a certain time
and stand there.

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:23.445 align:middle line:90%
This guy was very dedicated.

00:24:23.445 --> 00:24:27.720 align:middle line:84%
He bought a ticket from
Japan, flew to Canada,

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:31.190 align:middle line:84%
went to the street corner,
and stood there and waited.

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:33.260 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, I had
done a real similar thing,

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:37.002 align:middle line:84%
the angels had
given me an address.

00:24:37.002 --> 00:24:38.460 align:middle line:84%
They had given me
an address, which

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:43.270 align:middle line:84%
was 111 dash 444 4 street,
Fourth Avenue, in Vancouver,

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:45.040 align:middle line:90%
and told me to go there.

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.160 align:middle line:90%
And I did go there.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And they said that I would meet
a man, David Livingstone, which

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:49.600 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.970 align:middle line:84%
I think I told that story
in the other videos.

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And I did go there
and I ended up

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:56.666 align:middle line:84%
in the school, which was
called Alpha and Omega

00:24:56.666 --> 00:24:57.540 align:middle line:90%
Order of Melchizedek.

00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:00.580 align:middle line:90%


00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And while I was at this
school, which was a school

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:07.560 align:middle line:84%
to teach or learn how to
convert negative energy

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:13.310 align:middle line:84%
into positive energy
on a planetary level,

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:16.750 align:middle line:84%
one of my trainings
was that David

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:18.790 align:middle line:90%
let me witness this thing.

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And David's sitting there and
he says, oh, this guy is down

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.830 align:middle line:90%
in such and such street now.

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:25.810 align:middle line:90%
He's there.

00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:26.810 align:middle line:90%
He's just sitting there.

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:28.700 align:middle line:90%
And he says, he's there now.

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:32.420 align:middle line:84%
So he tells this other person
to go down and get him.

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:34.750 align:middle line:84%
So this guy drives down,
goes up to the street,

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:37.185 align:middle line:84%
and there's this little
Japanese guy sitting there, that

00:25:37.185 --> 00:25:40.120 align:middle line:90%
had been told to stand there.

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.705 align:middle line:84%
And he goes up to him and he
says, would you come with me?

00:25:42.705 --> 00:25:43.565 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, OK.

00:25:43.565 --> 00:25:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And he gets in the
car and he takes him

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:47.185 align:middle line:84%
over to where I was on
this place over here,

00:25:47.185 --> 00:25:49.070 align:middle line:84%
and brings him up
into this room.

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And David comes in to him
and says, why are you here?

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:56.070 align:middle line:90%
What led you here?

00:25:56.070 --> 00:26:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And he could speak
English-- sort of--

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:07.570 align:middle line:84%
and he said, that his writing
told him to come here--

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:09.720 align:middle line:90%
or to come to that place.

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And David says, can
I see your writing.

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.590 align:middle line:90%
And so he showed it to him.

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:15.184 align:middle line:90%
David looks at it, hm.

00:26:15.184 --> 00:26:16.068 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:16.068 --> 00:26:18.499 align:middle line:84%
And he says, would you
wait here just a minute?

00:26:18.499 --> 00:26:19.540 align:middle line:90%
I'll be back in a minute.

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:20.340 align:middle line:90%
So David leaves.

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:22.320 align:middle line:90%
So I wait here with this guy.

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And a little while
later this young woman

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.260 align:middle line:84%
comes in-- there's over
400 people in this group--

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:30.640 align:middle line:84%
so I didn't even know
everybody in the group.

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:35.280 align:middle line:84%
This woman comes in and
she puts an easel up,

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.710 align:middle line:84%
like this, only it
has a thing, a piece

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:40.190 align:middle line:90%
of cloth over the top of it.

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:43.536 align:middle line:90%
Sets it down and walks out.

00:26:43.536 --> 00:26:44.910 align:middle line:84%
We wait around
for a little while

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:51.830 align:middle line:84%
and pretty soon David comes
in with four other people,

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:54.840 align:middle line:84%
who come in and
stand there quietly.

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.750 align:middle line:84%
Two were on either
side of the easel.

00:26:56.750 --> 00:27:00.780 align:middle line:84%
I was in here, David was here,
and this little Japanese guy

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:01.810 align:middle line:90%
was right here.

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:10.227 align:middle line:90%


00:27:10.227 --> 00:27:12.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember exactly the
conversation at this point.

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:18.880 align:middle line:84%
David said something to him--
something I don't remember.

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:22.845 align:middle line:84%
And then he lifted
the cloth up and on

00:27:22.845 --> 00:27:25.620 align:middle line:90%
there was this guy's writing.

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:27.090 align:middle line:90%
All over it.

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And it said something
to him like-- I mean,

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:31.220 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't read it,
but whatever it was

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:33.580 align:middle line:90%
his smile went about that big.

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:35.730 align:middle line:84%
It said something
to him, you are now

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:38.710 align:middle line:84%
home or something like this,
and da da da like that.

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And, come to find out,
the other four people

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:44.070 align:middle line:84%
that were sitting
there-- who were

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:46.970 align:middle line:84%
all different nationalities,
from four different countries

00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:51.810 align:middle line:84%
from around the world-- also
had the same exact writing,

00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:53.692 align:middle line:84%
the same exact
situation in their life.

00:27:53.692 --> 00:27:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And so they were the ones
who wrote that on the board

00:27:55.900 --> 00:28:00.432 align:middle line:84%
to him, at which
point he was ecstatic.

00:28:00.432 --> 00:28:01.390 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I can tell you.

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:03.930 align:middle line:84%
The guy just started
crying and bawling

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:05.760 align:middle line:90%
and everything else like that.

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:09.640 align:middle line:84%
He had met four more
people that were from him,

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:12.660 align:middle line:90%
that were him, from him.

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And this was like a very, very
powerful experience for him.

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:20.639 align:middle line:84%
And it was a training for
me to watch this take place.

00:28:20.639 --> 00:28:23.180 align:middle line:84%
I had a lot of trainings like
this, but this was one of them.

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:30.350 align:middle line:90%


00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And so starting all the way
back from when he was just

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:37.080 align:middle line:84%
getting that transmission--
the writing that said,

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.140 align:middle line:84%
go to Canada, stand
on a street corner

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.170 align:middle line:84%
a certain day-- if you
got a transmission that

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:45.740 align:middle line:84%
said go to Japan, stand on
there, at a certain day,

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:48.600 align:middle line:84%
at a certain time, would you
have the courage to do it?

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.110 align:middle line:90%


00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:52.530 align:middle line:90%
This is what you're being asked.

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:55.120 align:middle line:90%


00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.949 align:middle line:90%
>>If it came loud and clear.

00:28:56.949 --> 00:28:58.115 align:middle line:90%
>>If it came loud and clear.

00:28:58.115 --> 00:29:01.500 align:middle line:90%


00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:02.490 align:middle line:90%
>>If it's a whisper--

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:06.810 align:middle line:84%
>>What if it came
quiet and foggy?

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:12.420 align:middle line:84%
Guys Well, this is really
what it comes down to,

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:14.180 align:middle line:84%
if you've got the
guts to do this stuff.

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:14.980 align:middle line:90%
It takes a lot.

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:16.260 align:middle line:90%
And maybe you don't right now.

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:18.850 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're not really
ready and, if which case,

00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:21.172 align:middle line:84%
you probably won't make
connection with higher self.

00:29:21.172 --> 00:29:23.000 align:middle line:90%
>>But we all made it here.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:23.930 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:24.730 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:27.990 align:middle line:84%
You got a guidance on one level,
for sure, to get this far.

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:30.280 align:middle line:84%
All I'm saying is, if you
don't make it right now,

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.060 align:middle line:90%
hang in there because you will.

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:33.880 align:middle line:84%
You definitely
will, but you will

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:38.550 align:middle line:84%
be faced with this thing of
having to, somewhat give up

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:44.570 align:middle line:84%
your life, and allow
something greater to enter in.

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean is you're
mundane life, which

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:52.170 align:middle line:84%
may be whatever you're
doing right now.

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:54.420 align:middle line:84%
Another way to say it,
whatever you're doing right now

00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:57.540 align:middle line:84%
may change dramatically
after that.

00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:00.255 align:middle line:84%
And your life may
change incredibly.

00:30:00.255 --> 00:30:04.140 align:middle line:90%


00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:11.754 align:middle line:90%
And so [INAUDIBLE] so many.

00:30:11.754 --> 00:30:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>>Drunvalo, I think [INAUDIBLE]
point is really beautiful.

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:17.766 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to see a show of hands
about how many people feel

00:30:17.766 --> 00:30:20.652 align:middle line:84%
like they either gave up
something or really went

00:30:20.652 --> 00:30:22.360 align:middle line:90%
against the grain or something.

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, OK, let me
ask this question.

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:27.664 align:middle line:84%
How many people
here, right now, feel

00:30:27.664 --> 00:30:29.830 align:middle line:84%
that you're already connected
with your higher self?

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:32.572 align:middle line:90%


00:30:32.572 --> 00:30:34.702 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:30:34.702 --> 00:30:37.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, you see, I've asked
this question before

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:45.344 align:middle line:84%
in other classes, and I usually
only get maybe 5 to 10 people.

00:30:45.344 --> 00:30:46.600 align:middle line:90%
>>Wow.

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>>So this is a very different--
this is a much higher level

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.150 align:middle line:90%
class.

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:53.260 align:middle line:90%
This is a lot of people.

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:54.876 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[INAUDIBLE] Just
in addition, some

00:30:54.876 --> 00:30:57.140 align:middle line:84%
of the information
that's coming in

00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:01.510 align:middle line:84%
is to shift the word
from self to selves.

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:02.607 align:middle line:90%
>>Selves?

00:31:02.607 --> 00:31:05.290 align:middle line:90%
>>Connection to higher selves.

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:06.447 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, OK.

00:31:06.447 --> 00:31:08.280 align:middle line:84%
In terms of what you
are just saying there--

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:10.420 align:middle line:84%
from self to
selves-- like I said,

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:13.380 align:middle line:84%
there's a higher self to a
higher self to a higher self.

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:17.150 align:middle line:90%
What this is is a process.

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:18.890 align:middle line:90%
It's an ongoing process.

00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:20.450 align:middle line:90%
This is what I've discovered.

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:22.480 align:middle line:84%
What I found in
the first part is,

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:28.830 align:middle line:84%
is that higher self-- single--
came in these two spheres,

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:31.079 align:middle line:90%
and I began to follow this.

00:31:31.079 --> 00:31:32.620 align:middle line:84%
And I followed it
by writing it down.

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:34.000 align:middle line:84%
I have a journal
where I wrote down

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.125 align:middle line:84%
everything they said for
years and years and years.

00:31:36.125 --> 00:31:38.790 align:middle line:90%


00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And then, at one
point, I discovered

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:44.590 align:middle line:84%
that there was a
change occurring in me

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:50.320 align:middle line:84%
and higher self began to come
to me less and less and less.

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:54.310 align:middle line:90%


00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't see it or see
them or myself-- however you

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.820 align:middle line:90%
want to say it-- as often.

00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And then, about
a year ago, there

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:07.570 align:middle line:84%
was a third higher self, a third
angel, which was a gold angel,

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:11.340 align:middle line:84%
or a gold sphere, that
was sometimes there

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:14.400 align:middle line:84%
and was sometimes not
there, but usually not.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:18.029 align:middle line:84%
When I asked what these other
two entities were, one said,

00:32:18.029 --> 00:32:20.320 align:middle line:84%
it was the spirit of the
Earth and the other the spirit

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:21.120 align:middle line:90%
of the Sun.

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:24.460 align:middle line:90%


00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:26.470 align:middle line:90%
But that they were me.

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:29.580 align:middle line:84%
There was a poem that came out
at one point, right after that,

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:32.286 align:middle line:90%
I am the Earth, I am the sun.

00:32:32.286 --> 00:32:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I am
really neither one.

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:38.242 align:middle line:90%


00:32:38.242 --> 00:32:43.150 align:middle line:84%
About a year ago, I started
to do a workshop in San Juan

00:32:43.150 --> 00:32:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Islands, I think it was,
and the gold sphere came in

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:52.160 align:middle line:84%
and it just came over me
and just came down into me.

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And I knew at that moment
that something had changed.

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:57.000 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't quite sure exactly
what had happened, because I was

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.890 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of a workshop.

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:01.165 align:middle line:84%
And I was in my own
little self going,

00:33:01.165 --> 00:33:04.330 align:middle line:84%
I know something [INAUDIBLE]
is different here.

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And since then, I've
discovered that all

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:11.420 align:middle line:84%
I can call it is a
knowingness has come over me.

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:15.421 align:middle line:84%
There's no more a polarity, or
asking a question and receiving

00:33:15.421 --> 00:33:16.221 align:middle line:90%
and answer.

00:33:16.221 --> 00:33:21.870 align:middle line:90%


00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:27.120 align:middle line:84%
There's not even an internal
asking of a question anymore.

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:31.240 align:middle line:84%
I just simply know
that what I'm doing

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:37.500 align:middle line:84%
is exactly right, without--
I can't explain it exactly.

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.640 align:middle line:84%
There's just this
knowing that comes over.

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And I can see that this whole
thing is just a process.

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:44.460 align:middle line:90%
It's more to it.

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:47.869 align:middle line:84%
So what's now happened,
I believe, another way

00:33:47.869 --> 00:33:50.410 align:middle line:84%
of interpreting this is, that
the higher self that I had been

00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:53.730 align:middle line:90%
communicating with has come in.

00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And that the level that extends
out into the higher selves--

00:33:57.390 --> 00:34:00.790 align:middle line:84%
like she's trying to
say-- has been opened.

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And so now it is
a different form

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:06.750 align:middle line:84%
of higher level
communication, that

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:13.150 align:middle line:84%
doesn't require the polarity
aspect of what was before.

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And I assume, that
at some point,

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:18.350 align:middle line:84%
if that's true,
then-- if there are

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:20.080 align:middle line:84%
selves to selves--
that at some point,

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:24.739 align:middle line:84%
something else will come in,
and an even greater level will

00:34:24.739 --> 00:34:26.471 align:middle line:90%
extended into myself.

00:34:26.471 --> 00:34:28.679 align:middle line:84%
Though I can't, at this
moment, imagine what that is.

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:32.887 align:middle line:90%


00:34:32.887 --> 00:34:34.719 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]?

00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:37.969 align:middle line:90%
>>When that came in?

00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:38.949 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, there was.

00:34:38.949 --> 00:34:42.340 align:middle line:90%


00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:48.650 align:middle line:84%
It felt very much like a
light extended around me.

00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:55.760 align:middle line:90%


00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:59.980 align:middle line:84%
My sensation of
breathing changed.

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And, I don't know,
I felt different.

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:10.210 align:middle line:84%
I felt more self-assured,
which I thought I was,

00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:13.990 align:middle line:84%
but I even felt more
so than ever before.

00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:16.696 align:middle line:84%
Though not instantly,
over a period of time.

00:35:16.696 --> 00:35:19.480 align:middle line:90%


00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:24.160 align:middle line:84%
It isn't like some kind of
real powerful sensation,

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:27.260 align:middle line:84%
but it was a very, very
clear thing that took place.

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>>There are voices
that people hear

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:31.580 align:middle line:84%
and automatic writing
that people participate

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:35.670 align:middle line:84%
in that sometimes originates
with entities that

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:38.750 align:middle line:90%
are not people's higher selves.

00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Could you speak to
the different feelings

00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:42.900 align:middle line:84%
that people would
experience in their heart

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:46.260 align:middle line:84%
chakra or other centers,
based on the source

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:48.930 align:middle line:84%
of the information and
the degree to which people

00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:50.520 align:middle line:84%
are shielded from
that sort of thing,

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.990 align:middle line:84%
in the state that you
are suggesting people get

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:54.780 align:middle line:90%
into before they attempt this?

00:35:54.780 --> 00:36:00.560 align:middle line:84%
>>This is the key to--
you see, the Merkaba

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:02.220 align:middle line:84%
and the Christ
sphere bleeding that

00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:06.557 align:middle line:84%
is at the core inside
of it, is the sense

00:36:06.557 --> 00:36:08.140 align:middle line:84%
that-- the Merkaba
is the pattern that

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:09.800 align:middle line:90%
created the universe.

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:12.030 align:middle line:84%
When we created this
universe on this pattern,

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:15.070 align:middle line:84%
we used the pattern to
step into the experience,

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:16.990 align:middle line:90%
for the Merkaba to get into it.

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's also the
doorway to get out of it.

00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:24.370 align:middle line:84%
We set this up in such a
way that the Merkaba is also

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:28.180 align:middle line:84%
the protection
field unparalleled.

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:31.195 align:middle line:84%
Once you're in your Merkaba, or
even your Christ consciousness

00:36:31.195 --> 00:36:38.354 align:middle line:90%
breathing, it's more than a law.

00:36:38.354 --> 00:36:40.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how to say this.

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:44.540 align:middle line:84%
The outside influences, no
matter how great or how small,

00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:48.260 align:middle line:84%
cannot influence you,
unless you allow them to.

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And so the purpose
of waiting until you

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:54.920 align:middle line:84%
get into the breathing
and the sphere--

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:59.090 align:middle line:84%
the golden sphere of light--
is that your intention, then,

00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:03.390 align:middle line:90%
is that only your higher self.

00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:06.930 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you're invoking
your higher self to come in.

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:07.930 align:middle line:90%
No other.

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:10.260 align:middle line:90%
And no other will or can.

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:13.400 align:middle line:84%
The only exception would
be is if that person

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:17.120 align:middle line:84%
is running some program in
them saying-- that there's

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:19.580 align:middle line:84%
some kind of low level
program going on saying,

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:22.122 align:middle line:84%
only my higher self and
maybe Joe, over here.

00:37:22.122 --> 00:37:23.080 align:middle line:90%
Or something like that.

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:25.970 align:middle line:90%


00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:27.990 align:middle line:84%
Because it's going
to respond to that.

00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:29.680 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to
be very, very clear

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:32.870 align:middle line:84%
and say, only my higher
self I'm invoking.

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:35.065 align:middle line:90%
Only that, nothing else.

00:37:35.065 --> 00:37:38.032 align:middle line:84%
And as long as you do that,
you won't get anything else.

00:37:38.032 --> 00:37:39.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, without this golden
sphere, if you're just

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:43.430 align:middle line:84%
sitting down and
doing meditation,

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:45.470 align:middle line:84%
and you're saying,
asking for that,

00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:48.390 align:middle line:84%
you might get just
about anything.

00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Especially with automatic
writing or things like this.

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:54.090 align:middle line:90%


00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:58.200 align:middle line:84%
It might be benevolent
to you and it might not.

00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.320 align:middle line:90%
That's amounting to channeling.

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And you'll know, because you'll
feel this feeling come in--

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:07.760 align:middle line:84%
if you're sensitive in the back
of the head-- it will come in.

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:14.700 align:middle line:84%
Something actually enters
into you and it does not you.

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:15.710 align:middle line:90%
It's something else.

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:18.330 align:middle line:90%
Though it is you ultimately.

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:21.710 align:middle line:84%
Still, it's not what
you're attempting to do.

00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:23.455 align:middle line:84%
But if you are in
that sphere, you

00:38:23.455 --> 00:38:26.830 align:middle line:84%
don't have to have
any fear or worries.

00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:30.110 align:middle line:84%
You won't be harmed and
you won't be intruded upon.

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:32.480 align:middle line:90%
Not that they might not try.

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:34.484 align:middle line:84%
An outside influence
may try, but it

00:38:34.484 --> 00:38:35.775 align:middle line:90%
won't be able to reach through.

00:38:35.775 --> 00:38:36.575 align:middle line:90%
It just won't.

00:38:36.575 --> 00:38:44.160 align:middle line:90%


00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:49.170 align:middle line:84%
Once you hit the Merkaba
field, then the protection

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:50.494 align:middle line:90%
is just absolute.

00:38:50.494 --> 00:38:54.410 align:middle line:90%


00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:55.840 align:middle line:90%
There's just nothing.

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:56.670 align:middle line:90%
There's no way.

00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:59.450 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing.

00:38:59.450 --> 00:39:01.240 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think
that you're going

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:04.725 align:middle line:84%
to have any problems with
reaching herself in this way.

00:39:04.725 --> 00:39:08.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't anticipate that, and I
don't think there will be one.

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:10.580 align:middle line:90%
For lots of reasons.

00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:14.080 align:middle line:84%
Because of the situation that's
developed around the Earth,

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:17.690 align:middle line:84%
because of the unique
cooperation between the dark

00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:21.530 align:middle line:84%
and the light brotherhoods,
and because of the timing

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:22.580 align:middle line:90%
that we're at right now.

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:23.413 align:middle line:90%
And everything else.

00:39:23.413 --> 00:39:25.634 align:middle line:84%
So all of this should
move very easily,

00:39:25.634 --> 00:39:28.050 align:middle line:84%
and I don't really anticipate
any kind of problems at all.

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:32.332 align:middle line:90%


00:39:32.332 --> 00:39:33.132 align:middle line:90%
Don't be afraid.

00:39:33.132 --> 00:39:35.770 align:middle line:90%


00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:36.570 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:37.750 align:middle line:90%
Where's the mic?

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:39.742 align:middle line:90%
>>It seems-- is this on?

00:39:39.742 --> 00:39:42.810 align:middle line:84%
It seems that this
knowingness is

00:39:42.810 --> 00:39:46.130 align:middle line:84%
about not being afraid
of becoming God,

00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:48.820 align:middle line:84%
because the whole
Lucifer dying was

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:51.920 align:middle line:84%
about breaking the laws
of thinking that there

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:55.600 align:middle line:84%
is something higher than God,
and then causing a separation.

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And the Christ consciousness
is about being the Son of God

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:04.260 align:middle line:84%
or some aspect of God, and then
struggling to get back to God.

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:06.390 align:middle line:84%
But everything that's
happening now--

00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:09.030 align:middle line:84%
of acceleration
and all that-- is

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:12.080 align:middle line:84%
going into that state
like of knowingness, where

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.860 align:middle line:90%
it's really natural to be God.

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:17.170 align:middle line:90%
To be God.

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:20.310 align:middle line:84%
Not one person God
over anybody else,

00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:23.850 align:middle line:84%
but not putting
God above or below

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:27.430 align:middle line:84%
or putting anything
else above or below.

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:29.760 align:middle line:84%
So it seems like that
one-ness, that experience

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.930 align:middle line:84%
of one-ness, where
there's not even

00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:34.982 align:middle line:84%
a separation between a
higher and a lower self

00:40:34.982 --> 00:40:37.140 align:middle line:90%
is that experience.

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And we all just have to get
used to not be afraid of that,

00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:46.607 align:middle line:84%
or thinking that there is
something wrong with that.

00:40:46.607 --> 00:40:49.710 align:middle line:90%
>>I was going to say the same.

00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:52.562 align:middle line:84%
Because when you say, I want
to talk to my higher self,

00:40:52.562 --> 00:40:54.902 align:middle line:90%
you're creating a duality.

00:40:54.902 --> 00:40:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
duality [INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:01.160 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm assuming-- and most
of you are already here--

00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:05.690 align:middle line:84%
but if there's someone
that is already in duality

00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:07.804 align:middle line:84%
it offers a starting
point for the process.

00:41:07.804 --> 00:41:09.970 align:middle line:84%
[? >>But do not lead ?]
[? towards the light. ?] The

00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:11.988 align:middle line:90%
light is.

00:41:11.988 --> 00:41:14.500 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:15.950 align:middle line:90%
You're the teacher.

00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:18.130 align:middle line:90%
I hear what you're saying.

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:18.930 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:22.280 align:middle line:90%


00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:25.420 align:middle line:84%
>>This is just a
technique, like I said.

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:27.730 align:middle line:84%
There are other ways
of thinking about this,

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:30.150 align:middle line:84%
there are other ways
to approach this.

00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:31.770 align:middle line:90%
It's not the only way.

00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And like I have said already,
this is one of the weaker areas

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:42.180 align:middle line:84%
that I am able to
communicate in.

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:46.260 align:middle line:84%
However, what I'm
really offering

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:49.760 align:middle line:84%
is, more or less, the
process that I went through.

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.306 align:middle line:90%
This is what happened to me.

00:41:51.306 --> 00:41:55.460 align:middle line:90%
And I began to follow this.

00:41:55.460 --> 00:42:00.325 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm seeing is that--
that was the very first thing

00:42:00.325 --> 00:42:01.200 align:middle line:90%
the angel said to me.

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:03.110 align:middle line:84%
The very first
thing that came in.

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:04.690 align:middle line:84%
I saw something
separate from me.

00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me and said,
we are not separate from you,

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:11.070 align:middle line:90%
we are you.

00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:12.247 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't understand it.

00:42:12.247 --> 00:42:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to go
through and understanding

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:16.340 align:middle line:90%
process of how that could be.

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:21.010 align:middle line:84%
How something outside of
myself could be, actually, me.

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And it took many
years of understanding

00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:26.920 align:middle line:84%
and I'm still getting more
and more understanding

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:29.320 align:middle line:90%
through this very process.

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And different levels of
what I call communication

00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:36.050 align:middle line:90%
within myself.

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And so now it's to a
whole different place.

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And I have a feeling
that that is only

00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:44.070 align:middle line:84%
a step along the way,
or an interpretation,

00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:48.754 align:middle line:84%
of what's possible, or
a fusion within oneself

00:42:48.754 --> 00:42:50.920 align:middle line:84%
going across the spectrum
of the dimensional levels.

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:55.070 align:middle line:90%


00:42:55.070 --> 00:42:57.590 align:middle line:84%
But there's lots of other
ways of perceiving that.

00:42:57.590 --> 00:43:01.480 align:middle line:90%


00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:07.100 align:middle line:84%
And I honor any that brings
unity and brings people

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:09.630 align:middle line:90%
into one-ness.

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:13.080 align:middle line:84%
I've studied enough
of the other religions

00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:15.810 align:middle line:84%
to know and understand
what you're saying,

00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:18.160 align:middle line:84%
but that isn't what
happened to me.

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.313 align:middle line:84%
And so I have to come
from experience in this

00:43:20.313 --> 00:43:21.354 align:middle line:90%
is where I'm coming from.

00:43:21.354 --> 00:43:24.900 align:middle line:90%


00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:25.700 align:middle line:90%
>>Two things.

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:27.710 align:middle line:84%
One was about
following directions

00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:30.470 align:middle line:84%
and this goes way
back to the 60s, when

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:31.950 align:middle line:90%
I was in India for three years.

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And I was told that I had to
learn to follow directions,

00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:39.760 align:middle line:84%
even if I was in chaos
equal to the Calcutta train

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:42.630 align:middle line:84%
station-- which is
considerable-- that you really

00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:44.920 align:middle line:84%
have to hear your
inner guidance and do

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:47.040 align:middle line:90%
what they tell you to do.

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
was about writing,

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:53.040 align:middle line:84%
because I remember when
I first started writing,

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:56.035 align:middle line:84%
I would be writing
with my eyes closed.

00:43:56.035 --> 00:43:58.121 align:middle line:84%
So that when I went to
read it, it was such a mess

00:43:58.121 --> 00:43:59.370 align:middle line:90%
that it would be hard to read.

00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And then I learned
to open my eyes.

00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:04.855 align:middle line:84%
But it's like dictation, if you
don't get it right, they stop.

00:44:04.855 --> 00:44:07.665 align:middle line:84%
You've got to go back,
and they await for you.

00:44:07.665 --> 00:44:10.140 align:middle line:84%
Or they'll give you a
word that you don't even

00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:11.950 align:middle line:90%
know the meaning of it.

00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's like it won't go
on until you get what it was

00:44:17.410 --> 00:44:19.845 align:middle line:90%
they were trying to give you.

00:44:19.845 --> 00:44:23.640 align:middle line:84%
It may not be that you
have to [INAUDIBLE],

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:27.306 align:middle line:84%
you may be able to just write
as you sit in meditation.

00:44:27.306 --> 00:44:30.640 align:middle line:90%


00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:34.610 align:middle line:84%
>>I hear that, but what
is being expressed here,

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:39.070 align:middle line:84%
in various ways, is that there
are lots and lots of ways

00:44:39.070 --> 00:44:40.980 align:middle line:90%
of doing this.

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:42.710 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm just saying
that this is one way,

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:45.530 align:middle line:90%
and that might happen too.

00:44:45.530 --> 00:44:48.740 align:middle line:84%
It may be that it's a
continuous flow that you

00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:50.520 align:middle line:84%
don't wait to come
out of meditation,

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:52.740 align:middle line:90%
you stay in meditation.

00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:56.120 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, this is what
my wife used to do.

00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:59.310 align:middle line:84%
She would look at the angels
and write-- dictate-- directly

00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:01.380 align:middle line:90%
as they speak.

00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:03.879 align:middle line:84%
>>And now what it is,
it's like sometimes I

00:45:03.879 --> 00:45:06.170 align:middle line:84%
get told to do things that
don't make any sense at all,

00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:08.160 align:middle line:84%
but they just said, we
have to know that you

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:09.410 align:middle line:90%
will follow what we tell you.

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:11.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, things that don't
seem to matter at all,

00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:14.470 align:middle line:84%
like which way you're
going to go somewhere.

00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:17.160 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like you're
always being tested.

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:20.380 align:middle line:90%


00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>>I would like Dawn to speak
about this, if she would.

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:25.002 align:middle line:90%
Would you talk?

00:45:25.002 --> 00:45:26.252 align:middle line:90%
>>About this particular point?

00:45:26.252 --> 00:45:28.904 align:middle line:84%
>>No, about your
viewpoint on-- you

00:45:28.904 --> 00:45:30.320 align:middle line:84%
have a particular
viewpoint, which

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:33.030 align:middle line:90%
I found pretty interesting.

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, with the
work that I do, I

00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:38.530 align:middle line:90%
feel that there's two elements.

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:40.350 align:middle line:84%
We can divide it
into two elements.

00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:43.550 align:middle line:84%
One is that there's the
relative third dimensional

00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:46.890 align:middle line:84%
element, where people
feel a lot of self-hatred

00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:50.200 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of confusion and
lack of trust in themselves.

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
past life element,

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:56.250 align:middle line:84%
which has to do
more with, perhaps,

00:45:56.250 --> 00:45:59.100 align:middle line:84%
fear of taking
responsibility again,

00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:02.500 align:middle line:84%
because we've been harmed
in the past or something.

00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:04.610 align:middle line:84%
That's one reason why
people will shut it off

00:46:04.610 --> 00:46:05.990 align:middle line:90%
from a past life.

00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:09.840 align:middle line:84%
Another reason from a
past life is, perhaps,

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.670 align:middle line:84%
that there's been
a mistake you made,

00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:14.830 align:middle line:84%
when you were following your
inner guidance or something.

00:46:14.830 --> 00:46:16.710 align:middle line:84%
It looks like you've
made a mistake.

00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:20.290 align:middle line:84%
So what I do is I try
to help a person, first,

00:46:20.290 --> 00:46:24.390 align:middle line:84%
to get in touch with their
own confidence in themselves,

00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:26.570 align:middle line:84%
their own love and
belief in themselves,

00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:28.970 align:middle line:90%
and trust in their own feelings.

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:34.800 align:middle line:84%
So many people, I find,
just do not feel confident

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.670 align:middle line:84%
in feeling what they're
feeling and in believing

00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:40.970 align:middle line:84%
their own guidance
for changing jobs

00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:44.120 align:middle line:84%
or changing living
environments or something.

00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And until we get to a
place where we really

00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:50.110 align:middle line:84%
learn to accept
and understand what

00:46:50.110 --> 00:46:52.950 align:middle line:84%
it is that's going on there,
feel what we're feeling,

00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:57.090 align:middle line:84%
allow that to come out,
allow ourselves to look at it

00:46:57.090 --> 00:47:01.030 align:middle line:84%
and knowledge, I've been hurt,
this doesn't feel good to me,

00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:04.020 align:middle line:84%
this does feel good to me,
this is on a totally third

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:05.450 align:middle line:90%
dimensional level.

00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And because so many people-- I'm
sure that the other therapists

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:13.180 align:middle line:84%
in the room would agree
with me-- that more than 80%

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:16.970 align:middle line:84%
of my clients have been abused,
very seriously, as children.

00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:18.740 align:middle line:84%
We do terrible things
to our children,

00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:22.090 align:middle line:84%
and we've all carried those
memories into our adulthood.

00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:26.690 align:middle line:84%
And just being able to say,
no, or just being able to say,

00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:28.970 align:middle line:90%
stop, is very difficult.

00:47:28.970 --> 00:47:31.860 align:middle line:84%
So what I work to do
is to get a person

00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:33.710 align:middle line:84%
to acknowledge what
they're feeling

00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:36.170 align:middle line:84%
in their heart,
whatever that is.

00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:38.490 align:middle line:84%
What is it that you're
really feeling down deep?

00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:40.240 align:middle line:90%
What is it you enjoy?

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:42.600 align:middle line:84%
What is it that's
frightening to you?

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And then once we get
that established,

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:47.340 align:middle line:84%
then we can go more
deeply and see what's

00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:49.210 align:middle line:90%
causing the fear from the past.

00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:50.420 align:middle line:90%
What did you come in with?

00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:52.300 align:middle line:84%
Why did you create
this violation

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:53.590 align:middle line:90%
with this [INAUDIBLE]?

00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:54.940 align:middle line:90%
What's the inner message?

00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:57.220 align:middle line:84%
What is it that you feel
you failed so miserably

00:47:57.220 --> 00:48:01.570 align:middle line:84%
at that you're not
willing, at this point,

00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:04.130 align:middle line:84%
to take back the reins
of your own dominion?

00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:05.530 align:middle line:90%
So that's the way that I work.

00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:08.840 align:middle line:84%
It's mostly starting with that
inner trust and inner love.

00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:11.450 align:middle line:84%
I think self love is
the basis of everything,

00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:14.430 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise what you
get from your higher self--

00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:18.010 align:middle line:84%
if you don't love yourself--
then your higher self

00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:23.090 align:middle line:84%
simply becomes another
authority in your life, which

00:48:23.090 --> 00:48:27.720 align:middle line:84%
is imposing upon you instead
of blending with this loving.

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:30.100 align:middle line:84%
The higher self connection,
in my experience,

00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:34.160 align:middle line:84%
should be one of
total, unbounded love.

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Even though we may get
information that's contrary,

00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:40.980 align:middle line:84%
like Drunvalo was saying,
walking through the forest

00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:41.780 align:middle line:90%
with our canoe.

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:44.160 align:middle line:84%
That seems contrary
to our life path.

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:45.850 align:middle line:84%
It's always done
in a loving way.

00:48:45.850 --> 00:48:49.210 align:middle line:84%
It's never done, at
least in my experience,

00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:55.860 align:middle line:84%
it's never done in a way
that feels abusive to us.

00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:59.330 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't come through
as a dictate to us, that

00:48:59.330 --> 00:49:02.240 align:middle line:90%
is very rude and intrusive.

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:05.610 align:middle line:84%
The way that we might have
experienced from childhood.

00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:08.350 align:middle line:84%
Loving ourselves and
trusting ourselves first,

00:49:08.350 --> 00:49:10.130 align:middle line:84%
understanding what
we're feeling,

00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:14.640 align:middle line:84%
that opens the door to
the deeper understanding

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:16.870 align:middle line:84%
and deeper connection
with the higher self.

00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:20.680 align:middle line:84%
So many times I have
people that have,

00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:23.750 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, been involved
in-- some of them

00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:26.870 align:middle line:84%
very serious-- people that have
been involved in drug dealing,

00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:30.800 align:middle line:84%
or I've had several clients who
have actually committed murder,

00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:33.540 align:middle line:84%
and they come in
really wanting to grow.

00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And how can they connect
with higher self when

00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:39.680 align:middle line:84%
they hate themselves so
much, when they really

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:41.020 align:middle line:90%
feel like they've erred.

00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:43.180 align:middle line:84%
Some of them feel like
they've erred simply

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:46.090 align:middle line:84%
because the programming
of their childhood.

00:49:46.090 --> 00:49:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Their parents have made them
feel like they're wrong.

00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:51.670 align:middle line:84%
The concept of shame--
that I am wrong.

00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:54.740 align:middle line:84%
Who I am, what I think,
what I feel is wrong.

00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:58.250 align:middle line:84%
So getting people to a point
of trusting what they feel,

00:49:58.250 --> 00:50:02.160 align:middle line:84%
believing in themselves, saying,
yes, that feels good to me.

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:03.910 align:middle line:84%
This is what I
need to do for me.

00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:07.330 align:middle line:84%
That's your first step, and
then the rest comes beyond that.

00:50:07.330 --> 00:50:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Then you can go and work
with your past lives.

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Then you can go and clear up
whatever other interferences

00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:18.090 align:middle line:84%
in the way, the fears
that might be buried

00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:20.070 align:middle line:90%
or might be subconscious.

00:50:20.070 --> 00:50:21.270 align:middle line:90%
The kinds of things that--

00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:23.920 align:middle line:90%


00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:26.740 align:middle line:84%
>>Let me just say one
more thing, this thing

00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:29.450 align:middle line:90%
about the higher self.

00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:31.900 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of people here,
there's a lot of information

00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:36.089 align:middle line:84%
here, and for those of you
who don't quite understand

00:50:36.089 --> 00:50:37.630 align:middle line:84%
try and communicate
with other people

00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:39.360 align:middle line:90%
and get other ideas about it.

00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:42.960 align:middle line:84%
But it is very, very
important, because if we

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:46.180 align:middle line:84%
move into the kinds
of rapid changes

00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:48.250 align:middle line:84%
that we're about
to go into, you've

00:50:48.250 --> 00:50:53.880 align:middle line:84%
got to be able to have
confidence in yourself,

00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:58.300 align:middle line:84%
to believe in yourself,
and know that you

00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:01.450 align:middle line:84%
can get the information
from within yourself.

00:51:01.450 --> 00:51:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And not go desperately
looking outside,

00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:06.159 align:middle line:84%
because you're not going to
be able to get it outside.

00:51:06.159 --> 00:51:08.034 align:middle line:84%
It is going to have to
come from within here.

00:51:08.034 --> 00:51:12.270 align:middle line:90%


00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:15.600 align:middle line:84%
Once you have that
inner guidance,

00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:17.610 align:middle line:84%
then the higher
self will say, OK.

00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:20.774 align:middle line:84%
Now you're ready
to use the Merkaba.

00:51:20.774 --> 00:51:22.190 align:middle line:84%
Because until you
get that, you're

00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:23.690 align:middle line:84%
not really ready
to use the Merkaba.

00:51:23.690 --> 00:51:26.474 align:middle line:90%


00:51:26.474 --> 00:51:27.274 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:51:27.274 --> 00:51:30.240 align:middle line:90%


00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:31.370 align:middle line:90%
We don't have it-- oh.

00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:36.757 align:middle line:90%


00:51:36.757 --> 00:51:38.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I'm
going to have time

00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:42.360 align:middle line:90%
for questions at the moment.

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:44.860 align:middle line:84%
>>This is just
following guidance.

00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:48.750 align:middle line:84%
To mention two points related
to attuning with our highness

00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:51.710 align:middle line:84%
and accepting the
reality of who we are.

00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:54.490 align:middle line:84%
That, actually,
the movement is not

00:51:54.490 --> 00:51:57.070 align:middle line:84%
a straight line
going from one point

00:51:57.070 --> 00:52:01.450 align:middle line:84%
to another, that it's a spiral,
which would be in conjunction

00:52:01.450 --> 00:52:02.960 align:middle line:90%
with all that you've taught us.

00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And that whatever has
been healed on one level

00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:10.270 align:middle line:84%
could very well reoccur
on another level,

00:52:10.270 --> 00:52:13.350 align:middle line:84%
with the response of, oh,
I thought I healed that.

00:52:13.350 --> 00:52:16.030 align:middle line:84%
When in reality it's
showing up again

00:52:16.030 --> 00:52:20.500 align:middle line:84%
to be exposed to a new
dimension of whatever it is.

00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And then, so forth,
we continue on.

00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:26.470 align:middle line:84%
Just to mention the
spiral movement.

00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And the other aspect has to do
with, I've worked with children

00:52:30.430 --> 00:52:33.100 align:middle line:84%
who have been labeled
as learning disabled

00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:36.420 align:middle line:84%
or who are not quote
unquote "intelligent."

00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And watched how
they have gone way

00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:46.640 align:middle line:84%
beyond the gifted
classes in their testing.

00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:48.130 align:middle line:90%
Just instantaneously.

00:52:48.130 --> 00:52:50.230 align:middle line:84%
In a very short time,
without even going

00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:51.620 align:middle line:90%
through any of the levels.

00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:55.770 align:middle line:84%
They've just, all of a
sudden, had instant knowing.

00:52:55.770 --> 00:52:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And it had to do with
opening of the heart.

00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:03.061 align:middle line:90%
