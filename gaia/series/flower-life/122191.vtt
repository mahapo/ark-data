00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:17.994 align:middle line:84%
>>There's a lot
of ways that that

00:00:17.994 --> 00:00:24.650 align:middle line:84%
can be for a
particular individual,

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.130 align:middle line:84%
that as you grow up,
you tend to reach

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.530 align:middle line:84%
to a different consciousness
level, which is a large body.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And when you go
up hire, you go up

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.026 align:middle line:84%
into a larger body
of consciousness.

00:00:40.026 --> 00:00:42.664 align:middle line:84%
It stretches further
and further and further.

00:00:42.664 --> 00:00:46.730 align:middle line:84%
If you're coming down,
it's like a vision.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.350 align:middle line:84%
It's like as soon as I
hit the Earth, in order

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.395 align:middle line:84%
to experience the polarity here,
I had to split myself in two.

00:00:55.395 --> 00:01:00.056 align:middle line:84%
So I broke my spirit
into two-ness.

00:01:00.056 --> 00:01:04.240 align:middle line:84%
In order to experience
polarity, I had to do that.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.740 align:middle line:90%
I experience polarity.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.040 align:middle line:90%


00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And so there were about 300--
almost 300-and-something

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.594 align:middle line:90%
people-- on this ship.

00:01:16.594 --> 00:01:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And there was three
other people that

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.760 align:middle line:84%
were-- this whole ship was
brought in here to drop myself

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:33.570 align:middle line:84%
off, another person named
Balthazar, and one more person.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And we left our Sirian bodies
in kind of a crystal-like casket

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.190 align:middle line:84%
sort of thing, which
they reuse, and went

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:54.780 align:middle line:84%
into the fourth conditional
overtone of the Earth's

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.980 align:middle line:90%
dimensional level.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.444 align:middle line:90%
That's where we came in on.

00:01:59.444 --> 00:02:04.629 align:middle line:84%
And there wasn't hardly
anybody there when we came in.

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:05.670 align:middle line:90%
This was a long time ago.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.780 align:middle line:90%


00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.940 align:middle line:90%
This was in 1819.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.230 align:middle line:84%
Went up in the higher
levels, there was life there.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.845 align:middle line:84%
There was life, but there
wasn't any real conscious life.

00:02:19.845 --> 00:02:21.970 align:middle line:84%
And so we had to keep going
up and up and up and up

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.220 align:middle line:84%
and up and up and up
and up and up and up,

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.235 align:middle line:84%
and we finally found
them all hanging out

00:02:25.235 --> 00:02:27.401 align:middle line:84%
up in the higher dimensions,
in the sixth dimension.

00:02:27.401 --> 00:02:29.970 align:middle line:90%


00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.710 align:middle line:84%
But I had divided
myself into two-ness.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.570 align:middle line:90%


00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.230 align:middle line:84%
In my memories, it felt like
it was right after we left,

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.350 align:middle line:84%
but it may have been a
little later when we actually

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.256 align:middle line:90%
did that.

00:02:42.256 --> 00:02:46.420 align:middle line:84%
But soon after, if I'd not
done it right then and went up

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.270 align:middle line:84%
and begin to try to
understand this whole thing.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.070 align:middle line:90%
So I studied.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.660 align:middle line:90%
I studied from 1819 to 1850.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And then by 1850, I
figured, OK, I'm ready.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.296 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready for this one.

00:03:02.296 --> 00:03:04.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go
down on the planet.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And I was born into
the Taos Pueblo.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.402 align:middle line:90%


00:03:11.402 --> 00:03:18.200 align:middle line:84%
The chief of the Taos
Pueblo had a dream

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.279 align:middle line:84%
that a kachina was
going to be born to him.

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:22.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
know what a kachina is,

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.580 align:middle line:84%
but it's an inter-dimensional
being, which is what I was.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:33.051 align:middle line:84%
And that was going to be a boy,
and his wife also had a dream

00:03:33.051 --> 00:03:34.800 align:middle line:84%
that they were going
to have a kachina who

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.050 align:middle line:90%
was going to be a boy.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.119 align:middle line:84%
However, there was
a medicine woman

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:41.410 align:middle line:84%
that was on the tribe, which
was going to be a midwife,

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.600 align:middle line:84%
and she had a dream that the
kachina was going to come in,

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.067 align:middle line:90%
and it was going to be a girl.

00:03:47.067 --> 00:03:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And she never said
anything to anyone,

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.160 align:middle line:84%
because it didn't conform
with what the other two had.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't quite
understand how this could be.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.650 align:middle line:84%
We were born one
evening in a tipi.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.190 align:middle line:90%


00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And the medicine
woman was there.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:06.715 align:middle line:90%
The daddy was there.

00:04:06.715 --> 00:04:07.660 align:middle line:90%
The mommy was there.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.390 align:middle line:84%
The mommy gave birth,
and it was a little boy.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And the daddy saw-- the
chief saw the little baby

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.029 align:middle line:84%
and then was all happy,
and they were happy.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:21.974 align:middle line:84%
And he went out and left
the midwife with the baby,

00:04:21.974 --> 00:04:24.190 align:middle line:90%
waiting for the placenta.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And the woman was exhausted
from all this and lay back.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.400 align:middle line:84%
When she thought what was
coming out was the placenta,

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.390 align:middle line:90%
it was another baby.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.810 align:middle line:84%
It was a little
girl, which was me.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.010 align:middle line:90%
But the little boy was also me.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.260 align:middle line:84%
But that was the
divided part of me.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.365 align:middle line:84%
And now the medicine woman
realized that we were kachinas.

00:04:52.365 --> 00:04:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And she also
realized that if they

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.470 align:middle line:84%
were told that it was
twins, that they would kill

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.440 align:middle line:84%
both of us, because
the Taos Pueblo won't

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.920 align:middle line:90%
allow twins to come out.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.990 align:middle line:84%
But she knew that we were
supposed to be there.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.080 align:middle line:84%
So what she did was
she took me and hid me

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.891 align:middle line:84%
and took me out, without
anyone knowing it.

00:05:12.891 --> 00:05:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And so the chief and the mom
knew only of birth of the boy.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.326 align:middle line:90%
They never knew about me.

00:05:22.326 --> 00:05:25.540 align:middle line:90%


00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.330 align:middle line:84%
She hid me, and a few weeks
later, she told the tribe

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.454 align:middle line:90%
that she found me.

00:05:30.454 --> 00:05:33.950 align:middle line:84%
No one thought anything of it,
because those kind of things

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.554 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:05:36.554 --> 00:05:38.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she thought it
was from another tribe,

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.436 align:middle line:84%
and there was a lot of
Pueblos running down there.

00:05:41.436 --> 00:05:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And nobody just thought anything
of it, and so she raised me.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And I was raised with the
mommy of the medicine woman.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And I was raised as a
Crystal-Fetish person

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.460 align:middle line:90%
from the Crystal-Fetish tribe.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.626 align:middle line:84%
There were 12 tribes
in the Pueblo,

00:05:56.626 --> 00:06:02.476 align:middle line:84%
and I was connected to
the Crystal-Fetish kiva.

00:06:02.476 --> 00:06:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And so all my training
was in crystals

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.530 align:middle line:84%
and fetishes and herbs,
these kinds of things.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.470 align:middle line:84%
However, when I was trained,
she told me secretly

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.640 align:middle line:84%
that I was a kachina
and that I was never,

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.140 align:middle line:84%
ever to marry or
to have children.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.000 align:middle line:90%


00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.377 align:middle line:84%
And so I lived that life and
everything went pretty good.

00:06:30.377 --> 00:06:31.460 align:middle line:90%
I learned the whole thing.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.786 align:middle line:84%
I did all kinds
of stuff for them.

00:06:33.786 --> 00:06:35.824 align:middle line:84%
And I know what
they can do, and you

00:06:35.824 --> 00:06:39.870 align:middle line:84%
would be amazed at what
the American Indians can do

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.618 align:middle line:84%
and the level that
their life is at.

00:06:42.618 --> 00:06:45.457 align:middle line:90%


00:06:45.457 --> 00:06:47.790 align:middle line:84%
What we tend to see is the
pickup trucks, the beer cans,

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.250 align:middle line:84%
and the drunk Indians, which
is what's happened recently.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.770 align:middle line:84%
But there's another layer
that's really extraordinary.

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And they have been devastated
by alcohol and these things

00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:59.382 align:middle line:90%
on habit.

00:06:59.382 --> 00:07:08.066 align:middle line:90%


00:07:08.066 --> 00:07:20.910 align:middle line:84%
When I was about maybe in
my twenties-- I don't know.

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:26.344 align:middle line:84%
I've got to think about it, I
guess-- 25 or 6 or something

00:07:26.344 --> 00:07:32.460 align:middle line:84%
like that-- one day-- I was
very innocent-- I went out

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.872 align:middle line:90%
to the forest.

00:07:34.872 --> 00:07:36.330 align:middle line:84%
I spent a lot of
time in the forest

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.276 align:middle line:84%
by myself gathering
herbs and things.

00:07:39.276 --> 00:07:43.210 align:middle line:90%


00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.720 align:middle line:84%
My brother, which nobody knew
that but the medicine woman--

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:51.782 align:middle line:84%
his name was Two
Feathers, in English.

00:07:51.782 --> 00:07:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And they gave him the
nickname of Geronimo.

00:07:54.730 --> 00:08:00.690 align:middle line:90%
And then he didn't know.

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:02.097 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know really either.

00:08:02.097 --> 00:08:05.849 align:middle line:90%


00:08:05.849 --> 00:08:07.240 align:middle line:90%
But we were very good friends.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.280 align:middle line:90%
We spent a lot of time together.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.850 align:middle line:90%
We liked each other a lot.

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:15.855 align:middle line:84%
And we had another friend that
was between us, this male.

00:08:15.855 --> 00:08:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And the three of us spent
a lot of time together.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:22.220 align:middle line:90%
It was really his close friend.

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And one day I was way out
in the woods, all by myself,

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.665 align:middle line:84%
hanging out, just picking
my things and everything,

00:08:27.665 --> 00:08:32.635 align:middle line:84%
and this guy-- this other
one-- happened along.

00:08:32.635 --> 00:08:34.840 align:middle line:84%
And we ended up sitting
on this hillside talking

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.611 align:middle line:84%
for a long time, and I
ended up doing something

00:08:37.611 --> 00:08:38.752 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't supposed to do.

00:08:38.752 --> 00:08:42.175 align:middle line:90%


00:08:42.175 --> 00:08:49.175 align:middle line:84%
And my mom said,
don't ever do that.

00:08:49.175 --> 00:08:51.600 align:middle line:90%
But I did.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And wouldn't you know, I got
pregnant on the first time,

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:05.020 align:middle line:90%


00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:08.000 align:middle line:90%
which was a problem.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And they would have
killed me, literally,

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.490 align:middle line:90%
if they had found out.

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And so we agreed-- see, I had
a lot of freedom in what I did.

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And so after two
or three months,

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:24.350 align:middle line:84%
I told them I had
to get these herbs

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:26.930 align:middle line:84%
and go way over into the
mountains a long ways away.

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:29.678 align:middle line:90%
I was going to be gone a while.

00:09:29.678 --> 00:09:31.150 align:middle line:84%
And nobody thought
anything of it.

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:33.342 align:middle line:84%
I got on my horse, and I
rose away for a long ways.

00:09:33.342 --> 00:09:36.210 align:middle line:84%
But what I really did is I
rode about 10 miles away,

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:39.910 align:middle line:84%
and I had this place that was
set up, and I stayed there.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:44.366 align:middle line:84%
And this other person came
and visited me every so often.

00:09:44.366 --> 00:09:46.870 align:middle line:84%
And I waited, and I
had the baby there.

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And when it was over, I gave it
to him, and then I came back.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And he did a similar
thing to what my mom did.

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:00.109 align:middle line:84%
He came back with
this baby, saying

00:10:00.109 --> 00:10:03.658 align:middle line:84%
that it had been given to
him from another Pueblo

00:10:03.658 --> 00:10:09.416 align:middle line:84%
and he had two wives-- I
think it was-- and he gave it

00:10:09.416 --> 00:10:10.818 align:middle line:90%
to them to take care of.

00:10:10.818 --> 00:10:12.312 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have to do it.

00:10:12.312 --> 00:10:17.300 align:middle line:90%


00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.973 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:10:18.973 --> 00:10:20.860 align:middle line:90%


00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I've
ever told this story.

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:24.720 align:middle line:90%
I don't think that I have.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.532 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:10:25.532 --> 00:10:27.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
ever gone out before.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>>Parts of it.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:29.381 align:middle line:90%
Parts of it.

00:10:29.381 --> 00:10:30.180 align:middle line:90%
>>You have.

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>>I have?

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.700 align:middle line:90%
>>In Sarasota.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.500 align:middle line:90%
>>I did?

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.700 align:middle line:90%
In Sarasota?

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.353 align:middle line:84%
That means this is the second
time it's ever been told.

00:10:37.353 --> 00:10:44.964 align:middle line:90%


00:10:44.964 --> 00:10:46.880 align:middle line:84%
Everything would have
been just great and fine

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:56.880 align:middle line:84%
and no problem, except
that Nura-- I should

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:01.670 align:middle line:84%
say his name-- who was friends
with Two Feathers-- they

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:02.840 align:middle line:90%
were really good friends.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:03.900 align:middle line:90%
And time went on.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.108 align:middle line:90%
Many years went by.

00:11:05.108 --> 00:11:07.010 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember how many.

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:12.425 align:middle line:84%
Quite a few years-- eight
years or so went by.

00:11:12.425 --> 00:11:14.252 align:middle line:90%
And it was all over with him.

00:11:14.252 --> 00:11:15.620 align:middle line:90%
It was all over with him.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:24.045 align:middle line:84%
One day, Nura tells Two Feathers
the truth, the whole story.

00:11:24.045 --> 00:11:25.670 align:middle line:84%
They're hanging out
somewhere together,

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:27.390 align:middle line:84%
and he tells him
the whole story.

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:30.531 align:middle line:84%
He figures that it's been so
long that Two Feathers wouldn't

00:11:30.531 --> 00:11:31.331 align:middle line:90%
care.

00:11:31.331 --> 00:11:33.500 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't matter
at that point.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, Two Feathers was
going to be the chief,

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:40.050 align:middle line:84%
and he was a real
popular person.

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:44.380 align:middle line:84%
He was serious about
what he was going to do,

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:47.850 align:middle line:84%
and he knew that I was never
supposed to do that either.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And from their point of view, it
was actually worse than murder,

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:59.668 align:middle line:84%
because I jeopardized the
very life of the tribe

00:11:59.668 --> 00:12:02.960 align:middle line:84%
by doing such a thing,
from their point of view.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.664 align:middle line:84%
And I made a lot of
mistakes in my first life.

00:12:05.664 --> 00:12:06.464 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you.

00:12:06.464 --> 00:12:09.860 align:middle line:84%
I screwed up left and right
on all kinds of things.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, from that one act,
the karma just kept rolling on.

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.050 align:middle line:90%
And he eventually told him.

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And when he told him, Two
Feathers just blew up,

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:25.172 align:middle line:84%
lost control of
his senses, thought

00:12:25.172 --> 00:12:26.630 align:middle line:84%
it was the worst
thing he could do.

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:28.171 align:middle line:84%
And so he sat around
and decided what

00:12:28.171 --> 00:12:30.870 align:middle line:84%
he could do to get even with
me for doing this thing.

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And he decided that what he
was going to do was go get me,

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:39.430 align:middle line:84%
make me pregnant, and
make me have a baby,

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:42.466 align:middle line:84%
make me go through what
I didn't go through.

00:12:42.466 --> 00:12:44.090 align:middle line:84%
He didn't think it
all the way through.

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:46.946 align:middle line:90%


00:12:46.946 --> 00:12:49.245 align:middle line:84%
All he thought was I was
going to have to pay for this,

00:12:49.245 --> 00:12:50.953 align:middle line:84%
and I was going to
have to do this again.

00:12:50.953 --> 00:12:53.075 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:12:53.075 --> 00:12:55.570 align:middle line:84%
>>You were the
medicine woman now?

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:57.142 align:middle line:90%
>>I was the medicine woman now.

00:12:57.142 --> 00:12:59.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I was the main person.

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And we were doing some
really very important-- very

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.790 align:middle line:90%
important-- work-- global work.

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:09.420 align:middle line:84%
>>But wasn't Two Feathers
part of you, too?

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.760 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes, it was me.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:17.270 align:middle line:84%
You've got to understand, this
is me coming back a little bit.

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:18.540 align:middle line:90%
>>I thought that too.

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:21.450 align:middle line:84%
I thought you were
parallel self couldn't

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:22.684 align:middle line:90%
meet with your parallel self.

00:13:22.684 --> 00:13:24.425 align:middle line:90%
Is that not true, then?

00:13:24.425 --> 00:13:25.225 align:middle line:90%
>>It's not true.

00:13:25.225 --> 00:13:28.710 align:middle line:90%


00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:32.330 align:middle line:90%
It's definitely not true.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:38.689 align:middle line:84%
This was a person that was a
friend between Two Feathers.

00:13:38.689 --> 00:13:40.018 align:middle line:90%
That was the name.

00:13:40.018 --> 00:13:43.930 align:middle line:90%


00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:45.875 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it can only
be done with kachinas.

00:13:45.875 --> 00:13:46.675 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:13:46.675 --> 00:13:50.430 align:middle line:84%
Maybe if you're
interdimensional, I don't know.

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:54.800 align:middle line:84%
I know for certain
that you can do this.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:14:00.086 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'm still with
this person right now.

00:14:00.086 --> 00:14:03.848 align:middle line:84%
I still have a connection with
this person, even in this life.

00:14:03.848 --> 00:14:07.242 align:middle line:90%


00:14:07.242 --> 00:14:09.450 align:middle line:84%
So what Two Feathers did is
he went out, found me out

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.530 align:middle line:84%
in the woods, and tied me
up, and beat the shit out

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:15.600 align:middle line:84%
of me, to get some of
his anger out of it,

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:20.700 align:middle line:84%
and then raped me to
try to get me pregnant,

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:23.800 align:middle line:84%
and then wanted to make
sure that it worked.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.260 align:middle line:84%
He came back several
times afterwards.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.960 align:middle line:84%
He beat me up another time,
and then third time he

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:33.506 align:middle line:84%
quit beating me up,
but he forced me.

00:14:33.506 --> 00:14:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And he did this
probably about 20 times.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:40.740 align:middle line:84%
But what happened is
each time he did it,

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:42.290 align:middle line:90%
his heart was softening.

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:45.674 align:middle line:84%
And he kept changing, because
he had never been with a woman

00:14:45.674 --> 00:14:48.559 align:middle line:90%
ever in his life.

00:14:48.559 --> 00:14:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And by the time-- it
was somewhere around--

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:51.933 align:middle line:84%
I don't know when
it was-- he ended up

00:14:51.933 --> 00:14:53.994 align:middle line:90%
falling in love with me.

00:14:53.994 --> 00:14:56.890 align:middle line:90%
And I did get pregnant.

00:14:56.890 --> 00:15:00.840 align:middle line:84%
But when the baby
started to come out

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:04.060 align:middle line:84%
and everything, by then his
whole attitude has changed.

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And now he realized
I was pregnant,

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.790 align:middle line:84%
so he rationalized the
whole thing again and said,

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:11.723 align:middle line:84%
oh well, the tribe
really loves me.

00:15:11.723 --> 00:15:13.973 align:middle line:84%
I'll just tell them, and
they'll make everything fine.

00:15:13.973 --> 00:15:17.421 align:middle line:90%


00:15:17.421 --> 00:15:19.420 align:middle line:84%
What I mean by it wasn't
thought out very well--

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:21.253 align:middle line:84%
he didn't realize he
was implicating himself

00:15:21.253 --> 00:15:23.020 align:middle line:90%
in some very deep things here.

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:25.570 align:middle line:90%


00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And so the tribe found
out I was pregnant,

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.620 align:middle line:90%
and they found out who did it.

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And nobody said a
word for a long time.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:38.090 align:middle line:84%
So we just sort of held
our breath for a long time.

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:48.702 align:middle line:84%
And the baby's born, and they
still don't say anything.

00:15:48.702 --> 00:15:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And a month went
by and two months.

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.830 align:middle line:84%
I think it was somewhere
between three months and six.

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:56.813 align:middle line:84%
I can't quite pinpoint
exactly where it was.

00:15:56.813 --> 00:16:01.110 align:middle line:84%
I was very emotional in this
whole thing about that time.

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:04.410 align:middle line:84%
But the baby was about
three to six months old,

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:09.505 align:middle line:84%
and his father comes in,
brings us into this place,

00:16:09.505 --> 00:16:14.810 align:middle line:84%
and tells us that we
had broken the laws,

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:17.820 align:middle line:84%
and that we had to
leave the Pueblo forever

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:21.030 align:middle line:90%
and could never come back again.

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:28.330 align:middle line:84%
But I had work to do, and I
had to finish my work first.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:31.400 align:middle line:90%
But Geronimo had to leave now.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And this was in the middle of
winter in December of 1848.

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And we had only 24 hours,
and in this 24 hours,

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:50.780 align:middle line:84%
he told me that he wanted
me to leave all this

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:54.180 align:middle line:84%
and come with him now
and not finish my work.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.990 align:middle line:84%
He wanted me to stop my
spiritual work, which

00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:00.440 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't do, because it
meant the whole planet would

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:04.630 align:middle line:84%
be harmed if I didn't do it,
from at least how I saw things.

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:07.314 align:middle line:84%
And so he wanted me to leave
my religious spiritual work

00:17:07.314 --> 00:17:09.920 align:middle line:84%
and come and join him and just
go out and live in the world

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.510 align:middle line:90%
by his self and be fine.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:13.770 align:middle line:84%
He picked a spot down
by the Rio Grande gorge

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:16.119 align:middle line:84%
where I was supposed
to meet him.

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:18.685 align:middle line:84%
And so he says, you be there
tomorrow, and I'll be there.

00:17:18.685 --> 00:17:21.185 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I can't do that,
because of what I've got to do.

00:17:21.185 --> 00:17:24.280 align:middle line:90%
And he says, you be there.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And then evening--
it was night they

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:32.090 align:middle line:84%
made him leave-- he got
on a horse with the baby.

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:35.470 align:middle line:84%
He took the baby wrapped
up in this blanket.

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:38.197 align:middle line:84%
And I remember at night
riding off on his horse.

00:17:38.197 --> 00:17:40.280 align:middle line:84%
I remember looking in his
eyes at the last moment.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.100 align:middle line:90%
I'll never forget that.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And he rode over the hillside,
and I never saw him again.

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And what happened-- the
moment he went out of sight,

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:53.912 align:middle line:84%
they arrested me, and put me
into one of the adobe buildings

00:17:53.912 --> 00:17:57.820 align:middle line:84%
and put a guard at the door and
kept me in there for a month,

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:00.760 align:middle line:84%
for 30 days, to make sure
that I wouldn't go get--

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:05.580 align:middle line:84%
and in the mean time, Two
Feathers went down to the gorge

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.860 align:middle line:90%
and waited for me at this place.

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.580 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't show up.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:11.944 align:middle line:84%
And then he waited
there another night.

00:18:11.944 --> 00:18:13.360 align:middle line:84%
I didn't show up
in another night.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:22.154 align:middle line:84%
And he ended up waiting nine--
it was on the ninth night,

00:18:22.154 --> 00:18:26.003 align:middle line:90%
when it was cold.

00:18:26.003 --> 00:18:26.836 align:middle line:90%
It was getting cold.

00:18:26.836 --> 00:18:27.919 align:middle line:90%
It really gets cold there.

00:18:27.919 --> 00:18:29.886 align:middle line:90%
It was like 20 below 0.

00:18:29.886 --> 00:18:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And on the ninth night,
the baby froze to death.

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And he got so depressed
over this whole thing

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:45.090 align:middle line:84%
that on the next night at the
very same time the baby had

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:48.750 align:middle line:84%
died, he laid down in the
snow and committed suicide

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:50.840 align:middle line:90%
and froze to death.

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know this
had happened at the time,

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.510 align:middle line:90%
and I kept going.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And they made me
complete the work

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:01.540 align:middle line:84%
that I was doing, which we
were building the largest

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.150 align:middle line:90%
pyramid in the world.

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:06.254 align:middle line:84%
It was a pyramid that was two
and a half miles on each side,

00:19:06.254 --> 00:19:08.670 align:middle line:84%
which still exists here today,
which is the final pyramid.

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:10.840 align:middle line:84%
It holds our grid
up right now, which

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.880 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't be in this room
right now, if it wasn't there.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:17.628 align:middle line:84%
And it was done by
several other tribes,

00:19:17.628 --> 00:19:19.836 align:middle line:84%
and it was extensive work
over a long period of time.

00:19:19.836 --> 00:19:21.906 align:middle line:90%
It was a crystal pyramid.

00:19:21.906 --> 00:19:23.180 align:middle line:90%
The crystal aligns.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:28.184 align:middle line:84%
It lined up and
held this together.

00:19:28.184 --> 00:19:33.123 align:middle line:84%
And so when I was
finished with that,

00:19:33.123 --> 00:19:34.340 align:middle line:90%
it took about two more years.

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And they brought me into
the kiva and said, OK.

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:40.460 align:middle line:84%
They said, your
work is done here.

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:43.300 align:middle line:84%
However, you're not finished,
because you're ours.

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:47.067 align:middle line:84%
They saw me as almost like
an object, like I was theirs.

00:19:47.067 --> 00:19:47.900 align:middle line:90%
You're not finished.

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.950 align:middle line:90%
You have all these things.

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:53.920 align:middle line:90%
You can't be an Indian anymore.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.440 align:middle line:84%
We want you to go
into a white body.

00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:01.166 align:middle line:84%
And we want you to
never cut your hair.

00:20:01.166 --> 00:20:02.630 align:middle line:90%
That's why my hair is long.

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:06.005 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to do with
American hippies or any

00:20:06.005 --> 00:20:06.944 align:middle line:90%
of this other stuff.

00:20:06.944 --> 00:20:08.360 align:middle line:84%
It was because of
a promise that I

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.470 align:middle line:84%
made so that they
would recognize me

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:13.024 align:middle line:90%
at a certain point.

00:20:13.024 --> 00:20:15.930 align:middle line:84%
There was certain
things that I had to do.

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And I had come back and do a
whole list of things for them.

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:21.820 align:middle line:84%
I've done all the things
for them, except for one.

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:24.200 align:middle line:84%
I have one last
thing I have to do.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.090 align:middle line:90%
But that's not until much later.

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And so my sister, Nita,
was my mother at that time.

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.290 align:middle line:90%
And Ken was my father.

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:42.260 align:middle line:90%


00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:45.292 align:middle line:84%
And they decided
to come with me.

00:20:45.292 --> 00:20:46.750 align:middle line:84%
Even though they
were the ones that

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:51.780 align:middle line:84%
told me that I had to leave,
they came with me later.

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And the tribe
understood all of this.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And it was told from one
son down to the next,

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:01.020 align:middle line:90%
like a whole pattern of a thing.

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:05.877 align:middle line:84%
That's why the chief, who
was Good Deer-- Wankoncha was

00:21:05.877 --> 00:21:08.330 align:middle line:84%
his name-- understood
the whole thing

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:11.847 align:middle line:84%
and went to my sister, Nita,
and said we know who you are.

00:21:11.847 --> 00:21:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And we want to
keep the connection

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:15.648 align:middle line:90%
and help with the thing.

00:21:15.648 --> 00:21:17.636 align:middle line:84%
And they've done
all the ceremonies

00:21:17.636 --> 00:21:21.510 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that I'm
allowed to wake up and help.

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:22.950 align:middle line:90%
And in fact, it was the--

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:24.450 align:middle line:84%
>>Hi, you don't
know me, but you do.

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:31.470 align:middle line:90%


00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:33.196 align:middle line:84%
And then Joann
brought her out here.

00:21:33.196 --> 00:21:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And here's this real beautiful
super-long, red-haired girl.

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:43.040 align:middle line:90%
And we knew.

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.840 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the way we
knew for certain was I

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:46.995 align:middle line:90%
knew the story of my life.

00:21:46.995 --> 00:21:49.562 align:middle line:90%
And she knew the story her life.

00:21:49.562 --> 00:21:52.890 align:middle line:84%
The first thing I knew really
beyond any doubt whatsoever,

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:54.490 align:middle line:90%
because no one knew my name.

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:56.511 align:middle line:84%
Nobody in the world
knew my name but me.

00:21:56.511 --> 00:22:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And she walked in, and she
goes, Gianni, which was my name.

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:04.702 align:middle line:90%
And instantly I knew.

00:22:04.702 --> 00:22:05.660 align:middle line:90%
There wasn't any doubt.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.223 align:middle line:84%
But beyond that, I still
wanted to check further.

00:22:08.223 --> 00:22:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And so she said the
first year of our life.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.010 align:middle line:90%
I said the second year.

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:14.796 align:middle line:84%
Then she told the story
of the third year.

00:22:14.796 --> 00:22:15.700 align:middle line:90%
I told the fourth.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And she told the fifth
all the way through

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:21.095 align:middle line:84%
to verify absolutely
that this was true

00:22:21.095 --> 00:22:22.177 align:middle line:90%
that we knew each other.

00:22:22.177 --> 00:22:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And then as soon as we got
done telling the whole,

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:25.518 align:middle line:84%
and we realized definitely
beyond any doubt

00:22:25.518 --> 00:22:28.010 align:middle line:84%
whatsoever who we were, she
looked at me, and she goes,

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:28.810 align:middle line:90%
you!

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:33.220 align:middle line:90%


00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:36.650 align:middle line:90%
You left me out there.

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:38.090 align:middle line:90%
I mean, she was pissed.

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:39.470 align:middle line:90%
I mean really pissed.

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:41.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she does her
whole first [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:43.320 align:middle line:90%
and she got so mad at me.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And I had to explain to
her that I was arrested,

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.900 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't have any
choice in this whole matter,

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:50.970 align:middle line:90%
because she didn't know that.

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And we went through
a lot of things.

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:54.750 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you, man.

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:56.396 align:middle line:90%
And we still are.

00:22:56.396 --> 00:23:00.320 align:middle line:84%
We're still going
through a lot of things.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.840 align:middle line:84%
It has not been an easy
road for either one of us.

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:09.680 align:middle line:90%
And she's a real hot red head.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.111 align:middle line:90%
>>She's your other aspect.

00:23:11.111 --> 00:23:11.911 align:middle line:90%
She's you.

00:23:11.911 --> 00:23:13.752 align:middle line:90%
>>She is me on another level.

00:23:13.752 --> 00:23:14.590 align:middle line:90%
>>That's incredible.

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:16.684 align:middle line:84%
>>And we got married
and had two babies.

00:23:16.684 --> 00:23:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And these two babies
were the two babies

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:21.590 align:middle line:84%
that I had brought
through before.

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:23.860 align:middle line:84%
I brought the same
ones back through.

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:29.870 align:middle line:84%
Marley was the one that died
24 hours before-- died exactly

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:31.920 align:middle line:90%
24 hours before.

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.710 align:middle line:84%
Mackie was born
February 4th at 7:28.

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:43.660 align:middle line:84%
28 Marley was born February
3rd at 7:28, exactly 24

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:49.230 align:middle line:84%
hours before Mackie, right
to the minute-- right

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:51.608 align:middle line:90%
to the minute.

00:23:51.608 --> 00:23:55.052 align:middle line:84%
>>Drunvalo, what about
your son supposedly

00:23:55.052 --> 00:23:57.512 align:middle line:90%
is supposed to be Merlin?

00:23:57.512 --> 00:24:00.690 align:middle line:90%
>>No, he's not Merlin.

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:01.617 align:middle line:90%
Merlin worked.

00:24:01.617 --> 00:24:02.742 align:middle line:90%
That's another whole thing.

00:24:02.742 --> 00:24:04.102 align:middle line:90%
>>I know it's another story.

00:24:04.102 --> 00:24:06.350 align:middle line:90%
It's a good one though.

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:08.520 align:middle line:84%
>>When I walked into
the body, the body

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.830 align:middle line:90%
happened to be married.

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And so my wife never
knew that I walked in,

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:16.862 align:middle line:84%
even know my name, Drunvalo
Melchizedek, came to my wife,

00:24:16.862 --> 00:24:18.470 align:middle line:90%
not to me.

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:21.540 align:middle line:84%
The angel said, your
husband's name is this.

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:24.910 align:middle line:90%
And we wrote it down.

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't know
what that meant.

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:29.730 align:middle line:84%
She didn't know that
really who I was was

00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:31.030 align:middle line:90%
not who she actually married.

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:38.600 align:middle line:90%


00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Right prior to that time,
before I walked into the body,

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:48.240 align:middle line:84%
the angels came in and
had asked that the baby be

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:55.520 align:middle line:84%
born to that family, which ended
up in my control for a while.

00:24:55.520 --> 00:25:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And they said that if we had
this inter-dimensional being,

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:04.047 align:middle line:84%
that it would be born
precisely on our wedding

00:25:04.047 --> 00:25:05.130 align:middle line:90%
night when we got married.

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:07.671 align:middle line:84%
We had to get married, and we'd
have it on our wedding night.

00:25:07.671 --> 00:25:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And so when they got married,
when the doctors counted back,

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:11.800 align:middle line:84%
it was exactly to
the wedding night.

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:15.520 align:middle line:84%
They said it would be a
male and all various things.

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:20.370 align:middle line:84%
They gave a secret name-- I
can't say right now, I guess,

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:23.050 align:middle line:84%
what his real name was--
where he came from,

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:25.526 align:middle line:84%
which was the center
of the central sun,

00:25:25.526 --> 00:25:27.240 align:middle line:84%
and that he'd never
been here before,

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.980 align:middle line:84%
and he would bring
in this pyramid

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:30.251 align:middle line:90%
of inter-dimensional beams.

00:25:30.251 --> 00:25:33.690 align:middle line:90%


00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:38.690 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as he was about
to be born, or somewhere

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:43.220 align:middle line:84%
in his birth, the angels
came and told my wife

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:49.262 align:middle line:84%
that Zachary, who is what
we ended up naming him,

00:25:49.262 --> 00:25:50.410 align:middle line:90%
didn't come from her.

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:52.994 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't her baby.

00:25:52.994 --> 00:25:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, what do
you mean, this is not my baby?

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:56.900 align:middle line:90%
It's in her tummy, right?

00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And he says, no, it
came from another woman,

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:05.060 align:middle line:84%
came in on her fertility
cycle of another woman,

00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:08.530 align:middle line:84%
and that this other woman's
name was [INAUDIBLE] Pindara

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:11.970 align:middle line:90%
and that she was in India.

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:15.120 align:middle line:90%


00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And so at one point, the
angel said, would you

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:25.770 align:middle line:84%
like to meet this
woman-- asked both of us

00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:27.326 align:middle line:84%
if we would like
to meet this woman.

00:26:27.326 --> 00:26:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we said,
of course we would.

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:33.814 align:middle line:84%
And again, we were
out in the middle

00:26:33.814 --> 00:26:35.980 align:middle line:84%
of that woods in that house
out in the middle there.

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:40.180 align:middle line:84%
This is right before
I walked in, actually.

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:43.940 align:middle line:84%
I've got all the memories of him
and me, both of them, in there.

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And I had a friend
who came over.

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:52.350 align:middle line:84%
His name was Jim Ulmer,
and he was a banjo player.

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:54.500 align:middle line:84%
I used to be into music
a lot in the old days.

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:57.000 align:middle line:84%
I played a lot of
different things.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.810 align:middle line:90%


00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:04.300 align:middle line:84%
I used to play the
silver flute or banjo,

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:07.040 align:middle line:90%
if you can figure that one out.

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:07.870 align:middle line:90%
It was really good.

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:13.380 align:middle line:90%


00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:17.340 align:middle line:84%
One night they said that she
would be coming in very soon.

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:20.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, this one night
she came into my wife.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.560 align:middle line:90%
I actually fell asleep.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And while I was asleep,
my wife was woken up.

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:29.980 align:middle line:84%
Angels woke her up and said
that Bupi was coming in.

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:34.730 align:middle line:90%


00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:37.000 align:middle line:84%
The first night was
only by her experience.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.640 align:middle line:84%
I had the direct experience
myself a few nights later.

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:43.110 align:middle line:84%
The first night what happened
is the weirdest thing.

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:46.240 align:middle line:84%
It's like the reality
opens up, and there's

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:49.880 align:middle line:84%
like an oval with
some shimmering gold

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.550 align:middle line:90%
around the oval.

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:54.749 align:middle line:84%
And you look through into where
the other person's standing.

00:27:54.749 --> 00:27:56.540 align:middle line:84%
So you see the rest of
the world like this,

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:58.410 align:middle line:84%
and all of the sudden,
there's like a window

00:27:58.410 --> 00:27:59.493 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the room.

00:27:59.493 --> 00:28:02.300 align:middle line:84%
You look through into where
this other woman was standing.

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:03.980 align:middle line:84%
So there was a woman
standing there.

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:06.440 align:middle line:84%
She was dressed in a
white sari with a red dot

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.780 align:middle line:84%
and a little bit of
gold on the fringe.

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:11.000 align:middle line:90%
And she was Hindu.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.726 align:middle line:84%
And you could see people
walk by in the background.

00:28:15.726 --> 00:28:17.715 align:middle line:84%
It was like, this
was the weirdest--

00:28:17.715 --> 00:28:20.615 align:middle line:84%
this was the best
communication I

00:28:20.615 --> 00:28:23.190 align:middle line:90%
had seen in this kind of level.

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And so she came in to my wife
and told her this whole story--

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.566 align:middle line:90%
this long, long story.

00:28:32.566 --> 00:28:33.830 align:middle line:90%
Am I going too long here?

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:34.630 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:36.182 align:middle line:90%
>>Who cares?

00:28:36.182 --> 00:28:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>>Go ahead, stop
if you're tired.

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm going to tell just
this one last story,

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:43.416 align:middle line:84%
and then we're going to
close, because I think

00:28:43.416 --> 00:28:46.350 align:middle line:84%
this has gone a long time,
because I've got to pack up,

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:49.320 align:middle line:84%
and I'm supposed to be
out of here by midnight.

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.428 align:middle line:90%
It's almost 11 o'clock.

00:28:50.428 --> 00:29:05.700 align:middle line:90%


00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.980 align:middle line:90%
>>Where was I?

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:09.630 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:13.950 align:middle line:90%


00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:16.160 align:middle line:84%
It was a thing between
my wife and her,

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:21.670 align:middle line:84%
and Bupi said she would tell
her the story of how it came in.

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And according to Bupi,
an angel came to her

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:26.510 align:middle line:84%
and told her that
she was going to have

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:30.520 align:middle line:84%
this being, like the other
angels told us the same thing.

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:34.230 align:middle line:84%
Told her that it was
going to be a girl.

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:39.660 align:middle line:90%


00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:40.910 align:middle line:90%
Other than that, I'm not sure.

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:42.510 align:middle line:84%
But it was immaculate
conception.

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:48.029 align:middle line:84%
She wasn't married,
had no husband.

00:29:48.029 --> 00:29:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough,
she became pregnant.

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:50.944 align:middle line:84%
And when she became
pregnant, she

00:29:50.944 --> 00:29:56.850 align:middle line:84%
was told to go to Tibet
to a monastery there,

00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:58.810 align:middle line:84%
and the monastery
would take care of her.

00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:01.009 align:middle line:84%
She went to Tibet,
and the monastery

00:30:01.009 --> 00:30:02.550 align:middle line:84%
knew that she was
coming, let her in,

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:05.340 align:middle line:84%
and took care of her all the
way through her pregnancy.

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:17.740 align:middle line:84%
When the baby was
born, the monastery

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:20.010 align:middle line:84%
thought the baby was
going to be a boy.

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:22.330 align:middle line:90%
That was their belief pattern.

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:24.070 align:middle line:90%
But the baby was a girl.

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And when the when the
Tibetan monks saw this,

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:32.160 align:middle line:84%
they took a knife 10 minutes
after the baby was born and put

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.206 align:middle line:90%
it through the baby's heart.

00:30:34.206 --> 00:30:39.880 align:middle line:84%
This was actually part of
the plan, according to Bupi.

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.920 align:middle line:84%
The baby is coming
in for the first time

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:45.500 align:middle line:84%
and wanted only to
see what femaleness

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:49.585 align:middle line:84%
was-- 10 minutes
was enough-- and had

00:30:49.585 --> 00:30:52.100 align:middle line:84%
to go over to the other side
and do what it had to do.

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:56.606 align:middle line:90%


00:30:56.606 --> 00:30:58.070 align:middle line:90%
Seems kind of weird.

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:03.450 align:middle line:90%


00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:05.145 align:middle line:84%
And then the baby
came in through us.

00:31:05.145 --> 00:31:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And so when Zachary was born,
this woman sat up in the top.

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:16.140 align:middle line:84%
Wherever that baby was, there
was this folded back reality

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:17.990 align:middle line:84%
up there with her looking
down at this baby.

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:21.750 align:middle line:84%
She watched over
this baby for a year.

00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:23.780 align:middle line:90%
I mean like a hawk.

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:27.180 align:middle line:84%
If anybody would have came in
that room and thought of doing

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:30.020 align:middle line:84%
something to that baby, I don't
know what she would have done.

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:35.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she was not going to let
anything happen to this baby.

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:37.935 align:middle line:84%
But I noticed that every time
I'd come in there, every once

00:31:37.935 --> 00:31:40.420 align:middle line:84%
in a while, I'd looked
up there, and it would

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:42.280 align:middle line:90%
be a different background.

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:46.130 align:middle line:84%
It would be a different house
or something where she was in.

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:48.160 align:middle line:84%
There was several
times it changed.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And I said, hey,
what's going on?

00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:52.372 align:middle line:90%
You seem to be moving a lot.

00:31:52.372 --> 00:31:54.705 align:middle line:84%
Actually I would sit in there
sometimes and sort of talk

00:31:54.705 --> 00:31:56.510 align:middle line:90%
to her like we're talking now.

00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And she'd say,
well, the Tibetans

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:02.514 align:middle line:84%
that killed the baby have
decided that I should die too.

00:32:02.514 --> 00:32:03.680 align:middle line:90%
So they're trying to get me.

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:07.158 align:middle line:90%


00:32:07.158 --> 00:32:11.067 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought about
that for a while.

00:32:11.067 --> 00:32:13.650 align:middle line:84%
After thinking about this for a
long time, I came back to her,

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:17.000 align:middle line:84%
and I said, how about if I
just send you a plane ticket,

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.060 align:middle line:84%
and you get on a plane and
fly out here to Canada,

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:21.560 align:middle line:84%
and they'll never
find you out here?

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:23.101 align:middle line:84%
I'll pay for your
way and everything.

00:32:23.101 --> 00:32:26.510 align:middle line:84%
I'll take care of you when you
get here and the whole thing.

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, well,
let me think about.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:33.657 align:middle line:84%
She goes, maybe it would be a
good idea for me to leave here.

00:32:33.657 --> 00:32:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And so a few days
later, she talks to me.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And she wanted to talk to me
when I walked in the room.

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:45.044 align:middle line:84%
She said, I thought of something
I would really like to do.

00:32:45.044 --> 00:32:47.585 align:middle line:84%
This is how I would like to do
it, if you will agree with it.

00:32:47.585 --> 00:32:50.140 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK, what's that?

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, here's
what I'd like you to do.

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:56.486 align:middle line:84%
Remember my alchemist
teacher, Will Chipman?

00:32:56.486 --> 00:32:58.280 align:middle line:90%
The guy who was doing this?

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:05.250 align:middle line:84%
She says, I would like you to
go to Will and tell him this.

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:08.940 align:middle line:84%
Tell him that in
exactly two weeks,

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:13.010 align:middle line:84%
he's going to have an
experience that will link him

00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:15.690 align:middle line:84%
tightly with the woman that
he's now with-- he just

00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:17.020 align:middle line:90%
had a girlfriend.

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:20.070 align:middle line:84%
He just had this
girlfriend-- and that they

00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:23.910 align:middle line:84%
are going to have an experience
where they will decide in two

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:26.640 align:middle line:84%
weeks that they're going
to want to be married

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:32.690 align:middle line:84%
and that in exactly 30 days
from the day I tell them,

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:36.920 align:middle line:84%
she's going to conceive a baby,
and the baby will grow up,

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:39.670 align:middle line:84%
and it will come out
a male, and that they

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:41.224 align:middle line:90%
will call this baby Merlin.

00:33:41.224 --> 00:33:46.680 align:middle line:90%


00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And when the baby
comes out, she says,

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:53.706 align:middle line:84%
you will hold me in
your arms-- meaning her.

00:33:53.706 --> 00:33:56.480 align:middle line:84%
You will hold me in your
arms and look into my eyes,

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:58.232 align:middle line:90%
and you will know who I am.

00:33:58.232 --> 00:34:01.650 align:middle line:84%
But you will never see me
again until you are much older.

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:05.790 align:middle line:90%


00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:10.491 align:middle line:84%
And I am then going to connect
with Zachary, this other baby,

00:34:10.491 --> 00:34:11.949 align:middle line:84%
and we are going
to become friends.

00:34:11.949 --> 00:34:14.363 align:middle line:84%
And we will meet you later,
when you're much older.

00:34:14.363 --> 00:34:17.158 align:middle line:90%


00:34:17.158 --> 00:34:18.199 align:middle line:90%
That was a long time ago.

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:21.920 align:middle line:90%
It was over 20 years.

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:26.965 align:middle line:84%
And so I felt real funny
about going to do this,

00:34:26.965 --> 00:34:30.330 align:middle line:84%
to tell this person this
thing, especially since they

00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:32.830 align:middle line:84%
were just boyfriend
girlfriend and had not even

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:35.670 align:middle line:84%
talked about marriage,
let alone babies.

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:36.470 align:middle line:90%
But I did it.

00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:42.572 align:middle line:84%
I sat them both down, and
I said, well, in two weeks,

00:34:42.572 --> 00:34:44.030 align:middle line:84%
you're going to

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:48.334 align:middle line:84%
And I just laid the whole thing
out, told them the whole thing.

00:34:48.334 --> 00:34:49.590 align:middle line:90%
And Will just looked at me.

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:53.330 align:middle line:90%
He says, nah.

00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:55.338 align:middle line:84%
We're going to-- nah,
never going to happen.

00:34:55.338 --> 00:34:58.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't know what
happened, but in two weeks,

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:02.390 align:middle line:84%
they did have this
experience, whatever it was,

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:04.210 align:middle line:90%
which blew their minds.

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And they decided to get
married, just like I said.

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And in exactly 30 days from
the day that I told them,

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:12.120 align:middle line:90%
she conceived a baby.

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:14.285 align:middle line:84%
And the baby was born,
and it was a male.

00:35:14.285 --> 00:35:15.857 align:middle line:90%
And it was too much.

00:35:15.857 --> 00:35:17.570 align:middle line:90%
And they named him Merlin.

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:23.180 align:middle line:90%


00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:26.700 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know who
Merlin was at that time.

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:29.080 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know about
the legends of Arthur

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:32.000 align:middle line:84%
and all these other
things like that.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until
much later that I

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:38.850 align:middle line:84%
was made to understand
who this person was.

00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And from what I understand now
is that what Merlin does is

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:43.504 align:middle line:90%
he oscillates.

00:35:43.504 --> 00:35:48.267 align:middle line:84%
A lot of peoples stay
one sex for a long time.

00:35:48.267 --> 00:35:50.100 align:middle line:84%
In reincarnation they
switch to another one.

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:53.170 align:middle line:84%
He goes every other
time back and forth

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:56.330 align:middle line:84%
in a wave to keep
perfect balance.

00:35:56.330 --> 00:35:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And the last time,
he was a female,

00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:01.505 align:middle line:90%
and so this time, he's male.

00:36:01.505 --> 00:36:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And he's doing the same thing
that he did with King Arthur.

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:07.680 align:middle line:84%
He's got this other
baby that he's

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:10.550 align:middle line:84%
trying to get up
there to do something,

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:11.620 align:middle line:90%
whatever the heck it is.

00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:15.016 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:36:15.016 --> 00:36:18.400 align:middle line:84%
And so when Thoth left
here a couple years ago,

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.870 align:middle line:84%
and he took the Merkaba and
went over the other edge,

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:25.310 align:middle line:84%
he told me, your next teacher
is going to be Merlin again.

00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:28.784 align:middle line:84%
But you won't meet Merlin
until you get to England.

00:36:28.784 --> 00:36:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why
I've been trying

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:33.014 align:middle line:84%
to get to England, to get
over there for a long time.

00:36:33.014 --> 00:36:36.666 align:middle line:84%
And maybe I won't meet
Merlin when I go to England.

00:36:36.666 --> 00:36:38.624 align:middle line:84%
You've got to move these
things with absolutely

00:36:38.624 --> 00:36:39.424 align:middle line:90%
no expectations.

00:36:39.424 --> 00:36:41.044 align:middle line:90%

At one point, when
he was 10 years old,

00:36:49.272 --> 00:36:55.200 align:middle line:84%
I gave the mother a whole lot
of money-- a lot of money.

00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:00.623 align:middle line:84%

left and went to Mexico.

the angels to leave it

00:37:10.746 --> 00:37:14.260 align:middle line:84%
that way for right now, though
it's really hard for me,

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:17.348 align:middle line:84%
because I was very
close to these children.

this is really real for you

and that it is
worthwhile to teach

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:14.261 align:middle line:84%
and that it's something
that you want to teach.

00:38:14.261 --> 00:38:18.584 align:middle line:84%
And so you've got to find
out if it's something

that you ought to do.

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:23.700 align:middle line:90%

done it for a while,

then you should maybe
think about doing that.

to do with that at all.

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:57.127 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be through
other people-- very little
