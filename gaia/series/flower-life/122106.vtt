00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>>This story-- I'm
telling a story

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.940 align:middle line:84%
because when we were talking
about the cities or the powers,

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.510 align:middle line:84%
you have to be able to prove
to yourself that it's real.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.370 align:middle line:84%
The TM people want you to
lift off the ground, OK?

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:32.977 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of
things you can do,

00:00:32.977 --> 00:00:34.476 align:middle line:84%
but one way or
another, you're going

00:00:34.476 --> 00:00:39.210 align:middle line:84%
to have to prove to yourself
that your mind and the reality

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.980 align:middle line:90%
are interlaced.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.210 align:middle line:84%
For Jesus, he had to
turn water into wine.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.735 align:middle line:90%
He had to do it.

00:00:44.735 --> 00:00:47.965 align:middle line:90%
He had to do something.

00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:51.122 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I was first
trying to do this, because they

00:00:51.122 --> 00:00:52.330 align:middle line:90%
told me I had to try to work.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.630 align:middle line:84%
This was before I ever
went in here or anything.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.904 align:middle line:84%
And I decided I wanted to
manifest an orange in my hand.

00:00:58.904 --> 00:01:00.320 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why
it was an orange,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.782 align:middle line:90%
but that's what I wanted to do.

00:01:01.782 --> 00:01:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And I used to sit
around for hours going,

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.230 align:middle line:90%
there's an orange in my hand.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.030 align:middle line:90%
There's an orange.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.280 align:middle line:90%
I know there is.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.580 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.021 align:middle line:84%
And there was one
time-- this is so funny.

00:01:10.021 --> 00:01:12.520 align:middle line:84%
There was one time when I was
sitting in a circle of people,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.478 align:middle line:90%
and we were meditating.

00:01:13.478 --> 00:01:14.717 align:middle line:90%
It was about 12 people.

00:01:14.717 --> 00:01:15.675 align:middle line:90%
And we were meditating.

00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:17.877 align:middle line:84%
We'd been meditating
for maybe about an hour.

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:19.957 align:middle line:84%
And then we came out
of the meditation.

00:01:19.957 --> 00:01:22.040 align:middle line:84%
For about the last half
hour while I was in there,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.450 align:middle line:84%
I had my hands like this, going,
there's an orange in my hand.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.890 align:middle line:90%
There's an orange in my hand.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't make
anything happen.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.017 align:middle line:84%
And we came out
of the meditation,

00:01:30.017 --> 00:01:31.850 align:middle line:84%
and I was still just
sitting here like this,

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:32.808 align:middle line:90%
sitting here like this.

00:01:32.808 --> 00:01:35.142 align:middle line:84%
And this persona came
in from the other room

00:01:35.142 --> 00:01:36.350 align:middle line:90%
and put an orange in my hand.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.316 align:middle line:90%
So there was an orange.

00:01:37.316 --> 00:01:38.931 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:39.731 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:01:39.731 --> 00:01:40.697 align:middle line:90%
Close.

00:01:40.697 --> 00:01:45.044 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:45.044 --> 00:01:47.960 align:middle line:90%


00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.640 align:middle line:90%
But that is kind of how it is.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.220 align:middle line:84%
You see, it starts out where
we don't think that there's

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.040 align:middle line:90%
any connection at all.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And then the second level
that begins to happen

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.435 align:middle line:84%
is coincidence, which
is that would fall

00:02:01.435 --> 00:02:03.950 align:middle line:90%
under the coincidence level.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.700 align:middle line:84%
Like you're thinking,
gee, I'd really

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.360 align:middle line:84%
like to have a certain bottle
of wine or something like that.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And then somebody walks
in with the very year

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:10.770 align:middle line:90%
you're thinking of.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.140 align:middle line:84%
These kinds of things are--
you're thinking of somebody,

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.990 align:middle line:90%
and they walk through the door.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.560 align:middle line:84%
Only when the coincidence
level really starts happening,

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.080 align:middle line:90%
it starts happening a lot.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.585 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure many of you have
probably experienced this.

00:02:22.585 --> 00:02:25.220 align:middle line:84%
It just sort of starts
happening all the time.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.030 align:middle line:84%
Because that's a
level of manifestation

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.952 align:middle line:90%
that you can accept.

00:02:30.952 --> 00:02:32.910 align:middle line:84%
Because it all has to
with your belief patterns

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.150 align:middle line:84%
and what you can accept
and what you can't accept.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And later, the ones that
we're talking about now

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.950 align:middle line:84%
is where you go directly
into it, where you directly

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.690 align:middle line:84%
manifest the orange
or you don't go

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.100 align:middle line:90%
have the wine bottle come in.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.170 align:middle line:84%
You take water and turn to
wine or molecular construction

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.330 align:middle line:90%
transformation or whatever.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.630 align:middle line:84%
There are higher levels
than that of understanding.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.960 align:middle line:84%
But the level of turning
water into wine, for example,

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.000 align:middle line:84%
is a lower level than
turning nothing into wine.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.710 align:middle line:90%


00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.860 align:middle line:84%
Turning one molecule
into another

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.910 align:middle line:84%
is easier to do than to
have something appear out

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.800 align:middle line:90%
of nowhere.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.375 align:middle line:84%
But it's still all
interrelated phenomena.

00:03:26.375 --> 00:03:30.910 align:middle line:90%


00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.737 align:middle line:84%
And so this was my
experience, and you

00:03:35.737 --> 00:03:37.504 align:middle line:90%
can take it for what you want.

00:03:37.504 --> 00:03:40.015 align:middle line:90%


00:03:40.015 --> 00:03:44.400 align:middle line:84%
It began-- remember
the little guy

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.215 align:middle line:84%
that my alchemist teacher
turned in this guy Thoth?

00:03:48.215 --> 00:03:52.542 align:middle line:84%
Many, many years before, I
talked about [? Willis ? ]

00:03:52.542 --> 00:03:55.010 align:middle line:84%
Chipman-- he turned into
the alchemist teacher.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Didn't I say that in
the beginning part?

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.520 align:middle line:90%
Well, many years went by.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.700 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see him.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And after a while,
I kind of forgot.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.810 align:middle line:84%
But I've never
forgotten his eyes.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And I just sort
of remembered him

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.160 align:middle line:84%
but didn't think about
him very much anymore.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.216 align:middle line:84%
Many years went by,
one, two, five, ten.

00:04:15.216 --> 00:04:18.060 align:middle line:90%
Finally 12 years went by.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.279 align:middle line:84%
And one day, the angels
came in, and they

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:25.922 align:middle line:84%
said that I needed to
read the Emerald Tablets.

00:04:25.922 --> 00:04:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And I never heard of the
Emerald Tablets before.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.210 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know what
they were talking about.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, well,
what's the Emerald Tablets?

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And they just looked at me and
they said, you'll find out.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.050 align:middle line:90%
And they left.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And so I went out to try
to buy the Emerald Tablets.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And I went into bookstores
and all these kinds of things

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.560 align:middle line:84%
everywhere, and nobody knew
what I was talking about.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:05:04.898 align:middle line:84%
This was back in
October of 1984.

00:05:04.898 --> 00:05:11.799 align:middle line:84%
And so I exhausted
all my possibilities

00:05:11.799 --> 00:05:13.090 align:middle line:90%
of trying to find these things.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.710 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't find them.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And so I just figured, well,
I'll just leave it up to God.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.103 align:middle line:84%
If I'm supposed to read
the Emerald Tablets,

00:05:18.103 --> 00:05:20.170 align:middle line:84%
they'll fall out of
the sky or something.

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And about two weeks
after they told me that,

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.430 align:middle line:84%
I was at the El Prado
post office in New Mexico,

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.090 align:middle line:90%
and I just had gotten my mail.

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And I went outside,
and there was

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.700 align:middle line:84%
a friend I hadn't seen
there for about a year

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.890 align:middle line:90%
or so or maybe longer.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.420 align:middle line:84%
I drove up in this
car, and she said hi.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.860 align:middle line:84%
I said hi, and I went over
to her to talk to her,

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.310 align:middle line:84%
and we're just talking
because I hadn't seen her

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.810 align:middle line:90%
for about a year.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And in the course
of conversations--

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.150 align:middle line:84%
she's still sitting in her car
and I was standing outside--

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.441 align:middle line:84%
she sort of reaches over
and grabs this little book

00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:02.274 align:middle line:84%
and hands it to me,
says, hey, have you ever

00:06:02.274 --> 00:06:03.320 align:middle line:90%
read these things?

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.120 align:middle line:90%
I look at it.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.696 align:middle line:90%
It says, "The Emerald Tablets."

00:06:05.696 --> 00:06:07.190 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.180 align:middle line:90%
And I said, ah!

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.560 align:middle line:90%
So she loaned it to me.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.530 align:middle line:90%
And I went home.

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing, I
started reading these tablets.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:28.295 align:middle line:84%
And they had a very
powerful effect on me

00:06:28.295 --> 00:06:29.095 align:middle line:90%
almost immediately.

00:06:29.095 --> 00:06:31.890 align:middle line:90%


00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And somewhere in there--
I can't remember.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:38.190 align:middle line:84%
It was about the
fourth tablet, I think.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:43.850 align:middle line:84%
It says in there that it was
written by Thoth the Atlantean.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And I really didn't
know who Thoth was.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.150 align:middle line:84%
I had read a fair
amount about Egypt,

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:56.370 align:middle line:84%
but I had not tuned in
to this person before.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.040 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really know who it was
when I was reading the books.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, it says if
you want to contact me,

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.400 align:middle line:90%
here's how you do it.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.835 align:middle line:84%
And it just says to repeat
his name three times,

00:07:08.835 --> 00:07:09.710 align:middle line:90%
which is [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.430 align:middle line:90%


00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And so I sat down in
meditation and decided

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:20.500 align:middle line:84%
it was OK because the
angels told me to do this.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.460 align:middle line:84%
So I assumed I had permission
to do these kind of things.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:31.055 align:middle line:84%
And so I sat down, and even
though it didn't say it,

00:07:31.055 --> 00:07:31.930 align:middle line:90%
I knew what it meant.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And so I got into
very deep meditation,

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:40.240 align:middle line:84%
and I sat for a long time
until I felt very, very still.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And then I had my eyes closed,
and I repeated his name out

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:53.486 align:middle line:90%
into the ethers and then waited.

00:07:53.486 --> 00:07:54.878 align:middle line:90%
And nothing happened.

00:07:54.878 --> 00:07:57.670 align:middle line:90%


00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:59.105 align:middle line:90%
I waited for a long time.

00:07:59.105 --> 00:08:03.110 align:middle line:84%
It was maybe 10 minutes
or 15 minutes or so,

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:05.280 align:middle line:90%
and absolutely nothing happened.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.552 align:middle line:84%
And so I opened my
eyes, because I was just

00:08:07.552 --> 00:08:09.260 align:middle line:84%
going to come back
out of the meditation,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.540 align:middle line:84%
get up, and go do
something else.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.340 align:middle line:84%
But when I opened my eyes,
there was a very definite object

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:19.060 align:middle line:84%
in front of me, the
likes of which I did not

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.920 align:middle line:84%
know what it was because
I had never seen anything

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.243 align:middle line:90%
quite like this before.

00:08:23.243 --> 00:08:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't fit into anything
I'd ever read or anything.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:31.664 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of hovering
off the-- or barely.

00:08:31.664 --> 00:08:33.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it was
hovering off the ground

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.330 align:middle line:84%
or if it was resting
on the ground or not.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:40.159 align:middle line:84%
But it was a very big
egg-shaped golden field.

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:48.140 align:middle line:84%
It was maybe this wide and
maybe four feet or so high.

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And it looked very much
or exactly like an egg

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:54.460 align:middle line:84%
except that it was kind
of a shimmering gold,

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.360 align:middle line:90%
translucent light.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.840 align:middle line:90%
And it was very powerful.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.804 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could
see through it.

00:08:59.804 --> 00:09:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And it would be pretty
hard to miss it.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And it was about three or
four feet in front of me.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm just sitting
there cross-legged.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just sitting here
looking at this thing,

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.910 align:middle line:84%
completely forgetting that
I had tried to get this guy

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:18.950 align:middle line:90%
Thoth to come out.

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:20.217 align:middle line:90%
Totally forgot about that.

00:09:20.217 --> 00:09:22.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm just sitting there
going, this is weird.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:24.372 align:middle line:90%
What is this thing?

00:09:24.372 --> 00:09:26.455 align:middle line:84%
Just totally in another
world thinking about this.

00:09:26.455 --> 00:09:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting
here looking at it,

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:30.531 align:middle line:84%
and I've looked at it for about
three or four minutes, trying

00:09:30.531 --> 00:09:32.820 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what it was
when suddenly something

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.592 align:middle line:84%
happened where my back
went really straight.

00:09:35.592 --> 00:09:36.550 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I didn't do it.

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:38.383 align:middle line:84%
My back just went
straight on its own, which

00:09:38.383 --> 00:09:40.220 align:middle line:90%
was kind of a funny feeling.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.616 align:middle line:84%
And my arms went up
in the air like this,

00:09:43.616 --> 00:09:45.270 align:middle line:90%
and I started going like this.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:49.920 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.780 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't doing this.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:53.410 align:middle line:90%
And I was going, this is weird.

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:57.970 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:03.800 align:middle line:84%
But my when my head would go
from 180 degrees, after a while

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.346 align:middle line:84%
I'd try to get a quick look in
at this egg, because I knew it

00:10:06.346 --> 00:10:08.670 align:middle line:90%
had something to do with this.

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And when my head
would go this way

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.500 align:middle line:84%
where I could see
it for a moment,

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:17.430 align:middle line:84%
the egg started getting
more and more transparent.

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And there was somebody in
there doing the same thing

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:23.822 align:middle line:84%
that I was doing, only
when I would look that way,

00:10:23.822 --> 00:10:26.280 align:middle line:84%
this person would look that
way, and then our heads would--

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.640 align:middle line:90%
shoo-- look like this.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.876 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what was going on,

00:10:31.876 --> 00:10:34.250 align:middle line:84%
but I was just going to go
along with this thing whatever

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:36.460 align:middle line:84%
it was because no one
else was happening.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon, the
egg thing is gone.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:43.405 align:middle line:84%
And then it sort of went
away, and I put my arms down,

00:10:43.405 --> 00:10:45.260 align:middle line:84%
and here's this
little old man sitting

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:50.830 align:middle line:90%
on my bed looking at me.

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And it was the same guy
from 12 years earlier.

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And inside of my head, I
said to him, oh, it's you.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.040 align:middle line:90%
Oh, great.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Because I really
liked him and always

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:03.840 align:middle line:90%
wanted to see this guy again.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized,
oh, that's who Thoth is.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.716 align:middle line:90%
That's who this person is.

00:11:12.716 --> 00:11:14.382 align:middle line:84%
But he didn't say
anything to me at all.

00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:15.460 align:middle line:90%
He didn't answer me back.

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:16.960 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to
him telepathically,

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.096 align:middle line:90%
but there was nothing.

00:11:18.096 --> 00:11:20.810 align:middle line:90%


00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:22.330 align:middle line:90%
And it was a little different.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.760 align:middle line:84%
Like the first time
when he appeared,

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:29.960 align:middle line:84%
my alchemist teacher
appeared, I could not resist.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.380 align:middle line:84%
I reached over and touched
him, because he looked real.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:35.840 align:middle line:90%
And he was solid.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.544 align:middle line:84%
But this time, he was
ever-so-slightly transparent.

00:11:39.544 --> 00:11:40.710 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have to reach over.

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:43.940 align:middle line:84%
I knew that he wasn't
like solidly there.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:46.810 align:middle line:84%
But he was real
clearly sitting there.

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And so after a while
or a few seconds,

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.750 align:middle line:84%
I realized that he
didn't want to talk.

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:56.400 align:middle line:90%
He just wanted to work.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.720 align:middle line:90%
And so I just looked back.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.970 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what else to do.

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:01.400 align:middle line:84%
So we just looked at
each other for a while.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And then after a while, the egg
kind of appeared around him,

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:10.520 align:middle line:84%
and then it just went
away, and he was gone.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And I got real
excited after that

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:16.030 align:middle line:84%
because something new
was happening here.

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And I liked this guy, and I
wanted-- and it was real good.

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:25.776 align:middle line:84%
And so I gotta remember
all the sequences here,

00:12:25.776 --> 00:12:27.026 align:middle line:90%
because it's a little complex.

00:12:27.026 --> 00:12:32.100 align:middle line:90%


00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.170 align:middle line:84%
Soon after that,
this friend of mine,

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:43.070 align:middle line:84%
Jenny Byrd, who's a singer
around town, she came up to me

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:47.110 align:middle line:84%
and gave me an emerald crystal,
a raw, natural emerald crystal

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:50.640 align:middle line:84%
just out of the blue, said,
would you like an emerald?

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.010 align:middle line:84%
So I looked at it,
and I thought, well,

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:54.340 align:middle line:90%
everything comes for a reason.

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:58.460 align:middle line:84%
So I went back to where I
meditate, and I sat down.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:12:59.880 align:middle line:90%
And to me, crystals are alive.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.090 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they're living beings.

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:05.340 align:middle line:84%
And I learned a long time ago
how to communicate with them.

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And so I sat in
there, and put it up.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:11.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember if I held
it this way or to my head.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:12.220 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.820 align:middle line:90%
But I connected with it.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And I asked it what it knew
about the Emerald Tablets.

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And all it would say over
and over and over again was,

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.331 align:middle line:84%
the Emerald Tablets are
not made out of emerald.

00:13:23.331 --> 00:13:24.380 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And after about five
minutes of that,

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:27.636 align:middle line:84%
I decided this was a
broken record here,

00:13:27.636 --> 00:13:28.985 align:middle line:90%
and I took it back down.

00:13:28.985 --> 00:13:31.110 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't say any more,
just, the Emerald Tablets

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:33.680 align:middle line:90%
are not made out of emerald.

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And just kind of a
little side thing

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:44.600 align:middle line:84%
on this thing about
crystals, to me

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.920 align:middle line:84%
they're real easy
to communicate with.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:53.300 align:middle line:84%
They're very easy
once you open to it.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.010 align:middle line:84%
I used to give classes on
crystals a long time ago.

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:59.670 align:middle line:90%


00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And one day I was in a
crystal class in San Francisco

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:08.640 align:middle line:90%
to about 30 people.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.585 align:middle line:84%
And we were sitting
in a big circle,

00:14:10.585 --> 00:14:12.230 align:middle line:84%
and I was pulling
out all my crystals

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:13.910 align:middle line:90%
and talking about each one.

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And I was saying the same
thing, that crystals are alive.

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And somebody said, well, can
you show me that they're alive?

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.340 align:middle line:84%
So I never know
if can or I can't.

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what--
it's up to God.

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought for a moment,
and I said, well, I don't know.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And then this idea
popped in my head.

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And I passed-- everybody had
a piece of paper and a pencil.

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.032 align:middle line:84%
And said, OK, somebody put
a crystal out in the middle.

00:14:46.032 --> 00:14:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And so somebody just put a
crystal out in the middle,

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.094 align:middle line:90%
just one at random.

00:14:49.094 --> 00:14:50.510 align:middle line:84%
Before anybody
could look at it, I

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:53.980 align:middle line:84%
got my hands on it [INAUDIBLE]
any kind of thing like that.

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.190 align:middle line:84%
I says, OK, nobody is going
to look at the crystal.

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:58.370 align:middle line:84%
All you're doing to do
is just take it, put it

00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:59.170 align:middle line:90%
to your forehead.

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:00.870 align:middle line:90%
You've got two seconds.

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:04.410 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the first place
that comes to your mind

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:07.440 align:middle line:84%
where this crystal
came from, just listen,

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.672 align:middle line:90%
the first place it is.

00:15:08.672 --> 00:15:10.380 align:middle line:84%
Take it down, hand it
to the next person,

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.602 align:middle line:84%
write it on a piece of
paper, and fold it up.

00:15:12.602 --> 00:15:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And it went around
the whole place.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.435 align:middle line:84%
Nobody got to sit
there and study

00:15:15.435 --> 00:15:17.986 align:middle line:84%
the crystal or anything
else like that, just-- ooh--

00:15:17.986 --> 00:15:19.880 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And then all at once
we opened them up.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.930 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know if it was
going to work, right?

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:26.795 align:middle line:84%
We all opened up, and every
single person in the room

00:15:26.795 --> 00:15:31.142 align:middle line:84%
had exactly the same
place, which was Brazil.

00:15:31.142 --> 00:15:32.624 align:middle line:90%
Every single person.

00:15:32.624 --> 00:15:38.242 align:middle line:90%


00:15:38.242 --> 00:15:39.450 align:middle line:90%
But that's just a simple one.

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:43.250 align:middle line:84%
I know from a lot of other
ways that communication level

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:47.640 align:middle line:84%
with crystals is really, really,
really easy and very accurate.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:51.820 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I ended up
giving that back to Jenny.

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And a little while later,
I was in a crystal store.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.980 align:middle line:90%
This is now about November.

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:03.750 align:middle line:84%
The first time when I-- the day
that I was introduced to Thoth

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:06.120 align:middle line:90%
was November 1, 1984.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:12.070 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the story is going
to go until January 19, 1985.

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:15.760 align:middle line:84%
So this is a span of
time that this is in.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And so this would have been
a few days after November 1.

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:28.090 align:middle line:84%
I was in a store, and
I saw a twined quartz

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:33.210 align:middle line:84%
crystal, which is just two
crystals that are like that.

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:36.760 align:middle line:90%
That's a twined quartz.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.450 align:middle line:84%
When the crystals
are formed, they

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:44.375 align:middle line:84%
make what is called a mistake,
which forms a second one.

00:16:44.375 --> 00:16:47.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you guys
know how crystals are formed,

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:51.520 align:middle line:84%
but it's really based
a lot on vortex energy

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.470 align:middle line:84%
and the flower of
light patterns.

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:58.780 align:middle line:84%
Crystals are-- silicon
is a tetrahedron.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:02.785 align:middle line:84%
And the silicon
thing fixes together

00:17:02.785 --> 00:17:05.810 align:middle line:84%
and makes a star
tetrahedron, which is a cube.

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And then it makes a whole
array of these cubes

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:10.660 align:middle line:90%
along a straight line.

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And then it spins
very, very fast

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:20.339 align:middle line:84%
and stops at the six
points of the flower's life

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:24.560 align:middle line:84%
and goes up like this
and forms itself.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.599 align:middle line:84%
And if it spins
one way, it's male,

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:28.390 align:middle line:84%
and if it spins the
other way, it's female.

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
spin counter-rotating

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:32.350 align:middle line:84%
when they do it, which
are both male and female.

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:34.016 align:middle line:84%
And you can look at
the windows and tell

00:17:34.016 --> 00:17:36.150 align:middle line:90%
if a crystal is male or female.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Start with the lowest window,
and the next highest window

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:41.682 align:middle line:84%
will either go this
way, and if it does,

00:17:41.682 --> 00:17:44.140 align:middle line:84%
the next one will be higher
and the next one will be higher

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:44.980 align:middle line:90%
and the next one will be higher.

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.521 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the rotational
energy going counterclockwise.

00:17:47.521 --> 00:17:49.070 align:middle line:90%
And that's a male.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:50.587 align:middle line:84%
The next windows
over in this side,

00:17:50.587 --> 00:17:52.920 align:middle line:84%
the next one will be there,
and it will go up like that.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:53.990 align:middle line:90%
It's a female.

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:55.739 align:middle line:84%
And then some of them
will have low window

00:17:55.739 --> 00:17:57.550 align:middle line:84%
with two equal windows
going up like this.

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:58.998 align:middle line:90%
It will have a double pattern.

00:17:58.998 --> 00:18:01.930 align:middle line:90%


00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:06.100 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I had this
little twined quartz,

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.500 align:middle line:84%
and it was an
extraordinary crystal.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:13.470 align:middle line:84%
I had never seen anything quite
like this crystal ever before.

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:17.260 align:middle line:84%
The face on it was the perfect
octagonal like a stop sign.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:20.810 align:middle line:84%
I've seen three-sided,
four-sided, five-sided,

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:24.915 align:middle line:84%
six-sided, seven-sided,
and nine-sided faces,

00:18:24.915 --> 00:18:27.410 align:middle line:84%
but I've never,
ever, ever, ever,

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.850 align:middle line:84%
seen an eight-sided face
on a crystal before.

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:31.150 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't stand it.

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:31.950 align:middle line:90%
I had to buy it.

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:32.750 align:middle line:90%
I bought it.

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:34.320 align:middle line:90%
I went home with it.

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.992 align:middle line:84%
And I sat down
with this crystal.

00:18:35.992 --> 00:18:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think I'm going to
tell the whole story on this

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:40.850 align:middle line:84%
because it's not really,
really important.

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:44.580 align:middle line:84%
But this crystal gave
me a two-hour long,

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.110 align:middle line:84%
one of the most
incredible visions

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:47.230 align:middle line:90%
I'd ever seen in my life.

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:50.085 align:middle line:84%
It was just nothing like
that had ever occurred.

00:18:50.085 --> 00:18:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And it was like
Akhenaten and Nefertiti

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:53.760 align:middle line:90%
had programmed into this thing.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And their voices came through,
she led me through Egypt,

00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:58.610 align:middle line:90%
and it was this amazing thing.

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:00.255 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what was going on.

00:19:00.255 --> 00:19:02.380 align:middle line:84%
I still don't know why it
all happened or anything,

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:05.800 align:middle line:84%
but it was very, very
powerful experience.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.100 align:middle line:84%
But at the very end,
Nefertiti led me

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:13.460 align:middle line:84%
through all these temples
with this crystal.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:18.105 align:middle line:84%
And the very final scene
was the sun going down

00:19:18.105 --> 00:19:21.170 align:middle line:84%
and the Sphinx, which was
inside of the Great Pyramid

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.330 align:middle line:90%
looking out.

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And the next night, I decided
to see if I could get Thoth

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:31.920 align:middle line:90%
back again.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:35.160 align:middle line:90%
And I felt this urge to do this.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.870 align:middle line:90%
And so I repeated his name.

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:39.000 align:middle line:90%
This time I left my eyes open.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.910 align:middle line:84%
The egg appeared, this
whole stuff went on again.

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And there he is
on the bed again.

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:49.180 align:middle line:84%
Only this time,
he's ready to talk.

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:55.790 align:middle line:90%
And Thoth is very direct.

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:57.990 align:middle line:84%
There's no small talk
ever with this guy.

00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:59.420 align:middle line:90%
It's not true with his wife.

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:02.938 align:middle line:84%
She'll sit there and talk
with you, but not Thoth.

00:20:02.938 --> 00:20:05.370 align:middle line:84%
He's-- booka--
right to the point.

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And he comes up, and
he goes, the dream

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:13.590 align:middle line:84%
you had last night, which is
where we where-- oh, I didn't

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:15.300 align:middle line:90%
tell you about that part.

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.260 align:middle line:90%
There's one thing in the middle.

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.010 align:middle line:84%
Right after I had that
crystal [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:22.090 align:middle line:84%
over there, right after
it I had this dream.

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And in the dream, it was one
of these really real dreams

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:31.020 align:middle line:84%
that we all have every one in
a while, super Technicolor,

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.320 align:middle line:90%
you remember every moment in it.

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And in the dream,
there was a small group

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:39.800 align:middle line:84%
of people that came to me,
and we went into Egypt,

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.570 align:middle line:84%
and we went through
this initiation

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:44.050 align:middle line:84%
through all these
temples in there.

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And until the crystal that had
happened right before then,

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:51.690 align:middle line:84%
I had really not even thought
about Egypt that much.

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:54.480 align:middle line:84%
I'd read about it
and things like that.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.960 align:middle line:84%
I had not contemplated
going to Egypt

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:59.290 align:middle line:84%
or thinking along those
kinds of lines at all.

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:05.190 align:middle line:90%


00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:08.057 align:middle line:84%
But in this dream,
we were going there,

00:21:08.057 --> 00:21:09.890 align:middle line:84%
and we were going through
all these temples,

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:12.320 align:middle line:84%
and all these initiations
were taking place.

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And then the dream seemed
to have like this hesitation

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:16.560 align:middle line:90%
place for a while.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:21.325 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going through
more pyramids and temples,

00:21:21.325 --> 00:21:24.410 align:middle line:84%
but I couldn't figure
out where I was.

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And through the whole dream,
I'm going, where am I?

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:27.470 align:middle line:90%
Where am I?

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:30.114 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I just asked,
where am I? [LAUGHING]

00:21:30.114 --> 00:21:31.500 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:32.300 align:middle line:90%
And I the answer.

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:34.030 align:middle line:90%
You're in Peru.

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:35.200 align:middle line:90%
And I mean, I'll tell you.

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:38.150 align:middle line:84%
Peru is like the last place--
well, maybe not the last,

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:40.180 align:middle line:84%
but pretty close
to the last place

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:42.580 align:middle line:90%
I had ever thought of going.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And then there was this
other place, separation.

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:51.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm going through more
pyramids and realized

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:52.820 align:middle line:90%
that I was in the Yucatan.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:55.480 align:middle line:90%


00:21:55.480 --> 00:22:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And so then when I
went and got Thoth back

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:04.470 align:middle line:84%
in the second time he came
in and he starts telling me,

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:06.330 align:middle line:84%
he says, the dream
that you just had,

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:08.325 align:middle line:84%
which was the night
before-- I believe

00:22:08.325 --> 00:22:09.610 align:middle line:90%
it was the night before.

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:12.070 align:middle line:84%
The dream you just
had will begin,

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:18.420 align:middle line:84%
will happen, the whole
thing, but only if it begins.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, what
you mean if it begins?

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, by that I
mean it has to begin in Egypt,

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:33.220 align:middle line:84%
but you can't do anything
to make it happen.

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:36.000 align:middle line:84%
The dream must
happen on its own.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.713 align:middle line:84%
It must begin on its own
without you doing anything.

00:22:40.713 --> 00:22:45.490 align:middle line:90%
And clarified it.

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:47.380 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't tell anybody.

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.250 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't go buy a ticket.

00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:51.500 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't do anything at.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:54.410 align:middle line:84%
Hold this thought into
my mind, into my heart,

00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:58.550 align:middle line:84%
and do nothing and
just end up there.

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:00.720 align:middle line:90%
And then he left.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And after he left, I
was thinking, well,

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.267 align:middle line:90%
this is a real easy one.

00:23:05.267 --> 00:23:07.480 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHING] I just don't
have to do a thing.

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.990 align:middle line:84%
I just sit here and
somehow some hijackers

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:10.990 align:middle line:90%
are going to come along.

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:12.806 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:12.806 --> 00:23:15.360 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHING] Put me in a truck
and take me to Egypt, I guess.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.985 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
was going to happen.

00:23:16.985 --> 00:23:19.480 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't conceive
of how I could

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.670 align:middle line:84%
possibly, how that
could possibly happen.

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:24.880 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't conceive of a
way that it could happen.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:28.080 align:middle line:84%
But I figured,
well, it's up to Go.

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.320 align:middle line:90%
Anything's possible.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.250 align:middle line:84%
But I couldn't figure out
how it could be possible.

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And a few days
later, I had already

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.720 align:middle line:84%
made arrangements
to go see my parents

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:49.825 align:middle line:90%
in California in the Bay area.

00:23:49.825 --> 00:23:53.780 align:middle line:90%
And so went there.

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:55.370 align:middle line:84%
I was going to go
there for 10 days.

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:57.730 align:middle line:90%
And I went there to see them.

00:23:57.730 --> 00:23:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
the 10 days-- it

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:04.220 align:middle line:84%
was the ninth day-- my
sister Nita was just

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:05.820 align:middle line:90%
returning from China.

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And I really love my
sister Nita a lot.

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:13.470 align:middle line:84%
I've got four sisters and a
brother, and the rest of them,

00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:15.230 align:middle line:90%
I don't even see them.

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:18.425 align:middle line:84%
But my sister Nita
and I are real close.

00:24:18.425 --> 00:24:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And she was actually my
mother in my last lifetime.

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:23.839 align:middle line:84%
She knows it, I
know it, and we just

00:24:23.839 --> 00:24:25.130 align:middle line:90%
have a real close relationship.

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:28.236 align:middle line:90%


00:24:28.236 --> 00:24:35.620 align:middle line:90%
And so I wanted to go see her.

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And so on the ninth night,
I went over to see her.

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:44.620 align:middle line:90%
And we got talking all night.

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:47.060 align:middle line:90%
She's a real interesting person.

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:53.365 align:middle line:84%
She has been traveling
about 10 or 11 months out

00:24:53.365 --> 00:24:59.220 align:middle line:84%
of every year for about
the last 45 years non-stop.

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:01.290 align:middle line:84%
She had a map on
the wall one time

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:03.580 align:middle line:84%
a long time ago where
she put a little pin

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:05.430 align:middle line:90%
in every city she's been in.

00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:08.620 align:middle line:84%
The whole was just--
there was anywhere.

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:11.450 align:middle line:84%
Every city is usually
like 15, 20, 30, 40 times

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:13.120 align:middle line:90%
she's been in, everywhere.

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.006 align:middle line:84%
There's no where
she hasn't been.

00:25:15.006 --> 00:25:16.510 align:middle line:84%
I remember this
one time when she

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:19.520 align:middle line:84%
was sitting in a room
with some friends,

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.980 align:middle line:84%
and this guy came in who
was another world traveler.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And they sat down and
tried to find a place

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:29.390 align:middle line:90%
that one had not been to.

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:30.870 align:middle line:90%
And hours went by.

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:31.981 align:middle line:90%
They were going on.

00:25:31.981 --> 00:25:33.730 align:middle line:84%
like two hours later,
one would say, well,

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:34.410 align:middle line:90%
have you been to da-da-da?

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:34.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:35.675 align:middle line:90%
Have you been-- bluh.

00:25:35.675 --> 00:25:36.885 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:36.885 --> 00:25:38.450 align:middle line:84%
I come back an hour later,
and they're still, well,

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:39.533 align:middle line:90%
have you been to da-da-da?

00:25:39.533 --> 00:25:41.362 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:41.362 --> 00:25:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And finally at the very end,
I was listening to this,

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:47.830 align:middle line:84%
and my sister's going,
OK-- [LAUGHING]--

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:50.150 align:middle line:84%
you go down the Amazon and
down this stuff like that.

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:51.450 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:53.040 align:middle line:90%
You know where this da-da-da is?

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:53.892 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:53.892 --> 00:25:54.692 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:54.692 --> 00:25:57.584 align:middle line:84%
And he says, and you
know this little thing

00:25:57.584 --> 00:25:58.500 align:middle line:90%
that goes up that way?

00:25:58.500 --> 00:25:59.943 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, yeah.

00:25:59.943 --> 00:26:01.548 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:01.548 --> 00:26:02.348 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

00:26:02.348 --> 00:26:03.687 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:03.687 --> 00:26:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And she goes away up there
to some place up there,

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:07.195 align:middle line:90%
and he had never been there.

00:26:07.195 --> 00:26:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And it was like she
finally got him.

00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:11.850 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:14.400 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, she was had just
come back from China,

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.240 align:middle line:84%
and I was sitting
in the room talking

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:19.930 align:middle line:90%
to her about spiritual things.

00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:26.340 align:middle line:84%
That's mostly what she wants
to talk about, though I did not

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:28.660 align:middle line:84%
tell her anything
about what Thoth-- what

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:30.990 align:middle line:84%
was going on with me relative
to this new thing that

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:31.790 align:middle line:90%
was happening.

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:33.700 align:middle line:90%
I was told not to.

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.365 align:middle line:84%
And sometime about 1
o'clock in the evening,

00:26:36.365 --> 00:26:38.870 align:middle line:84%
we're still going
on, and she had

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:43.570 align:middle line:84%
a copy of "The Secret
Teachings of All Ages"

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:46.140 align:middle line:84%
by Manly P. Hall that
was sitting on the table.

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.535 align:middle line:84%
And she just flips
it open, casually,

00:26:48.535 --> 00:26:50.285 align:middle line:84%
as she's talking about
some other subject.

00:26:50.285 --> 00:26:51.437 align:middle line:90%
She you flips it open.

00:26:51.437 --> 00:26:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And there's a cross section,
like we saw up there,

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.340 align:middle line:90%
of the Great Pyramid.

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:58.422 align:middle line:84%
And the conversation
gets switched to Egypt.

00:26:58.422 --> 00:27:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And she starts telling me
about one of her adventures

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:01.463 align:middle line:90%
over there in Egypt.

00:27:01.463 --> 00:27:06.282 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm just listening
to her on all this.

00:27:06.282 --> 00:27:08.115 align:middle line:84%
And right in the middle
of the conversation,

00:27:08.115 --> 00:27:09.660 align:middle line:84%
she stops, she
looks at me, and she

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.690 align:middle line:84%
says, you've never been
to Egypt, have you?

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:15.510 align:middle line:90%
I go, me? [LAUGHING]

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:17.860 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:19.270 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:23.570 align:middle line:84%
She goes, well, gee, you
really need to Egypt.

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:25.740 align:middle line:84%
She says, if you ever want
to go, just let me know.

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:26.739 align:middle line:90%
I'll pay for everything.

00:27:26.739 --> 00:27:30.700 align:middle line:84%
I'll just totally pay for
the whole trip for you.

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And I kept my mouth real
closed, and I said, OK.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:37.054 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:37.054 --> 00:27:37.970 align:middle line:90%
I didn't say anything.

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:39.830 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I could
not say anything.

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I went on home
the next morning.

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:48.870 align:middle line:84%
I got home that next evening,
and I set my bags down.

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:51.990 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing I do when I
get off of a plane, I sit down

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:56.360 align:middle line:84%
and I center from all
the stuff and everything.

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And I sit down and
meditate for a little bit.

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And I open my eyes, and
Thoth is sitting in my bed.

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:05.087 align:middle line:84%
None of this stuff,
no things, no nothing.

00:28:05.087 --> 00:28:06.253 align:middle line:90%
He's just sitting in my bed.

00:28:06.253 --> 00:28:07.211 align:middle line:90%
He's got my number now.

00:28:07.211 --> 00:28:08.620 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:12.651 align:middle line:84%
And he immediately goes
right to the point,

00:28:12.651 --> 00:28:13.900 align:middle line:90%
doesn't say hello or anything.

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:17.967 align:middle line:84%
He goes-- he got
better after, though.

00:28:17.967 --> 00:28:19.300 align:middle line:90%
After a few years he got better.

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:22.130 align:middle line:90%


00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:25.690 align:middle line:84%
He says, that's how
you're going to Egypt.

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:26.870 align:middle line:90%
I said, how?

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:29.710 align:middle line:90%
And he said, your sister.

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:32.930 align:middle line:84%
You call her tomorrow
morning, tell her

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:34.810 align:middle line:84%
that you want to go
to Egypt, and you

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:39.080 align:middle line:84%
want to go between
January 10 and January 19,

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.320 align:middle line:84%
which is-- we're
talking about this

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:42.970 align:middle line:84%
is like toward the
end of November,

00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:46.700 align:middle line:84%
so we're talking about
five, six weeks away.

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And so when he said that,
it made perfect sense.

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:51.860 align:middle line:90%
And I said, oh, OK.

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:54.010 align:middle line:90%
And then he leaves.

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And then after he left,
I started thinking.

00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And the more I
started thinking, I

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:00.910 align:middle line:84%
started feeling
funnier and funnier,

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:05.560 align:middle line:84%
because I know what my sister
meant when she told me this.

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:10.350 align:middle line:84%
She didn't mean that she would
take me in five or six weeks.

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:15.380 align:middle line:84%
She meant someday
down the line, someday

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:17.410 align:middle line:90%
she would take me to Egypt.

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And he told me to call first
thing in the morning, so

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:23.204 align:middle line:84%
that next morning when I woke
up, I was sitting with my hand

00:29:23.204 --> 00:29:24.745 align:middle line:84%
on the phone for
like a half an hour.

00:29:24.745 --> 00:29:27.240 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't lift it
up off the cradle

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.490 align:middle line:84%
because I felt like I
was really opposing here.

00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:31.250 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, I knew I had

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:34.070 align:middle line:84%
to do what the higher
guidance was telling me to do.

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:37.470 align:middle line:84%
But I finally got the guts, you
gotta do it, you gotta do it.

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:38.430 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:40.687 align:middle line:84%
I lifted the phone
up, dialed the number,

00:29:40.687 --> 00:29:42.270 align:middle line:84%
and I told her-- she
got on the phone.

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:44.160 align:middle line:84%
I says real quickly,
well, remember

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.825 align:middle line:84%
you said you would
take me to Egypt?

00:29:45.825 --> 00:29:46.866 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, yeah, yeah.

00:29:46.866 --> 00:29:50.855 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, I'd really like
to go right away to-- January 10

00:29:50.855 --> 00:29:53.360 align:middle line:90%
through January 19.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And she goes,
well-- [LAUGHING] I

00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:00.020 align:middle line:90%
don't think that we can do that.

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:02.330 align:middle line:84%
She says, as far
as I can remember--

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:04.120 align:middle line:84%
she traveled so
much she eventually

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:05.980 align:middle line:90%
bought a travel agency.

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:08.545 align:middle line:84%
And they have stuff-- she
had the largest travel

00:30:08.545 --> 00:30:09.420 align:middle line:90%
agency in California.

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:12.810 align:middle line:84%
I think it was 22 people
that just booked flights

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:15.510 align:middle line:84%
all the time and which
was also booking hers.

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:17.168 align:middle line:84%
She would take groups
around the world.

00:30:17.168 --> 00:30:18.904 align:middle line:84%
That's how she
made her own money.

00:30:18.904 --> 00:30:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, I don't think I
can do that until-- she said,

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:29.660 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm booked all the way
through September of next year,

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:31.270 align:middle line:90%
1984.

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:33.250 align:middle line:84%
She says, I don't
think I can do that.

00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:35.866 align:middle line:84%
She says, but I'll
call you back when

00:30:35.866 --> 00:30:37.240 align:middle line:84%
I get-- I had
called her at home,

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.850 align:middle line:84%
and she says, I'll call you
when I get to the office

00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:41.680 align:middle line:84%
and I'll look, but, she says,
I don't think I can do that.

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:42.750 align:middle line:90%
That's how she left it.

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:45.220 align:middle line:84%
She says, but I'll take
you in October, November.

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:48.320 align:middle line:90%
Later this year we can go.

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.380 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, OK.

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:51.860 align:middle line:90%
And she left.

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And so it looked like
it wasn't gonna happen.

00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.670 align:middle line:84%
About an hour or two later,
she calls me back up.

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, well, I'm not
only booked through September,

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:06.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm now booked all the
way through October 1984,

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:11.400 align:middle line:84%
every single day, she
says, except for January 10

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:12.540 align:middle line:90%
through January 19.

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:13.881 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:13.881 --> 00:31:15.380 align:middle line:84%
She says, when I
looked in the book,

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:18.070 align:middle line:84%
it was solid mass
things on either side,

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:20.190 align:middle line:90%
and those days were blank.

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:23.840 align:middle line:84%
She says, not even one
word written in them.

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:27.197 align:middle line:84%
She says something like,
I think you've really

00:31:27.197 --> 00:31:28.280 align:middle line:90%
tuned into something here.

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:29.654 align:middle line:84%
We're really
supposed to do this.

00:31:29.654 --> 00:31:30.888 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:30.888 --> 00:31:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yeah,
I think we are.

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:37.780 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:40.060 align:middle line:90%
And then she calls up TWA.

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:43.850 align:middle line:84%
She used to bring the ARE
groups over there, anywhere

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:47.990 align:middle line:84%
from 100 to 700 people at a
time over to Egypt all the time.

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And so when she called them up
for the tickets to go to Egypt,

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.910 align:middle line:84%
she knew the guy that
was booking the tickets.

00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And she says, I
want a ticket for me

00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:59.480 align:middle line:90%
and my brother to go Egypt.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:02.099 align:middle line:90%
He goes, you and your brother?

00:32:02.099 --> 00:32:04.390 align:middle line:84%
He says, well, you've brought
so many people over there

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:06.790 align:middle line:84%
we'll just give it
to you for free.

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:09.592 align:middle line:84%
So TWA flew both of us over
there and back for nothing.

00:32:09.592 --> 00:32:12.889 align:middle line:90%


00:32:12.889 --> 00:32:16.190 align:middle line:90%
Even TWA was on our side.

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:21.330 align:middle line:90%
And so we then began to prepare.

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:28.133 align:middle line:90%


00:32:28.133 --> 00:32:30.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember if this
was the exact order or not,

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:38.600 align:middle line:84%
but Thoth came in and said that
I had to go through a training

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.000 align:middle line:90%
and that he would help me.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And he spent a couple weeks or
more with me, a lot each day.

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:48.170 align:middle line:90%


00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:50.450 align:middle line:84%
He gave me an itinerary
of where I had to go.

00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:53.140 align:middle line:84%
I had to start at
Luxor Temple of Man

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:55.520 align:middle line:84%
and then go to the Temple
of Dreams, like I told you.

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, there
was a whole itinerary

00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:01.630 align:middle line:84%
of places running all the
way up the Nile into Saqqara.

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And then finally at
the very last place

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:06.850 align:middle line:84%
was into that little
room or that tunnel

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:13.800 align:middle line:90%
underneath in the Great Pyramid.

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And he told me that I had to
go in precisely that order,

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:26.620 align:middle line:84%
that if it was even one
deviation or one change, just

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:30.150 align:middle line:90%
to go home, forget it.

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:31.620 align:middle line:90%
It's all over, everything.

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:34.360 align:middle line:90%
The whole thing's over with.

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And then he said I
had to do a training.

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:41.190 align:middle line:90%
I did two basic trainings.

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:44.290 align:middle line:84%
The first one,
which was ongoing,

00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:48.880 align:middle line:84%
which took a long time, was for
each one of these itineraries

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:51.340 align:middle line:84%
in each one of
these temples, I had

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:54.500 align:middle line:84%
to go to a certain place in
each one of these temples,

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:58.420 align:middle line:84%
and I had to repeat certain
Atlantean sounds and words

00:33:58.420 --> 00:33:59.910 align:middle line:90%
and paragraphs.

00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to learn
how to speak Atlantean.

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:05.550 align:middle line:90%
And it was hard.

00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:09.464 align:middle line:84%
And so he would give me a
sound or a series of words

00:34:09.464 --> 00:34:10.880 align:middle line:84%
that I'd have to
say, and I'd have

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.644 align:middle line:84%
to keep repeating them over and
over and over until I got them

00:34:13.644 --> 00:34:16.580 align:middle line:84%
just the way that he
wanted me to say them.

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And then I would write them
out phonetically on paper

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:20.962 align:middle line:90%
so I could try to remember.

00:34:20.962 --> 00:34:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Then when he would
come back in, he

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:23.519 align:middle line:84%
would have me keep
repeating them.

00:34:23.519 --> 00:34:24.949 align:middle line:90%
I had to get them just right.

00:34:24.949 --> 00:34:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they sounded
exactly what he was saying,

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:29.699 align:middle line:84%
but it wasn't good
enough for him.

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:31.179 align:middle line:90%
It had to be just right.

00:34:31.179 --> 00:34:33.230 align:middle line:84%
So that was one of the
things that kept going.

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:35.639 align:middle line:84%
And then the other one told
me what I just told you,

00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:38.760 align:middle line:84%
that where I was going into
was a fourth-dimensional space

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:41.830 align:middle line:84%
connected to the Halls of
Amenti and that I couldn't

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:46.510 align:middle line:84%
have any fears, that I
could get hurt in this place

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:48.139 align:middle line:90%
if I had any fears.

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:52.070 align:middle line:90%
And so he gave me a training.

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:54.036 align:middle line:84%
He said I would do
find on the fears,

00:34:54.036 --> 00:34:58.176 align:middle line:84%
but he gave me a training, which
is talked about in the Emerald

00:34:58.176 --> 00:35:00.300 align:middle line:84%
Tablets, but it's another
thing about talking about

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:01.883 align:middle line:84%
than actually doing
it and everything,

00:35:01.883 --> 00:35:07.000 align:middle line:84%
which is you make these-- they
can either be blue or gold.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.890 align:middle line:84%
But you make these psychic
blue rings around you.

00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And you can do them either
in one or in sets of three,

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:15.720 align:middle line:90%
I think it was.

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:20.039 align:middle line:84%
They're like neon
lights around your body.

00:35:20.039 --> 00:35:21.080 align:middle line:90%
Let me explain something.

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:29.930 align:middle line:84%
If you experience fear, you
move these rings up and down

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:33.850 align:middle line:90%
your body from foot to head.

00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:37.060 align:middle line:84%
You do it in such a
way it will tell you

00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:39.570 align:middle line:84%
if it's a real fear
that you're experiencing

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:44.480 align:middle line:90%
or if it's paranoia, number one.

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And if it is real
fear, then there

00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:50.490 align:middle line:84%
is a certain rhythm
of the rings that

00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:53.507 align:middle line:84%
will eliminate the fear so
you can deal with the problem.

00:35:53.507 --> 00:35:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And if it's paranoia,
there's another rhythm

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:57.381 align:middle line:84%
of the rings that will
just make the fear go away

00:35:57.381 --> 00:35:59.230 align:middle line:90%
so you can keep going on.

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And so that was
part of my training.

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And so while I was
doing all of that,

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:11.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm still going
through all of this.

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:13.350 align:middle line:84%
At one point, I realized
that my Emerald Tablets

00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:14.710 align:middle line:90%
had a couple missing pages.

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:17.930 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHING] Because this
was an old, beat-up copy.

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And in my mind, I was wishing
I had a full set of them.

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And I was also in my mind-- I
didn't express this to anyone,

00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:30.060 align:middle line:84%
but in my mind, I was
wishing that I also

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:32.570 align:middle line:90%
had a set for my sister.

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And something I haven't
told you, in the meantime

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:37.690 align:middle line:90%
I had a friend.

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:42.650 align:middle line:84%
His name was Sananda Ra, who
found out I was going to Egypt

00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:44.882 align:middle line:84%
and said he wanted
to come with me.

00:36:44.882 --> 00:36:47.650 align:middle line:90%
And I asked, and they said yes.

00:36:47.650 --> 00:36:49.347 align:middle line:90%
And so he was allowed to go.

00:36:49.347 --> 00:36:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And then he came back and said
he wanted to bring his brother.

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:53.620 align:middle line:90%
So I asked.

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:54.870 align:middle line:90%
And his brother came with him.

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:57.203 align:middle line:84%
Then he said he had a girlfriend
that he wanted to come.

00:36:57.203 --> 00:36:59.491 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING] So I asked.

00:36:59.491 --> 00:37:00.490 align:middle line:90%
And she could come, too.

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:02.364 align:middle line:84%
So we ended up being
five of us all together.

00:37:02.364 --> 00:37:06.145 align:middle line:84%
It was myself, my sister,
Sananda, his name was Jake,

00:37:06.145 --> 00:37:12.476 align:middle line:84%
and this woman, who was a
follower of Yogi Bhajan, who

00:37:12.476 --> 00:37:16.880 align:middle line:84%
was a Sikh who at that time
was somebody Singh-- I can't

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:19.640 align:middle line:84%
remember-- but later
changed her name

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:22.090 align:middle line:84%
and became known
as Katrina Raphael.

00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And that was before
she was Katrina.

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:32.182 align:middle line:84%
And so I was also wishing
that I had-- by this time

00:37:32.182 --> 00:37:33.723 align:middle line:84%
I knew those three
were coming, and I

00:37:33.723 --> 00:37:34.880 align:middle line:84%
was wishing that
I had another book

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.050 align:middle line:84%
to give to them so that they
could think about it, too.

00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:38.220 align:middle line:90%
I was wanting three books.

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:40.760 align:middle line:90%


00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:43.272 align:middle line:84%
And also in all this,
the angels came,

00:37:43.272 --> 00:37:45.355 align:middle line:84%
and the angels were coming
in and out all the time

00:37:45.355 --> 00:37:46.090 align:middle line:90%
through this whole thing.

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And at one point,
they came in, and they

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:52.340 align:middle line:84%
said you're about to go
on a trip for three days.

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:53.223 align:middle line:90%
Pack.

00:37:53.223 --> 00:37:56.310 align:middle line:90%
And then they left.

00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:59.270 align:middle line:84%
They didn't tell me
where I was going.

00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:02.390 align:middle line:90%
And this was December.

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:04.690 align:middle line:84%
So I went through a
lot, I'll tell you.

00:38:04.690 --> 00:38:09.751 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking,
well-- [LAUGHING]

00:38:09.751 --> 00:38:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever tried to pack
for anywhere in the world?

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:12.850 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:13.650 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know.

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:15.410 align:middle line:84%
So I packed this
bag with everything

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:18.180 align:middle line:84%
from shorts to down jackets to
everything you could think of.

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And I had it all
crammed into this thing,

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.556 align:middle line:84%
every conceivable
thing I could think of,

00:38:22.556 --> 00:38:26.220 align:middle line:84%
enough for three days, and
then sat around and wondered

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.190 align:middle line:90%
where I was going.

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:35.799 align:middle line:84%
And a very short
time later-- I don't

00:38:35.799 --> 00:38:38.090 align:middle line:84%
remember what it was, two or
three days later-- Sananda

00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:38.890 align:middle line:90%
comes up.

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:40.970 align:middle line:84%
He had just bought a
brand new white Jeep.

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And he comes up,
pulls up to my house,

00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:47.800 align:middle line:84%
and I was sitting there
on the porch, and he says,

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:50.672 align:middle line:84%
I just got another job
down in Tuscon, Arizona,

00:38:50.672 --> 00:38:52.380 align:middle line:84%
and I gotta go down
there for three days.

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:54.886 align:middle line:90%
He says, would you want to come?

00:38:54.886 --> 00:38:55.885 align:middle line:90%
I knew it was the thing.

00:38:55.885 --> 00:38:56.815 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:56.815 --> 00:38:58.800 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yeah.

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:01.654 align:middle line:84%
So I just picked up this
bag and put it into his car.

00:39:01.654 --> 00:39:04.134 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:04.134 --> 00:39:05.126 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:39:05.126 --> 00:39:09.590 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:10.374 align:middle line:90%


00:39:10.374 --> 00:39:12.540 align:middle line:84%
So we went over to his house
and packed his clothes.

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:15.650 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:17.410 align:middle line:90%
Went to Tuscon.

00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And what happened on that trip
was truly an incredible story.

00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:23.450 align:middle line:90%
I can't tell you the story.

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:24.760 align:middle line:90%
It's too long.

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:25.560 align:middle line:90%
Is beautiful.

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:26.940 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:30.750 align:middle line:84%
It's an absolutely
amazing story.

00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And we went into the
fourth dimension on Earth

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:38.500 align:middle line:90%
for a little over three days.

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:42.576 align:middle line:84%
And it was one
miracle after another.

00:39:42.576 --> 00:39:43.950 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen
anything like it.

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:47.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe I have, but
it had been a long time.

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:52.860 align:middle line:84%
But in those three days, we
went to this person's house,

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:58.942 align:middle line:84%
and in a very short
period of time-- ha, ha,

00:39:58.942 --> 00:40:02.870 align:middle line:90%
I just remembered part of that.

00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:04.834 align:middle line:90%
>>Tell us.

00:40:04.834 --> 00:40:05.830 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:09.570 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, just this woman who
appeared in the room-- she's

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:10.370 align:middle line:90%
a real woman.

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:13.380 align:middle line:84%
I watched her appear
right in the room,

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:16.890 align:middle line:90%
holding these owl feathers.

00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And she gave me the-- this
is not part of the story.

00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And she gave me the
two wings of this owl.

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:27.880 align:middle line:90%


00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:32.139 align:middle line:84%
And when we were
leaving and coming out--

00:40:32.139 --> 00:40:33.930 align:middle line:84%
this is right at the
as we were coming back

00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:36.192 align:middle line:84%
in the third dimension,
basically-- we

00:40:36.192 --> 00:40:39.960 align:middle line:84%
were driving down
the road, and there

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:43.099 align:middle line:84%
was this owl circling right
over our car as we were going.

00:40:43.099 --> 00:40:44.640 align:middle line:84%
This is during the
middle of the day.

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.120 align:middle line:90%
It's like 11 o'clock.

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And then we went just
a little bit further,

00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:53.520 align:middle line:84%
and there was this owl
sitting beside the road.

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:55.560 align:middle line:90%
And we stopped and backed up.

00:40:55.560 --> 00:41:00.090 align:middle line:84%
It was just sitting there
, only it had just died.

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:03.020 align:middle line:90%
It was still warm.

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at this owl,
and I took the feathers out,

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:08.384 align:middle line:84%
the wings out, and
it was identical.

00:41:08.384 --> 00:41:09.550 align:middle line:90%
It was absolutely identical.

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:11.960 align:middle line:90%
It was the same one.

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And the bird told me to
take its wings and its feet

00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:19.670 align:middle line:84%
and to put it into the
bushes, which I did.

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:25.666 align:middle line:84%
And the spirit of the owl
came to me at that point.

00:41:25.666 --> 00:41:30.400 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the birds
that was one of my power birds

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.020 align:middle line:90%
that was with me.

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And after that, every
mile for five more miles,

00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:37.490 align:middle line:84%
there was one of
the owls circling

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:38.500 align:middle line:90%
over us leading us out.

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And every time we went
under one of these owls,

00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:43.380 align:middle line:84%
I could feel us coming back,
coming back, and coming back.

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And by the time we got
past the seventh owl,

00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:48.820 align:middle line:84%
we were just driving down
a car on the road again.

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:49.660 align:middle line:90%
It was all over.

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:51.100 align:middle line:84%
But I can't tell you
the rest of the story,

00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:52.100 align:middle line:90%
because it was too much.

00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:54.910 align:middle line:90%


00:41:54.910 --> 00:42:00.370 align:middle line:84%
But birds have been very,
very close to me all my life.

00:42:00.370 --> 00:42:08.230 align:middle line:84%
The hummingbird, which has
been carefully helping me

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:10.600 align:middle line:84%
with this work
that I'm doing now,

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:15.060 align:middle line:84%
the way the hummingbird came
to me was I was in a building.

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:18.057 align:middle line:84%
And there had been a
little tiny opening

00:42:18.057 --> 00:42:19.640 align:middle line:84%
over on one edge of
the building where

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.030 align:middle line:90%
there was some construction.

00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:21.910 align:middle line:90%
They were only about this big.

00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And when I came
in the room, there

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:25.525 align:middle line:84%
had been a hummingbird in
the room that was flying,

00:42:25.525 --> 00:42:27.500 align:middle line:90%
darting all over.

00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And it kept hitting the
windows and going around.

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And I just stood very
still in the room

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:35.660 align:middle line:84%
and waited until it finally
landed on the ledge.

00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And then I went over to it
when it about three feet away.

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And in my mind, I told
it everything was OK.

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And I just held my
finger up and said,

00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:54.280 align:middle line:84%
if you'll come over and land on
my finger, I'll take you out.

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And the bird turned around,
and he looked at me,

00:42:57.490 --> 00:43:00.360 align:middle line:84%
and it just flew over
and landed on my finger.

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And then I walked about 30 feet
over to where the little hall

00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:06.220 align:middle line:90%
was, and I let it go.

00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And the next morning when
I came in to my desk, which

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.218 align:middle line:84%
was over there, the little bird
was laying on my desk, dead.

00:43:13.218 --> 00:43:16.030 align:middle line:90%


00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:18.040 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if you understand.

00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:20.360 align:middle line:84%
See, the bird's death
is nothing to birds.

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:21.160 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing.

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:24.490 align:middle line:90%
They can get out real easy.

00:43:24.490 --> 00:43:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And that was the bird's way
of telling me thank you.

00:43:29.170 --> 00:43:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And it made this really powerful
connection with me also.

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:36.082 align:middle line:90%


00:43:36.082 --> 00:43:37.970 align:middle line:90%
But there are several.

00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:39.480 align:middle line:84%
There's the
red-tailed hawk also,

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:44.050 align:middle line:84%
which was-- and the
crow and the eagle.

00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:46.787 align:middle line:84%
They've all helped
me a lot in all.

00:43:46.787 --> 00:43:48.370 align:middle line:84%
But I've got to get
back to the story.

00:43:48.370 --> 00:43:52.060 align:middle line:90%


00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:56.360 align:middle line:84%
While we were there, I went
to this person's house.

00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And somehow-- I don't
remember the conversation--

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:04.000 align:middle line:84%
but the Emerald
Tablets were mentioned.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And I said to the person,
you know about them?

00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:09.390 align:middle line:90%
And he was kind of bragging.

00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:10.750 align:middle line:90%
He said, oh, yeah.

00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:11.610 align:middle line:90%
I know about them.

00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:17.150 align:middle line:84%
I even though the person who
released them to the world.

00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:18.980 align:middle line:90%
And I said, really?

00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:19.870 align:middle line:90%
And he says, yeah.

00:44:19.870 --> 00:44:22.912 align:middle line:84%
He says, would you
like to meet her?

00:44:22.912 --> 00:44:24.912 align:middle line:90%
And that was too much, you know?

00:44:24.912 --> 00:44:26.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:28.757 align:middle line:90%
And he says, let me call her up.

00:44:28.757 --> 00:44:30.632 align:middle line:84%
So he gets on the phone,
and he calls her up,

00:44:30.632 --> 00:44:32.510 align:middle line:90%
and her name is Angelique.

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:36.089 align:middle line:90%
And he says, can they come over?

00:44:36.089 --> 00:44:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And she says,
absolutely, right now.

00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:39.980 align:middle line:90%
Come right now, she says.

00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:42.300 align:middle line:90%
So I hung up the phone.

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:44.880 align:middle line:84%
We go get in his
brand new white Jeep,

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:51.080 align:middle line:84%
and we drive over to
this old Victorian house.

00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:54.552 align:middle line:84%
And we walk into this house, and
there's this huge living room.

00:44:54.552 --> 00:44:56.510 align:middle line:84%
You know how some of
these old Victorian houses

00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:58.830 align:middle line:90%
have these big old living rooms.

00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:02.355 align:middle line:84%
And it was a little dark,
and there was plants

00:45:02.355 --> 00:45:04.062 align:middle line:90%
all over the place.

00:45:04.062 --> 00:45:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And this woman was
sitting at the far end

00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:08.080 align:middle line:90%
of this room, way at the end.

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:11.020 align:middle line:84%
It's like 30 feet on the
other side of the room

00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:16.300 align:middle line:84%
over in this room in this chair
facing the door as we came in.

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And she was about maybe 35 or
36 or 37 or something like that.

00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And she motions for
us to come over.

00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:27.640 align:middle line:90%
So I'm walking over across.

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:31.760 align:middle line:84%
I get about halfway over
there, and scolds me.

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:35.070 align:middle line:84%
She goes, I've been waiting
for you for six months!

00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:37.040 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:38.340 align:middle line:90%
I go, but I just got here.

00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:41.240 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:44.070 align:middle line:90%
And so I just keep walking up.

00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And she's got a little
table sitting over here.

00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And sitting on the
table are three copies

00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:51.010 align:middle line:90%
of the Emerald Tablets.

00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And she reaches over and says,
here, and hands them to me.

00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And here I'm sitting
with three copies.

00:45:57.220 --> 00:46:01.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, that's just
what I need. [LAUGHING]

00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, you were
supposed to have been here

00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:05.470 align:middle line:90%
a long time ago.

00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I
just found out about you

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:10.540 align:middle line:90%
just a little while ago.

00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And there was an
angel that has led her

00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:18.446 align:middle line:84%
through all this who told
her six months earlier that I

00:46:18.446 --> 00:46:19.360 align:middle line:90%
was coming.

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:21.500 align:middle line:84%
I guess the angel
didn't say clearly when.

00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:22.300 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And she had been expecting
me all this time.

00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And she said that the
angel had told her

00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:30.640 align:middle line:84%
that I could ask
her any questions

00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:32.605 align:middle line:84%
that I wanted to know
about the Emerald Tablets

00:46:32.605 --> 00:46:34.140 align:middle line:90%
that she could answer.

00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:37.056 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked all these
questions, all kinds of things

00:46:37.056 --> 00:46:38.430 align:middle line:84%
that I wanted to
know about them.

00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And she just fired the
answers right away.

00:46:40.850 --> 00:46:44.041 align:middle line:84%
And she said this one--
one of my questions

00:46:44.041 --> 00:46:45.540 align:middle line:84%
toward the end of
the whole thing, I

00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:51.970 align:middle line:90%
said, how did you get these?

00:46:51.970 --> 00:46:54.086 align:middle line:90%
How did they come to you?

00:46:54.086 --> 00:46:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And she told me
this story, which

00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:06.220 align:middle line:84%
would make a great movie,
Indiana Jones type movie

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:09.310 align:middle line:84%
She said-- and I'm going
to not tell all the details

00:47:09.310 --> 00:47:11.880 align:middle line:84%
because I've got a lot to
go on this other story.

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:14.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go
pretty quick on it.

00:47:14.310 --> 00:47:17.340 align:middle line:84%
She said that there was this
couple, this married couple

00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:20.490 align:middle line:90%
from LA, went to the Yucatan.

00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And they were looking at the
temples and pyramids and things

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:28.040 align:middle line:90%
in the Yucatan.

00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And they got separated,
and the female

00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:36.140 align:middle line:90%
got lost in the Yucatan jungle.

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And the male made it back,
but the female didn't.

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:45.886 align:middle line:84%
And so she went walking through
this juggle all day long

00:47:45.886 --> 00:47:48.260 align:middle line:84%
and got lost and then happen
to spend the night there out

00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:51.400 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of nowhere
and went another whole day

00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:53.964 align:middle line:84%
and spent another night
and went another whole day.

00:47:53.964 --> 00:47:55.270 align:middle line:90%
It was three nights.

00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:57.000 align:middle line:84%
So it must have been
on the fourth day

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.050 align:middle line:84%
that she finally got up under
like this little hill, where

00:48:01.050 --> 00:48:03.320 align:middle line:90%
she could see around.

00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And as she did, she could
look down into this valley

00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:10.400 align:middle line:90%
and see this Mayan village.

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:14.400 align:middle line:84%
They made these kind of--
I don't know if it's Adobe

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:15.200 align:middle line:90%
or what that is.

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:18.140 align:middle line:90%


00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:19.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure what that is.

00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:21.960 align:middle line:84%
I've seen these
buildings myself.

00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:26.600 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, they have grass,
thatched roofs on them.

00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:29.900 align:middle line:84%
And there was a trail
that led down to it.

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:32.000 align:middle line:84%
She could see where the
trail led down to it.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And so she said, ah,
civilization, somebody, people.

00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And she started to
walk down there.

00:48:41.770 --> 00:48:43.020 align:middle line:90%
I think I have this right now.

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:45.640 align:middle line:84%
The first thing she did, she
stepped with her right foot.

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:48.146 align:middle line:90%


00:48:48.146 --> 00:48:49.312 align:middle line:90%
I think I'm correct in this.

00:48:49.312 --> 00:48:50.770 align:middle line:84%
She took her right
foot and started

00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:52.480 align:middle line:84%
to take a step to
go down the trail,

00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:55.300 align:middle line:84%
and a snake went
from left to right,

00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:56.720 align:middle line:90%
right underneath her foot.

00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And she obviously pulled
her foot right back.

00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And she started to
take another step,

00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:05.530 align:middle line:84%
and another snake
went from right

00:49:05.530 --> 00:49:09.400 align:middle line:84%
to left underneath her food,
and she pulled it back.

00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And she started to
take another step,

00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:14.050 align:middle line:84%
and another snake went
from left to right,

00:49:14.050 --> 00:49:15.480 align:middle line:90%
right underneath her foot.

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And she pulled it back, and
as she went back like this,

00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:22.672 align:middle line:84%
this huge butterfly
flapped in her face.

00:49:22.672 --> 00:49:24.882 align:middle line:84%
And I guess the combination
of these three snakes

00:49:24.882 --> 00:49:27.090 align:middle line:84%
and this butterfly freaked
her out, which is probably

00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:29.250 align:middle line:90%
would a few people.

00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And she just started
screaming and running down

00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:37.780 align:middle line:84%
this trail all the way down
into this village, running right

00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:40.350 align:middle line:84%
into the village, right
into the grass hut,

00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:45.380 align:middle line:84%
and right into the arms of
the chief of the village,

00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:46.941 align:middle line:90%
who happen to be standing there.

00:49:46.941 --> 00:49:52.130 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And there were some
older men sitting around

00:49:57.090 --> 00:50:00.140 align:middle line:90%
inside this darkened little hut.

00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And he looks at her and calms
her down and everything.

00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:03.675 align:middle line:90%
She was kind of hysterical.

00:50:03.675 --> 00:50:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And he calms her down,
and he says to her--

00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:09.130 align:middle line:90%
they spoke in Spanish.

00:50:09.130 --> 00:50:11.380 align:middle line:84%
It was the common
language that they had.

00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:17.070 align:middle line:90%
And says to her, what's wrong?

00:50:17.070 --> 00:50:19.060 align:middle line:90%
Why are you all excited?

00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:20.920 align:middle line:90%
What scared you?

00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And she starts describing
these three stakes

00:50:23.330 --> 00:50:27.780 align:middle line:84%
and this big butterfly up
there that freaked her out.

00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And when she described how they
went back this way and this way

00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:32.760 align:middle line:84%
and this way and all this
stuff and the butterfly that

00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:36.200 align:middle line:84%
went like that, all
the men stood up.

00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And they came and they
circled around her.

00:50:39.310 --> 00:50:41.470 align:middle line:84%
Because you see, when
the Emerald Tablets

00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:44.050 align:middle line:84%
were placed in the
hands of Mayan Indians

00:50:44.050 --> 00:50:53.690 align:middle line:84%
by Thoth a long, long,
long time ago-- no,

00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:56.590 align:middle line:90%
that's not exactly correct.

00:50:56.590 --> 00:50:58.180 align:middle line:84%
The Emerald Tablets
were brought there

00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:03.495 align:middle line:84%
by Thoth a long, long, long time
ago and given to this tribe.

00:51:03.495 --> 00:51:07.650 align:middle line:84%
Doreal in 1925, which was
part of the White Brotherhood,

00:51:07.650 --> 00:51:10.400 align:middle line:84%
was directed to go there
to interpret the Emerald

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:13.460 align:middle line:84%
Tablets so that someday
we would read them.

00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:15.600 align:middle line:84%
In his instructions, he
interpreted the Emerald

00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:16.560 align:middle line:90%
Tablets.

00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:19.450 align:middle line:84%
At that point, ten of them went
back to the Halls of Amenti

00:51:19.450 --> 00:51:21.280 align:middle line:90%
and two of them stayed there.

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And the interpretation,
once it was written down,

00:51:25.170 --> 00:51:32.930 align:middle line:84%
was then given to a very
young couple in New York City.

00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And they were told to keep
this copy of this book

00:51:40.090 --> 00:51:43.610 align:middle line:84%
and to never give it to anyone,
to never let anyone copy it,

00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:46.310 align:middle line:84%
to never let anyone
take photographs of it

00:51:46.310 --> 00:51:49.110 align:middle line:84%
or any kind of thing
like that and to keep it

00:51:49.110 --> 00:51:50.980 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of their life.

00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:53.070 align:middle line:90%
That was their instructions.

00:51:53.070 --> 00:51:58.590 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, Doreal gives to this
Indian tribe a piece of paper.

00:51:58.590 --> 00:52:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And on the piece of paper is
the address of this couple.

00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:07.094 align:middle line:84%
And then Doreal tells
them that someday there

00:52:07.094 --> 00:52:09.510 align:middle line:84%
would be this white woman that
would be known by the three

00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:12.340 align:middle line:90%
snakes and the butterfly.

00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And when they saw her,
they were to take her

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:19.190 align:middle line:84%
and to bring her to this cave,
which they did. [LAUGHING]

00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And to bring her in there,
and there was this ceremony

00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:25.340 align:middle line:84%
that she was to go through,
which would take 30 days.

00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And she had no food for
30 days, only water.

00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And whatever this ceremony
was and the whole experience

00:52:34.510 --> 00:52:36.360 align:middle line:84%
of being in the
jungle for four days

00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:38.820 align:middle line:84%
and the snakes and
the whole thing,

00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:42.200 align:middle line:84%
she wasn't quite the same
person after she got done.

00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And it awakened her to her
purpose, whatever that was,

00:52:47.730 --> 00:52:48.890 align:middle line:90%
real quickly.

00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And when they were
done with her,

00:52:52.330 --> 00:52:54.790 align:middle line:84%
they gave her this
little piece of paper

00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:59.480 align:middle line:84%
and told her to go there and get
this interpretation-- she knew

00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:02.890 align:middle line:84%
what it was by then-- to
get this interpretation

00:53:02.890 --> 00:53:05.980 align:middle line:84%
from these people in
any way that she could.

00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:09.160 align:middle line:84%
So they had the job of making
sure that no one got it,

00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:12.630 align:middle line:84%
and she had the job to make
sure that she got it away.

00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:15.880 align:middle line:84%
But they had been keeping
this since 1925 or '26 or '27

00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:17.130 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:53:17.130 --> 00:53:18.770 align:middle line:84%
They had had this
thing over there

00:53:18.770 --> 00:53:23.380 align:middle line:84%
all the way up
until about 1980--

00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:26.140 align:middle line:84%
I guess it was about
six years before that,

00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:29.620 align:middle line:84%
so we're talking about
1978 or something

00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:32.181 align:middle line:90%
like that when this took place.

00:53:32.181 --> 00:53:33.170 align:middle line:90%
It was a long time.

00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:35.130 align:middle line:84%
So these were probably
pretty old people

00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:36.400 align:middle line:90%
by the time she was there.

00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:39.200 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, she took a
little piece of paper,

00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:41.130 align:middle line:84%
and they told her
how to get out.

00:53:41.130 --> 00:53:43.178 align:middle line:90%
And she went back to LA.

00:53:43.178 --> 00:53:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And she broke the relationship
off with her husband.

00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:50.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
that was about.

00:53:50.070 --> 00:53:53.970 align:middle line:90%
And then she went to New York.

00:53:53.970 --> 00:53:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And when she got
to New York, she

00:53:57.030 --> 00:54:00.350 align:middle line:84%
went straight to the
address, and she was still,

00:54:00.350 --> 00:54:05.910 align:middle line:84%
as Angelique tried to describe
this, kind of jungle-fied,

00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:08.909 align:middle line:84%
not so clean and everything,
and went to this apartment.

00:54:08.909 --> 00:54:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And they just took one look
at her and slammed the door

00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:13.075 align:middle line:84%
and locked it, wouldn't
even let her in.

00:54:13.075 --> 00:54:13.875 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:13.875 --> 00:54:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And she went back out and
realized the situation.

00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:20.080 align:middle line:84%
So she went back to wherever
she was, and she cleaned up,

00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:23.975 align:middle line:84%
and she bought some clothes and
changed the whole appearance

00:54:23.975 --> 00:54:25.180 align:middle line:90%
and went back.

00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:27.865 align:middle line:84%
Those people did not even
know it was the same person,

00:54:27.865 --> 00:54:29.040 align:middle line:90%
didn't even have any idea.

00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:30.998 align:middle line:84%
They thought it was
somebody totally different.

00:54:30.998 --> 00:54:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And so she was so nice
looking, they let her in.

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:35.680 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And they start talking,
and she started

00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:40.850 align:middle line:84%
saying that she knew that
there was this interpretation

00:54:40.850 --> 00:54:43.230 align:middle line:90%
and if she could see it.

00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:44.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was OK
for them to see it.

00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:46.616 align:middle line:84%
It just could never
leave the apartment.

00:54:46.616 --> 00:54:49.140 align:middle line:90%
So they let her see this thing.

00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:51.411 align:middle line:84%
But she couldn't
copy it or photograph

00:54:51.411 --> 00:54:53.410 align:middle line:84%
it or anything, other
kinds of things like this.

00:54:53.410 --> 00:54:54.868 align:middle line:84%
So she was looking
at it and seeing

00:54:54.868 --> 00:54:56.380 align:middle line:90%
the whole thing like that.

00:54:56.380 --> 00:55:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And then she did something like
ask for some tea or something

00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:02.540 align:middle line:90%
else like that.

00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:06.142 align:middle line:84%
And when they got up,
anyway, the two of them,

00:55:06.142 --> 00:55:07.600 align:middle line:84%
she was sitting
there with the book

00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:10.614 align:middle line:84%
and the door was right
there, and they got away

00:55:10.614 --> 00:55:11.530 align:middle line:90%
from her a little bit.

00:55:11.530 --> 00:55:16.200 align:middle line:84%
She just picked the
book up and-- [POP] ran.

00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:18.110 align:middle line:90%
And that's how she got it.

00:55:18.110 --> 00:55:22.645 align:middle line:84%
And she got outside and then
was instructed somehow--

00:55:22.645 --> 00:55:25.815 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know what
her communication was,

00:55:25.815 --> 00:55:28.190 align:middle line:84%
whether it was still with the
are Mayans or higher level.

00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:29.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't know was it was.

00:55:29.570 --> 00:55:32.700 align:middle line:84%
She was instructed to
go to Globe, Arizona

00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:35.440 align:middle line:84%
and then directly to a
very specific address.

00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:38.596 align:middle line:84%
And she just went there
and gave it to Angelique.

00:55:38.596 --> 00:55:40.470 align:middle line:84%
Angelique knew in advance
that this woman was

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:44.440 align:middle line:84%
coming from her angel
and was waiting there

00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:46.840 align:middle line:90%
for her to give it to her.

00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:51.140 align:middle line:84%
And then the angels
for a long time

00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:54.010 align:middle line:84%
told Angelique who could have
it and who couldn't have it.

00:55:54.010 --> 00:55:56.450 align:middle line:84%
This is in the very,
very beginning stages.

00:55:56.450 --> 00:55:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And then at one
point, the Brotherhood

00:55:59.430 --> 00:56:03.720 align:middle line:84%
of the White Temple in Colorado
realized what had happened,

00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:08.482 align:middle line:84%
in some way-- I don't hoq--
and then they released it also

00:56:08.482 --> 00:56:13.430 align:middle line:84%
at [INAUDIBLE] So
this is the story.

00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:15.820 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, I got three copies.

00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And I went back and I
gave one to my sister

00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:21.597 align:middle line:84%
and I gave one to
Sananda and I kept one.

00:56:21.597 --> 00:56:29.260 align:middle line:90%
And so we're ready to go.

00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:31.461 align:middle line:90%
Everything's all ready.

00:56:31.461 --> 00:56:33.530 align:middle line:84%
I learned all my words
and figured out how

00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:35.210 align:middle line:90%
to do these thing things.

00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And I felt ready in my heart
to do this, whatever it was.

00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And everybody else felt
like they were ready.

00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:42.730 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't so sure of Jake.

00:56:42.730 --> 00:56:44.460 align:middle line:90%
But everybody else was ready.

00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:46.010 align:middle line:90%
But Jake ended up being fine.

00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:47.190 align:middle line:90%
He did OK.

00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:51.570 align:middle line:90%
And so we took off.

00:56:51.570 --> 00:56:54.770 align:middle line:84%
I'll never forget flying
right over the Great Pyramids

00:56:54.770 --> 00:56:58.210 align:middle line:84%
as we came in and landing
down on them, landing down

00:56:58.210 --> 00:56:59.580 align:middle line:90%
on the airport.

00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:02.630 align:middle line:84%
We were greeted by
Ahmed Fakhry, who

00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:05.326 align:middle line:84%
was the number one Egyptian
archaeologist in the world

00:57:05.326 --> 00:57:07.820 align:middle line:84%
and the number one
Egyptian archaeologist

00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:10.075 align:middle line:90%
of the Egyptian government.

00:57:10.075 --> 00:57:12.540 align:middle line:90%
He works for the government.

00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And he got that position
because of his father.

00:57:15.330 --> 00:57:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't have to
go through customs.

00:57:19.690 --> 00:57:24.280 align:middle line:84%
He just took us right past all
the lines, went up the thing,

00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:26.976 align:middle line:84%
took our books, he
said, stamp them.

00:57:26.976 --> 00:57:29.520 align:middle line:84%
They stamp them, he takes
us right straight out

00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:30.680 align:middle line:90%
and got in the taxicab.

00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:33.630 align:middle line:84%
Nobody even looked at
our bags or nothing.

00:57:33.630 --> 00:57:35.151 align:middle line:90%
We just got in there and left.

00:57:35.151 --> 00:57:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And he took us straight
home to his house.

00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And his house is an
apartment building

00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:45.000 align:middle line:90%
that is about six stories high.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:50.266 align:middle line:84%
And it's probably like
an apartment building.

00:57:50.266 --> 00:57:51.470 align:middle line:90%
And it's his house.

00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And it looks directly
into the Sphinx.

00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:55.290 align:middle line:84%
It's the closest
building looking straight

00:57:55.290 --> 00:57:56.960 align:middle line:90%
into the Sphinx.

00:57:56.960 --> 00:58:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And this was a real good
friend of my sister's.

00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:05.800 align:middle line:84%
That's why he was
the one that did it.

00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:08.120 align:middle line:84%
He was connected with the
ARE and so was my sister.

00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:09.645 align:middle line:84%
They became friends
at one point.

00:58:09.645 --> 00:58:12.240 align:middle line:90%


00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:17.290 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, he gave us a room
there and everything.

00:58:17.290 --> 00:58:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And-- oh, I gotta tell you one
thing about this guy's father.

00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:23.530 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of
important to know.

00:58:23.530 --> 00:58:26.930 align:middle line:84%
This is the kind of
information that Egypt will not

00:58:26.930 --> 00:58:28.680 align:middle line:90%
tell you about.

00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:33.570 align:middle line:84%
Egypt holds most of this
information very secret.

00:58:33.570 --> 00:58:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And when things happen,
you're not going to hear it.

00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:39.450 align:middle line:84%
I know so many things
that go on over there.

00:58:39.450 --> 00:58:41.611 align:middle line:90%


00:58:41.611 --> 00:58:44.110 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't believe some of
these things that are going on,

00:58:44.110 --> 00:58:45.485 align:middle line:84%
and yet they're
really happening,

00:58:45.485 --> 00:58:47.690 align:middle line:84%
and they're not
going to tell you.

00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:50.090 align:middle line:90%
But this truly happened.

00:58:50.090 --> 00:58:54.770 align:middle line:84%
There's absolutely no doubt
about what I'm about to say.

00:58:54.770 --> 00:59:00.690 align:middle line:84%
Ahmed's father, when he was
12 years old, he had a dream.

00:59:00.690 --> 00:59:03.500 align:middle line:84%
He had a dream that there
was a wooden boat that

00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:07.450 align:middle line:90%
was 120 feet long.

00:59:07.450 --> 00:59:10.365 align:middle line:84%
You know the boat, the celestial
boat that takes the Egyptians

00:59:10.365 --> 00:59:12.520 align:middle line:90%
from one world to the next?

00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:16.390 align:middle line:84%
There's this long boat, and then
it sat approximately 60 feet

00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:19.970 align:middle line:84%
off of the Western
side, I think it

00:59:19.970 --> 00:59:27.360 align:middle line:84%
was, of the Great Pyramid
and so many feet down.

00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:29.800 align:middle line:90%
He drew a picture of the boat.

00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And the boat was so authentic
in so many ways, including

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.155 align:middle line:84%
even all the hieroglyphics
and everything,

00:59:35.155 --> 00:59:36.980 align:middle line:84%
that the government
upon seeing this

00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:40.340 align:middle line:84%
decided that they would actually
check to see if there really

00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:41.330 align:middle line:90%
was something there.

00:59:41.330 --> 00:59:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And so they drilled this
hole, and sure enough,

00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:45.930 align:middle line:84%
there's really a
boat down there.

00:59:45.930 --> 00:59:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And they go down in there,
and they take the boat out.

00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:53.230 align:middle line:84%
The only thing is,
the boat is in pieces.

00:59:53.230 --> 00:59:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And so the Egyptian
government tries for two years

00:59:55.610 --> 00:59:59.200 align:middle line:84%
to put the boat together
and can't figure it out.

00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:02.910 align:middle line:84%
So now the kid is 14 years
old, and he has another dream.

01:00:02.910 --> 01:00:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And the dream is the
blueprint of exactly how

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:08.530 align:middle line:90%
to put the boat together.

01:00:08.530 --> 01:00:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And so with the
blueprint, the government

01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:12.480 align:middle line:84%
takes the blueprint
and the boat,

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:15.860 align:middle line:84%
and all the pieces fit together,
and this beautiful, 120-foot

01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:19.171 align:middle line:90%
long wooden boat appears.

01:00:19.171 --> 01:00:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Of course, wood won't
keep for very long,

01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:25.060 align:middle line:84%
so they had to build
this special room, which

01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:28.422 align:middle line:84%
now sits I think off the
southern face, I believe,

01:00:28.422 --> 01:00:29.710 align:middle line:90%
of the Great Pyramid.

01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:33.480 align:middle line:84%
There's this modernistic room
that's all glass and everything

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:35.970 align:middle line:84%
else like that with
this big boat in it

01:00:35.970 --> 01:00:37.150 align:middle line:90%
that sits there right now.

01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:39.701 align:middle line:90%
But that's how it got there.

01:00:39.701 --> 01:00:42.200 align:middle line:84%
He then told him that there's
another one on the other side.

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:43.010 align:middle line:90%
They drilled a hole.

01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:44.510 align:middle line:84%
Sure enough, there was
another one on the other side.

01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:45.265 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't
want to build one

01:00:45.265 --> 01:00:48.030 align:middle line:84%
of those big, fancy rooms again,
so they filled up the whole

01:00:48.030 --> 01:00:49.230 align:middle line:90%
and they just left it there.

01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:52.380 align:middle line:90%


01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:56.120 align:middle line:84%
At this point, this kid
had a lot of credibility

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:59.090 align:middle line:90%
with the Egyptian government.

01:00:59.090 --> 01:01:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And so when he
started telling them

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:03.590 align:middle line:84%
that there was an
underground city

01:01:03.590 --> 01:01:07.710 align:middle line:84%
out in the middle of the
desert, they listened to him.

01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And he took them to a place
that's now called Memphis.

01:01:10.610 --> 01:01:12.680 align:middle line:84%
At the time, there
was nothing there

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:15.270 align:middle line:84%
but a few little houses
scattered around.

01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And he said, there's a
vast, ancient city here

01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:19.860 align:middle line:90%
under the ground.

01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Let me show you where
some of the buildings are.

01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And he went to this
one spot, and he

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:29.304 align:middle line:84%
drew this detailed photograph
almost of this building.

01:01:29.304 --> 01:01:30.762 align:middle line:84%
And he would come
like this, and he

01:01:30.762 --> 01:01:32.310 align:middle line:90%
would draw a piece in the sand.

01:01:32.310 --> 01:01:37.160 align:middle line:84%
He says, this is the corner
of the building right

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.666 align:middle line:90%
where he drew the line.

01:01:38.666 --> 01:01:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And they would dig
down there, and that

01:01:40.290 --> 01:01:44.580 align:middle line:84%
would be exactly the
corner of that building.

01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And they would undo the
picture, and the thing

01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:50.330 align:middle line:90%
was exactly the same.

01:01:50.330 --> 01:01:52.610 align:middle line:90%
The guy was a good psychic, man.

01:01:52.610 --> 01:01:55.152 align:middle line:84%
And he would then say, there's
this thing running over there.

01:01:55.152 --> 01:01:56.984 align:middle line:84%
And they'd dig it up,
and it would be there.

01:01:56.984 --> 01:01:59.240 align:middle line:84%
They'd say, this is over
there, this building is here,

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:00.740 align:middle line:84%
and this is here,
and this is there.

01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:04.595 align:middle line:84%
And every time he was never
wrong on anything ever.

01:02:04.595 --> 01:02:07.350 align:middle line:90%
He was 100% perfect.

01:02:07.350 --> 01:02:08.850 align:middle line:90%
And he unfolded all of Memphis.

01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:11.640 align:middle line:90%
He was the one who did it.

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And so he began to tell them
all kinds of things about Egypt

01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:18.290 align:middle line:90%
all over the place.

01:02:18.290 --> 01:02:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And he knows where
everything is, things

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:24.580 align:middle line:90%
that we don't know about yet.

01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And he's told me certain
things that I know are there

01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:31.270 align:middle line:90%
and I can't talk about it.

01:02:31.270 --> 01:02:33.882 align:middle line:84%
But what you see above
ground is only part

01:02:33.882 --> 01:02:34.840 align:middle line:90%
of what's really there.

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:37.450 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot more there.

01:02:37.450 --> 01:02:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And just for another
example-- and these

01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:47.820 align:middle line:84%
are only ones that I
can really talk about,

01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:49.430 align:middle line:90%
but they're all documented.

01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:51.700 align:middle line:90%
This is all documented stuff.

01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:56.170 align:middle line:84%
The middle pyramid-- the
Great Pyramid they broke into.

01:02:56.170 --> 01:02:58.630 align:middle line:84%
They drilled into it
and they smashed it.

01:02:58.630 --> 01:03:00.270 align:middle line:90%
And that's how they got in.

01:03:00.270 --> 01:03:02.781 align:middle line:84%
But that's not how they got
into the middle pyramid.

01:03:02.781 --> 01:03:06.370 align:middle line:84%
The middle pyramid went to--
his name is Mohamed Fayed.

01:03:06.370 --> 01:03:09.610 align:middle line:84%
He's about 85 or 90
years old right now.

01:03:09.610 --> 01:03:12.595 align:middle line:84%
He sits around and plays
backgammon all the time

01:03:12.595 --> 01:03:15.696 align:middle line:84%
at this point and wears
these long Egyptian robes

01:03:15.696 --> 01:03:16.496 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

01:03:16.496 --> 01:03:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And they went to him,
and they said, Mohamed,

01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:22.970 align:middle line:84%
can we get into the
middle pyramid, please?

01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:30.680 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHING] And he finally
said, yes, I guess so.

01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And so he sat in
front of the north

01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:36.700 align:middle line:90%
face of the middle pyramid.

01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:40.880 align:middle line:84%
There are, again, about
2 and 1/2 million blocks

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:41.802 align:middle line:90%
in that pyramid.

01:03:41.802 --> 01:03:43.260 align:middle line:84%
The government said
that they would

01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:46.980 align:middle line:90%
remove one of them, just one.

01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:50.710 align:middle line:84%
So it had to be right on the
first guess, if it's a guess.

01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:52.316 align:middle line:84%
And so he sat
cross-legged in front

01:03:52.316 --> 01:03:56.280 align:middle line:84%
of the north face of this
pyramid for five hours

01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:59.065 align:middle line:90%
and then said, that one.

01:03:59.065 --> 01:04:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And they climbed
up about a third

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:03.890 align:middle line:84%
of the way up this pyramid
and pointed to this one

01:04:03.890 --> 01:04:07.750 align:middle line:84%
certain block, carefully
removed this one block,

01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:09.712 align:middle line:84%
and that was the
doorway into the tunnel.

01:04:09.712 --> 01:04:10.670 align:middle line:90%
That's how they got in.

01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:15.710 align:middle line:90%


01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:19.220 align:middle line:84%
So it was his son
that we were with.

01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:22.280 align:middle line:84%
This is why the ARE
likes him so much

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:24.760 align:middle line:84%
because he knows a
lot about his father.

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:26.900 align:middle line:84%
Him and his whole
family know what's

01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:29.520 align:middle line:90%
in Egypt and all that stuff.

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:40.115 align:middle line:84%
And so anyway, I get in there,
and Ahmed says to my sister,

01:04:40.115 --> 01:04:41.370 align:middle line:90%
well, what do you want to do?

01:04:41.370 --> 01:04:42.369 align:middle line:90%
Where do you want to go?

01:04:42.369 --> 01:04:44.935 align:middle line:84%
He would you take her anywhere,
whatever she wanted to do.

01:04:44.935 --> 01:04:46.060 align:middle line:90%
He can get her in anywhere.

01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And he says, whatever
you want to do.

01:04:48.250 --> 01:04:53.024 align:middle line:84%
And she says, well, whatever--
my name was Akbar then.

01:04:53.024 --> 01:04:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And she says, well
whenever Akbar wants to do.

01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:57.730 align:middle line:84%
I was involved in Sufi
work for many, many years,

01:04:57.730 --> 01:05:00.115 align:middle line:90%
about 11 years.

01:05:00.115 --> 01:05:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And so he says, OK, well,
what do you want to do?

01:05:04.450 --> 01:05:07.982 align:middle line:84%
And so I hand him the itinerary
that I had written down of all

01:05:07.982 --> 01:05:09.190 align:middle line:90%
the places that I need to go.

01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:11.175 align:middle line:90%
And he [INAUDIBLE] like this.

01:05:11.175 --> 01:05:13.825 align:middle line:84%
This would have been
on January-- we came in

01:05:13.825 --> 01:05:16.920 align:middle line:90%
on January 10, I think it was.

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:26.275 align:middle line:84%
So this would have been on
the evening of January 10.

01:05:26.275 --> 01:05:28.740 align:middle line:90%
This is when we first arrived.

01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:31.520 align:middle line:90%
And so I have him the thing.

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:33.613 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, this
is what I'd like to.

01:05:33.613 --> 01:05:34.587 align:middle line:90%
And he says, OK.

01:05:34.587 --> 01:05:35.920 align:middle line:90%
And he looks at the whole thing.

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:37.294 align:middle line:84%
He thinks about
for a little bit.

01:05:37.294 --> 01:05:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And he comes back and he
goes, this is not very good.

01:05:42.030 --> 01:05:44.690 align:middle line:90%
This won't work real well.

01:05:44.690 --> 01:05:48.650 align:middle line:84%
He says, you're only going
to be here for nine days

01:05:48.650 --> 01:05:52.830 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is,
which isn't very long.

01:05:52.830 --> 01:05:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, he's
being really nice.

01:05:55.330 --> 01:05:57.420 align:middle line:84%
He's trying to convince
me to do something

01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:00.650 align:middle line:90%
else other than that itinerary.

01:06:00.650 --> 01:06:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And he says that
we couldn't leave

01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:05.240 align:middle line:84%
for-- if you want
to start in Luxor,

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:08.200 align:middle line:84%
we couldn't leave in Luxor
until tomorrow evening

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:10.850 align:middle line:84%
because the train doesn't
leave until 6 o'clock.

01:06:10.850 --> 01:06:13.942 align:middle line:84%
There's a French train
that goes down there--

01:06:13.942 --> 01:06:18.880 align:middle line:84%
and it's a French-made
train-- at 6 o'clock.

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:22.645 align:middle line:84%
And it's the only way to
get down there right now.

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And so that we don't just
sit around all day long,

01:06:25.470 --> 01:06:29.235 align:middle line:84%
he says, why don't we go to
the Sphynx tomorrow morning.

01:06:29.235 --> 01:06:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'll take you
to Saqqara, and we

01:06:31.110 --> 01:06:33.530 align:middle line:84%
can go to the Great Pyramid
and all these things

01:06:33.530 --> 01:06:35.020 align:middle line:90%
because it's right here.

01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And then tomorrow at 6 o'clock,
we'll go down to Luxor.

01:06:37.770 --> 01:06:40.650 align:middle line:90%


01:06:40.650 --> 01:06:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that if I did that,
I might as well go home, right?

01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I tried to convince him
that I didn't want to do this,

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:52.400 align:middle line:84%
that I really wanted to
start exactly by that thing.

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:54.420 align:middle line:90%
But he wouldn't listen.

01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:55.980 align:middle line:90%
He just says, no, no, no.

01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:57.120 align:middle line:90%
This is much better.

01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:58.640 align:middle line:90%
Just listen to me.

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:01.150 align:middle line:84%
I know what I'm
doing. [LAUGHING]

01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:03.350 align:middle line:84%
And he just kept pushing
it and kept pushing it.

01:07:03.350 --> 01:07:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And then I mean, we only
went around and around

01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:08.190 align:middle line:84%
for about 10 minutes,
and I realized

01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:11.450 align:middle line:84%
he wasn't going to give up
easy, that was for sure.

01:07:11.450 --> 01:07:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And though I've been involved
in Sufi work for a long time,

01:07:15.810 --> 01:07:19.230 align:middle line:84%
my inner belief is much more
closely associated with Taoism

01:07:19.230 --> 01:07:21.170 align:middle line:90%
than anything else.

01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And I did not believe
that force should

01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:28.190 align:middle line:84%
be necessary for
something of this nature.

01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:31.189 align:middle line:84%
And so I surrendered
to it and I said OK.

01:07:31.189 --> 01:07:32.730 align:middle line:84%
Because if it was
supposed to happen,

01:07:32.730 --> 01:07:36.630 align:middle line:84%
it would happen without me
having to get the guy down

01:07:36.630 --> 01:07:39.287 align:middle line:84%
on the ground, saying, no, we're
gonna go to Luxor, you know?

01:07:39.287 --> 01:07:41.722 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:41.722 --> 01:07:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, OK,
we'll go there tomorrow.

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And so he wanted
to go there I think

01:07:52.530 --> 01:07:55.190 align:middle line:84%
it was 7:00 or 7:30 or something
like that in the morning

01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:56.840 align:middle line:90%
the next morning.

01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:59.150 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to take us
straight-- he knew that we

01:07:59.150 --> 01:08:00.980 align:middle line:90%
wanted to go into this tunnel.

01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:02.487 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I'll
get you in there.

01:08:02.487 --> 01:08:04.570 align:middle line:84%
We'll take you there first
thing tomorrow morning.

01:08:04.570 --> 01:08:07.360 align:middle line:84%
You can do that first, which is
supposed to be the last thing.

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:09.990 align:middle line:84%
You do that first,
and then we'll

01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:12.280 align:middle line:90%
do some of these other things.

01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And he went in there that
evening and got a document.

01:08:15.110 --> 01:08:17.220 align:middle line:84%
He had to get some
kind of document

01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:19.050 align:middle line:84%
to get in there
because it's illegal.

01:08:19.050 --> 01:08:20.883 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most people you
just pay-- in Egypt,

01:08:20.883 --> 01:08:23.319 align:middle line:84%
you just pay people off, and
they just look the other way.

01:08:23.319 --> 01:08:26.050 align:middle line:84%
But he couldn't do
that because of who

01:08:26.050 --> 01:08:29.172 align:middle line:90%
he was in the government.

01:08:29.172 --> 01:08:31.630 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, he just
got this little document that

01:08:31.630 --> 01:08:33.740 align:middle line:90%
said that we could go in there.

01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And so the next morning at
7:00 or 7:30, we're all ready.

01:08:42.110 --> 01:08:44.069 align:middle line:84%
I have my little backpack
with a little coat

01:08:44.069 --> 01:08:45.485 align:middle line:84%
because it's cold
in these places.

01:08:45.485 --> 01:08:49.729 align:middle line:84%
It stays 56 degrees year
in, year out, no matter

01:08:49.729 --> 01:08:51.510 align:middle line:90%
what's going on outside.

01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:53.779 align:middle line:90%
It's cool in those things.

01:08:53.779 --> 01:08:56.669 align:middle line:90%
And I had a lite bit of water.

01:08:56.669 --> 01:08:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And Thoth didn't want
me to use flashlights

01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:00.000 align:middle line:90%
once I got in there.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.479 align:middle line:84%
So I had a candle with me
and these kinds of things.

01:09:02.479 --> 01:09:04.795 align:middle line:84%
And I had my little words
to say all the stuff

01:09:04.795 --> 01:09:06.920 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't know what
good they were going to do,

01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:09.790 align:middle line:84%
if I was going to
start out first.

01:09:09.790 --> 01:09:14.960 align:middle line:84%
And I had everything I needed,
but I was thinking, oh, boy.

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:17.960 align:middle line:90%
And so he says, you ready?

01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:20.319 align:middle line:84%
And he opens the door,
Katrina walks out

01:09:20.319 --> 01:09:21.850 align:middle line:84%
and Sananda and my
sister and Jake.

01:09:21.850 --> 01:09:24.658 align:middle line:84%
And he's begging
for me to come out.

01:09:24.658 --> 01:09:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And you guys who have seen
that other video probably

01:09:27.850 --> 01:09:32.120 align:middle line:84%
think that all I do is get sick
when I go around the world,

01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:35.689 align:middle line:84%
but these were
the only two times

01:09:35.689 --> 01:09:37.736 align:middle line:84%
that I ever travel that
I ever have done this.

01:09:37.736 --> 01:09:38.819 align:middle line:90%
It's always been in Egypt.

01:09:38.819 --> 01:09:40.527 align:middle line:84%
That's why I never
want to go back there.

01:09:40.527 --> 01:09:43.210 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:43.210 --> 01:09:45.689 align:middle line:84%
But what happened to me is
I started to take a step,

01:09:45.689 --> 01:09:47.870 align:middle line:84%
and this wave of
energy came over me.

01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:51.330 align:middle line:84%
I was totally healthy,
totally normal.

01:09:51.330 --> 01:09:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And I started to take
a step, and this wave

01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:57.200 align:middle line:90%
came over me, like real weird.

01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:59.442 align:middle line:84%
And t started to go again,
another one and then

01:09:59.442 --> 01:10:01.100 align:middle line:90%
another one and another one.

01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:04.670 align:middle line:84%
It just went, wham
and then wham and wham

01:10:04.670 --> 01:10:07.965 align:middle line:90%
and then wham, wham, wham, wham.

01:10:07.965 --> 01:10:11.580 align:middle line:84%
In just minutes, like
two minutes or less.

01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:13.810 align:middle line:90%
I was on the ground dying.

01:10:13.810 --> 01:10:17.070 align:middle line:90%
And I was just dying.

01:10:17.070 --> 01:10:18.120 align:middle line:90%
So I was dying.

01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:19.630 align:middle line:84%
I was starting to
go unconscious.

01:10:19.630 --> 01:10:20.940 align:middle line:90%
I was throwing up, everything.

01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:23.645 align:middle line:84%
I was just like
totally losing it.

01:10:23.645 --> 01:10:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And they came in
there to get me,

01:10:26.970 --> 01:10:31.385 align:middle line:84%
and they have to carry me
into my bedroom where I was.

01:10:31.385 --> 01:10:35.632 align:middle line:84%
And I remember I just
barely crawled in.

01:10:35.632 --> 01:10:38.970 align:middle line:84%
I just barely made it into
the toilet to throw up again.

01:10:38.970 --> 01:10:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And then I almost started
getting paralyzed.

01:10:43.930 --> 01:10:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And they laid me down on the
bed, and I got to the place

01:10:46.290 --> 01:10:50.840 align:middle line:84%
where after a while I
could barely open my eyes.

01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:53.244 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't move my
fingers or anything.

01:10:53.244 --> 01:10:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And I was getting weaker
and weaker and weaker.

01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And I was going,
this is serious.

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:03.985 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:11:03.985 --> 01:11:05.590 align:middle line:90%
I've got a problem here.

01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:08.040 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And so I decided
that I was going

01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:15.220 align:middle line:84%
to try to do the
meditation, which I knew--

01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:17.390 align:middle line:84%
my feeling was if I could
just get this flow going,

01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:19.100 align:middle line:90%
I'll be fine.

01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And that was when I realized,
too late, of course,

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:27.330 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't know how to do the
meditation laying on my side.

01:11:27.330 --> 01:11:31.190 align:middle line:84%
I'd always done it in
this perfect position.

01:11:31.190 --> 01:11:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't make my fingers
do the mudras or anything else

01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:35.160 align:middle line:90%
like that.

01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And I tried for a
little while, and I just

01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:38.270 align:middle line:90%
couldn't get the flow going.

01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:40.576 align:middle line:90%
Nothing could seem to happen.

01:11:40.576 --> 01:11:41.950 align:middle line:84%
Then I just got
sicker and sicker

01:11:41.950 --> 01:11:44.320 align:middle line:84%
until finally I just-- I
think I went out for a while.

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:46.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how long it was.

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:52.618 align:middle line:84%
But about something like 3
o'clock in the afternoon or so

01:11:52.618 --> 01:11:56.560 align:middle line:84%
or something like that,
I kind of came back in.

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And I realized I
really needed help.

01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I got
Katrina and Sananda.

01:12:00.510 --> 01:12:02.567 align:middle line:84%
I could still kind
of talk sort of.

01:12:02.567 --> 01:12:03.400 align:middle line:90%
And I them in there.

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you
guys gotta help me.

01:12:06.150 --> 01:12:08.630 align:middle line:90%
You gotta get me sat up.

01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, what do
you want to get sat up for?

01:12:11.170 --> 01:12:14.020 align:middle line:90%
Just sit me up, will you?

01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And got me up in
position, put my hands

01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:20.344 align:middle line:84%
over here and everything
else like that,

01:12:20.344 --> 01:12:24.730 align:middle line:84%
and I get oriented to the
fields and everything like that.

01:12:24.730 --> 01:12:28.435 align:middle line:84%
And I begin doing the breathing,
very, very weakly at first

01:12:28.435 --> 01:12:30.610 align:middle line:84%
and then started getting
stronger and stronger

01:12:30.610 --> 01:12:32.776 align:middle line:90%
until I get the flows going.

01:12:32.776 --> 01:12:35.569 align:middle line:84%
And after a little while, I was
OK and I could start doing it

01:12:35.569 --> 01:12:37.110 align:middle line:84%
and I started getting
stronger, and I

01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:39.050 align:middle line:84%
started getting the flow
stronger and stronger

01:12:39.050 --> 01:12:40.428 align:middle line:90%
through me.

01:12:40.428 --> 01:12:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And within 45 minutes
or so like that,

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:46.700 align:middle line:90%
I was walking around the room.

01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:49.270 align:middle line:90%
And I was still a little dizzy.

01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:52.410 align:middle line:84%
Why, within an hour
or so afterwards, I

01:12:52.410 --> 01:12:55.246 align:middle line:90%
was feeling pretty good.

01:12:55.246 --> 01:12:59.150 align:middle line:84%
I felt like-- you
ever had the flu

01:12:59.150 --> 01:13:01.390 align:middle line:84%
and then when you're
over it, you kind of feel

01:13:01.390 --> 01:13:03.287 align:middle line:90%
like you're not quite here yet.

01:13:03.287 --> 01:13:05.370 align:middle line:84%
There was a part of me
that it wasn't quite there,

01:13:05.370 --> 01:13:07.690 align:middle line:90%
but I was pretty good.

01:13:07.690 --> 01:13:11.590 align:middle line:90%
And Ahmed walks in.

01:13:11.590 --> 01:13:14.610 align:middle line:84%
This was maybe 4:30 or
something when he walks in.

01:13:14.610 --> 01:13:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And he comes in
and he looks at me.

01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:16.740 align:middle line:90%
He'd been gone.

01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:17.906 align:middle line:90%
He comes in and looks at me.

01:13:17.906 --> 01:13:19.320 align:middle line:90%
He goes, oh, you're better.

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:21.480 align:middle line:84%
He says, oh, you're
looking pretty good.

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:23.513 align:middle line:90%
And I go, well, I'm feeling OK.

01:13:23.513 --> 01:13:25.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm feeling OK now.

01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:27.940 align:middle line:84%
He looks at his watch
and he looks at me.

01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:31.192 align:middle line:84%
He goes, do you
think you can travel?

01:13:31.192 --> 01:13:34.470 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, travel?

01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:36.620 align:middle line:84%
I said, yeah, I guess I
can travel if I have to.

01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:45.300 align:middle line:84%
He says, well, the French train
leaves in an hour and a half,

01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:47.880 align:middle line:84%
and if you want, we can go back
and do this itinerary, what

01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:49.640 align:middle line:90%
you wanted to do.

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:51.520 align:middle line:84%
He says, it leaves in
an hour and a half.

01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:53.516 align:middle line:84%
I guess if you can
get on that train,

01:13:53.516 --> 01:13:55.390 align:middle line:84%
you can go to sleep once
you're on the train.

01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:57.770 align:middle line:90%
It's a long way down there.

01:13:57.770 --> 01:14:01.356 align:middle line:84%
And so we got on that train
and started heading for Luxor.

01:14:01.356 --> 01:14:03.855 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm heading down on that
train, I'm saying to myself,

01:14:03.855 --> 01:14:08.660 align:middle line:84%
did I make myself sick
just so this would happen?

01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:10.850 align:middle line:84%
And then I was really
wondering if it was me

01:14:10.850 --> 01:14:12.550 align:middle line:90%
or if it was Thoth.

01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And those were the thoughts
that were going through my mind.

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:17.595 align:middle line:84%
But by the time I got to
Luxor, I was pretty good.

01:14:17.595 --> 01:14:20.010 align:middle line:90%
I was pretty fine.

01:14:20.010 --> 01:14:21.600 align:middle line:90%
And it all began.

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And we started moving through
all the different temples, one

01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:27.950 align:middle line:84%
after another, exactly,
saying all the words.

01:14:27.950 --> 01:14:32.085 align:middle line:84%
Everything was just click,
click, click, click.

01:14:32.085 --> 01:14:35.225 align:middle line:84%
And it was just amazing that
everything we wanted to do,

01:14:35.225 --> 01:14:38.180 align:middle line:84%
it was just open and
we would be there.

01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And finally we went through
all the various steps,

01:14:41.470 --> 01:14:44.030 align:middle line:90%
just like it perfectly.

01:14:44.030 --> 01:14:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And as it turned out,
on January 18, which

01:14:48.510 --> 01:14:54.600 align:middle line:84%
happened to be my birthday,
of this body anyway,

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:56.940 align:middle line:84%
was the day that we went
into the Great Pyramid

01:14:56.940 --> 01:14:57.740 align:middle line:90%
to be initiated.

01:14:57.740 --> 01:14:58.645 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't planned.

01:14:58.645 --> 01:15:01.690 align:middle line:84%
It just-- that's
the way it happened.

01:15:01.690 --> 01:15:05.695 align:middle line:84%
And so early in the
morning, again, we

01:15:05.695 --> 01:15:07.820 align:middle line:84%
got our little packs ready
and all this other stuff

01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:09.280 align:middle line:90%
all over again.

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:12.800 align:middle line:90%
And we went to the pyramid.

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And he stopped the
flow of the people that

01:15:15.810 --> 01:15:17.720 align:middle line:84%
were kind of-- he made
them stop, and he you

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:19.795 align:middle line:84%
put two guides, one way
and one way the other way

01:15:19.795 --> 01:15:21.050 align:middle line:90%
and made them stop.

01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:23.500 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want anybody to
see that I was going down

01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:24.300 align:middle line:90%
in that room.

01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:27.030 align:middle line:90%


01:15:27.030 --> 01:15:31.150 align:middle line:84%
18,000 people a day walk
to the Great Pyramid.

01:15:31.150 --> 01:15:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And so they stopped the
flow of ants on either side

01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:37.270 align:middle line:90%
and opened the gates.

01:15:37.270 --> 01:15:40.150 align:middle line:84%
He said he wanted us to
synchronize our watches.

01:15:40.150 --> 01:15:43.890 align:middle line:84%
He says, you have
one hour and a half.

01:15:43.890 --> 01:15:46.740 align:middle line:84%
We will open the gate in an
hour and a half for 60 seconds.

01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:47.990 align:middle line:90%
You better be here.

01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:52.086 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING] Yes, sir.

01:15:52.086 --> 01:15:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Then we put our little alarms on
and everything else like that,

01:15:54.710 --> 01:15:59.354 align:middle line:84%
and he closes the
gate, locks them up.

01:15:59.354 --> 01:16:01.020 align:middle line:84%
He wanted us to get
down out of the way.

01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:03.519 align:middle line:84%
And we got down out of the way
so no one could see anything,

01:16:03.519 --> 01:16:05.016 align:middle line:90%
started the flow again.

01:16:05.016 --> 01:16:06.010 align:middle line:90%
And he left.

01:16:06.010 --> 01:16:08.270 align:middle line:84%
He wouldn't go down
in there with us.

01:16:08.270 --> 01:16:10.240 align:middle line:90%
He says, you're crazy.

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:11.240 align:middle line:90%
He says , no way.

01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:13.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going in
there for anything.

01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And we were then confronted
with the sloping tunnel.

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:24.480 align:middle line:84%
The tunnel slopes at
23 and 1/2 degrees,

01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:27.000 align:middle line:84%
which happens to be the
angle the Earth is sloped at,

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.270 align:middle line:90%
of course.

01:16:28.270 --> 01:16:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And we had to move at this 23
and 1/2 degree sloped tunnel,

01:16:32.910 --> 01:16:38.050 align:middle line:84%
which is a square tunnel about
this wide and about that high.

01:16:38.050 --> 01:16:41.000 align:middle line:84%
It's about like that at an
angle, 23 and 1/2 degrees,

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.550 align:middle line:90%
which is pretty sharp.

01:16:43.550 --> 01:16:47.950 align:middle line:90%
It's like that's 45 degrees.

01:16:47.950 --> 01:16:50.880 align:middle line:90%
So it's about like that.

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:54.521 align:middle line:84%
The only thing is, is the angle
is just such that-- I mean,

01:16:54.521 --> 01:16:56.020 align:middle line:84%
we sat there for
five minutes trying

01:16:56.020 --> 01:16:58.650 align:middle line:84%
to figure out how we were
going to get down this tunnel.

01:16:58.650 --> 01:17:01.840 align:middle line:84%
Has anybody been
down that tunnel?

01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:03.310 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

01:17:03.310 --> 01:17:04.320 align:middle line:90%
>>You went into the pit?

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:05.120 align:middle line:90%
But no one?

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.050 align:middle line:84%
You've been
[INAUDIBLE], you have?

01:17:07.050 --> 01:17:10.045 align:middle line:84%
How did you get down the tunnel?
[LAUGHING] Did you just crawl?

01:17:10.045 --> 01:17:11.130 align:middle line:90%
Or what did you do?

01:17:11.130 --> 01:17:11.930 align:middle line:90%
Slide?

01:17:11.930 --> 01:17:12.800 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:13.600 align:middle line:90%
>>You crawled.

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:15.944 align:middle line:90%


01:17:15.944 --> 01:17:17.360 align:middle line:84%
I though we were
going to crack up

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:19.151 align:middle line:84%
laughing because we
couldn't figure it out.

01:17:19.151 --> 01:17:22.600 align:middle line:84%
It was like-- because
you can't walk

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:25.540 align:middle line:84%
and sliding-- it's
300-- I forgot

01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:28.190 align:middle line:84%
how-- I think it's 300 feet
down here or something.

01:17:28.190 --> 01:17:30.300 align:middle line:90%
It's like a long ways.

01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And Sonanda suggested
rolling down.

01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:38.020 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:39.880 align:middle line:90%
He would.

01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And we finally had to
take our backpacks off.

01:17:42.510 --> 01:17:44.027 align:middle line:90%
We walked like a duck.

01:17:44.027 --> 01:17:45.360 align:middle line:90%
That was what we ended up doing.

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.043 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you, when
I got out of there,

01:17:47.043 --> 01:17:48.001 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't hardly walk.

01:17:48.001 --> 01:17:50.940 align:middle line:84%
I used muscles I
didn't even know I had.

01:17:50.940 --> 01:17:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And so we walked like a
duck and went down there.

01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And I was the last one
going down this whole thing.

01:17:56.680 --> 01:17:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And I was so intrigued
with this whole thing

01:17:59.010 --> 01:18:01.150 align:middle line:84%
that I had completely
forgotten everything.

01:18:01.150 --> 01:18:05.280 align:middle line:84%
I was just like this,
just looking around.

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't even thinking
about why I was going down there

01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:09.590 align:middle line:90%
or nothing.

01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:11.510 align:middle line:84%
I was just so intrigued
with this whole thing.

01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:12.930 align:middle line:90%
And I start walking down there.

01:18:12.930 --> 01:18:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And we went down there, I
don't know, a certain distance.

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:17.900 align:middle line:84%
I really don't know
when this began.

01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:19.360 align:middle line:90%
We got down a certain distance.

01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
I felt a very

01:18:24.010 --> 01:18:28.650 align:middle line:84%
definite vibrational
change in the room.

01:18:28.650 --> 01:18:32.120 align:middle line:84%
It was a weird, very
strange sensation.

01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:36.340 align:middle line:84%
There's a vibration that moves
through the Great Pyramid.

01:18:36.340 --> 01:18:44.050 align:middle line:84%
It's a vibration that is so
strong that it's almost--

01:18:44.050 --> 01:18:45.560 align:middle line:90%
you can almost hear it.

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:47.610 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you can hear it.

01:18:47.610 --> 01:18:48.660 align:middle line:90%
And it's a sound.

01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:51.570 align:middle line:84%
Like when you touch
the stone or anything.

01:18:51.570 --> 01:18:53.686 align:middle line:90%
The sound is this.

01:18:53.686 --> 01:18:54.658 align:middle line:90%
It's a--

01:18:54.658 --> 01:18:59.518 align:middle line:90%


01:18:59.518 --> 01:19:08.986 align:middle line:90%
[IMITATES VIBRATION]

01:19:08.986 --> 01:19:10.360 align:middle line:84%
It just keeps
going on like that.

01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:11.410 align:middle line:90%
It's not like ohm.

01:19:11.410 --> 01:19:13.820 align:middle line:84%
It's like a very
stones are vibrating.

01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:15.400 align:middle line:90%
It just never seems to quit.

01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:18.840 align:middle line:90%


01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:23.150 align:middle line:84%
However, when I
was going down it,

01:19:23.150 --> 01:19:25.100 align:middle line:84%
the vibration at this
one point suddenly

01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:30.740 align:middle line:84%
went from [IMITATES VIBRATION]
to [IMITATES VIBRATION],

01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:34.060 align:middle line:84%
like dropped an
octave just like that.

01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:35.824 align:middle line:90%
And it made me stop.

01:19:35.824 --> 01:19:39.186 align:middle line:90%
And I had a shiver up my spine.

01:19:39.186 --> 01:19:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And I got goosebumps all
over, which I just did.

01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:46.390 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:49.760 align:middle line:90%
And I looked around.

01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:50.640 align:middle line:90%
I stopped.

01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:51.440 align:middle line:90%
I just stopped.

01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:53.320 align:middle line:90%
I didn't go one inch further.

01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:54.600 align:middle line:90%
And I looked around.

01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And over on both sides of
right where I was sitting

01:19:58.110 --> 01:20:12.960 align:middle line:84%
were these two red squares that
were embossed into the stone

01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:15.280 align:middle line:90%
or set into the stone.

01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:17.218 align:middle line:84%
They were made out of
some kind of stone.

01:20:17.218 --> 01:20:20.850 align:middle line:90%


01:20:20.850 --> 01:20:23.300 align:middle line:90%
They were about that size.

01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:26.020 align:middle line:84%
They were with
little opening inside

01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:27.230 align:middle line:90%
and a little thing like that.

01:20:27.230 --> 01:20:30.280 align:middle line:84%
And there was one
on the other side.

01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:36.520 align:middle line:90%
And I felt fear.

01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:38.280 align:middle line:84%
I suddenly felt
afraid to go further.

01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:42.125 align:middle line:84%
And I never-- nothing,
nothing bothers me usually,

01:20:42.125 --> 01:20:43.970 align:middle line:90%
I mean, really just nothing.

01:20:43.970 --> 01:20:46.230 align:middle line:90%
I've done things that are crazy.

01:20:46.230 --> 01:20:50.576 align:middle line:84%
And here I'm suddenly feeling
fear to go into a tunnel.

01:20:50.576 --> 01:20:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And I started
walking down further.

01:20:54.310 --> 01:20:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And I go down about
another 20, 30 feet.

01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:59.820 align:middle line:84%
The sound was
[IMITATES VIBRATION]

01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:00.620 align:middle line:90%
down lower.

01:21:00.620 --> 01:21:02.786 align:middle line:84%
And I look over, and here's
two more of these things

01:21:02.786 --> 01:21:04.260 align:middle line:90%
on either side of me.

01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And there's spaced at certain
distances going all the way

01:21:06.810 --> 01:21:08.680 align:middle line:90%
down here.

01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And I completely, totally
forget anything that he told me

01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:20.570 align:middle line:84%
and all the training that
he gave me about fear.

01:21:20.570 --> 01:21:22.495 align:middle line:84%
He might as well not
even have done it.

01:21:22.495 --> 01:21:23.295 align:middle line:90%
I didn't remember.

01:21:23.295 --> 01:21:24.625 align:middle line:84%
I didn't remember
about the rings.

01:21:24.625 --> 01:21:26.700 align:middle line:84%
I didn't remember checking
to see if it's paranoia

01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:28.324 align:middle line:84%
or what's going on,
anything like that.

01:21:28.324 --> 01:21:29.520 align:middle line:90%
I just felt this fear.

01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And every time I go
through these rings,

01:21:31.190 --> 01:21:33.810 align:middle line:90%
I kept feeling more fear.

01:21:33.810 --> 01:21:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And so about the second or third
ring, which were only maybe

01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:42.070 align:middle line:84%
a quarter of the way
down this whole thing,

01:21:42.070 --> 01:21:46.490 align:middle line:84%
I start this conversation that
starts going off in my head.

01:21:46.490 --> 01:21:48.030 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm not afraid of anything.

01:21:48.030 --> 01:21:49.304 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:21:49.304 --> 01:21:50.470 align:middle line:90%
You're not afraid, Drunvalo.

01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:52.220 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And my head sort of
became polarized.

01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:56.740 align:middle line:90%
And there's those little voices.

01:21:56.740 --> 01:21:58.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying, you're not
afraid of anything.

01:21:58.530 --> 01:22:01.547 align:middle line:84%
And this other little voice
says, oh, yes, you are.

01:22:01.547 --> 01:22:03.495 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:22:03.495 --> 01:22:06.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm going-- no, I'm not.

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:08.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you are.

01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:12.162 align:middle line:84%
And I go, well,
what am I afraid of?

01:22:12.162 --> 01:22:15.308 align:middle line:84%
And this things says,
you're afraid of spiders.

01:22:15.308 --> 01:22:18.428 align:middle line:90%
And I go, yeah, a little bit.

01:22:18.428 --> 01:22:20.670 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:22:20.670 --> 01:22:23.927 align:middle line:84%
And then it says, what
about poisonous snakes?

01:22:23.927 --> 01:22:25.882 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going, yeah.

01:22:25.882 --> 01:22:26.682 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

01:22:26.682 --> 01:22:30.056 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:22:30.056 --> 01:22:31.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's one.

01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:33.920 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:36.780 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't believe it.

01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:41.500 align:middle line:84%
It was like it's so
unlike me to do this.

01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:43.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going through
this whole thing

01:22:43.180 --> 01:22:44.440 align:middle line:90%
with myself going down there.

01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:46.023 align:middle line:84%
And the sound is
[IMITATES VIBRATION],

01:22:46.023 --> 01:22:47.650 align:middle line:90%
lower and lower and lower.

01:22:47.650 --> 01:22:48.380 align:middle line:84%
I got down to the
bottom of this thing,

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:50.238 align:middle line:84%
and I was just a
bundle of nerves, man.

01:22:50.238 --> 01:22:53.211 align:middle line:84%
I was just like-- I
was looking for snakes

01:22:53.211 --> 01:22:54.294 align:middle line:90%
everywhere and everything.

01:22:54.294 --> 01:22:57.080 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And it turns and
makes a 90-degree turn

01:22:59.620 --> 01:23:03.270 align:middle line:84%
and goes through a little
chamber, which interestingly

01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:07.990 align:middle line:84%
enough is not on
anything I've ever seen,

01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:10.940 align:middle line:84%
none of the diagrams of any
of the pyramids anywhere,

01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:15.200 align:middle line:84%
even in the main Rosicrucian
temple in San Jose,

01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:16.385 align:middle line:90%
the main temple there.

01:23:16.385 --> 01:23:19.170 align:middle line:84%
It's got an exact replica
of the whole thing.

01:23:19.170 --> 01:23:20.885 align:middle line:90%
This room is not there.

01:23:20.885 --> 01:23:22.260 align:middle line:84%
It's a little,
tiny room that you

01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:27.610 align:middle line:84%
go into before you go
into the main room.

01:23:27.610 --> 01:23:30.600 align:middle line:84%
You come down this long
thing, and you make a room,

01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:35.140 align:middle line:84%
and there's just this
little tiny room like that

01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:40.120 align:middle line:84%
before you get into this
main, bigger room over here.

01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And then you come into
this very unusual room.

01:23:46.830 --> 01:23:49.040 align:middle line:84%
It's a completely,
totally, female room.

01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:51.280 align:middle line:84%
There's not a
straight line in it.

01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:53.345 align:middle line:84%
All the rest of the rooms
in the Great Pyramid

01:23:53.345 --> 01:23:57.360 align:middle line:84%
are perfectionist
and all this stuff.

01:23:57.360 --> 01:24:00.888 align:middle line:84%
This room looks
kind of like this.

01:24:00.888 --> 01:24:07.030 align:middle line:90%


01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:09.700 align:middle line:84%
It kind of comes up like
this then slopes down.

01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:14.140 align:middle line:90%


01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:19.506 align:middle line:84%
And there's all these
funny things over here.

01:24:19.506 --> 01:24:22.380 align:middle line:90%


01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And then in the
middle of here is

01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:27.150 align:middle line:84%
the well, which the
Egyptians built.

01:24:27.150 --> 01:24:31.746 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of a
little big, I guess.

01:24:31.746 --> 01:24:33.600 align:middle line:90%
Like that.

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:36.085 align:middle line:90%
And then this is perfect.

01:24:36.085 --> 01:24:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's all lined
in stones perfectly

01:24:38.110 --> 01:24:39.540 align:middle line:90%
and everything else like that.

01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:40.340 align:middle line:90%
They do that.

01:24:40.340 --> 01:24:41.980 align:middle line:84%
But the rest of this
room was not done.

01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:43.938 align:middle line:84%
And it was just all this
kind of-- I don't what

01:24:43.938 --> 01:24:46.627 align:middle line:84%
all these shapes were and
weird things over here.

01:24:46.627 --> 01:24:48.210 align:middle line:84%
But it was just this
weird-shaped kind

01:24:48.210 --> 01:24:52.800 align:middle line:84%
of room, almost looked
like a cave in a way.

01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And then over here in
also an illogical place

01:24:57.570 --> 01:25:01.595 align:middle line:84%
over this far corner, you
entered into from this side

01:25:01.595 --> 01:25:02.480 align:middle line:90%
about right here.

01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And then over in
the far corner over

01:25:04.050 --> 01:25:07.720 align:middle line:84%
there was the tunnel we
were supposed to take.

01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:09.770 align:middle line:84%
Only this time, it
was really little.

01:25:09.770 --> 01:25:17.170 align:middle line:84%
It was only about that
wide and that high.

01:25:17.170 --> 01:25:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>>How many feet high?

01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:23.540 align:middle line:90%
>>Maybe that high.

01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Maybe about that high
and about that wide.

01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And it went back into the solid
earth about 75 or 100 feet.

01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And it was lined with
crystals on three sides,

01:25:36.450 --> 01:25:39.140 align:middle line:84%
little tiny [INAUDIBLE]
quartz crystals on three sides

01:25:39.140 --> 01:25:42.710 align:middle line:90%
and silica sand on the bottom.

01:25:42.710 --> 01:25:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And when you shined
a flashlight into it,

01:25:44.630 --> 01:25:46.265 align:middle line:90%
the light spiraled inside.

01:25:46.265 --> 01:25:47.220 align:middle line:90%
It was beautiful.

01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:49.160 align:middle line:90%
It was absolutely beautiful.

01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:53.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I remember sitting
there thinking it was

01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:55.530 align:middle line:90%
like the last thing I expected.

01:25:55.530 --> 01:25:56.330 align:middle line:90%
It really got me.

01:25:56.330 --> 01:25:59.905 align:middle line:84%
Because I really expected
some kind of tunnel.

01:25:59.905 --> 01:26:04.295 align:middle line:84%
I did not expect a crystal
tunnel to be in there at all.

01:26:04.295 --> 01:26:06.202 align:middle line:90%
It just did not occur to me.

01:26:06.202 --> 01:26:07.660 align:middle line:84%
No one ever said
anything about it.

01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:09.270 align:middle line:90%
It just never occurred to me.

01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:14.257 align:middle line:90%
And so we all looked inside.

01:26:14.257 --> 01:26:16.340 align:middle line:84%
So the other thing is that
the light was absorbed.

01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:18.840 align:middle line:84%
It would only got about 10 feet,
and I don't care how bright

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:20.964 align:middle line:84%
the light you got, it just
wouldn't go any further.

01:26:20.964 --> 01:26:21.929 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

01:26:21.929 --> 01:26:23.470 align:middle line:84%
The little crystals
or something were

01:26:23.470 --> 01:26:24.724 align:middle line:90%
absorbing it or reflecting it.

01:26:24.724 --> 01:26:25.557 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:26:25.557 --> 01:26:27.140 align:middle line:84%
But shine a light
in there and it just

01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:29.264 align:middle line:90%
would be black beyond there.

01:26:29.264 --> 01:26:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And so we all looked inside
his tunnel, and each one of us

01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:33.760 align:middle line:90%
looked inside the tunnel.

01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And then they all looked
at me. [LAUGHING] You go.

01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:42.390 align:middle line:84%
You got us down in here, and
you go in that thing first.

01:26:42.390 --> 01:26:45.854 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they really
wanted to do it. [LAUGHING]

01:26:45.854 --> 01:26:48.840 align:middle line:90%


01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:51.670 align:middle line:90%
But we did it.

01:26:51.670 --> 01:26:53.870 align:middle line:84%
But I remember
crawling in this thing.

01:26:53.870 --> 01:26:56.550 align:middle line:84%
I had to take my backpack off
and carry it in front of me

01:26:56.550 --> 01:26:59.110 align:middle line:84%
because it wouldn't
even-- it was too low.

01:26:59.110 --> 01:27:00.957 align:middle line:90%
I had to crawl in this thing.

01:27:00.957 --> 01:27:03.540 align:middle line:84%
So I'm crawling down this tunnel
and crawling down this tunnel

01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:06.780 align:middle line:84%
with my light on here, trying
to see where I was going,

01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:10.114 align:middle line:84%
looking for snakes and
spiders and things like this.

01:27:10.114 --> 01:27:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And it just kept
getting stronger in me.

01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And once I started in there, I
just get stronger and stronger,

01:27:14.670 --> 01:27:18.710 align:middle line:84%
completely forgetting
my training totally,

01:27:18.710 --> 01:27:22.600 align:middle line:84%
looking, hoping
there was no snakes.

01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And these guys are
right behind me.

01:27:24.770 --> 01:27:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And we get all the way
down after crawling.

01:27:26.930 --> 01:27:31.020 align:middle line:84%
100 feet in a little tunnel
like that is a long ways.

01:27:31.020 --> 01:27:35.575 align:middle line:84%
It feels like you've just
taken a highway for-- I mean,

01:27:35.575 --> 01:27:38.880 align:middle line:84%
it feels like we crawled
way, way, way, way

01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:41.380 align:middle line:90%
way into this thing.

01:27:41.380 --> 01:27:42.890 align:middle line:90%
And we got down there.

01:27:42.890 --> 01:27:45.430 align:middle line:84%
I finally got to the place
where I could see the end.

01:27:45.430 --> 01:27:46.520 align:middle line:90%
And I remember the relief.

01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:51.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, ah, there's no snakes,
all good, nothing in here.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And I remember I
put my pack down,

01:27:52.750 --> 01:27:54.310 align:middle line:84%
I got right up to
the back of it,

01:27:54.310 --> 01:27:56.920 align:middle line:84%
and it looks like whoever dug
this tunnel just was digging

01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:59.410 align:middle line:90%
a tunnel and decided to quit.

01:27:59.410 --> 01:28:05.990 align:middle line:84%
You can still see where it
had just stopped, the digging.

01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:08.110 align:middle line:84%
The quartz were in here,
but not on the back part.

01:28:08.110 --> 01:28:10.370 align:middle line:90%
It just was dirt.

01:28:10.370 --> 01:28:13.780 align:middle line:90%
And I put my pack down.

01:28:13.780 --> 01:28:15.870 align:middle line:90%
I lit a candle.

01:28:15.870 --> 01:28:18.936 align:middle line:84%
And I started to--
we're crouched down

01:28:18.936 --> 01:28:20.310 align:middle line:84%
in this little
thing, like you're

01:28:20.310 --> 01:28:22.240 align:middle line:90%
squeezed in this little thing.

01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And then I look
right ahead of me,

01:28:25.150 --> 01:28:31.630 align:middle line:84%
and here's this little hole
that goes into the back tunnel.

01:28:31.630 --> 01:28:34.850 align:middle line:90%
It looks just like a snake hole.

01:28:34.850 --> 01:28:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Just a little
whole in the earth.

01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:37.490 align:middle line:84%
I shined my little
light in there

01:28:37.490 --> 01:28:39.156 align:middle line:84%
to see if there's any
eyes looking back.

01:28:39.156 --> 01:28:43.274 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:28:43.274 --> 01:28:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And the hole kind
of curves away.

01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:48.220 align:middle line:90%
And there's nothing in here.

01:28:48.220 --> 01:28:49.820 align:middle line:90%
And oh, man.

01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:51.844 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:28:51.844 --> 01:28:54.790 align:middle line:84%
And if the hole hadn't have
been there, I'd have been OK.

01:28:54.790 --> 01:28:56.430 align:middle line:90%
But there's this hole.

01:28:56.430 --> 01:28:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And so I realized at
that moment that there's

01:28:59.530 --> 01:29:04.560 align:middle line:84%
no way that I can sit like
this inside of that tunnel.

01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:07.159 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the tunnel would go
right through the top my head.

01:29:07.159 --> 01:29:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting there going,
what am I going to do now?

01:29:09.450 --> 01:29:11.283 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked Thoth,
what am I going to do?

01:29:11.283 --> 01:29:12.377 align:middle line:90%
He was really right there.

01:29:12.377 --> 01:29:13.960 align:middle line:84%
He was just watching
this whole thing.

01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:15.350 align:middle line:90%
And I says, what do I do?

01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:17.920 align:middle line:84%
He says, lay on your back with
your head toward the thing

01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:22.170 align:middle line:84%
so that you can line
up with the shaft.

01:29:22.170 --> 01:29:24.420 align:middle line:84%
So I said, OK, which
put that little hole

01:29:24.420 --> 01:29:26.450 align:middle line:90%
right behind my head, right?

01:29:26.450 --> 01:29:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And so I lay down with my
head toward this hole thing

01:29:29.950 --> 01:29:35.450 align:middle line:90%
and just got a feel for it.

01:29:35.450 --> 01:29:36.490 align:middle line:90%
What does it feel like?

01:29:36.490 --> 01:29:39.420 align:middle line:90%
It feels almost magnetic.

01:29:39.420 --> 01:29:42.550 align:middle line:84%
You know when you have a--
you ever had two magnets

01:29:42.550 --> 01:29:45.400 align:middle line:90%
and they kind of go, won, won?

01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:47.152 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of what
that feeling is.

01:29:47.152 --> 01:29:49.210 align:middle line:90%
It's real strong.

01:29:49.210 --> 01:29:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And I got approximately
where it was.

01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:53.880 align:middle line:84%
I knew right where
it was sort of.

01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And then I got off center
so I wouldn't be right in it

01:29:56.130 --> 01:30:00.390 align:middle line:84%
and took the-- oh, I still
had my flashlight on.

01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:04.422 align:middle line:84%
Then I lit the candle,
turned off the flashlight.

01:30:04.422 --> 01:30:06.880 align:middle line:84%
He told us to put head to foot,
head to foot, head to foot.

01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:09.650 align:middle line:84%
So we all did that all the
way down this whole thing.

01:30:09.650 --> 01:30:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And then next thing he wanted me
to do was to get the words out.

01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:21.090 align:middle line:90%
So I got the words out.

01:30:21.090 --> 01:30:23.454 align:middle line:84%
He wanted me to read
them with force, which

01:30:23.454 --> 01:30:24.620 align:middle line:90%
he didn't in the other ones.

01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:26.244 align:middle line:84%
The other ones I just
had to read them.

01:30:26.244 --> 01:30:29.090 align:middle line:84%
This one he wanted
me to do it, which

01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:31.580 align:middle line:84%
was calling on the
seven lords, who

01:30:31.580 --> 01:30:36.440 align:middle line:84%
were the original seven in
Annunaki who started our race

01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:39.740 align:middle line:84%
to open up the Halls of
Amenti and allow us in.

01:30:39.740 --> 01:30:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to
call them my name.

01:30:42.390 --> 01:30:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I said this whole thing
and called the seven lords in.

01:30:47.550 --> 01:30:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And he then told me to
blow out the candle.

01:30:50.490 --> 01:30:53.080 align:middle line:90%
And so I blew out the candle.

01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And I went through a series of
immediate rapid experiences.

01:30:57.190 --> 01:30:59.269 align:middle line:84%
The first one was--
the first thing

01:30:59.269 --> 01:31:01.560 align:middle line:84%
that struck me was this was
the darkest place I've ever

01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:04.820 align:middle line:90%
seen in my entire life ever.

01:31:04.820 --> 01:31:08.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I remember taking
my hand and going like this.

01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And with my eyes wide open,
I couldn't even feel it.

01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:15.170 align:middle line:84%
It was like it was
blacker than black.

01:31:15.170 --> 01:31:20.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that there was
even one photon-- [LAUGHING]

01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:23.825 align:middle line:84%
--in our tunnel, considering
what it had to go down

01:31:23.825 --> 01:31:25.990 align:middle line:84%
and through and over to
here and down this thing.

01:31:25.990 --> 01:31:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
like I never, ever

01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:31.210 align:middle line:84%
expected-- it's like,
wow, man, this is black.

01:31:31.210 --> 01:31:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And then the next thing was
I thought, wow, this is just

01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:36.072 align:middle line:90%
like being buried alive.

01:31:36.072 --> 01:31:37.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:41.610 align:middle line:84%
But I don't have any of
those kind of fears at all.

01:31:41.610 --> 01:31:43.490 align:middle line:90%
I kind of dug it, actually.

01:31:43.490 --> 01:31:46.250 align:middle line:90%
It felt good.

01:31:46.250 --> 01:31:50.210 align:middle line:84%
But I did feel the intense
gravitational field

01:31:50.210 --> 01:31:52.799 align:middle line:84%
of this mountain that
was on top of me.

01:31:52.799 --> 01:31:54.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was a
lot of weight up there.

01:31:54.590 --> 01:31:56.360 align:middle line:90%
I could feel it.

01:31:56.360 --> 01:31:57.770 align:middle line:90%
And it felt good.

01:31:57.770 --> 01:31:59.240 align:middle line:90%
To me it felt good.

01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:01.951 align:middle line:84%
But I thought, boy, if
you're claustrophobic, man,

01:32:01.951 --> 01:32:04.450 align:middle line:84%
you're in trouble. [LAUGHING]
Because you can't go this way.

01:32:04.450 --> 01:32:05.640 align:middle line:90%
You can't go that way.

01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:06.220 align:middle line:90%
You can't go this way.

01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:07.136 align:middle line:90%
You can't go that way.

01:32:07.136 --> 01:32:08.054 align:middle line:90%
Yo can't go this way.

01:32:08.054 --> 01:32:10.387 align:middle line:84%
And there's people flowing
in the tunnel going that way.

01:32:10.387 --> 01:32:14.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:17.640 align:middle line:84%
So those are the initial
things I went through,

01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:21.190 align:middle line:84%
which took about 15
seconds or something.

01:32:21.190 --> 01:32:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought,
OK, now I'm ready.

01:32:24.590 --> 01:32:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And then I remembered
that little hole.

01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:29.216 align:middle line:90%
And my mind switched back to it.

01:32:29.216 --> 01:32:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel my mind going
back to that little hole.

01:32:31.890 --> 01:32:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
oh, yeah, the snakes.

01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And I started going through
this whole thing all over again.

01:32:39.370 --> 01:32:40.447 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't stop it.

01:32:40.447 --> 01:32:41.780 align:middle line:90%
And it started getting stronger.

01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:44.180 align:middle line:90%
And the fear came back again.

01:32:44.180 --> 01:32:46.810 align:middle line:84%
Oh. the snakes are
gonna crawl out.

01:32:46.810 --> 01:32:51.190 align:middle line:90%
This is just like somebody else.

01:32:51.190 --> 01:32:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And I remember what I did, which
it's a good thing it worked,

01:32:57.980 --> 01:33:03.410 align:middle line:84%
because I just sort of grabbed
myself by the collar and said,

01:33:03.410 --> 01:33:04.230 align:middle line:90%
look, kid--

01:33:04.230 --> 01:33:06.590 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:33:06.590 --> 01:33:09.720 align:middle line:84%
--you came how many thousands
of miles across here

01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:12.440 align:middle line:84%
to do this whole thing, and
this is really important stuff.

01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:14.479 align:middle line:84%
And who cares if
you die, anyway?

01:33:14.479 --> 01:33:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And all this other kind
of stuff like that.

01:33:16.270 --> 01:33:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And I was just telling myself
all that stuff and saying,

01:33:18.930 --> 01:33:19.830 align:middle line:90%
just do it.

01:33:19.830 --> 01:33:20.630 align:middle line:90%
Just forget it.

01:33:20.630 --> 01:33:22.730 align:middle line:90%
What if you-- it doesn't matter.

01:33:22.730 --> 01:33:24.870 align:middle line:90%
And it worked for me.

01:33:24.870 --> 01:33:26.870 align:middle line:84%
It's a good thing it did
work, because I believe

01:33:26.870 --> 01:33:29.250 align:middle line:84%
that if it had not worked,
I could feel it starting

01:33:29.250 --> 01:33:31.140 align:middle line:84%
to happen. and if
it had not worked,

01:33:31.140 --> 01:33:33.620 align:middle line:84%
I probably wouldn't
be here today.

01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:36.485 align:middle line:84%
But I had just gotten
to the place where

01:33:36.485 --> 01:33:38.700 align:middle line:84%
I just got over the top
of the fear and just said,

01:33:38.700 --> 01:33:39.670 align:middle line:90%
I don't care if I die.

01:33:39.670 --> 01:33:40.540 align:middle line:90%
So what?

01:33:40.540 --> 01:33:42.355 align:middle line:90%
Let's go on.

01:33:42.355 --> 01:33:43.980 align:middle line:84%
At which point Thoth
comes in and says,

01:33:43.980 --> 01:33:44.938 align:middle line:90%
are you ready to go on?

01:33:44.938 --> 01:33:46.950 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:33:46.950 --> 01:33:48.200 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes, let's just go.

01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:49.720 align:middle line:90%
What do you want me to do?

01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:55.136 align:middle line:84%
And he says, OK, get
into the Markaba.

01:33:55.136 --> 01:33:57.540 align:middle line:84%
At that time, I was
not in the Markaba

01:33:57.540 --> 01:33:59.800 align:middle line:90%
all the time like I am now.

01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:03.470 align:middle line:84%
So I had to reconstruct
it each time.

01:34:03.470 --> 01:34:06.170 align:middle line:84%
I did something that a few
days earlier I couldn't even

01:34:06.170 --> 01:34:08.260 align:middle line:84%
do the simple
breathing patterns.

01:34:08.260 --> 01:34:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And without even thinking,
I reconstructed the Markaba

01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:13.007 align:middle line:90%
laying on my back.

01:34:13.007 --> 01:34:15.340 align:middle line:84%
It didn't even occur to me
that I was laying on my back.

01:34:15.340 --> 01:34:18.659 align:middle line:84%
I guess because I
couldn't tell up and down

01:34:18.659 --> 01:34:19.950 align:middle line:90%
or anything else anyway hardly.

01:34:19.950 --> 01:34:21.685 align:middle line:90%
It was like blackness.

01:34:21.685 --> 01:34:22.485 align:middle line:90%
But I did it.

01:34:22.485 --> 01:34:23.943 align:middle line:84%
I immediately got
into the Markaba,

01:34:23.943 --> 01:34:27.570 align:middle line:84%
the counter-rotating fields
and got into the whole thing.

01:34:27.570 --> 01:34:29.370 align:middle line:90%
And then Thoth came in.

01:34:29.370 --> 01:34:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And he said, are
you aware that when

01:34:44.270 --> 01:34:48.570 align:middle line:84%
you're in the Markaba like
this that there is light

01:34:48.570 --> 01:34:52.410 align:middle line:90%
radiating off of your body?

01:34:52.410 --> 01:34:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And I knew the instructions,
intellectually, anyway,

01:34:54.770 --> 01:34:55.570 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

01:34:55.570 --> 01:34:58.504 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes, I understand.

01:34:58.504 --> 01:35:00.404 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, no.

01:35:00.404 --> 01:35:03.160 align:middle line:84%
He says, do you
really understand

01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:06.500 align:middle line:84%
that there is real light
coming off of your body

01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:09.051 align:middle line:90%
when you breathe like this?

01:35:09.051 --> 01:35:11.290 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, I think so.

01:35:11.290 --> 01:35:13.570 align:middle line:84%
I think I understand
what you mean.

01:35:13.570 --> 01:35:15.570 align:middle line:90%
He says, open your eyes.

01:35:15.570 --> 01:35:18.458 align:middle line:90%


01:35:18.458 --> 01:35:20.060 align:middle line:90%
So I opened my eyes.

01:35:20.060 --> 01:35:22.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm laying on my back
looking up at the tunnel.

01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:26.840 align:middle line:84%
I open my eyes, and what had
been absolute black charcoal

01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:32.680 align:middle line:84%
before, I could see
the ceiling clearly.

01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:34.510 align:middle line:90%
The room was lit up.

01:35:34.510 --> 01:35:37.930 align:middle line:84%
The space in the
tunnel was lit up.

01:35:37.930 --> 01:35:41.005 align:middle line:90%
And I'm looking at this.

01:35:41.005 --> 01:35:42.520 align:middle line:90%
It was not like daylight.

01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:44.820 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't even this bright.

01:35:44.820 --> 01:35:50.090 align:middle line:84%
It was like a soft moonlight in
kind of whitish-bluish color.

01:35:50.090 --> 01:35:54.040 align:middle line:90%


01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:55.140 align:middle line:90%
But it was very definite.

01:35:55.140 --> 01:35:58.280 align:middle line:84%
I could absolutely
clearly see all around me,

01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:02.210 align:middle line:84%
and I could clearly see my
hand and everything else.

01:36:02.210 --> 01:36:04.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at this, and
then the thought came.

01:36:04.780 --> 01:36:05.580 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no.

01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:09.150 align:middle line:90%
Somebody has a light on.

01:36:09.150 --> 01:36:13.840 align:middle line:84%
So I looked down the tunnel to
see if someone had a light on.

01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:14.700 align:middle line:90%
There's no light on.

01:36:14.700 --> 01:36:19.890 align:middle line:84%
Those guys were just--
they were meditating.

01:36:19.890 --> 01:36:20.760 align:middle line:90%
They were gone.

01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:22.400 align:middle line:90%
There was no light.

01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And the light was
just around me.

01:36:24.790 --> 01:36:27.070 align:middle line:84%
It was not coming from
any particular place.

01:36:27.070 --> 01:36:29.816 align:middle line:90%
It was like the air was lit up.

01:36:29.816 --> 01:36:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at this, and
I closed my eyes again,

01:36:32.230 --> 01:36:33.240 align:middle line:90%
and there's Thoth again.

01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And I said, wow,
that's pretty good.

01:36:37.390 --> 01:36:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And he told me to open my
eyes again and look at it.

01:36:40.710 --> 01:36:41.797 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

01:36:41.797 --> 01:36:42.597 align:middle line:90%
Looked around.

01:36:42.597 --> 01:36:43.570 align:middle line:90%
It was still there.

01:36:43.570 --> 01:36:44.990 align:middle line:90%
I could see.

01:36:44.990 --> 01:36:45.845 align:middle line:90%
Checked it out.

01:36:45.845 --> 01:36:48.060 align:middle line:90%
Everything was like this.

01:36:48.060 --> 01:36:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I closed my eyes
again after a little while

01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:51.660 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE].

01:36:51.660 --> 01:36:56.039 align:middle line:84%
I remember saying to him,
yeah, OK, I understand.

01:36:56.039 --> 01:36:57.830 align:middle line:84%
So I said something
like, I understand now.

01:36:57.830 --> 01:37:01.262 align:middle line:90%


01:37:01.262 --> 01:37:04.660 align:middle line:90%
And I says, OK, what's next?

01:37:04.660 --> 01:37:08.738 align:middle line:84%
And he says to me, isn't
lighting the tunnel enough?

01:37:08.738 --> 01:37:11.426 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:37:11.426 --> 01:37:13.430 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah, OK.

01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:15.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, that's enough.

01:37:15.140 --> 01:37:19.300 align:middle line:90%
And he says, open your eyes.

01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:20.100 align:middle line:90%
Look.

01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:20.900 align:middle line:90%
Watch.

01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:22.190 align:middle line:90%
Just keep looking.

01:37:22.190 --> 01:37:25.550 align:middle line:90%
Remember what you're seeing.

01:37:25.550 --> 01:37:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And so for about an
hour, I sat in there,

01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:31.880 align:middle line:84%
looking in the tunnel,
closing my eyes,

01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:35.130 align:middle line:84%
looking around, closing my eyes
and looking at this glowing,

01:37:35.130 --> 01:37:37.560 align:middle line:84%
keep looking around and
doing this kind of stuff

01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:40.130 align:middle line:90%
for about an hour.

01:37:40.130 --> 01:37:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I remember I
had my eyes closed and Thoth

01:37:45.710 --> 01:37:46.840 align:middle line:90%
was there.

01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:49.090 align:middle line:84%
Because I kept going back
and forth and back and forth

01:37:49.090 --> 01:37:49.990 align:middle line:90%
and back and forth.

01:37:49.990 --> 01:37:51.550 align:middle line:90%
Thoth was just sitting there.

01:37:51.550 --> 01:37:53.852 align:middle line:84%
I had my eyes closed,
and the little alarm

01:37:53.852 --> 01:37:55.685 align:middle line:84%
went off on the watch,
which we were ready--

01:37:55.685 --> 01:37:59.040 align:middle line:84%
because we had set it for
about 10 minutes, I think,

01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:02.090 align:middle line:84%
before the time when we were
supposed to be upstairs.

01:38:02.090 --> 01:38:05.320 align:middle line:84%
Little beeper went off,
and I clicked it like that.

01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And I opened my eyes,
expecting it to be light,

01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:14.131 align:middle line:84%
and it was pitch
black, just absolutely.

01:38:14.131 --> 01:38:15.130 align:middle line:90%
And it was like a shock.

01:38:15.130 --> 01:38:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And I went, oh, God,
I'm blinded again.

01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And there I was, and it
was blacker than ever.

01:38:21.030 --> 01:38:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And I had to reach in,
find the flashlight,

01:38:26.350 --> 01:38:30.750 align:middle line:84%
and turn it on and use an
ordinary light now to see with.

01:38:30.750 --> 01:38:33.980 align:middle line:90%
And we all knew.

01:38:33.980 --> 01:38:35.190 align:middle line:90%
They all started stirring.

01:38:35.190 --> 01:38:40.045 align:middle line:84%
They knew that little beeping
sound like a-- beep, beep,

01:38:40.045 --> 01:38:41.050 align:middle line:90%
beep, beep!

01:38:41.050 --> 01:38:43.870 align:middle line:84%
It sounded really loud
in this little tunnel.

01:38:43.870 --> 01:38:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And we got out of
there, went upstairs.

01:38:49.930 --> 01:38:52.039 align:middle line:84%
When we got upstairs
to the top, we

01:38:52.039 --> 01:38:53.830 align:middle line:84%
actually got up there
a minute or two early

01:38:53.830 --> 01:38:55.579 align:middle line:84%
and had to wait for
them to open the door.

01:38:55.579 --> 01:38:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And then they opened
the door, and my sister

01:38:58.870 --> 01:39:01.179 align:middle line:84%
went out to the
right to go outside,

01:39:01.179 --> 01:39:03.720 align:middle line:84%
because she'd been in the King's
Chamber a whole lot of times

01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:05.430 align:middle line:90%
and didn't want to go in.

01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:07.060 align:middle line:90%
She wanted to go back outside.

01:39:07.060 --> 01:39:09.200 align:middle line:84%
But the other four
of us wanted to,

01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:12.250 align:middle line:84%
and so we went upstairs and
into the King's Chamber.

01:39:12.250 --> 01:39:15.930 align:middle line:84%
But it was pretty clear to me
that the experience was over

01:39:15.930 --> 01:39:19.927 align:middle line:90%
and that I was now a tourist.

01:39:19.927 --> 01:39:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And so we just went up and
looked around at things

01:39:22.010 --> 01:39:25.250 align:middle line:84%
and followed all these
people, hundreds of people

01:39:25.250 --> 01:39:26.320 align:middle line:90%
in there all around.

01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:29.447 align:middle line:84%
And we came back out,
maybe a little while later.

01:39:29.447 --> 01:39:30.780 align:middle line:90%
I really don't know when it was.

01:39:30.780 --> 01:39:32.851 align:middle line:84%
A half an hour, 45
minutes or an hour later

01:39:32.851 --> 01:39:34.184 align:middle line:90%
we came back out of the pyramid.

01:39:34.184 --> 01:39:36.930 align:middle line:90%


01:39:36.930 --> 01:39:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And I really thought
it was all over with.

01:39:38.890 --> 01:39:41.690 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I had
completed whatever

01:39:41.690 --> 01:39:44.850 align:middle line:90%
it was that I come there to do.

01:39:44.850 --> 01:39:48.090 align:middle line:84%
But when I went outside,
there was a phenomena

01:39:48.090 --> 01:39:52.226 align:middle line:90%
outside that I did not expect.

01:39:52.226 --> 01:39:55.090 align:middle line:84%
It did not occur to me
that such a thing would be.

01:39:55.090 --> 01:39:57.230 align:middle line:84%
When we went in there,
there was just a few people

01:39:57.230 --> 01:40:02.845 align:middle line:84%
standing around, a few hundred
people standing around that

01:40:02.845 --> 01:40:04.250 align:middle line:90%
were preparing to come in there.

01:40:04.250 --> 01:40:05.867 align:middle line:90%
Because we went in really early.

01:40:05.867 --> 01:40:08.790 align:middle line:84%
We went in right
when it opened up.

01:40:08.790 --> 01:40:11.694 align:middle line:84%
So we were going out
there 7:00, 7:30,

01:40:11.694 --> 01:40:14.410 align:middle line:84%
so it would be 8:00, 9:00,
probably 9:30, 10:00,

01:40:14.410 --> 01:40:15.750 align:middle line:90%
something like that.

01:40:15.750 --> 01:40:19.657 align:middle line:84%
And we go outside,
and there was a sea--

01:40:19.657 --> 01:40:21.240 align:middle line:84%
and that's the only
way I can describe

01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:25.338 align:middle line:90%
it-- a sea of children.

01:40:25.338 --> 01:40:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at these kids, and
they were almost all children.

01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:33.860 align:middle line:84%
There was hardly
any adults anywhere.

01:40:33.860 --> 01:40:35.645 align:middle line:84%
It was all kids from
about five years

01:40:35.645 --> 01:40:37.020 align:middle line:84%
old-- I carefully
looked at this.

01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:38.486 align:middle line:90%
I stood there for a long time.

01:40:38.486 --> 01:40:40.860 align:middle line:84%
They were all from about five
years old to about 12 years

01:40:40.860 --> 01:40:42.420 align:middle line:90%
old.

01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:43.750 align:middle line:90%
And there was a lot of them.

01:40:43.750 --> 01:40:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And I can't judge crowds,
but it like thousands

01:40:46.490 --> 01:40:47.770 align:middle line:90%
and thousands and thousands.

01:40:47.770 --> 01:40:51.870 align:middle line:84%
It was well over 50,000,
60,000 kids or more.

01:40:51.870 --> 01:40:53.715 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was just
like incredible

01:40:53.715 --> 01:40:59.270 align:middle line:90%
what was outside this pyramids.

01:40:59.270 --> 01:41:00.670 align:middle line:84%
If it was true--
and it was true.

01:41:00.670 --> 01:41:01.753 align:middle line:90%
I saw it with my own eyes.

01:41:01.753 --> 01:41:03.820 align:middle line:90%
That's why for sure it was true.

01:41:03.820 --> 01:41:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Children had rung the
entire pyramid, which

01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:10.110 align:middle line:84%
is a big structure, were
sitting there holding hands

01:41:10.110 --> 01:41:13.970 align:middle line:84%
while we were in there,
ringing the entire pyramid.

01:41:13.970 --> 01:41:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And so I then left there
thinking about that.

01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And I started going down to the
road that led to Ahmed's house.

01:41:19.130 --> 01:41:20.820 align:middle line:84%
I looked over at
the other pyramid.

01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:23.010 align:middle line:84%
There was lots and lots
of kids around that one,

01:41:23.010 --> 01:41:25.360 align:middle line:84%
and they were
ringing that pyramid.

01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And I walked around that
one, the middle one,

01:41:27.550 --> 01:41:29.040 align:middle line:84%
and they had the
middle one rung.

01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:31.340 align:middle line:90%
And they also had the third one.

01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:33.650 align:middle line:84%
All three pyramids
were completely

01:41:33.650 --> 01:41:37.780 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by children holding
hands, from about five years

01:41:37.780 --> 01:41:40.580 align:middle line:90%
old to about 12 years old.

01:41:40.580 --> 01:41:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And I went back-- and everybody
went in different directions

01:41:43.420 --> 01:41:44.220 align:middle line:90%
from our group.

01:41:44.220 --> 01:41:46.110 align:middle line:90%
And I went back all by myself.

01:41:46.110 --> 01:41:50.550 align:middle line:84%
I just started
thinking, what is it?

01:41:50.550 --> 01:41:51.860 align:middle line:90%
There's meaning of everything.

01:41:51.860 --> 01:41:55.460 align:middle line:84%
This is really
important, completely

01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:57.050 align:middle line:90%
forgetting everything else.

01:41:57.050 --> 01:42:01.595 align:middle line:84%
Even seeing the light in the
tunnel didn't seem important.

01:42:01.595 --> 01:42:02.970 align:middle line:84%
This seemed more
important to me.

01:42:02.970 --> 01:42:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And I remember walking
back to Ahmed's house,

01:42:05.890 --> 01:42:08.990 align:middle line:84%
going up into my bedroom,
and sitting down and asking

01:42:08.990 --> 01:42:09.960 align:middle line:90%
the angels to come in.

01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:12.530 align:middle line:84%
And they came in,
and I said, what

01:42:12.530 --> 01:42:15.170 align:middle line:90%
is this with all these children?

01:42:15.170 --> 01:42:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And they said to me,
don't you remember

01:42:19.090 --> 01:42:20.820 align:middle line:90%
what we told you 12 years ago?

01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:24.050 align:middle line:90%


01:42:24.050 --> 01:42:26.180 align:middle line:90%
They do this to me all the time.

01:42:26.180 --> 01:42:28.790 align:middle line:90%
And I go, I don't remember.

01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:31.400 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And you see, they
asked me-- actually,

01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:38.140 align:middle line:84%
before 12 years
ago, they asked me

01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:42.400 align:middle line:84%
to have a baby,
which they said would

01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:47.740 align:middle line:84%
be the apex of a pyramid-- this
was their words-- of millions

01:42:47.740 --> 01:42:50.910 align:middle line:84%
of children that would come
into the world that would be

01:42:50.910 --> 01:42:53.350 align:middle line:84%
interdimensional beings
that would help raise

01:42:53.350 --> 01:42:58.750 align:middle line:84%
the vibration of the
planet during this time.

01:42:58.750 --> 01:43:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And they told me right
after-- his name was Zachary.

01:43:01.910 --> 01:43:06.250 align:middle line:84%
They said right after
he was born that he'd

01:43:06.250 --> 01:43:07.937 align:middle line:90%
be an absolutely ordinary kid.

01:43:07.937 --> 01:43:09.520 align:middle line:84%
You'd never see any
difference at all.

01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:14.440 align:middle line:84%
He'd be a normal
child until 13 years

01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:22.810 align:middle line:84%
went by, or in other words,
until his-- how do I put this?

01:43:22.810 --> 01:43:27.870 align:middle line:90%


01:43:27.870 --> 01:43:31.855 align:middle line:84%
It was 12 years-- it
had to be 12 years.

01:43:31.855 --> 01:43:33.795 align:middle line:90%
12 years went by.

01:43:33.795 --> 01:43:37.200 align:middle line:90%


01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:39.650 align:middle line:90%
I think I'm right on this.

01:43:39.650 --> 01:43:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, what it
worked out to, they

01:43:41.210 --> 01:43:44.420 align:middle line:84%
had to wait till he
was-- this is '85-- yeah,

01:43:44.420 --> 01:43:47.410 align:middle line:90%
until his 13th birthday, right.

01:43:47.410 --> 01:43:49.030 align:middle line:90%
12 years had to go by.

01:43:49.030 --> 01:43:50.920 align:middle line:90%
It had to be his 13th birthday.

01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:54.705 align:middle line:84%
And then, he said, all
these children, which

01:43:54.705 --> 01:43:58.370 align:middle line:84%
would be all over the world,
would begin to wake up,

01:43:58.370 --> 01:44:00.670 align:middle line:90%
they said.

01:44:00.670 --> 01:44:05.556 align:middle line:84%
And I hadn't seen my son for
three years at that time.

01:44:05.556 --> 01:44:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't really
thinking about Zachary

01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:09.360 align:middle line:90%
when I went in there.

01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:12.920 align:middle line:90%
And they said, do you remember?

01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:18.096 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized then that it
was his birthday on January 10.

01:44:18.096 --> 01:44:20.346 align:middle line:84%
Mine was on the 18th, and
his was on the 10th, the day

01:44:20.346 --> 01:44:22.450 align:middle line:90%
that we came in.

01:44:22.450 --> 01:44:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And they said, it's now
beginning to happen.

01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:34.760 align:middle line:84%
The children of the world
will begin to waken.

01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:38.980 align:middle line:90%
I remember flying home.

01:44:38.980 --> 01:44:41.880 align:middle line:84%
As I was flying home
on the airplane,

01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:44.910 align:middle line:84%
flying back, still
thinking about this,

01:44:44.910 --> 01:44:51.440 align:middle line:84%
I got this "Omni"
magazine, January 1985.

01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:55.085 align:middle line:84%
And it says, "China's
Psychic Children."

01:44:55.085 --> 01:44:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And I start reading
this article,

01:44:56.460 --> 01:44:58.394 align:middle line:84%
and this is it right here
where you can read it.

01:44:58.394 --> 01:45:00.420 align:middle line:84%
This is incredible if you
don't know about this.

01:45:00.420 --> 01:45:04.587 align:middle line:90%


01:45:04.587 --> 01:45:08.790 align:middle line:84%
China, first there
was this one child.

01:45:08.790 --> 01:45:12.070 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember his name.

01:45:12.070 --> 01:45:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And this one child discovered
that he could do things

01:45:18.630 --> 01:45:22.300 align:middle line:90%
that are supposedly impossible.

01:45:22.300 --> 01:45:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And then the government became
aware of this one child.

01:45:26.610 --> 01:45:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And then the government began
to discover that these children

01:45:30.890 --> 01:45:32.231 align:middle line:90%
were everywhere.

01:45:32.231 --> 01:45:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And first they found a few of
them and then hundreds of them

01:45:34.730 --> 01:45:36.620 align:middle line:84%
and then thousands of
them and then thousands

01:45:36.620 --> 01:45:39.090 align:middle line:90%
upon thousands of them.

01:45:39.090 --> 01:45:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And who knows how many
there are in the world?

01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:43.950 align:middle line:84%
According to the
angels, there's millions

01:45:43.950 --> 01:45:45.720 align:middle line:90%
upon millions upon millions.

01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And at this moment, almost
all children being born

01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:51.230 align:middle line:90%
are of this nature.

01:45:51.230 --> 01:45:56.180 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about 99.999999%
of them on the planet.

01:45:56.180 --> 01:46:00.360 align:middle line:84%
They're almost all these
highly evolved, very evolved,

01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:02.410 align:middle line:90%
interdimensional beings.

01:46:02.410 --> 01:46:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And "Omni" magazine, when
they heard about these things,

01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:08.600 align:middle line:90%
they went to China.

01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And they went there
in a scientific vein,

01:46:11.810 --> 01:46:15.480 align:middle line:90%
assuming that there was a hoax.

01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And so China gave
"Omni" I think they

01:46:23.070 --> 01:46:26.582 align:middle line:84%
said about a couple hundred of
these children to investigate.

01:46:26.582 --> 01:46:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And they did things like they
would take maybe some of them

01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:33.277 align:middle line:84%
in the back of the room,
and they would take a book,

01:46:33.277 --> 01:46:35.610 align:middle line:84%
and they would flip through
the book and rip out a page,

01:46:35.610 --> 01:46:38.496 align:middle line:84%
crumple it up, and stick
it under their arm.

01:46:38.496 --> 01:46:39.870 align:middle line:10%
And every one of
these kids could

01:46:39.870 --> 01:46:43.380 align:middle line:10%
read every word on
the page every time

01:46:43.380 --> 01:46:46.890 align:middle line:10%
without any errors at all, ever.

01:46:46.890 --> 01:46:48.440 align:middle line:10%
And they would rip
out another page,

01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:50.149 align:middle line:10%
and they can do the same thing.

01:46:50.149 --> 01:46:51.940 align:middle line:10%
And they tested them
on every psychic level

01:46:51.940 --> 01:46:54.106 align:middle line:10%
they could think of-- you'll
read about it in here--

01:46:54.106 --> 01:46:56.040 align:middle line:10%
with no errors at all-- none.

01:46:56.040 --> 01:46:58.570 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

01:46:58.570 --> 01:47:01.970 align:middle line:90%
And "Omni" [INAUDIBLE] wow.

01:47:01.970 --> 01:47:03.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, these kids are
now popping up all

01:47:03.910 --> 01:47:08.160 align:middle line:84%
over Russia, all over
Japan, all over Canada, all

01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:09.830 align:middle line:90%
over the United States.

01:47:09.830 --> 01:47:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
primary places,

01:47:12.620 --> 01:47:15.242 align:middle line:84%
though they're in
Europe, and they're

01:47:15.242 --> 01:47:16.450 align:middle line:90%
coming up all over the world.

01:47:16.450 --> 01:47:19.540 align:middle line:90%


01:47:19.540 --> 01:47:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of people
that don't know what to do.

01:47:22.930 --> 01:47:25.080 align:middle line:84%
They're extraordinary
in all kinds of levels.

01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:31.310 align:middle line:90%


01:47:31.310 --> 01:47:32.990 align:middle line:84%
According to the
angels, it will be

01:47:32.990 --> 01:47:37.630 align:middle line:84%
the children that will
initiate the transformation.

01:47:37.630 --> 01:47:40.260 align:middle line:90%
They will be the ones.

01:47:40.260 --> 01:47:43.020 align:middle line:84%
They will be the ones that begin
doing the things that we're

01:47:43.020 --> 01:47:44.480 align:middle line:90%
trying to do.

01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And they will be the example
that will lead us out.

01:47:47.750 --> 01:47:49.350 align:middle line:84%
It was the same
thing that happened

01:47:49.350 --> 01:47:54.000 align:middle line:84%
with the dolphins, the legend
of the golden dolphins.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:57.540 align:middle line:84%
The dolphins and the
whales, the adults,

01:47:57.540 --> 01:47:59.770 align:middle line:84%
couldn't make the
transformation.

01:47:59.770 --> 01:48:03.004 align:middle line:84%
And it was the baby
dolphin, the golden dolphin,

01:48:03.004 --> 01:48:04.670 align:middle line:84%
that was able to make
the transformation

01:48:04.670 --> 01:48:06.820 align:middle line:90%
and lead them out.

01:48:06.820 --> 01:48:10.700 align:middle line:90%
