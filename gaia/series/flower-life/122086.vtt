00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.800 align:middle line:90%


00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.455 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:04.455 --> 00:00:16.350 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.280 align:middle line:90%
>>This is Chinese.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And again, the Chinese
understood this clearly.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.820 align:middle line:90%
This is a real building.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And again, where this line
was, where this line was, where

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.320 align:middle line:84%
this line was, and
this one, relative

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.790 align:middle line:84%
to all the other ones,
the total height,

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.330 align:middle line:84%
compared to any of the
other aspects of this,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.390 align:middle line:90%
is all based on sacred geometry.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.519 align:middle line:90%
And primarily, the phi ratio.

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And if you really
got in here and you

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.450 align:middle line:84%
looked at the
height of the doors

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.260 align:middle line:84%
and the width of the doors, and
how far the doors were apart,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.130 align:middle line:84%
and how far the edge of the door
was to the edge of the wall,

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.750 align:middle line:84%
and all this kind
of stuff, you would

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.400 align:middle line:84%
see this incredible
sacred geometry going

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.586 align:middle line:90%
on throughout all of that.

00:01:01.586 --> 00:01:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And what it does is it
gives you this funny feeling

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:04.762 align:middle line:90%
when you look at it.

00:01:04.762 --> 00:01:07.220 align:middle line:84%
All this geometry that's around
the world is based on this.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.360 align:middle line:84%
When you look at
it, it just feels

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.950 align:middle line:84%
like looking at a
sunset or something.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.620 align:middle line:84%
It feels, I don't know
exactly how to say it.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.270 align:middle line:84%
Geometry has often been called
the mathematics of beauty.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.205 align:middle line:84%
Because when we see these kinds
of things in form, we say,

00:01:26.205 --> 00:01:29.270 align:middle line:90%
gee, that's beautiful.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.340 align:middle line:90%
>>This man did a study.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.695 align:middle line:84%
And he had, on Channel
13, these dancers

00:01:32.695 --> 00:01:34.620 align:middle line:90%
all wear these black leotards.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And on all of the joints,
they had white spots.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.143 align:middle line:84%
And he had people
watch the dance.

00:01:39.143 --> 00:01:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And he had several different
choreographers do something.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.805 align:middle line:84%
And everybody basically
agreed on certain dances

00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:48.610 align:middle line:84%
as being really nice or pleasant
to watch, or comfortable.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And when they put
this onto a screen,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.020 align:middle line:84%
it made geometric patterns
with all the white things.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And if it was one of the
dances that everybody enjoyed,

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.080 align:middle line:84%
it all worked out
mathematically.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And if it was
something that people

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.860 align:middle line:84%
said that just wasn't
right about the dance,

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.340 align:middle line:90%
it didn't work out.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And what they determined was
that the mind does everything

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.560 align:middle line:90%
mathematically.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And whether you like
something or don't like it,

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.140 align:middle line:84%
whether you determine whether
it's beautiful or not,

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.760 align:middle line:90%
it's all based on the math.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.050 align:middle line:90%
And they showed to us.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.850 align:middle line:90%
It was really cool.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.016 align:middle line:90%
They showed it on the dance.

00:02:20.016 --> 00:02:21.100 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.080 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.550 align:middle line:90%
I agree with that.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.960 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.950 align:middle line:84%
Everything we do
is mathematical.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.670 align:middle line:84%
At least, everything from the
left side of our brain is.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.770 align:middle line:84%
We do have this freedom from
the other side, which is not.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.760 align:middle line:84%
But we also have a part of our
brain, our male, logical side,

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.580 align:middle line:84%
just like the female side, that
is free and experiential also.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.530 align:middle line:84%
OK there's another sacred
form that is all over nature,

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.870 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.540 align:middle line:90%
We live in one.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.640 align:middle line:84%
The galaxies, in
this big spiral.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.910 align:middle line:90%
So where do spirals come from?

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.870 align:middle line:84%
There are spirals
in sunflower seeds.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.880 align:middle line:84%
There are spirals in the
way that pinecone seeds are.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.230 align:middle line:90%
Spirals in the nautilus shell.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.640 align:middle line:84%
In fact, almost all
seashells that you take out,

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.690 align:middle line:84%
you're gonna see all
these intimate spirals

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.500 align:middle line:90%
moving through them.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.890 align:middle line:90%
Where does it come from?

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.050 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're the measuring
stick in the universe.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.610 align:middle line:90%
It's got to be in our body.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.360 align:middle line:84%
Always, no matter what
you're looking for,

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.860 align:middle line:84%
you're gonna look to
yourself to find the answer.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And here's that same
shape around here.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.690 align:middle line:10%
This form, which we derived
straight out of the human body,

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.380 align:middle line:10%
all you gotta do is connect
this line to that line,

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.140 align:middle line:10%
and you get a form
called the golden mean,

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:51.080 align:middle line:10%
or the golden mean rectangle,
which looks like this.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.940 align:middle line:84%
This would have
been the human body.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.065 align:middle line:90%
This would be the diagonal.

00:03:56.065 --> 00:03:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is the line that
would come over here.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Connect these together, and
this is a golden mean rectangle.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.900 align:middle line:84%
A golden mean rectangle
is this, basically.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.000 align:middle line:84%
You take the shorter
edge of the rectangle

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.630 align:middle line:84%
and you come down
the same distance

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.920 align:middle line:84%
and form a square in it, based
upon whatever this edge is.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.570 align:middle line:84%
What's left over is another
golden mean rectangle

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.620 align:middle line:84%
in proportion to
this one, only faced

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.890 align:middle line:90%
this way rather than this way.

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.140 align:middle line:84%
You take the shorter edge
and you make another square,

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.304 align:middle line:84%
and you have another
golden mean rectangle.

00:04:27.304 --> 00:04:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Take the shorter edge
and make another square,

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.690 align:middle line:84%
and you have another
golden mean rectangle.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.389 align:middle line:84%
And another square, and
another golden mean rectangle.

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And another square, and
another golden mean rectangle.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.170 align:middle line:90%
And that will go on forever.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And you can go
out the other way.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.350 align:middle line:84%
You can take the longer
edge and make a square,

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.480 align:middle line:84%
and that's a bigger
golden mean rectangle.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And then you can take the longer
edge and make another square,

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.930 align:middle line:84%
and that will be another
golden mean rectangle.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.140 align:middle line:90%
So it would go in forever.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And it'll go out forever,
with no beginning and no end.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And then you have two
primary lines of energy

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.090 align:middle line:90%
that move through this.

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.540 align:middle line:84%
If you take the
diagonals across here,

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.280 align:middle line:84%
which is a square root of
2 triangle, across here,

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.920 align:middle line:84%
and the diagonal
comes this way, that

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.220 align:middle line:90%
is the male energy of a spiral.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.744 align:middle line:84%
And if you take the arcing
curve across here, and then

00:05:26.744 --> 00:05:30.260 align:middle line:84%
here, and then
here, and such, this

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.710 align:middle line:84%
is the female energy of
a golden mean spiral.

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.725 align:middle line:84%
Both of them are there,
every time, at once.

00:05:36.725 --> 00:05:40.760 align:middle line:90%


00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.700 align:middle line:84%
You usually see, in nature,
the female part of it manifest.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.410 align:middle line:90%
Though that isn't always true.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.815 align:middle line:84%
A good example of that
is the business crystal.

00:05:49.815 --> 00:05:54.720 align:middle line:84%
The business crystal
looks just like this.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.855 align:middle line:90%
That's how its shape is.

00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:58.070 align:middle line:84%
It's the male part
of the spiral.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.760 align:middle line:84%
But almost always, it's
the female part spiral

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.860 align:middle line:90%
that is formed.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And if you take the diagonals
of a golden mean rectangle,

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.850 align:middle line:84%
this point to this
one, to this diagonal,

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.440 align:middle line:84%
and there's another one that I
didn't draw in here from here,

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.330 align:middle line:84%
they will locate
the exact center.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:20.390 align:middle line:90%


00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Well this shape is real,
real important in life, too.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.746 align:middle line:90%
It's a logarithmic curve.

00:06:26.746 --> 00:06:31.860 align:middle line:84%
It has been said by other
sacred geometry people

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.970 align:middle line:84%
that if you take from
the navel and draw

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.040 align:middle line:84%
a line across the
imaginary square,

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.560 align:middle line:84%
that this is a golden mean
rectangle around there.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's been said
that you would then

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.990 align:middle line:84%
be able to draw a
logarithmic spiral.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.350 align:middle line:84%
It would come around and
it would focus exactly

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:54.280 align:middle line:84%
on the diagonal going
from here to here.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.340 align:middle line:90%
I believe that's almost true.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.762 align:middle line:84%
And I have to explain
in a moment what I mean.

00:06:59.762 --> 00:07:02.310 align:middle line:84%
I personally do
not believe there

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:09.070 align:middle line:84%
are any logarithmic spirals in
existence, naturally forming.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.246 align:middle line:84%
I'll have to explain
myself here in a moment.

00:07:13.246 --> 00:07:16.110 align:middle line:90%


00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.860 align:middle line:84%
But this is real, real
close to the truth.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.550 align:middle line:90%


00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And that if you were
to take this line here,

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:28.011 align:middle line:84%
this one here that forms the
square, and continue it up,

00:07:28.011 --> 00:07:29.010 align:middle line:90%
then that's another one.

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:32.169 align:middle line:84%
That's another golden mean
rectangle, or close to it.

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And then if you took this line
over here, that's another one.

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And if you continue
that around, you

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:39.150 align:middle line:90%
find there are eight of them.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.550 align:middle line:84%
There are eight of these
golden mean rectangles

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:44.240 align:middle line:84%
around the human body
associated with the eight

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.050 align:middle line:90%
possible diagonals.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:51.890 align:middle line:10%
There's one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:54.070 align:middle line:10%
eight possible diagonals.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:55.875 align:middle line:84%
And there are eight
golden mean rectangles

00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:57.470 align:middle line:90%
that spiral around the body.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:59.960 align:middle line:10%
Then these eight
spiraling forms of energy

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.540 align:middle line:10%
come and terminate these
eight places around the body.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:07.500 align:middle line:10%
And this pattern right around
the original eight cells

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.980 align:middle line:10%
that are located in the
precise center of that pattern.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:14.630 align:middle line:84%
Leonardo drew these
lines on the body.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And if you drew the lines
down from where he put them

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:22.600 align:middle line:84%
on there, it forms
this primary grid

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.390 align:middle line:84%
where it shows these four
places in the middle,

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:28.640 align:middle line:84%
and these eight places
around the outer edge, which

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.820 align:middle line:84%
happened to be the squares where
the eight primary spirals come

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.039 align:middle line:90%
in focus in on it.

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:37.230 align:middle line:84%
If you complete
that grid totally,

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:42.620 align:middle line:84%
you would find that it's a
grid of 64 squares, which

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.340 align:middle line:84%
has a direct relationship
to the I Ching

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:50.160 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of other things, the
DNA molecule and other stuff.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.870 align:middle line:84%
But I'm gonna stop
that just for a moment

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:56.950 align:middle line:84%
and come back and
address something.

00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And that is this statement
I made that I don't believe

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:05.430 align:middle line:90%
there's a logarithmic spiral.

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:07.885 align:middle line:84%
A logarithmic spiral is
an irrational number,

00:09:07.885 --> 00:09:08.980 align:middle line:90%
as we showed before.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.940 align:middle line:90%
It has no end.

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And it is a spiral that has
no beginning and no end.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's something
that's elusive.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:23.440 align:middle line:84%
You can't get it all, can't
get a hold of the whole thing.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And this whole thing of
having no beginning and no end

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.900 align:middle line:84%
is very, very hard for us,
as humans, to deal with.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:36.790 align:middle line:84%
We have the part
in us that can deal

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:38.340 align:middle line:90%
with something that has no end.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.450 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty easy.

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:43.066 align:middle line:84%
But, at least I do, I have a
really hard time with something

00:09:43.066 --> 00:09:43.982 align:middle line:90%
that has no beginning.

00:09:43.982 --> 00:09:46.580 align:middle line:90%


00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.590 align:middle line:90%
Just think about it.

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:50.650 align:middle line:84%
Think about something
that has no beginning.

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:55.140 align:middle line:90%


00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:57.100 align:middle line:84%
It can go on forever
once it's started.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:58.010 align:middle line:90%
But once it isn't?

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:01.560 align:middle line:84%
But it's hard because we
are geometrical in nature,

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.350 align:middle line:90%
which always has a center.

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And if we can't find
a center, our mind

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.540 align:middle line:84%
just doesn't know how
to deal with that.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.400 align:middle line:84%
Well that's because it's
an irrational number.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.070 align:middle line:90%
It's irrational.

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And so what life has done,
it's really ingenious.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:25.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it is the most brilliant
thing that I've ever seen.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:30.280 align:middle line:84%
Life has figured out a way
to get around this problem.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.590 align:middle line:84%
It's like God said
to life, OK, do

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.670 align:middle line:90%
this thing that's impossible.

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:38.570 align:middle line:90%
And we said, it's impossible!

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And then we said,
oh, but I know a way.

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:44.370 align:middle line:90%


00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:46.640 align:middle line:90%
I know how I can do this.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.740 align:middle line:90%
And this is what happened.

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:51.950 align:middle line:84%
There was a man named
Leonardo Fibonacci.

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:54.320 align:middle line:84%
He was a little bit
almost contemporary

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.220 align:middle line:84%
with Leonardo daVinci, a
couple hundred years before.

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And he was an
interesting person.

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:02.640 align:middle line:84%
He was kind of a
lone type that used

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.590 align:middle line:84%
to walk through
forests and everything

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:06.300 align:middle line:90%
to relax in the forest.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.751 align:middle line:90%
You know, right brain stuff.

00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:09.250 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, his left brain

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:10.458 align:middle line:90%
was clicking on all the time.

00:11:10.458 --> 00:11:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And he kept noticing the
mathematics of the plant life

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:15.960 align:middle line:90%
and everything around him.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And as I understand it, it was
this plant that triggered it.

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:20.480 align:middle line:90%
It's called sneezewort plant.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.570 align:middle line:84%
He probably smelled it
and sneezed [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:27.820 align:middle line:84%
But what it was, he noticed
the leaf pattern on it.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.860 align:middle line:84%
A sneezewort plant comes
up and has one leaf,

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.990 align:middle line:90%
and then it grows one more.

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:34.660 align:middle line:90%
And then it grows two.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.130 align:middle line:90%
And then it grows three.

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And then five, and then
eight, and has 13 flowers.

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:43.080 align:middle line:84%
There's that 1,
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.820 align:middle line:90%
And he wrote that down.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.630 align:middle line:10%
And he started
noticing-- and these

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:50.330 align:middle line:10%
were the things he wrote down--
he found out that lilies--

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:53.310 align:middle line:10%
and of course there's lots
more examples than these,

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:58.150 align:middle line:10%
but this is what he got-- lilies
and irises have three petals.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:01.730 align:middle line:10%
And buttercups and larkspurs
and columbines have five.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:03.830 align:middle line:10%
And some delphiniums have eight.

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:05.990 align:middle line:10%
Corn marigolds have 13.

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:07.710 align:middle line:10%
Some asters have 21.

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:13.590 align:middle line:10%
And daisies almost always have
either 34, 55, or 89 petals.

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:18.230 align:middle line:10%
And he looked at and he said,
hey, there's something there.

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:34.160 align:middle line:10%
So we had this sequence of 1,
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.100 align:middle line:10%
Again, we showed you this
one once before, where

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.910 align:middle line:10%
if you add 3 to 5, you get 8.

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:40.710 align:middle line:90%
5 to 8, you get 13.

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:43.248 align:middle line:84%
And 8 and 23, you
get 21, et cetera.

00:12:43.248 --> 00:12:44.920 align:middle line:90%
Like that.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.480 align:middle line:10%
And that sequence became
known as the Fibonacci,

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.240 align:middle line:10%
or Fibronacci,
Sequence, depending

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.840 align:middle line:10%
on how you wanna say it.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:55.372 align:middle line:10%
Here's an example of the
hibiscus flower which

00:12:55.372 --> 00:12:57.630 align:middle line:10%
has five petals
facing out this way,

00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:59.756 align:middle line:10%
and the stamen comes out
in five petals facing down

00:12:59.756 --> 00:13:00.555 align:middle line:10%
the other way.

00:13:00.555 --> 00:13:01.730 align:middle line:90%
Pentagon facing one way.

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:03.834 align:middle line:90%
Pentagon facing the other way.

00:13:03.834 --> 00:13:05.250 align:middle line:84%
Of course, when
we look at plants,

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:07.840 align:middle line:84%
we don't really think of
them as being geometrical.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.850 align:middle line:90%
But they are.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is what life
did to solve the problem.

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:29.754 align:middle line:84%
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,
13, 21, 34, 55, 89.

00:13:29.754 --> 00:13:33.226 align:middle line:90%


00:13:33.226 --> 00:13:40.666 align:middle line:90%
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.

00:13:40.666 --> 00:13:46.620 align:middle line:90%


00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:51.020 align:middle line:90%
I'll go this far on it.

00:13:51.020 --> 00:14:00.266 align:middle line:84%
Remember this number
of a phi equals 1.6180.

00:14:00.266 --> 00:14:02.270 align:middle line:90%
We'll go that far on it.

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And look what happens
when you divide the one

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:11.930 align:middle line:90%
term into the previous term.

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:17.740 align:middle line:84%
If you divide 1
into 1, it equals 1.

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:20.590 align:middle line:84%
Now one can get a lot
smaller in this number.

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And if you divide 1
into 2, you get 2.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:27.360 align:middle line:84%
Which is a lot bigger
than this number.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.810 align:middle line:84%
If you divide 2 into
3, you get 1.5, which

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:34.830 align:middle line:90%
is smaller than this number.

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:38.960 align:middle line:84%
If you divide 3 into
5, you get 1.66,

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:45.590 align:middle line:84%
I believe, yes,
which is greater.

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:51.950 align:middle line:84%
If you divide 5 into
8, you get 1.60,

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:53.700 align:middle line:90%
which is under the number.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:59.850 align:middle line:84%
8 into 13 is 1.625, which
is slightly greater.

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:05.260 align:middle line:90%
13 into 21 is 1.615, just under.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:11.800 align:middle line:90%
21 into 34 is 1.619, just over.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:19.120 align:middle line:84%
34 into 55, 1.6176,
which is under.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:27.000 align:middle line:90%
55 into 89, 1.6181, just over.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:34.250 align:middle line:90%
89 into 144, 1.6179775.

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:41.040 align:middle line:90%
44 into 233, 1.61805.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.900 align:middle line:84%
In mathematics, it's
called asymptotically

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.090 align:middle line:90%
reaching the limit.

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:47.340 align:middle line:84%
It will just keep getting
closer and closer and closer

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.930 align:middle line:84%
and closer as the
numbers increase.

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:53.250 align:middle line:84%
It'll never reach it,
but it'll get so close,

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:55.170 align:middle line:90%
you can't tell it apart.

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:56.720 align:middle line:90%
You can't see it.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And so when you look at
things in life-- well,

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:03.880 align:middle line:84%
let me just show you
an example in a moment.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:07.590 align:middle line:84%
This will be a geometrical
view of what you're doing.

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:12.544 align:middle line:84%
Here's these four places
around the human body.

00:16:12.544 --> 00:16:14.960 align:middle line:84%
Remember, there's four spots
we talked about in the basis.

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.670 align:middle line:84%
And there's eight
squares around it.

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:19.210 align:middle line:84%
We're going to pick one,
like that one right there.

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to take
the diagonal across one

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:24.410 align:middle line:84%
of those little squares and use
that as our measuring stick.

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:26.930 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to call it 1.

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And so the diagonal that goes
across that little square

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:31.440 align:middle line:90%
there will be 1.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And then turn 90 degrees
and go to the next term, 1.

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:37.310 align:middle line:90%
Turn 90 degrees.

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:38.110 align:middle line:90%
The next term is 2.

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:39.390 align:middle line:90%
So you go two diagonals.

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:40.630 align:middle line:90%
And then three.

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:41.820 align:middle line:90%
Then five.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:43.320 align:middle line:90%
Then eight.

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.020 align:middle line:90%
Then 13.

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:45.820 align:middle line:90%
Then 21.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:46.255 align:middle line:90%
Then 34.

00:16:46.255 --> 00:16:46.690 align:middle line:90%
Then 55.

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:47.560 align:middle line:90%
Then 89.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And you can see this
spiral coming out,

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:56.400 align:middle line:90%
which will look just like that.

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.015 align:middle line:84%
This is inside of
a nautilus shell.

00:16:59.015 --> 00:17:01.550 align:middle line:90%


00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:04.890 align:middle line:84%
With this incredible precision,
moving out from there,

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:08.500 align:middle line:90%
this spiral comes out like this.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And each one of
these chambers is

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:18.390 align:middle line:84%
more and more and more accurate
in the creation of the spiral.

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:22.109 align:middle line:84%
But if you remember, over
here in the beginning,

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:23.770 align:middle line:84%
as you go back
toward the beginning,

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:28.000 align:middle line:84%
it gets less and less
and less accurate, right?

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean in the
beginning, it's 1 and 2,

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:33.880 align:middle line:90%
which is way off, way under.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:37.650 align:middle line:90%
And then closer.

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:41.500 align:middle line:84%
Look what happens when you
go way back in the center.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.050 align:middle line:84%
Can you see these
first three ones?

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:46.890 align:middle line:84%
The first one came over here
and hit the edge and bent.

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:48.580 align:middle line:84%
The next one came
around and bent over

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.210 align:middle line:84%
because it wasn't
even aimed right.

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And then three
came out like that.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:54.400 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until the
fourth one that it

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:58.325 align:middle line:84%
starting to fit properly,
which is the closest.

00:17:58.325 --> 00:18:02.150 align:middle line:90%


00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:05.550 align:middle line:84%
Actually it was the one, two,
three, four, the fifth one

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:08.070 align:middle line:90%
where it started getting close.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:10.240 align:middle line:84%
Which is down
here, where it just

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.920 align:middle line:90%
starts to begin to approximate.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.167 align:middle line:84%
And so if you
looked at this, you

00:18:15.167 --> 00:18:17.500 align:middle line:84%
would think that the nautilus
shell made a mistake there

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:18.789 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning.

00:18:18.789 --> 00:18:21.330 align:middle line:84%
You think, well that guy didn't
know what he was doing there.

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And [INAUDIBLE] didn't
know what he was doing.

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:23.930 align:middle line:90%
This is an egg shell.

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:28.050 align:middle line:84%
It's that first squid
that lives inside here.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And the mommy creates this
shell, and the nautilus blows

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:36.300 align:middle line:84%
gas through these
little tubes that

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.680 align:middle line:84%
causes the shell
to rise and come up

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.070 align:middle line:90%
the surface where it feeds.

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And it sucks the gas up, and
sinks to incredible depths

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:44.470 align:middle line:90%
below.

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:47.142 align:middle line:90%


00:18:47.142 --> 00:18:48.350 align:middle line:90%
It's really pretty ingenious.

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:50.354 align:middle line:84%
Then when it gets big
enough, it leaves.

00:18:50.354 --> 00:18:51.770 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't need
the shell anymore.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:54.670 align:middle line:84%
It leaves and these come up
and float up on the surface.

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:57.260 align:middle line:84%
So you can see the very
mathematics going on.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's no
mistakes in here.

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:05.200 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly proper according
to what we have figured out

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.570 align:middle line:90%
on how to make this spiral.

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:09.940 align:middle line:84%
So this spiral isn't
a logarithmic spiral,

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:13.010 align:middle line:84%
though many books will
tell you that it is.

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:13.960 align:middle line:90%
It isn't logarithmic.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.840 align:middle line:90%
It's a Fibonacci spiral.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.570 align:middle line:90%
It's different.

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:20.250 align:middle line:84%
Remember in Egypt they had
those two spirals that came off?

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:23.030 align:middle line:84%
One was Fibonacci,
and one was there.

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:24.400 align:middle line:90%
We're gonna show that again.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:27.270 align:middle line:84%
The difference between these
two is very, very important

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.240 align:middle line:90%
in life.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.870 align:middle line:90%
This is the pinecone.

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And you have spirals
running this way around it,

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:37.650 align:middle line:84%
and you also have spirals
running in this way around it.

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:40.510 align:middle line:84%
You have two
counter-rotating spirals,

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:42.790 align:middle line:84%
one going one way,
one going the other.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And if you counted all
the spirals going one way,

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:47.721 align:middle line:84%
and then you count all the
spirals going the other way,

00:19:47.721 --> 00:19:50.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't hear if it's a daisy
or a sunflower, or this, or any

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:55.820 align:middle line:84%
other-- a pineapple,
anything else--

00:19:55.820 --> 00:20:01.420 align:middle line:84%
you'll find that it's always two
sequential Fibonacci sequence

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:05.170 align:middle line:84%
numbers that determine how
many spirals go one way

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:08.860 align:middle line:84%
and how many spirals
go the other way.

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And this, geometrically,
is the summation

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.500 align:middle line:84%
of what we were
just talking about.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.580 align:middle line:84%
Over here is the
golden mean rectangle.

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And this is a
Fibonacci rectangle.

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:25.200 align:middle line:84%
This edge is the same as
this edge in both of them.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.585 align:middle line:84%
And this is one, and this
one, and this edge is one,

00:20:28.585 --> 00:20:29.460 align:middle line:90%
and this edge is one.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:34.130 align:middle line:84%
So these two squares
are exactly the same.

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:37.170 align:middle line:84%
The difference lies in
the part that's left over.

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:41.520 align:middle line:84%
In the Fibonacci one,
it's just 2 more squares.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:46.860 align:middle line:84%
But in a golden mean one,
it's a little bit greater.

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:51.340 align:middle line:84%
Instead of being
0.5, it's 0.618.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a
difference of 0.118,

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:56.350 align:middle line:90%
this little, tiny difference.

00:20:56.350 --> 00:21:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And so as this one starts over
here and goes 1, 1, 2, 3, 5,

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:07.100 align:middle line:84%
this one starts in here at some
undefined place, and comes out.

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And very, very quickly, you
could not tell the two apart.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.550 align:middle line:84%
Because this little tiny
piece, geometrically,

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:15.820 align:middle line:84%
get smaller, and
smaller, and smaller,

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:18.600 align:middle line:84%
proportionate to the squares
that get bigger, and bigger,

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.930 align:middle line:90%
and bigger.

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:22.100 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
this square here,

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:28.830 align:middle line:84%
that what proportion
of 0.118, is very big.

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Relative to the line,
that's a big piece.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:33.540 align:middle line:84%
Here is the same amount
relative to this square.

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.920 align:middle line:90%
Now that's a lot smaller.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:39.610 align:middle line:84%
Relative to this square, that
little piece is even smaller.

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is
that little piece is fixed.

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:46.180 align:middle line:90%
And it just goes to 0.

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:50.010 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't think it, but from
the Egyptian point of view,

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:55.000 align:middle line:84%
this is real important in
understanding resurrection.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.480 align:middle line:84%
The very chamber,
the King's Chamber

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:02.440 align:middle line:84%
which so many people said is a
golden mean rectangle, is not.

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:07.325 align:middle line:84%
It is two perfectly
equal squares.

00:22:07.325 --> 00:22:10.650 align:middle line:90%


00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And the height of
the King's Chamber

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:16.920 align:middle line:90%
is one half the diagonal.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:20.040 align:middle line:90%


00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is all
Fibonacci sequence stuff,

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:25.750 align:middle line:90%
this King's Chamber.

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:30.560 align:middle line:84%
The sarcophagus sits over
here, in over here like this.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And these proportions
are not golden mean.

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:33.460 align:middle line:90%
They're Fibonacci.

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:35.490 align:middle line:90%


00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:38.480 align:middle line:90%
Because that was the key.

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:42.140 align:middle line:84%
The very shape of the
room was the key to what

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:43.510 align:middle line:90%
they were doing in there.

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:47.240 align:middle line:84%
You'll see when we get
to that part of it.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:50.910 align:middle line:84%
So this has no
beginning and no end.

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:53.000 align:middle line:84%
This has a very, very
definite beginning.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.300 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't necessarily
have to have an end.

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:57.620 align:middle line:90%
And that's who we are.

00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:59.620 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have a
problem with some of these.

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:01.070 align:middle line:90%
There's no beginning.

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:03.432 align:middle line:84%
Is there answer any questions
on this one statement?

00:23:03.432 --> 00:23:04.232 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:23:04.232 --> 00:23:08.590 align:middle line:84%
>>My question on that is
that with the golden mean,

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:13.845 align:middle line:84%
does that means it
connects itself at one

00:23:13.845 --> 00:23:17.110 align:middle line:90%
end somewhere along the line?

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:21.040 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't have a beginning
and an end, then it loops.

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:25.110 align:middle line:84%
Have you thought
along those lines?

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:27.000 align:middle line:90%
>>Well.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>>It's not in this
dimension, I know that.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>>You can think
along those lines.

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.760 align:middle line:90%
And that may be true.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:41.080 align:middle line:84%
That would be a mathematical,
theoretical approach to it.

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:45.520 align:middle line:84%
But purely from a
geometrical image of the eye,

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:48.240 align:middle line:84%
if you have a
vortex, that vortex

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:52.830 align:middle line:84%
can rotate in that
direction forever.

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And it can go in forever,
absolutely forever,

00:23:57.530 --> 00:23:59.210 align:middle line:90%
and ever, and ever, and ever.

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:01.550 align:middle line:90%
Of course, all space is curved.

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And so you could
probably come up

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:11.820 align:middle line:84%
with some kind of mathematics
that might support that idea.

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:14.980 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not looking
at it like that.

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:17.920 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, I could
see what you're saying.

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:21.640 align:middle line:90%


00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:25.070 align:middle line:84%
So like, electromagnetic
fields are the same way.

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:28.380 align:middle line:90%
They are all looping patterns.

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:32.654 align:middle line:84%
But they do not bend
back on themselves.

00:24:32.654 --> 00:24:35.020 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>>It's like red light and
purple light don't meet.

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:43.530 align:middle line:84%
Red has a long wavelength,
purple has a short wavelength.

00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And instead of meeting, purple
goes into ultraviolet light.

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And just transmutes into
something different.

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And red light doesn't
come from purple.

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:59.070 align:middle line:90%
It comes from infrared.

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:01.270 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:04.022 align:middle line:84%
But I hear what you're saying,
but all I can say is just,

00:25:04.022 --> 00:25:04.822 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:25:04.822 --> 00:25:07.380 align:middle line:90%


00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:08.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:11.420 align:middle line:84%
>>The consciousness, we're
getting in a Fibonacci spiral

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:13.260 align:middle line:90%
or in the logarithmic?

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>I believe the consciousness
works in Fibonacci.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.610 align:middle line:84%
Everything about
us is Fibonacci.

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:20.200 align:middle line:90%
We're totally Fibonacci.

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:23.730 align:middle line:84%
>>So then potentially, the
wider our consciousness

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:25.550 align:middle line:84%
got, in terms of more
of a universal mind,

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:29.000 align:middle line:84%
the closer we get
towards that ideal then?

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.155 align:middle line:84%
>>The more closer that we would
approach that mathematically.

00:25:33.155 --> 00:25:36.170 align:middle line:84%
It very rapidly
approaches it, so quickly

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:41.890 align:middle line:84%
that there's just no way to
visually see the difference.

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:44.740 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't take very
long for that thing

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:47.580 align:middle line:84%
to expand out there
before you just, you

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:54.230 align:middle line:84%
can't already have an instrument
that can detect any difference.

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:56.094 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:56.094 --> 00:25:57.510 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty ingenious
what we did.

00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:59.670 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it really is.

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:02.680 align:middle line:84%
It's an amazing
solution to a problem.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.110 align:middle line:84%
>>I think I might have missed
an important transition

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:07.410 align:middle line:84%
point, because this
whole discussion started

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:10.195 align:middle line:84%
upon the square
within the circle.

00:26:10.195 --> 00:26:11.820 align:middle line:84%
>>And where are we
going with all this?

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:16.970 align:middle line:84%
>>We're going with the
drawing by Leonardo.

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:19.200 align:middle line:90%
It's not placed in the same way.

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And I don't quite understand
how the perfection of all

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:29.030 align:middle line:84%
of the mathematics in there can
happen when this square is not

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:31.166 align:middle line:84%
placed in the same
proportion that it

00:26:31.166 --> 00:26:33.570 align:middle line:84%
was in the original drawing,
where it was directly

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:34.370 align:middle line:90%
in the center.

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:35.280 align:middle line:90%
It's moved down.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.957 align:middle line:90%


00:26:37.957 --> 00:26:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>>Oh, you mean in
the original drawing

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:41.623 align:middle line:84%
where we started with in
the very, very beginning?

00:26:41.623 --> 00:26:42.500 align:middle line:90%
>>Right, exactly.

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:43.300 align:middle line:90%
It was centered.

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:44.914 align:middle line:90%
And then with Leonardo--

00:26:44.914 --> 00:26:46.330 align:middle line:84%
>>With Leonardo,
that's what I was

00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:50.844 align:middle line:84%
saying is that-- you missed an
important little piece there.

00:26:50.844 --> 00:26:51.885 align:middle line:90%
Where's the next in this?

00:26:51.885 --> 00:26:53.150 align:middle line:90%
This goes back to it?

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:53.950 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:58.680 align:middle line:90%


00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.900 align:middle line:84%
This is the center
of the circle, right?

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:02.850 align:middle line:84%
This is the center
of the square?

00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:04.532 align:middle line:84%
That difference,
between the navel

00:27:04.532 --> 00:27:07.970 align:middle line:84%
and the base of the spine,
is a sacred proportion.

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:13.170 align:middle line:84%
It happens to be the distance
between the line of your hand

00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:14.940 align:middle line:90%
to the longest finger.

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:20.030 align:middle line:84%
Which, he also drew a line on
the right wrist showing that.

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:22.512 align:middle line:84%
That distance of
your hand in there

00:27:22.512 --> 00:27:24.470 align:middle line:84%
is identical to the same
one between your navel

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:26.100 align:middle line:90%
and the base of the spine.

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And that is one half
the distance of here.

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:32.320 align:middle line:84%
If you could put that
distance above your head,

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.200 align:middle line:90%
it would hit exactly one half.

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that if you brought
the circle down to here,

00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:42.580 align:middle line:84%
that shape that we started
out with would happen.

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:45.721 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
parameter of the square

00:27:45.721 --> 00:27:47.220 align:middle line:84%
and the circumference
of the circle,

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:50.021 align:middle line:90%
are very, very, very close.

00:27:50.021 --> 00:27:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>>Well I understand that,
the sacred proportion

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:55.880 align:middle line:90%
that you're talking about.

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:58.150 align:middle line:84%
So that was what
prompted him to move it

00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:01.480 align:middle line:84%
down and prove that the geometry
still works out perfectly?

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.110 align:middle line:84%
Because I would think that
from the original drawing,

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:07.900 align:middle line:84%
it would have to be placed
perfectly in center,

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.760 align:middle line:84%
that the square would
have to be centered

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:11.740 align:middle line:90%
within the circle at all times.

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:13.930 align:middle line:84%
The fact that he chose
that sacred proportion

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:17.480 align:middle line:84%
to bring it down, I don't
quite understand how it--

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.600 align:middle line:84%
>>He wanted to
show you that this

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:24.410 align:middle line:84%
is an important
relationship, that when

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:27.400 align:middle line:84%
the squares around here
are centered there,

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.960 align:middle line:84%
the body will fit
inside the circle that

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.190 align:middle line:90%
will be centered on there.

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And that these two
meet, that this

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.890 align:middle line:84%
is an important sacred
relationship between the navel

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:38.350 align:middle line:90%
and the base of the spine.

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:40.080 align:middle line:90%
This is one way of showing that.

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:44.210 align:middle line:84%
He did a lot of really
subtle things in here.

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:48.200 align:middle line:84%
For example, later
on-- and he did this

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:51.020 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of other works too,
because he realized that this

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:54.380 align:middle line:84%
is true throughout
nature-- he's showing

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:56.769 align:middle line:90%
the energy field of a male.

00:28:56.769 --> 00:28:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And he actually, as you're
going to see a little later,

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:02.220 align:middle line:84%
he shows a star
tetrahedral field on there.

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:05.820 align:middle line:84%
He did it by these
simple little lines.

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:06.820 align:middle line:90%
He hid it.

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:10.350 align:middle line:84%
But once you bring
it out, you see it,

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:13.890 align:middle line:84%
it's the tetrahedral
field for a man.

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:18.140 align:middle line:84%
But he knew that the
female was a mirror image.

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:19.570 align:middle line:90%
It's an exact mirror image.

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:21.920 align:middle line:84%
The female and male
ones are mirror images.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:25.930 align:middle line:84%
Now the male has its
tetrahedral field

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:29.960 align:middle line:84%
like that, where the
female has hers like that.

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:31.850 align:middle line:90%
It's a mirror image.

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:36.055 align:middle line:84%
And so in order to just
two slyly tell you that,

00:29:36.055 --> 00:29:39.080 align:middle line:84%
he wrote his writing so that
the only way you can read it

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.490 align:middle line:90%
is with a mirror up to it.

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:43.926 align:middle line:84%
You have to hold a mirror
up here to read it.

00:29:43.926 --> 00:29:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And he knew that
the mirror image

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:48.240 align:middle line:84%
extended throughout
nature and everything.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.120 align:middle line:84%
There was always
these mirror images.

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:53.250 align:middle line:84%
The mirror images in the
mind and all these things.

00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:55.500 align:middle line:90%
This guy was really brilliant.

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And they were always
secretly hiding everything.

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And he did it in
very subtle ways.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.750 align:middle line:84%
They're extremely
logical, once you

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:06.100 align:middle line:90%
understand what he's saying.

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:08.550 align:middle line:84%
Took me a while to figure
out how he thought.

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:13.790 align:middle line:84%
And after awhile, you'll see
that this simple drawing has

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:16.670 align:middle line:84%
a hidden pattern behind
it that is incredibly

00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:22.150 align:middle line:84%
complex that describes all these
energy fields around the body.

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing that lead me
to think that there was really

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:31.510 align:middle line:84%
something here is the
mass consciousness

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:33.990 align:middle line:90%
around this particular drawing.

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:37.490 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we all have a
real strong emotional feeling

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:38.290 align:middle line:90%
for this.

00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:40.270 align:middle line:90%
It's being used constantly.

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:45.200 align:middle line:84%
It'll flash on a screen for
one frame, and we pick it up.

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:46.800 align:middle line:90%
We won't let go of it.

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:51.100 align:middle line:84%
We know that there's something
real important here, all of us.

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:52.630 align:middle line:84%
We know there's
something important.

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And we're not
going to let it go.

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And yet, this has become one
of his most important works.

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:01.140 align:middle line:90%
And it was a sketch.

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:04.250 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't meant
even for public use.

00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:07.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's the "Mona Lisa,"
which has become important.

00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:11.080 align:middle line:84%
But this is really more
popular than the "Mona Lisa."

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:13.150 align:middle line:84%
It's reached deeper
into our psyche

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:15.350 align:middle line:90%
than the very "Mona Lisa."

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:17.140 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:21.900 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a real powerful
truth coming off that page.

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:24.880 align:middle line:90%
And we can't help but feel it.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And when I show you what
he was into, totally,

00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:35.760 align:middle line:84%
I think you'll really know why
that it's so powerful for us.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:39.090 align:middle line:90%
We just don't have any choice.

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:42.630 align:middle line:90%
It's really important for us.

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:44.540 align:middle line:84%
Remember we showed how
this grid was here?

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Well if we complete the
grid, complete all the lines,

00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:51.060 align:middle line:84%
like he drew a line on the
elbow that came down like that,

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:52.620 align:middle line:84%
make the line go
all the way down.

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:54.210 align:middle line:84%
Make them all
complete themselves,

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:55.590 align:middle line:90%
all the way through.

00:31:55.590 --> 00:32:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And you end up with a grid of
64 squares around the body.

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:02.700 align:middle line:84%
The head is one
of these squares.

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:06.860 align:middle line:84%
The head size is exactly
1/64th of the whole thing

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:08.630 align:middle line:90%
that he laid out here.

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And you realize it's
interesting because now you

00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:17.110 align:middle line:84%
know that six squares
in a row like this

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:19.710 align:middle line:90%
is a Fibonacci rectangle.

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:21.620 align:middle line:90%
And so this is a series.

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:22.900 align:middle line:90%
The human body's still here.

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:25.720 align:middle line:84%
Here's the head, the feet come
across, the arms come across,

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.770 align:middle line:90%
the feet down here.

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:30.030 align:middle line:90%
This is the center of the body.

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And this is a Fibonacci
rectangle coming around here.

00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:39.880 align:middle line:84%
The blue one stretching up to
here is another Fibonacci one.

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:47.340 align:middle line:84%
So you have all these Fibonacci
rectangles that are in there.

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:48.690 align:middle line:90%
There is this thing.

00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm about to
show you could potentially

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:57.360 align:middle line:84%
change the planet's life big
time if it ever gets out.

00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:58.350 align:middle line:90%
And it's trying to.

00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And it probably won't,
because it's too big.

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.930 align:middle line:84%
But there's a new science
coming out in the world.

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:07.800 align:middle line:84%
It's about ready to
change everything.

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:11.210 align:middle line:84%
It'll have more influence
if it ever gets out there

00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:14.670 align:middle line:84%
than anything that's ever
hit our planet before.

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:17.670 align:middle line:84%
It's called zero
point technology.

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:20.670 align:middle line:84%
There are certain places
in a sine-wave curve

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:21.500 align:middle line:90%
called zero point.

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:24.390 align:middle line:90%


00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:27.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's technology
out there right now that

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:29.620 align:middle line:84%
can replace every single
thing that we have,

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:35.730 align:middle line:84%
just about, using
nothing but light.

00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:38.300 align:middle line:90%


00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:41.050 align:middle line:84%
Just light, you can do
anything you think of.

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Do things you can't
even think of.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's all based on-- this
is one way of looking at it.

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:52.350 align:middle line:84%
On a sine-wave curve,
there are five places

00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:54.090 align:middle line:90%
where zero point is reached.

00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:58.920 align:middle line:84%
That's here, here,
here, here, here.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:01.110 align:middle line:84%
When we learn how--
and we have already

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:05.590 align:middle line:84%
learned how-- to stop light
at these particular places

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:09.719 align:middle line:84%
and resume it in
patterns at these places,

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:13.320 align:middle line:84%
things will be possible that
would not normally be possible.

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:15.900 align:middle line:84%
This is where
creation takes place.

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:18.469 align:middle line:84%
This is that place between
maleness and femaleness.

00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:20.265 align:middle line:84%
It's that place
between the in-breath

00:34:20.265 --> 00:34:23.830 align:middle line:84%
and the out-breath
in meditation.

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:26.179 align:middle line:84%
And geometrically,
it looks like this.

00:34:26.179 --> 00:34:28.739 align:middle line:90%


00:34:28.739 --> 00:34:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Because this is
the energy field,

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:36.690 align:middle line:84%
the grid around the body, or at
least one of the earth bodies.

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:40.340 align:middle line:84%
We have two kinds
of vortex energies.

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:43.480 align:middle line:90%
There's at least two.

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.730 align:middle line:90%
There's two basic ones, anyway.

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:49.699 align:middle line:84%
And one I would give the name
of the white light spiral,

00:34:49.699 --> 00:34:52.340 align:middle line:84%
and the other one the
black light spiral.

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:56.360 align:middle line:84%
There's also the logarithmic
spiral, which is different.

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.255 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
you've got the spiral

00:34:58.255 --> 00:35:02.310 align:middle line:84%
where there's one going one way,
and another going another way.

00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:05.202 align:middle line:84%
That gives you five,
then you've got six.

00:35:05.202 --> 00:35:06.536 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how many there are.

00:35:06.536 --> 00:35:08.160 align:middle line:84%
I've never thought
about it completely.

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.560 align:middle line:90%
But there's two basic kinds.

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:11.910 align:middle line:84%
One is white light, and
the other's black light.

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:14.780 align:middle line:90%
A white light spiral is this.

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:16.490 align:middle line:84%
Remember that thing
where we did 1, 1, 2,

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:18.530 align:middle line:84%
using the diagonals as
our measuring stick?

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:22.220 align:middle line:84%
If you up here in this corner,
here's the center of the body.

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:25.620 align:middle line:84%
Here's these eight places
where these spiraling energies

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:26.980 align:middle line:90%
terminate.

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And in that square,
we come up here.

00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:31.430 align:middle line:90%
This is 1.

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:32.560 align:middle line:90%
Make a 90 degree turn.

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.090 align:middle line:90%
And we go 1.

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:35.510 align:middle line:90%
Next one is two.

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:38.630 align:middle line:84%
Which just hits the
edge of this field.

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:39.900 align:middle line:90%
The next one is three.

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:41.480 align:middle line:90%
One, two, three.

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.000 align:middle line:90%
Just hits the edge of the field.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.390 align:middle line:90%
The next one is 5.

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:46.840 align:middle line:90%
One, two, three, four, five.

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:48.760 align:middle line:90%
Just hits the edge of the field.

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:51.560 align:middle line:10%
Leaves exactly at
three and goes out.

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:54.590 align:middle line:10%
One, one, two, three, five,
reflects inside the field

00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:56.530 align:middle line:10%
and leaves.

00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:58.030 align:middle line:10%
That's the white light spiral.

00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:59.860 align:middle line:10%
But there's another
possibility in there.

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Instead of starting
from up here,

00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:04.600 align:middle line:90%
you could start from down here.

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And this one goes one, one,
two, right through zero point.

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:14.000 align:middle line:90%
3 exactly reflects out.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Leaves precisely at 2,
and if you calculate it,

00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:19.220 align:middle line:84%
it would hit the tip
of there exactly.

00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:26.880 align:middle line:10%
And it's like it reflecting
inside of a cube.

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:31.100 align:middle line:10%
The white light is the male.

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:34.820 align:middle line:10%
And all of the white
light could come this way,

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:40.000 align:middle line:10%
but it could also come
this way and reflect out.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.580 align:middle line:10%
So you have one that could
either rotate this way in,

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:45.670 align:middle line:10%
or rotate this way in.

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:47.260 align:middle line:10%
But none of the
white light spirals,

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:49.420 align:middle line:10%
in any of these eight
places, are going

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:52.890 align:middle line:10%
to even touch this blue area.

00:36:52.890 --> 00:36:55.750 align:middle line:10%
All of the black light spirals,
no matter which way you go,

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:58.105 align:middle line:10%
it's gonna go one,
one, two out this way.

00:36:58.105 --> 00:37:00.610 align:middle line:84%
Or, if you came the other
way, one, one, two this way.

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:02.280 align:middle line:10%
As you look at them
all, they're all

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.630 align:middle line:10%
going to pass right
through this one place

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:07.970 align:middle line:10%
in the center called zero point.

00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:09.260 align:middle line:10%
The male one does not.

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:11.980 align:middle line:10%
The female on always
passes through zero point.

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:17.755 align:middle line:10%
It's the reason that the
female only has the womb.

00:37:17.755 --> 00:37:20.820 align:middle line:90%


00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:22.715 align:middle line:84%
This is the technology
of the womb.

00:37:22.715 --> 00:37:25.440 align:middle line:90%
The geometry of the womb.

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:29.870 align:middle line:90%
It's the geometry of creation.

00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And so what they
are now learning

00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:39.770 align:middle line:84%
is how to create things
right from zero point.

00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:41.780 align:middle line:84%
Once you're in zero point,
that's a great point.

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:44.670 align:middle line:90%
Anything's possible.

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:45.470 align:middle line:90%
Anything at all.

00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:49.110 align:middle line:90%


00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And we're just now emerging out
to begin to understand this.

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:58.637 align:middle line:84%
And science is bulging at the
seams trying to figure out

00:37:58.637 --> 00:37:59.470 align:middle line:90%
how to deal with it.

00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:02.260 align:middle line:90%


00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And these again can be
determined from the human body,

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:08.980 align:middle line:84%
from the very energy
fields inside the body.

00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:11.980 align:middle line:84%
These fields, by the
way, that come around

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:13.109 align:middle line:90%
are really Fibonacci.

00:38:13.109 --> 00:38:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And when you see
that it's Fibonacci,

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:18.090 align:middle line:84%
they form loop-de-loop
patterns of energy,

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:21.410 align:middle line:84%
reflecting energies of
patterns around the body.

00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:23.830 align:middle line:84%
They can either stay
within or leave.

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:25.640 align:middle line:90%
They can leave.

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:29.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't quite know what
all that means yet.

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And I've always been
waiting for them to tell me.

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:36.745 align:middle line:84%
I know it has an important
aspect, in terms of meditation.

00:38:36.745 --> 00:38:40.999 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know exactly
what it means yet.

00:38:40.999 --> 00:38:42.540 align:middle line:84%
But I figured I
would show it anyway.

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:44.970 align:middle line:84%
This zero point technology
that we were talking about

00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:53.180 align:middle line:84%
before-- I'm going to show you
right now just the male field.

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:57.020 align:middle line:84%
This is the entire male
field of the lines of energy

00:38:57.020 --> 00:39:01.230 align:middle line:84%
that come off of the human body
just from those eight places.

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:04.410 align:middle line:84%
These are all the male
spiraling lines that come out.

00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And I've shown you four
of the female trackings.

00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:11.500 align:middle line:84%
So you have one blue
spiral coming up like that.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:15.272 align:middle line:84%
Then the other one
coming like that.

00:39:15.272 --> 00:39:17.547 align:middle line:84%
And I want that purple
one to come like that.

00:39:17.547 --> 00:39:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And then a pink one
go down like that.

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:23.800 align:middle line:84%
Notice these hearts, set
of hearts facing this way

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:26.290 align:middle line:84%
and a set of hearts
facing this way,

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:29.950 align:middle line:84%
and another set of hearts
facing up this way.

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And then a bigger set of
hearts facing over this way.

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And they're all at least 90
degrees angles to each other.

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:40.230 align:middle line:10%
You're going to
see these later on.

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:42.290 align:middle line:10%
But they're real,
real important, again,

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:44.910 align:middle line:10%
in a lot of the research
that's going on.

00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:48.260 align:middle line:10%
None of them pass through
the center four squares.

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:49.060 align:middle line:10%
That's male.

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:50.740 align:middle line:10%
This is the female.

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And the female, these are
all the grid lines coming off

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.250 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And I've just tracked
two of the spirals

00:39:57.010 --> 00:40:01.080 align:middle line:84%
to both the Fibonacci
spirals coming off there.

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.930 align:middle line:84%
You see a heart facing this
way, a heart facing that way,

00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:06.221 align:middle line:84%
and a heart facing this way,
getting bigger and bigger.

00:40:06.221 --> 00:40:13.400 align:middle line:90%


00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:16.400 align:middle line:10%
It's the energy
levels of creation

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:19.140 align:middle line:10%
itself, both male and female.

00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:22.990 align:middle line:10%
And you're just
gonna have to watch

00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:27.249 align:middle line:10%
what this means a little later
as more things unfold here.

00:40:27.249 --> 00:40:29.540 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully this will start
meaning more and more to you.

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:34.644 align:middle line:90%


00:40:34.644 --> 00:40:35.444 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:35.444 --> 00:40:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:42.130 align:middle line:90%
>>Well only that it is the womb.

00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:46.025 align:middle line:84%
What the female contains
is organ in here,

00:40:46.025 --> 00:40:51.720 align:middle line:84%
but in the center of that organ
is this zero point place, which

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:55.104 align:middle line:90%
is based on this geometry.

00:40:55.104 --> 00:40:56.288 align:middle line:90%
Who said that?

00:40:56.288 --> 00:40:57.088 align:middle line:90%
You said that?

00:40:57.088 --> 00:41:01.840 align:middle line:90%


00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.340 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about
the Merkaba, when

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:07.040 align:middle line:84%
we talk about some other places,
I'll bring back this thing.

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:09.120 align:middle line:84%
The Merkaba is just
a huge zero point

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:12.870 align:middle line:84%
field that can take you
through the great void,

00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:18.235 align:middle line:84%
but you can create directly
from it, absolutely directly.

00:41:18.235 --> 00:41:20.840 align:middle line:90%


00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:24.450 align:middle line:84%
>>What is so important to
understand about the zero point

00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:25.720 align:middle line:90%
technology?

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Is it that the whole
power of the universe

resides in this zero point?

00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:37.380 align:middle line:90%
>>Zero point is the great void.

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:39.580 align:middle line:90%
It's where it all began.

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:42.570 align:middle line:84%
>>Where everything becomes
possible from that void?

00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>>It's where from that point,
a change in something--

00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:53.740 align:middle line:84%
we keep passing through
zero point all the time.

00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:56.220 align:middle line:84%
Every time we take a breath,
we go through zero point.

00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:59.220 align:middle line:84%
But usually we pass through
it and come right back

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:01.090 align:middle line:84%
out the other side
with no change.

00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:03.250 align:middle line:90%
Meaning, nothing changes.

00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:08.700 align:middle line:84%
But at zero point, you can
go into it, make a change,

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:13.125 align:middle line:84%
and one in second
come, and everything's

00:42:13.125 --> 00:42:14.000 align:middle line:90%
completely different.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.130 align:middle line:84%
>>So this will have to
do with the [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:19.114 align:middle line:84%

from the Merkaba?

00:42:19.114 --> 00:42:19.914 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:42:19.914 --> 00:42:23.910 align:middle line:90%


00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:26.010 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to know
in that kind of detail.

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Again like I said, you
don't need to know this.

00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:32.439 align:middle line:90%
You just need to know about it.

00:42:32.439 --> 00:42:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>>In other words, you
can manifest anything

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:38.907 align:middle line:84%

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Once you go into zero
point, through the Merkaba,

00:42:44.350 --> 00:42:46.890 align:middle line:84%

we still have the same ratio?

>>Well, not necessarily.

If you were to look at the
five ratios in a Sirian body,

Yeah?

00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:09.560 align:middle line:84%
>>Did you say that
the Fibonacci spiral

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:11.794 align:middle line:90%
has no beginning and no end?

00:44:11.794 --> 00:44:13.096 align:middle line:90%
>>No, it has a beginning.

00:44:13.096 --> 00:44:13.970 align:middle line:90%
>>It has a beginning.

>>OK.

>>Or you could say
it starts at zero.

00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:23.150 align:middle line:90%
>>But the golden mean does not?

00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:24.680 align:middle line:90%
>>Not necessarily.

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:26.400 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:31.090 align:middle line:84%
>>It potentially has no
beginning and no end.

00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:33.000 align:middle line:84%
If you're moving
down it, if you're

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.190 align:middle line:84%
moving down a theoretical one,
you would never find the end.

00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:40.670 align:middle line:84%
If you're moving out,
you'd never find the end.

00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:44.180 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if you're moving
out of a Fibonacci one,

00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:46.665 align:middle line:84%
you would never find
the end, possibly.

00:44:46.665 --> 00:44:48.540 align:middle line:84%
But if you're moving
in, you would definitely

00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:49.915 align:middle line:84%
come to the place
where it began.

00:44:49.915 --> 00:44:52.450 align:middle line:90%


00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:54.350 align:middle line:84%
If you're studying
vortex mechanics,

00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:56.650 align:middle line:84%
there is a man named Walter
Baumgartner if you really

00:44:56.650 --> 00:44:58.280 align:middle line:90%
wanna know what it's all about.

00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:00.990 align:middle line:84%
He was the head of the
Walter Russell school.

00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And I just put his name
on the list here recently.

00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:09.580 align:middle line:84%
But he gives outstanding
workshops on vortex mechanics.

00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:10.380 align:middle line:90%
Outstanding.

00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:12.800 align:middle line:90%


00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.200 align:middle line:90%
Just one second.

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is,
if you have a vortex

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:22.886 align:middle line:84%
of a logarithmic spiral, it
will just keep going in and in,

00:45:22.886 --> 00:45:26.750 align:middle line:84%
and in, and compressing, and
compressing, and compressing.

00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:28.784 align:middle line:84%
If you have a Fibonacci
spiral coming in,

00:45:28.784 --> 00:45:31.620 align:middle line:90%
it'll come in, and in, and in.

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And when it gets
to 1-- click over.

00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:40.080 align:middle line:90%


00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:48.884 align:middle line:84%
It will go 5, 3,
2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5.

00:45:48.884 --> 00:45:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And so it'll go
[WHOOSHING NOISE].

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:54.111 align:middle line:90%


00:45:54.111 --> 00:45:56.036 align:middle line:90%
Like that.

00:45:56.036 --> 00:45:57.160 align:middle line:90%
It'll just come right back.

00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:01.200 align:middle line:84%
It'll reverse polarity
relative to itself.

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:03.070 align:middle line:84%
So even though it's
male, everything's

00:46:03.070 --> 00:46:04.440 align:middle line:90%
got a male and female.

00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:06.288 align:middle line:84%
And so one of those
is going to be male.

00:46:06.288 --> 00:46:08.121 align:middle line:84%
And then it would be
coming back, coming out

00:46:08.121 --> 00:46:10.025 align:middle line:90%
the opposite one, female.

00:46:10.025 --> 00:46:11.925 align:middle line:84%
Or if it's rotating in
this way, then it'll

00:46:11.925 --> 00:46:14.050 align:middle line:84%
still come back out the
opposite polarity going out

00:46:14.050 --> 00:46:16.370 align:middle line:90%
the other way.

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And so that has to a different
kind of effect than something

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:22.532 align:middle line:84%
just going [WHOOSHING NOISE]
in like this.

00:46:22.532 --> 00:46:25.990 align:middle line:90%


00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:26.880 align:middle line:90%
His work's amazing.

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:29.880 align:middle line:90%
He's got some of the things.

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:33.430 align:middle line:90%


00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:34.950 align:middle line:90%
Most of his work is with water.

00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:41.250 align:middle line:90%


00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:45.760 align:middle line:84%
Water wants to rotate in a
very specific spiraling energy.

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And he's got a glass
tube in the exact way

00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:51.720 align:middle line:90%
that water wants to run.

00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And all it is gravity
fed and it's water

00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:56.770 align:middle line:84%
just moving down this small
glass tube in an exact way.

00:46:56.770 --> 00:46:59.140 align:middle line:84%
But because it's moving
exactly the way it wants to,

00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:01.060 align:middle line:90%
it creates all this energy.

00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:03.220 align:middle line:84%
He can hold this light
bulb up next to it,

00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:05.628 align:middle line:84%
it's not even touching
it, and it turns it on.

00:47:05.628 --> 00:47:07.360 align:middle line:90%
It's really pretty good.

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>>My question was about free
energy machine, which I believe

00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:12.230 align:middle line:90%
he is also working with.

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And is it related to this
illustration here on the board?

00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:17.450 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:18.930 align:middle line:84%
All your free
energies are related

00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:21.350 align:middle line:90%
to this or to the zero point.

00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:24.172 align:middle line:84%
And you either look
at it like that,

00:47:24.172 --> 00:47:25.880 align:middle line:84%
or you can look at it
like it's geometry.

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:28.800 align:middle line:84%
But they don't
know the geometry.

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:31.190 align:middle line:84%
At least all the people
I know working on it,

00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:32.940 align:middle line:84%
they have it more
along this line

00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:37.840 align:middle line:84%
and in rotating fields,
which are based upon Merkaba.

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:40.910 align:middle line:84%
Basically Merkaba sciences that
they are trying to develop,

00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:middle line:84%
connecting in with tachyon, or
fourth-dimensional prana energy

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:46.300 align:middle line:90%
to bring it in from there.

00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:50.462 align:middle line:90%


00:47:50.462 --> 00:47:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's trying to get
these free energy machines.

00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:54.905 align:middle line:84%
They already got
free energy machines.

00:47:54.905 --> 00:47:57.360 align:middle line:90%
And we can't use them.

00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:00.670 align:middle line:84%
>>I think you said
it in the video

00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:03.150 align:middle line:84%
that they were already
being manufactured in India.

00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:03.950 align:middle line:90%
>>That's right.

00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:06.490 align:middle line:90%
Not manufactured.

00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:10.320 align:middle line:84%
India and Germany have
already created both the

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:12.860 align:middle line:84%
in machine and Adam
Trombly one also,

00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:15.650 align:middle line:84%
which is another one
other than the in machine.

00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Both of which are
over unity generators.

00:48:20.810 --> 00:48:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And both of them are based
on rotating fields of energy.

00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Different principles,
but they work.

00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:31.744 align:middle line:90%
But nobody can use them.

00:48:31.744 --> 00:48:32.910 align:middle line:90%
You got all this technology.

00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:34.310 align:middle line:90%
There's tons of technology.

00:48:34.310 --> 00:48:38.615 align:middle line:84%
There's so much technology out
there, and it's amazing stuff.

00:48:38.615 --> 00:48:40.155 align:middle line:90%
Can't bring it out.

00:48:40.155 --> 00:48:41.045 align:middle line:90%
Can't use it.

00:48:41.045 --> 00:48:41.935 align:middle line:90%
>>Why?

00:48:41.935 --> 00:48:43.270 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand.

00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>>Because if we
did, everybody dies.

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:46.512 align:middle line:90%
That's why.

00:48:46.512 --> 00:48:47.312 align:middle line:90%
We all die.

00:48:47.312 --> 00:48:49.311 align:middle line:84%
We haven't been able to
figure out how to do it.

00:48:49.311 --> 00:48:50.730 align:middle line:90%
Huh?

00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:52.380 align:middle line:90%
Oh, well, yeah, but it's money.

00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:53.690 align:middle line:90%
See, it's money.

00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:54.800 align:middle line:90%
All that money.

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:57.721 align:middle line:84%
If you bring our
free energy machine--

00:48:57.721 --> 00:48:59.720 align:middle line:84%
say you've got this little
machine about so big,

00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:01.180 align:middle line:90%
and you plug your house into it.

00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And you got free electrical
energy for the rest your life.

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:07.290 align:middle line:84%
No moving parts, or
in one case the atoms

00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:11.350 align:middle line:84%
there's a disk rotating with
magnetic bearings in a vacuum

00:49:11.350 --> 00:49:17.300 align:middle line:84%
so nothing wears out, ever,
what would happen to the world?

00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:20.169 align:middle line:90%


00:49:20.169 --> 00:49:21.710 align:middle line:84%
How many countries
would be destroyed

00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:24.090 align:middle line:90%
utterly and completely?

00:49:24.090 --> 00:49:26.312 align:middle line:84%
How many millions of
people would die overnight?

00:49:26.312 --> 00:49:27.112 align:middle line:90%
>>Why?

00:49:27.112 --> 00:49:28.940 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand.

00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:33.320 align:middle line:84%
>>Because what would happen
to all the oil companies?

00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:34.480 align:middle line:90%
All the oil countries?

00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:38.140 align:middle line:84%
All the Arabs and Saudi Arabia,
and all that stuff like that?

00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:39.550 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of other countries.

00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:43.914 align:middle line:84%
Mexico and all the
people producing oil.

00:49:43.914 --> 00:49:45.390 align:middle line:90%
Wham.

00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:49.080 align:middle line:84%
In a short period of time,
oil will be worthless.

00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:50.254 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely worthless.

00:49:50.254 --> 00:49:52.670 align:middle line:84%
What would happened to all the
oil companies in the United

00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:56.010 align:middle line:84%
States, and all the impact
and all of that stuff?

00:49:56.010 --> 00:49:57.430 align:middle line:84%
You'd be amazed
what would happen.

00:49:57.430 --> 00:50:00.799 align:middle line:84%
See, I thought a long time ago
too, when I got into this, OK,

00:50:00.799 --> 00:50:02.090 align:middle line:90%
let's get out here and do this.

00:50:02.090 --> 00:50:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And so we invented 200
and something inventions.

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:07.770 align:middle line:84%
All of them were on
"Star Trek" level.

00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:12.830 align:middle line:84%
We do things you wouldn't
believe that we could do.

00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And it isn't stuff
we say we could do.

00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:17.307 align:middle line:90%
We can prove it.

00:50:17.307 --> 00:50:18.140 align:middle line:90%
We had the machines.

00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:18.940 align:middle line:90%
We could do it.

00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:22.710 align:middle line:90%
We could do a lot of things.

00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:27.540 align:middle line:84%
But what happens when
you try to put these out?

00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:29.480 align:middle line:84%
No matter what you
try to put out,

00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:31.200 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
hurting somebody,

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:35.100 align:middle line:84%
somewhere in a big time way,
with most things anyway.

00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And the more powerful
impact it has on the world,

00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:40.090 align:middle line:90%
the more powerful it has.

00:50:40.090 --> 00:50:42.053 align:middle line:84%
Supposing that you had
a little light that

00:50:42.053 --> 00:50:44.400 align:middle line:84%
could heal any kind of
disease you could think of,

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:47.204 align:middle line:84%
just supposing there
was such a device,

00:50:47.204 --> 00:50:50.570 align:middle line:84%
then what would happen
to the United States

00:50:50.570 --> 00:50:55.154 align:middle line:84%
if that was released
in the United States?

00:50:55.154 --> 00:50:56.960 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:58.460 align:middle line:84%
>>Doesn't matter
if they believe it.

00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:00.293 align:middle line:84%
What if I had something
that could just tch.

00:51:00.293 --> 00:51:02.032 align:middle line:90%
OK, next.

00:51:02.032 --> 00:51:02.990 align:middle line:90%
Then what would happen?

00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:06.280 align:middle line:90%


00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:09.246 align:middle line:84%
The American Medical
Association would go bankrupt.

00:51:09.246 --> 00:51:11.030 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:12.370 align:middle line:90%
>>You might say, good.

00:51:12.370 --> 00:51:14.270 align:middle line:84%
But we would all
be out of business.

00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:18.030 align:middle line:84%
We would all be destroyed by
it, because it would be like

00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:20.000 align:middle line:90%
if General Motors collapsed.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.370 align:middle line:84%
General Motors collapses,
we're all going to feel that,

00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:24.610 align:middle line:90%
real big time.

00:51:24.610 --> 00:51:28.190 align:middle line:84%
We're already feeling it because
it has been dying slowly.

00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And we're already,
in the United States,

00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:36.000 align:middle line:84%
beginning to feel daily the
impact of what this means.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.167 align:middle line:84%
What happens if all of a sudden
all the banks in the United

00:51:40.167 --> 00:51:41.250 align:middle line:90%
States close the same day?

00:51:41.250 --> 00:51:43.791 align:middle line:84%
>>We won't need money because
we won't have to pay for energy

00:51:43.791 --> 00:51:45.830 align:middle line:90%
or health care, or food or--

00:51:45.830 --> 00:51:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>>Right, if we ever
get to that side.

00:51:48.130 --> 00:51:51.190 align:middle line:84%
But right now, we're addicted
to these other sides.

00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And there's people
that will do anything

00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:57.349 align:middle line:84%
to keep the financial
status quo the same.

00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:59.140 align:middle line:84%
Because of fear and a
lot of other reasons.

>>You're already [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:01.470 --> 00:52:03.070 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes I know they are.

00:52:03.070 --> 00:52:05.830 align:middle line:84%
But when you start talking
about these technological levels

00:52:05.830 --> 00:52:08.062 align:middle line:90%
and all the devices and things--

00:52:08.062 --> 00:52:10.720 align:middle line:90%

00:52:17.322 --> 00:52:19.090 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:52:19.090 --> 00:52:20.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying it's wrong.

00:52:20.530 --> 00:52:23.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm just telling
you what the problem

00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:25.725 align:middle line:84%
is with the people
that are out here that

00:52:25.725 --> 00:52:27.540 align:middle line:90%
have these inventions.

00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:32.400 align:middle line:84%
There's a guy who
used vortex mechanics

00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:36.240 align:middle line:84%
to create a tube-- it's about
30 feet long-- that would suck

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:41.180 align:middle line:84%
in it anything and break it down
into about two micron sizes.

00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:44.232 align:middle line:84%
And then as it moved along
the tube, which never touched

00:52:44.232 --> 00:52:47.385 align:middle line:84%
the sides of the tube, it would
move like magic down this tube

00:52:47.385 --> 00:52:48.610 align:middle line:90%
and come out the other side.

00:52:48.610 --> 00:52:52.000 align:middle line:84%
It would dump it according
to its atomic weight.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And so you could take
garbage and stick this tube

00:52:57.330 --> 00:52:59.900 align:middle line:84%
toward the ground, where
you've got a garbage dump.

00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:03.640 align:middle line:84%
It would pull 200 tons
of garbage, including

00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:06.180 align:middle line:84%
the earth and everything
else, through tube

00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:08.200 align:middle line:90%
at the rate of 200 tons an hour.

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And it come out in
all these little piles

00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:13.265 align:middle line:84%
which happened to be all
the elements of industry.

00:53:13.265 --> 00:53:16.380 align:middle line:90%


00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Solve a lot of
problems, wouldn't it?

00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:23.100 align:middle line:84%
He brought this to LA, and
put two of these, one of them

00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:26.390 align:middle line:84%
on the back of big semi truck,
and drive these into LA.

00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:29.736 align:middle line:84%
Two of them could process
all the garbage in LA.

00:53:29.736 --> 00:53:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And instead of costing
$80 million a year,

00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:38.590 align:middle line:84%
that LA is spending, they could
make money off the garbage,

00:53:38.590 --> 00:53:41.830 align:middle line:84%
because it's in very usable
form, with no garbage.

00:53:41.830 --> 00:53:45.010 align:middle line:84%
Nothing, not a single
thing left over at all.

00:53:45.010 --> 00:53:49.730 align:middle line:90%
And he figured, OK.

00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:51.610 align:middle line:90%
No problem, let's do this.

00:53:51.610 --> 00:53:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And he was immediately
greeted with this goon

00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:57.570 align:middle line:84%
squad that said, if you
even think about doing this,

00:53:57.570 --> 00:53:59.040 align:middle line:90%
you're dead.

00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:00.830 align:middle line:90%
Get out of here.

00:54:00.830 --> 00:54:01.630 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:54:01.630 --> 00:54:03.300 align:middle line:90%
Because it was the mafia.

00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:04.910 align:middle line:90%
It holds the garbage there.

00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:07.232 align:middle line:84%
And they want that
$80 million a year.

00:54:07.232 --> 00:54:09.440 align:middle line:84%
Even though they could make
more money the other way,

00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:10.830 align:middle line:90%
they don't want change.

00:54:10.830 --> 00:54:13.240 align:middle line:84%
They want this money coming
in the way it is right now,

00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:15.720 align:middle line:84%
and they don't want
to change anything.

00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:18.910 align:middle line:90%
And his life was threatened.

00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And so he ended up having to
go to China to get out of here.

00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And they're trying to
develop it in China now.

00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen this
time and time again.

00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example,
many years ago

00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:34.760 align:middle line:84%
we invented two light bulbs made
on technology that they just

00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:37.410 align:middle line:84%
have rediscovered
in the last years.

00:54:37.410 --> 00:54:41.060 align:middle line:84%
But we discovered
this back in 1970.

00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And two of these light bulbs
would light up Yankee Stadium

00:54:46.010 --> 00:54:48.530 align:middle line:90%
brighter than daylight.

00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And they would go for thousands
and thousands of hours.

00:54:51.690 --> 00:54:53.460 align:middle line:84%
20,000 hours, or
something like that.

00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:56.110 align:middle line:90%
And they cost like $25.

00:54:56.110 --> 00:54:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And so we were going
to figure, well

00:54:59.750 --> 00:55:01.790 align:middle line:84%
let's make light bulbs
that will last forever.

00:55:01.790 --> 00:55:04.254 align:middle line:84%
Make little ones, big ones,
and do all this stuff.

00:55:04.254 --> 00:55:05.670 align:middle line:84%
They don't take
hardly any energy,

00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:08.160 align:middle line:84%
because they're based on
totally different principles.

00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:09.863 align:middle line:84%
They're based on
radio waves rather

00:55:09.863 --> 00:55:12.540 align:middle line:90%
than heating [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:16.362 align:middle line:84%
And General Electric found out
that we were going to do this.

00:55:16.362 --> 00:55:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And we thought they were
going to be real happy

00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:20.040 align:middle line:90%
and want to buy these.

00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:20.990 align:middle line:90%
And they came in.

00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:22.470 align:middle line:84%
My partner was in
the other room.

00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:25.280 align:middle line:84%
I did not hear them say
this, but General Electric

00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:27.992 align:middle line:84%
went up to him and said, we
want to buy your light bulb.

00:55:27.992 --> 00:55:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, no, we really
want to do this ourselves.

00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:32.366 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we'll give
you a lot of money for it,

00:55:32.366 --> 00:55:33.442 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:55:33.442 --> 00:55:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And he said, no, no, we
really want to do this.

00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:37.631 align:middle line:84%
And then they just
quickly said, we'll

00:55:37.631 --> 00:55:39.880 align:middle line:84%
give you a million and a
half dollars tomorrow morning

00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:40.630 align:middle line:90%
or you're dead.

00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:41.463 align:middle line:90%
And they walked out.

00:55:41.463 --> 00:55:44.020 align:middle line:90%


00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:45.082 align:middle line:90%
They weren't kidding.

00:55:45.082 --> 00:55:46.290 align:middle line:90%
He knew they weren't kidding.

00:55:46.290 --> 00:55:47.470 align:middle line:90%
He sold it to them.

00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:51.886 align:middle line:84%
General Electric shelved
it because these banks

00:55:51.886 --> 00:55:53.385 align:middle line:84%
of light bulbs in
all these stadiums

00:55:53.385 --> 00:55:56.220 align:middle line:84%
and everything only last
like 25 hours or something.

00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:57.560 align:middle line:90%
They cost a lot of money.

00:55:57.560 --> 00:55:59.393 align:middle line:84%
That's millions, and
millions, and millions,

00:55:59.393 --> 00:56:00.550 align:middle line:90%
and millions of dollars.

00:56:00.550 --> 00:56:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And they would have just
been totally wiped out.

00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And so this was
reinvented recently

00:56:08.010 --> 00:56:12.520 align:middle line:84%
by someone else outside of
General Electric, obviously.

00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:14.530 align:middle line:84%
You now can buy
these light bulbs.

00:56:14.530 --> 00:56:15.612 align:middle line:90%
They finally got it out.

00:56:15.612 --> 00:56:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And I was reading this
statement about it

00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:19.695 align:middle line:84%
and I said, aha, they finally
figured this one out again.

00:56:19.695 --> 00:56:21.010 align:middle line:90%
It took 20 years.

00:56:21.010 --> 00:56:25.215 align:middle line:84%
And they came down here and
they asked General Electric

00:56:25.215 --> 00:56:26.340 align:middle line:90%
what they thought about it.

00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And General Electric
says, oh we had

00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:31.540 align:middle line:84%
invented that many, many,
many, many years ago.

00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:34.050 align:middle line:84%
But we thought that
nobody would want it.

00:56:34.050 --> 00:56:36.370 align:middle line:90%
So we just kept it.

00:56:36.370 --> 00:56:38.330 align:middle line:90%
They admitted that they had it.

00:56:38.330 --> 00:56:40.290 align:middle line:90%

for 23, 22 years.

00:56:48.650 --> 00:56:54.460 align:middle line:84%
They were making probably $50
million a year for 22 years.

00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:56.120 align:middle line:84%
>>So essentially
what you're saying

00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:58.800 align:middle line:84%
is that if
circumstances accelerate

00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:01.010 align:middle line:84%
at the pace they're
going, the whole banking

00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:03.040 align:middle line:84%
system and the government
have to break down

00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:04.590 align:middle line:84%
before any of this
new technology

00:57:04.590 --> 00:57:06.180 align:middle line:90%
could be established?

00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:07.980 align:middle line:90%
>>I don't know that for sure.

00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:10.650 align:middle line:90%
But we would have to cooperate.

00:57:10.650 --> 00:57:13.940 align:middle line:84%
There would have to be
a world cooperation.

00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:17.130 align:middle line:84%
There would have to be a
lot of love happening, which

00:57:17.130 --> 00:57:19.190 align:middle line:90%
we don't have right now.

00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:21.290 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the
fear could go away.

00:57:21.290 --> 00:57:23.950 align:middle line:84%
At which point, if
there was cooperation,

00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:27.900 align:middle line:84%
it could be done in such a way
that the technology could come

00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:29.900 align:middle line:90%
out without people being hurt.

00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:33.110 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
give the invention

00:57:33.110 --> 00:57:35.910 align:middle line:84%
to the oil companies with
the free energy machines

00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:38.140 align:middle line:84%
so that they can
distribute them.

00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:42.270 align:middle line:84%
So that they can replace their
oil with this new invention

00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:44.360 align:middle line:84%
that would generate
the same kind of funds

00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:47.430 align:middle line:90%
but wouldn't wipe them out.

00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:49.380 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to do
something like that.

00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:51.200 align:middle line:84%
If you don't do
something like that,

00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:53.590 align:middle line:90%
you're going to have a war.

00:57:53.590 --> 00:57:56.730 align:middle line:90%
You will continue to have wars.

00:57:56.730 --> 00:58:02.330 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you try to take away
some country's total ability

00:58:02.330 --> 00:58:07.307 align:middle line:84%

to get you, anything at all.

If they have to blow up an
atomic bomb in New York City,

00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:12.310 align:middle line:90%
they'll do that.

00:58:12.310 --> 00:58:13.570 align:middle line:90%
They'll do whatever it takes.

00:58:13.570 --> 00:58:14.653 align:middle line:90%

But this is the kind
of world we live in.

00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:23.203 align:middle line:84%
This is what I finally
realized after a long time.

00:58:23.203 --> 00:58:24.510 align:middle line:90%
It took me a long time.

00:58:24.510 --> 00:58:26.343 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting there,
really innocent, going,

00:58:26.343 --> 00:58:29.390 align:middle line:90%
well let's go save the planet.

00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And the planet doesn't
want to be saved.

00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:34.060 align:middle line:84%
It would like to be
saved, but not if it means

00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:35.780 align:middle line:90%
they're gonna lose their money.

00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And the same way
with President Bush.

00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:41.240 align:middle line:84%
We had this thing in Rio, and
President Bush didn't even

00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:44.810 align:middle line:84%
wanna go there, because he
was afraid of getting trapped

00:58:44.810 --> 00:58:47.300 align:middle line:84%
into some situation
where he would have

00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:50.914 align:middle line:84%
to sign some thing saying that
he would have to reduce some

00:58:50.914 --> 00:58:52.330 align:middle line:84%
of the emissions
or something else

00:58:52.330 --> 00:58:54.540 align:middle line:84%
like that, which would cost
millions of jobs in the United

00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:55.340 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:58:55.340 --> 00:58:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And we were already
in a recession.

00:58:57.310 --> 00:59:00.030 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't want to do it.

00:59:00.030 --> 00:59:03.636 align:middle line:84%
Nobody wants to be the first
one to be hurt, or have to have

00:59:03.636 --> 00:59:04.999 align:middle line:90%
the pain happen to them.

00:59:04.999 --> 00:59:06.790 align:middle line:84%
Because the only way
we're going to get out

00:59:06.790 --> 00:59:08.390 align:middle line:84%
of this thing, if
we're not thinking

00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:13.484 align:middle line:84%
of any fourth dimensional levels
or any other stuff going on,

00:59:13.484 --> 00:59:15.400 align:middle line:84%
somebody's going to have
to make some changes.

00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And somebody's gonna have to
make some compromises and gift.

00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:22.770 align:middle line:84%
But we do have the
technology that

00:59:22.770 --> 00:59:26.740 align:middle line:84%
could heal almost
all, if not all,

00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:30.270 align:middle line:84%
of the environmental
problems, and very rapidly.

00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Though some of them
now have gone beyond.

00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:35.800 align:middle line:84%
We could have done
it a few years ago.

00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:38.944 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are now so
far gone that I don't even

00:59:38.944 --> 00:59:41.110 align:middle line:84%
know we have the technology
to be able to solve them

00:59:41.110 --> 00:59:42.710 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:46.560 align:middle line:84%
Well from my point of view,
I don't see any other answer.

00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And I really looked
at other ways.

00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And if anybody's
got an answer, I

00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:52.050 align:middle line:84%
don't care if I'm wrong,
I mean, if you can

00:59:52.050 --> 00:59:55.200 align:middle line:90%
find a way to heal this planet.

00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:57.167 align:middle line:84%

something outside

00:59:57.167 --> 00:59:59.250 align:middle line:84%
of the system that's even
greater than this that's

00:59:59.250 --> 01:00:02.565 align:middle line:84%
going to come and it's going to
force us to leave here anyway.

dimension, when

01:00:08.305 --> 01:00:11.772 align:middle line:84%

reinhabited by those of us who

01:00:15.619 --> 01:00:18.036 align:middle line:84%
have made it through to come
back with greater technology?

01:00:18.036 --> 01:00:19.702 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what would
even the technology--

01:00:19.702 --> 01:00:20.540 align:middle line:90%
>>No, no.

01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:22.890 align:middle line:90%
We won't need technology.

01:00:22.890 --> 01:00:25.010 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing with
technology, I think,

01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:29.440 align:middle line:84%
should be left for a little
while until I get to the place

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:33.335 align:middle line:84%
where I can really talk about
where technology came from

01:00:33.335 --> 01:00:35.000 align:middle line:90%
and what it's all about.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Because, technology
is not our friend.

01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:44.998 align:middle line:90%

01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:02.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was taken
aboard a Syrian ship.

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:04.180 align:middle line:84%
This was about a
50 mile long ship.

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:05.846 align:middle line:84%
And they led me through
the whole thing.

01:03:05.846 --> 01:03:07.720 align:middle line:90%
And I spent three days on it.

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And the whole inside
of the ship was white.

01:03:11.030 --> 01:03:14.860 align:middle line:90%
The outside exterior was black.

01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And there was no
moving parts anywhere.

01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:18.200 align:middle line:84%
There was no
electrical circuits.

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:20.830 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing.

01:03:20.830 --> 01:03:22.620 align:middle line:90%
It looked like an art gallery.

01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:25.700 align:middle line:84%
All there was were these
moving shapes of white

01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:28.200 align:middle line:90%
that looked like art forms.

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:32.704 align:middle line:84%
And people simply
psychotronically connected

01:03:32.704 --> 01:03:33.870 align:middle line:90%
with these different shapes.

01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:35.960 align:middle line:90%
It was able to do anything.

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:44.961 align:middle line:84%
And when I came back
from that experience,

01:03:44.961 --> 01:03:48.460 align:middle line:84%
I expressed my
thanks to the angels,

01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:52.490 align:middle line:84%
saying, this is incredible
stuff, you know?

01:03:52.490 --> 01:03:55.310 align:middle line:84%
This is the most advanced
thing I've ever seen.

01:03:55.310 --> 01:03:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And the angels said to
me, no, you're not right.

01:03:59.210 --> 01:04:00.480 align:middle line:90%
I said, well what do you mean?

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:01.780 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:03.060 align:middle line:90%
They go, no.

01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And they said to me,
supposing you're in your house

01:04:07.310 --> 01:04:09.080 align:middle line:90%
and you get cold.

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:13.300 align:middle line:84%
So you say to yourself,
I'm gonna invent a heater.

01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And so you invent a
heater and whatever it is.

01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:20.265 align:middle line:84%
Could be free energy here,
it doesn't matter what

01:04:20.265 --> 01:04:22.300 align:middle line:90%
it is, how sophisticated it is.

01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:24.760 align:middle line:84%
You invent something
to heat your room.

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And it heats your
room and it works.

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And you think you
just got better off.

01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:34.300 align:middle line:84%
But from their point of
view, what you just did

01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:39.610 align:middle line:84%
was give your innate
power to an object.

01:04:39.610 --> 01:04:41.410 align:middle line:90%
And you're now weaker.

01:04:41.410 --> 01:04:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And you're addicted
to the object.

01:04:43.610 --> 01:04:45.500 align:middle line:84%
You now have to
have this object.

01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And so as the technology
keeps growing, you make lights

01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:48.940 align:middle line:84%
and you do this,
and you do this.

01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:50.814 align:middle line:84%
And it keeps going on
and on, and on, and on.

01:04:50.814 --> 01:04:54.080 align:middle line:84%
As a God-centered
individual, you

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:57.390 align:middle line:84%
get weaker, and
weaker, and weaker,

01:04:57.390 --> 01:05:00.710 align:middle line:84%
until finally, you can't
live without the technology.

01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:05.370 align:middle line:90%


01:05:05.370 --> 01:05:08.150 align:middle line:84%
You could have heated the
room in the first place

01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:10.290 align:middle line:84%
just with the Merkaba,
with your own energies.

01:05:10.290 --> 01:05:11.640 align:middle line:90%
With your connection to God.

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:14.740 align:middle line:90%


01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:17.325 align:middle line:84%
And so what they said
is, the more advanced

01:05:17.325 --> 01:05:22.700 align:middle line:84%
the technology becomes,
the more separated from God

01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:28.350 align:middle line:84%
they become, and the weaker
as a race they become.

01:05:28.350 --> 01:05:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And later we will talk
about this, when we talk

01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:32.630 align:middle line:90%
about the Lucifer rebellion.

01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:34.610 align:middle line:84%
Because the Lucifer
rebellion is totally

01:05:34.610 --> 01:05:38.600 align:middle line:84%
based on the difference
between a living Merkaba field

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:41.289 align:middle line:84%
and an external
technological field, which

01:05:41.289 --> 01:05:42.580 align:middle line:90%
we called UFOs or flying ships.

01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:46.130 align:middle line:90%


01:05:46.130 --> 01:05:49.290 align:middle line:84%
But I really want to
lay down a whole lot

01:05:49.290 --> 01:05:52.090 align:middle line:84%
more information before we
go into that too deeply.

01:05:52.090 --> 01:05:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And it is a real
important subject,

01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:58.020 align:middle line:84%
because it's the keynote of
what our problem is here.

01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:00.440 align:middle line:84%
But I did get real
involved in this stuff.

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:03.585 align:middle line:84%
I really did try to put
some of this technology on.

01:06:03.585 --> 01:06:06.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's so many
things that I thought

01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:08.960 align:middle line:90%
could really help.

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:12.280 align:middle line:84%
I first had this experience
maybe 20 years ago.

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:14.090 align:middle line:90%
They told me all of this stuff.

01:06:14.090 --> 01:06:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And then in the meantime as time
went on, I completely forgot.

01:06:18.350 --> 01:06:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And I got totally wrapped
up in science again.

01:06:22.210 --> 01:06:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And I started doing everything
they told me not to do.

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:26.950 align:middle line:90%
And they never said a word.

01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:31.600 align:middle line:84%
They waited until
about two years ago.

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And then they gave me a
very interesting experience

01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:37.590 align:middle line:84%
which I'll tell you about, which
overnight changed my whole mind

01:06:37.590 --> 01:06:38.790 align:middle line:90%
about everything.

01:06:38.790 --> 01:06:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And I walked away
from the scientists.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.840 align:middle line:90%
I had all the stuff going.

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:43.840 align:middle line:90%
Incredible things going.

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:45.820 align:middle line:90%
And I just said, see you later.

01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:46.620 align:middle line:90%
And walked away.

01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:50.040 align:middle line:84%
I realized that there's
only one way out for me.

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.440 align:middle line:84%
For me, maybe not for you,
but the only away for me is I

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:56.707 align:middle line:84%
got to figure out how to do
this on my own, completely 100%,

01:06:56.707 --> 01:06:57.790 align:middle line:90%
without any kind of stuff.

01:06:57.790 --> 01:07:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And I know we're still addicted
to cars and things like this.

01:07:00.890 --> 01:07:03.340 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not going to add to it.

01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:06.920 align:middle line:84%
If anything, I'm going to try
to keep subtracting from it

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:08.976 align:middle line:84%
and try to figure out
how I get to the place

01:07:08.976 --> 01:07:09.975 align:middle line:90%
where do this on my own.

01:07:09.975 --> 01:07:12.480 align:middle line:90%


01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:16.190 align:middle line:84%
But we really do need
to wait till I lay down

01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:20.360 align:middle line:84%
more information here to make
this whole problem that we

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:24.070 align:middle line:84%
have, the whole parameters
of the problem, clear.

01:07:24.070 --> 01:07:27.630 align:middle line:90%


01:07:27.630 --> 01:07:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>>So the solution is to
learn about the zero point

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:34.020 align:middle line:90%
technology, no?

01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:35.570 align:middle line:90%
>>Internally.

01:07:35.570 --> 01:07:38.510 align:middle line:84%
Not to apply it some
kind of external.

01:07:38.510 --> 01:07:43.120 align:middle line:84%
See, most people are taking
it applying it into science.

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:47.010 align:middle line:84%
But you can do anything
science can do on any level

01:07:47.010 --> 01:07:49.560 align:middle line:90%
whatsoever, and more.

01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:52.710 align:middle line:84%
Because science has its
limits, as we don't.

01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Anything whatsoever can be
done internally from ourselves.

01:07:57.310 --> 01:08:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And if we could learn
to do the things,

01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:04.310 align:middle line:84%
we begin by just doing
very simple things.

01:08:04.310 --> 01:08:10.590 align:middle line:84%
Like, we didn't learn to run
100 yards in six seconds,

01:08:10.590 --> 01:08:13.010 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is,
when we were little.

01:08:13.010 --> 01:08:15.520 align:middle line:84%
We first learned how to
stand up and take a walk.

01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:18.483 align:middle line:90%
And so we take that first step.

01:08:18.483 --> 01:08:20.149 align:middle line:84%
For me, there are
certain things that we

01:08:20.149 --> 01:08:24.240 align:middle line:84%
can do to just begin to learn
the power of our own cells.

01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:26.870 align:middle line:90%


01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:33.010 align:middle line:90%
And this is what it's all about.

01:08:33.010 --> 01:08:33.910 align:middle line:90%
But it's not easy.

01:08:33.910 --> 01:08:35.924 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're so
addicted to this.

01:08:35.924 --> 01:08:39.300 align:middle line:90%


01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:40.470 align:middle line:90%
We're in a building.

01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:42.920 align:middle line:90%
This is technology.

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:44.380 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:49.029 align:middle line:84%
>>Would it be possible for
us to live without eating?

01:08:49.029 --> 01:08:50.380 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, you won't eat after this.

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:51.180 align:middle line:90%
Once you--

01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:54.778 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:54.778 --> 01:08:55.819 align:middle line:90%
Are you hungry right now?

01:08:55.819 --> 01:08:58.289 align:middle line:90%


01:08:58.289 --> 01:08:59.830 align:middle line:84%
Throw that man an
apple or something.

01:08:59.830 --> 01:09:03.560 align:middle line:90%


01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:06.620 align:middle line:90%
>>It's one of problems.

01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:08.050 align:middle line:90%
It's to eat.

01:09:08.050 --> 01:09:12.920 align:middle line:84%
But I know that some of us, like
the masters in the Far East,

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:16.109 align:middle line:84%
for example, there was
a wonderful book called,

01:09:16.109 --> 01:09:19.520 align:middle line:84%
"The Lives and Teachings of
the Masters of the Far East"

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:22.130 align:middle line:84%
and they seem to
live on the prana.

01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:24.250 align:middle line:90%
They don't eat anymore.

01:09:24.250 --> 01:09:26.930 align:middle line:90%
>>We didn't eat before we fell.

01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:28.899 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, that was
one of the first signs

01:09:28.899 --> 01:09:34.335 align:middle line:84%
that the masters knew, how
far down we had fallen,

01:09:34.335 --> 01:09:36.930 align:middle line:84%
when we all started
eating food again.

01:09:36.930 --> 01:09:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>>They seem to be able to
make a bubble, for example,

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.620 align:middle line:90%
of protection for the night.

01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:47.741 align:middle line:84%
And be very comfortable
in the middle of a storm.

01:09:47.741 --> 01:09:49.490 align:middle line:84%
>>That's the understanding
of the Merkaba.

01:09:49.490 --> 01:09:51.365 align:middle line:84%
If you're in the Merkaba
and you're rotating,

01:09:51.365 --> 01:09:55.334 align:middle line:84%
you could stay warm
and everything.

01:09:55.334 --> 01:09:56.750 align:middle line:84%
All your needs,
whatever they are,

01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:59.660 align:middle line:84%
are completely satisfied
without doing anything,

01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:01.520 align:middle line:90%
without having on.

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:04.160 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to sit
there and get dripping wet.

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:07.270 align:middle line:84%
Just have the water just
go right around your field.

01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:09.347 align:middle line:84%
>>Can you teach
us how to do that?

01:10:09.347 --> 01:10:10.638 align:middle line:90%
>>That's what I'm trying to do.

01:10:10.638 --> 01:10:14.502 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:14.502 --> 01:10:18.370 align:middle line:90%


01:10:18.370 --> 01:10:21.000 align:middle line:84%
>>Drunvalo, you've said that
we've all done this before,

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.870 align:middle line:84%
created our Merkabas and it's
just a matter of remembering?

01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:27.500 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, everything I'm
saying to you is nothing new.

01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:28.300 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:30.400 align:middle line:90%
>>Though it may seem new.

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:32.370 align:middle line:90%
You know all of this.

01:10:32.370 --> 01:10:33.270 align:middle line:90%


01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:35.004 align:middle line:84%
>>That's why it's
interesting to you.

01:10:35.004 --> 01:10:36.670 align:middle line:84%
You already know what
I'm talking about.

01:10:36.670 --> 01:10:40.020 align:middle line:84%
>>If we have done this before
and created this Merkaba,

01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:42.730 align:middle line:84%
is this something that's
waiting to be reunited?

01:10:42.730 --> 01:10:45.230 align:middle line:84%
Or is it something that we're
creating from inside ourselves

01:10:45.230 --> 01:10:46.030 align:middle line:90%
again?

01:10:46.030 --> 01:10:49.510 align:middle line:84%
Or did we hang it up
somewhere and incarnate?

01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>>You see, you have this field
sitting around your body,

01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:56.910 align:middle line:84%
right out at your fingertips,
an electromagnetic field

01:10:56.910 --> 01:10:59.339 align:middle line:84%
which I'm trying to
describe to you right now.

01:10:59.339 --> 01:11:01.672 align:middle line:84%
And that one is connected to
other ones, and other ones,

01:11:01.672 --> 01:11:05.110 align:middle line:84%
and there's a whole series
of nested geometrical forms

01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:09.830 align:middle line:84%
that go out to, about,
maybe roughly this far away

01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:11.850 align:middle line:90%
from a human being.

01:11:11.850 --> 01:11:13.907 align:middle line:90%
A whole series of them.

01:11:13.907 --> 01:11:20.120 align:middle line:90%


01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:23.200 align:middle line:90%
What was the question?

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:26.340 align:middle line:84%
I got way over there and
forgot what I was doing.

01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:27.477 align:middle line:90%
I need that apple real bad.

01:11:27.477 --> 01:11:30.220 align:middle line:90%


01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:34.920 align:middle line:84%
>>If we did it before, and we
forgot it when we incarnated,

01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:37.300 align:middle line:84%
is it something we jump
start to get it going again

01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:39.480 align:middle line:84%
or is it sitting somewhere
waiting to be revived?

01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:41.350 align:middle line:84%
>>Well the fields
are sitting there.

01:11:41.350 --> 01:11:42.540 align:middle line:90%
And they're all there.

01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:45.890 align:middle line:84%
There's actually three sets
of these fields superimposed

01:11:45.890 --> 01:11:47.110 align:middle line:90%
over each other.

01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:49.140 align:middle line:90%
Three identical fields.

01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:51.220 align:middle line:84%
All we have to do
is remember how

01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:56.510 align:middle line:84%
to begin to activate it, which
is breathing the prana down

01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:59.400 align:middle line:84%
through the pineal gland,
coming out, activating

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:01.910 align:middle line:84%
the field in that kind of way,
and beginning the rotating

01:12:01.910 --> 01:12:02.710 align:middle line:90%
process.

01:12:02.710 --> 01:12:06.565 align:middle line:84%
So we have one set that
will rotate this way.

01:12:06.565 --> 01:12:10.810 align:middle line:84%
An entire set like this will
begin to rotate like that.

01:12:10.810 --> 01:12:12.800 align:middle line:10%
The one that rotates
to your left,

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:15.560 align:middle line:10%
counterclockwise,
is male in nature.

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:16.960 align:middle line:10%
It's electrical.

01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:19.882 align:middle line:10%
And it is literally your mind.

01:12:19.882 --> 01:12:22.530 align:middle line:10%
It's knowledge.

01:12:22.530 --> 01:12:25.715 align:middle line:10%
And the one that
rotates this way, which

01:12:25.715 --> 01:12:31.830 align:middle line:10%
is an entire set, just like
we see going there, is female.

01:12:31.830 --> 01:12:33.560 align:middle line:10%
It's magnetic in nature.

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:37.190 align:middle line:10%
And it is literally
your emotional body.

01:12:37.190 --> 01:12:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And so when you happen to
have just the right thoughts

01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:44.490 align:middle line:84%
rotating this way, and
just the right emotions

01:12:44.490 --> 01:12:49.150 align:middle line:84%
rotating this way,
then this phenomena

01:12:49.150 --> 01:12:52.190 align:middle line:84%
takes place, which is
called the Merkaba.

01:12:52.190 --> 01:12:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why it just
takes remembering how to do it,

01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:57.400 align:middle line:90%
what it was about.

01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:58.970 align:middle line:90%
The field is set up.

01:12:58.970 --> 01:13:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And then the
testing of the field

01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:04.670 align:middle line:90%
to see that it's really real.

01:13:04.670 --> 01:13:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And then once you have just
even one experience, just one,

01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:13.676 align:middle line:84%
you will never be
the same again.

01:13:13.676 --> 01:13:16.120 align:middle line:84%
Just recently had
someone called up

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:21.199 align:middle line:84%
and put her arm through a
door, right through the wall.

01:13:21.199 --> 01:13:22.740 align:middle line:84%
She obviously will
never be the same.

01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:27.280 align:middle line:90%


01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:28.930 align:middle line:84%
Or another person
who was sitting there

01:13:28.930 --> 01:13:32.000 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly lifted off
the floor, and went from I

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.290 align:middle line:84%
think was in the living
room into the kitchen.

01:13:35.290 --> 01:13:36.740 align:middle line:90%
Levitated into the kitchen.

01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:39.140 align:middle line:84%
She's never going
to be the same.

01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Really, you're just not
going to be the same.

01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:42.550 align:middle line:90%
It's just like, that's it.

01:13:42.550 --> 01:13:46.540 align:middle line:84%
You realize everything you were
ever told was just not true.

01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:49.020 align:middle line:90%
And there's a lot more to life.

01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:51.624 align:middle line:84%
But there's no one that
can do that but you.

01:13:51.624 --> 01:13:55.170 align:middle line:90%


01:13:55.170 --> 01:13:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And I've had a similar
experience myself.

01:13:57.740 --> 01:13:59.240 align:middle line:90%
And I've had a few other ones.

01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:03.090 align:middle line:90%


01:14:03.090 --> 01:14:05.311 align:middle line:84%
And I know what the
possibilities are.

01:14:05.311 --> 01:14:12.680 align:middle line:90%


01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>>Does this only happen
in the physical awareness?

01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:18.550 align:middle line:84%
Or is it possible to experience
this, maybe, in dream time

01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:19.520 align:middle line:90%
as well?

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:24.400 align:middle line:84%
>>Well you can remember what
it was all about in dream time.

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:27.769 align:middle line:84%
Like, in the dream time, you
may remember yourself flying,

01:14:27.769 --> 01:14:29.185 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
other thing you

01:14:29.185 --> 01:14:32.827 align:middle line:84%
can do is you can just lift
off and fly with Merkaba.

01:14:32.827 --> 01:14:34.910 align:middle line:84%
You could do it that way,
or you could just simply

01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:37.860 align:middle line:84%
disappear here and reappear
where you want to be.

01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:46.440 align:middle line:84%
The potential is directed by
intention and what's possible.

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:54.847 align:middle line:84%
But we're getting a little
bit ahead of ourselves here.

01:14:54.847 --> 01:14:56.430 align:middle line:84%
These are the kinds
of things we'll be

01:14:56.430 --> 01:14:58.075 align:middle line:90%
talking about on the last day.

01:14:58.075 --> 01:14:59.975 align:middle line:90%
We gotta wait till we get there.

01:14:59.975 --> 01:15:00.925 align:middle line:90%
I know.

Nobody wants to be
here anymore, I know.

01:15:13.710 --> 01:15:15.465 align:middle line:90%
Is that way all over the world.

the monasteries in Tibet and--

01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:25.570 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, yeah.

01:15:25.570 --> 01:15:29.080 align:middle line:84%
This is what in
Tibet, the final test

01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:34.650 align:middle line:84%
was after you had done 108,000
prostrations, thrown your mala

01:15:34.650 --> 01:15:37.782 align:middle line:84%
beads against all
the walls, and you

01:15:37.782 --> 01:15:39.490 align:middle line:84%
walked around all the
mountains, and done

01:15:39.490 --> 01:15:40.560 align:middle line:90%
all the various things.

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And then when you got
really, really old,

01:15:43.070 --> 01:15:47.969 align:middle line:84%
and you're almost
ready to die, then they

01:15:47.969 --> 01:15:49.260 align:middle line:90%
told you what it was all about.

01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:54.180 align:middle line:90%


01:15:54.180 --> 01:15:56.640 align:middle line:84%
Maybe, maybe they
would tell you.

01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
tell you what it was.

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And then they'd see if
you could really do it.

01:16:02.950 --> 01:16:04.815 align:middle line:84%
And they would
sit you on a ledge

01:16:04.815 --> 01:16:07.267 align:middle line:84%
out there, 30,000
feet in the air.

01:16:07.267 --> 01:16:09.640 align:middle line:84%
It's 100 below zero, and
you're freezing and everything

01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:10.040 align:middle line:90%
like that.

01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And they take all
your clothes off

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:13.710 align:middle line:84%
and they put wet
blankets around you.

01:16:13.710 --> 01:16:17.140 align:middle line:90%
And they'd say, dry them.

01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:20.194 align:middle line:84%
And that guy, of course, would
very quickly sit under there

01:16:20.194 --> 01:16:22.610 align:middle line:84%
and start doing his breathing
and get on the field fields.

Pop that baby out, and say,
it's 80 degrees in here.

Which would only be just
inside the Merkaba shape, which

01:16:31.850 --> 01:16:33.620 align:middle line:90%
looks like a flying saucer.

01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:36.500 align:middle line:84%
It would instantly
be 80 degrees,

01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:38.620 align:middle line:90%
if that's what he set it for.

01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And very quickly, you
would see a circle of snow

01:16:42.830 --> 01:16:45.850 align:middle line:84%
melt in a circle
around this person.

01:16:45.850 --> 01:16:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And very quickly, he would dry
these blankets and stand up.

01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And he would demonstrate,
in real time to his teacher,

01:16:54.430 --> 01:16:55.350 align:middle line:90%
that he had done this.

01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And "Omni Magazine"
just videoed this.

01:16:58.610 --> 01:17:01.680 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they were
allowed to video it.

01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:05.590 align:middle line:84%
They sat there and watched
one of these guys do it.

01:17:05.590 --> 01:17:08.020 align:middle line:84%
They would never have allowed
this before we're ready.

01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:10.110 align:middle line:90%
We're ready for this stuff.

01:17:10.110 --> 01:17:11.815 align:middle line:90%
They said, watch this.

01:17:11.815 --> 01:17:13.120 align:middle line:90%
And they just did it.

I don't know.

01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:19.910 align:middle line:84%
I never know what they're
going to have me do.

01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:23.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what's
gonna happen.

01:17:23.010 --> 01:17:25.270 align:middle line:90%
But this is where we're heading.

01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:26.250 align:middle line:90%
This is possible.

01:17:26.250 --> 01:17:27.800 align:middle line:90%
This is real stuff.

01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is nothing compared
to where we're going.

01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:35.770 align:middle line:84%
Because where we're
going, that's nothing.

01:17:35.770 --> 01:17:38.350 align:middle line:84%
We're going to create
the very universe we're

01:17:38.350 --> 01:17:42.302 align:middle line:84%
in, second by second,
and everything in it.

01:17:42.302 --> 01:17:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Which is a lot farther
than just creating

01:17:44.010 --> 01:17:46.022 align:middle line:90%

01:17:51.579 --> 01:17:53.926 align:middle line:84%
would have it come back
and [INAUDIBLE] this time

01:17:53.926 --> 01:17:55.870 align:middle line:90%
in order to change?

01:17:55.870 --> 01:17:56.670 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

01:17:56.670 --> 01:18:00.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean I said that's everyday
stuff, on higher levels.

01:18:00.990 --> 01:18:06.380 align:middle line:84%
Just down here, why you
ended up here, I don't know.

01:18:06.380 --> 01:18:11.502 align:middle line:84%
Most of you are probably coming
from higher dimensional levels

01:18:11.502 --> 01:18:13.206 align:middle line:84%
and have a reason
for being here.

01:18:13.206 --> 01:18:14.580 align:middle line:84%
But when you come
in here, you've

01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:15.621 align:middle line:90%
got to become part of it.

01:18:15.621 --> 01:18:18.350 align:middle line:84%
Like me, like everyone
else, you become part of it

01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:20.890 align:middle line:90%
and you forget.

01:18:20.890 --> 01:18:23.550 align:middle line:84%
You gotta start over
like everybody else.

01:18:23.550 --> 01:18:26.220 align:middle line:84%
But you usually very
quickly come back

01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:29.540 align:middle line:84%
to this place where
you start remembering.

01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And we're all
starting to remember.

01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:35.030 align:middle line:84%
People everywhere are
starting to remember.

01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:37.990 align:middle line:90%
This is happening everywhere.

01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:38.890 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

There will come a time,
I know, I can feel it.

01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:42.350 align:middle line:90%
I can see it about to happen.

01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:48.940 align:middle line:84%
When all of a sudden everybody
in the world is gonna go, yeah!

01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:50.230 align:middle line:90%
And it's over.

01:18:50.230 --> 01:18:51.030 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

01:18:51.030 --> 01:18:52.020 align:middle line:90%
It's just over.

01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:55.960 align:middle line:84%
It could be over in just a
second, the dream that we're

01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:59.260 align:middle line:84%
in, this nightmare
that we're in,

01:18:59.260 --> 01:19:01.470 align:middle line:90%
can just be over just like that.

01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:05.070 align:middle line:90%


01:19:05.070 --> 01:19:08.420 align:middle line:84%
What's an environmental
problem like a dirty ocean?

01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:10.000 align:middle line:90%
Big deal.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.674 align:middle line:84%
If Christ could turn
water into wine,

01:19:11.674 --> 01:19:13.840 align:middle line:84%
you don't think a whole
planet full of Christ beings

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:17.650 align:middle line:84%
could just like
that, with the ocean?

01:19:17.650 --> 01:19:18.720 align:middle line:90%
Solve all the problems.

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:22.040 align:middle line:84%
The whole environment would
just transform into harmony,

01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:24.130 align:middle line:90%
because it's just light.

01:19:24.130 --> 01:19:26.170 align:middle line:90%
The truth is, it's just light.

01:19:26.170 --> 01:19:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And it is intimately
connected to our thoughts

01:19:28.090 --> 01:19:30.845 align:middle line:84%
and our feelings,
and what we think

01:19:30.845 --> 01:19:33.160 align:middle line:84%
and we feel when our
intentions are set.

01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:34.950 align:middle line:84%
What's going on
out here is you've

01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:37.720 align:middle line:84%
got people like in Israel
who are intentionally

01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:40.540 align:middle line:84%
hating someone else, who is
intentionally hating back,

01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:43.220 align:middle line:84%
who is intentionally hating that
and creating the world as it

01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:44.570 align:middle line:90%
continues on.

01:19:44.570 --> 01:19:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And those kinds of patterns
have gotta be broken.

01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:48.790 align:middle line:90%
That's where the problem lies.

01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:50.830 align:middle line:84%
Not in trying to
solve environment.

01:19:50.830 --> 01:19:53.687 align:middle line:84%
It's consciousness problems
that are on the Earth.

01:19:53.687 --> 01:19:56.020 align:middle line:84%
Once we can get to the proper
level on the consciousness

01:19:56.020 --> 01:19:57.770 align:middle line:84%
problems, then all
this other stuff

01:19:57.770 --> 01:20:01.284 align:middle line:84%
is solved like that,
just like that.

01:20:01.284 --> 01:20:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>>But wouldn't we
have to get permission

01:20:02.950 --> 01:20:06.870 align:middle line:84%
to fix things for those people
who are still busy hating?

01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:08.050 align:middle line:90%


01:20:08.050 --> 01:20:09.320 align:middle line:90%
>>No, that's the thing.

01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:11.610 align:middle line:90%
We can't do that.

01:20:11.610 --> 01:20:14.040 align:middle line:84%
You can't go around, even
once you get to the level

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:17.220 align:middle line:84%
where you realize that you
can make certain changes,

01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:20.050 align:middle line:84%
you also realize the
responsibility on other levels.

01:20:20.050 --> 01:20:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And you can't go
doing those things.

01:20:23.170 --> 01:20:29.045 align:middle line:84%
And the only real source
of change that you've got

01:20:29.045 --> 01:20:31.360 align:middle line:90%
is yourself.

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And so if you can
change yourself,

01:20:33.370 --> 01:20:35.930 align:middle line:84%
where all you're doing
is emitting love,

01:20:35.930 --> 01:20:37.980 align:middle line:84%
then that's the
beginning of the cure.

01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And that truly
influences other people.

01:20:42.730 --> 01:20:45.050 align:middle line:90%
And it goes into the grids.

01:20:45.050 --> 01:20:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And this hundredth monkey theory
thing is not just a theory.

01:20:48.530 --> 01:20:50.290 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very real.

01:20:50.290 --> 01:20:52.740 align:middle line:84%
It's been proven
scientifically, which

01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:56.040 align:middle line:84%
I will talk about when
we talk about the grids.

01:20:56.040 --> 01:21:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And a few people can change
the world, can change things.

01:21:04.050 --> 01:21:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Mother Mary used to
ask people, pray.

01:21:06.610 --> 01:21:07.420 align:middle line:90%
Pray for peace.

01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:08.590 align:middle line:90%
Pray for peace.

01:21:08.590 --> 01:21:11.860 align:middle line:84%
But we never knew
what praying meant.

01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:14.360 align:middle line:90%
Praying doesn't mean asking God.

01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:18.590 align:middle line:84%
It means changing
yourself into that

01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:24.216 align:middle line:84%
which you want to see become
and happen, making it real.

01:21:24.216 --> 01:21:26.144 align:middle line:84%
>>You know about
all those studies

01:21:26.144 --> 01:21:28.392 align:middle line:84%
where they sent
meditators into war zones

01:21:28.392 --> 01:21:30.000 align:middle line:90%
and they stopped the wars.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And they've got tons of
documentation on that.

01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:35.600 align:middle line:90%
>>It only takes a few people.

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:37.820 align:middle line:84%
But instead, what
we're doing now

01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:43.650 align:middle line:84%
is we're trying to use very
specific external Merkabas

01:21:43.650 --> 01:21:45.655 align:middle line:84%
to use mind control,
which they used

01:21:45.655 --> 01:21:48.400 align:middle line:90%
in the Iraq war, which works.

01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:50.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that war was
not an ordinary war.

01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:53.080 align:middle line:84%
If you noticed, suddenly
all these people

01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:55.800 align:middle line:84%
just dropped their
weapons and gave up.

01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:58.960 align:middle line:84%
They gave up because of
the mind control saying,

01:21:58.960 --> 01:21:59.900 align:middle line:90%
you're to surrender.

01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:01.260 align:middle line:90%
You're to surrender.

01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:03.162 align:middle line:84%
Which was all based
on the technology

01:22:03.162 --> 01:22:04.995 align:middle line:84%
they had learned in the
Montauk experiments.

01:22:04.995 --> 01:22:07.830 align:middle line:90%


01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:10.380 align:middle line:84%
But a higher way
of doing that would

01:22:10.380 --> 01:22:11.730 align:middle line:90%
be doing what you're saying.

01:22:11.730 --> 01:22:17.840 align:middle line:84%
Sending in soldiers of
love to say, it's OK.

01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:19.206 align:middle line:90%
It's all light.

01:22:19.206 --> 01:22:20.580 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
instead of having

01:22:20.580 --> 01:22:25.230 align:middle line:84%
them surrender to capture them
or anything like that, to say,

01:22:25.230 --> 01:22:28.150 align:middle line:90%
not surrender, let's just stop.

01:22:28.150 --> 01:22:30.734 align:middle line:90%
