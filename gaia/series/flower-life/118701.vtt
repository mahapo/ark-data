00:00:21.098 --> 00:00:28.475 align:middle line:90%


00:00:28.475 --> 00:00:29.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to change
subjects now.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.820 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.130 align:middle line:90%
There's a couple subjects.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.763 align:middle line:90%


00:00:39.763 --> 00:00:42.180 align:middle line:90%
Let me see.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.970 align:middle line:84%
The first one-- I'm
not sure if it's

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.470 align:middle line:84%
the first one or the second
one, but the two subjects are--

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.430 align:middle line:84%
one of them has to do with
the star Sirius again.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.100 align:middle line:84%
What was so important
about that star?

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.850 align:middle line:84%
Why was there was so much
emphasis placed on that one?

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And the dolphins, saying
they're coming from there.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.630 align:middle line:90%
And calendars based on it.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.665 align:middle line:84%
All the temples in Egypt were
based on the heliacal rising

00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:07.510 align:middle line:84%
of Sirius, so that a little,
tiny dot of red light

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.322 align:middle line:84%
would shoot through
little, tiny slits that

00:01:09.322 --> 00:01:11.030 align:middle line:84%
would go into the
middle of the buildings

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.360 align:middle line:84%
and land on the
center of the Altars

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.910 align:middle line:84%
for one second
out of every year.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.250 align:middle line:90%
And all this stuff.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.507 align:middle line:84%
What was the big
deal about this?

00:01:20.507 --> 00:01:21.340 align:middle line:90%
What does it matter?

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we need to know why
Sirius is important to us

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.690 align:middle line:84%
because it is very important
why we understand that.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And second of all, there's
obviously something going on

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.552 align:middle line:90%
in the world right now.

00:01:31.552 --> 00:01:33.260 align:middle line:84%
At least it's obvious
to a lot of people.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.530 align:middle line:90%
Some people-- maybe not.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.250 align:middle line:84%
This is just normal
what's going on here.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.300 align:middle line:84%
But this is not normal, what's
happening here, in 1992.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.280 align:middle line:90%
This is really extraordinary.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.759 align:middle line:84%
And in so many ways,
you can see this.

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's more people
on the surface of the earth

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.810 align:middle line:84%
than there's ever been
and it's about to double.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.030 align:middle line:84%
We're about to go from 5.5
billion to 11 billion people

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.600 align:middle line:90%
here real quickly.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of things
that are doubling right now.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.009 align:middle line:84%
Every few years now,
one of them that I

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.775 align:middle line:84%
like use because it's so
clear is knowledge itself,

00:02:13.775 --> 00:02:14.575 align:middle line:90%
understanding.

00:02:14.575 --> 00:02:18.090 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.090 align:middle line:84%
There's people who
have done this.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.230 align:middle line:84%
If you take all the
information we've

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.380 align:middle line:84%
learned from the beginning--
say, the Sumerian culture,

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.970 align:middle line:84%
6,000 years ago--
to the year 1950,

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.840 align:middle line:84%
we had so many bits
of information.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.380 align:middle line:84%
There was so much, basically,
that we had learned.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.170 align:middle line:84%
You could put it
into the computer

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.333 align:middle line:90%
and you could count it.

00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:44.780 align:middle line:90%


00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.570 align:middle line:84%
But starting in
the early 1900s--

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.340 align:middle line:84%
and I believe it was right
around 1910, 1911, 1912, 1913,

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.180 align:middle line:84%
right about in there--
something started happening

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.130 align:middle line:90%
that was extraordinary.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And we started becoming a lot
more intelligent a lot faster.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And by the year 1950,
only 50 years later,

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.670 align:middle line:84%
in short amount of
time, we had doubled

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.890 align:middle line:84%
or matched the
amount of information

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.360 align:middle line:84%
that we had learned
in 6,000 years.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.090 align:middle line:84%
So what we had learned
in 6,000 years,

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.800 align:middle line:90%
we had doubled that in 50.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.240 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:29.140 align:middle line:84%
But we doubled all of that
again in 20 years, by 1970.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And then we doubled all of
that again by about 1980.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.450 align:middle line:90%
These are rough dates.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And then we doubled it
all again by about 1985.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And now it's gone so fast
that it's out of control.

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.170 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.970 align:middle line:90%


00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.225 align:middle line:84%
Nobody can get it in
their computers even.

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:46.110 align:middle line:90%
It's coming in like--

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.910 align:middle line:90%
[SCREAMING]

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.080 align:middle line:90%
Like this.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.140 align:middle line:84%
NASA is about
eight or nine years

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.950 align:middle line:84%
behind being able to get what's
coming in off their satellites

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.560 align:middle line:84%
and everything into
their computers.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they just physically
can't get in there.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.350 align:middle line:90%
Until the computers change.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.050 align:middle line:84%
Now the computers are starting
to catch up with our ability

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.220 align:middle line:90%
to receive the information.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.793 align:middle line:84%
We're only just a couple
more years away from this.

00:04:08.793 --> 00:04:12.460 align:middle line:84%
Now this phenomenon is going to
happen here, in your lifetime.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Just if nothing
else happens, you're

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.168 align:middle line:90%
going to see this one happen.

00:04:15.168 --> 00:04:17.329 align:middle line:90%


00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.570 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
286 came out and it

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:20.649 align:middle line:90%
was able to do something.

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And then 18 months
later, the 386

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.620 align:middle line:84%
came out, which about
doubled its capabilities.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.750 align:middle line:84%
Then 18 months later,
the 486 came out.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And now we're just about
to have the 586 come out,

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.007 align:middle line:84%
which will be here in
just a-- it's here now.

00:04:37.007 --> 00:04:38.465 align:middle line:84%
They're just about
ready to present

00:04:38.465 --> 00:04:40.940 align:middle line:90%
it, which is incredible.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And they say that it's
doubling about every 18 months.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.650 align:middle line:84%
By the end of the century,
seven years from now,

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.890 align:middle line:84%
you'll have a PC so powerful
that a little individual

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.880 align:middle line:84%
sitting in this room
will have more capability

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.740 align:middle line:84%
than all the computers in
the world hooked together,

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.500 align:middle line:84%
including all of
NASA's computers,

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.290 align:middle line:84%
everything in the
United Nations,

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.800 align:middle line:84%
everything in the Pentagon,
and everything else all put

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.600 align:middle line:90%
in there.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.390 align:middle line:84%
One little guy will have more
power than that, sitting there,

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.190 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.290 align:middle line:90%
It's speed, ability, everything.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, at
one point here,

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.890 align:middle line:84%
the influx of
information coming in

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.060 align:middle line:84%
will catch up with our ability
to process the information.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And what that means--
we don't even know yet.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.940 align:middle line:84%
One person will be able
to map what's going on.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.080 align:middle line:84%
For example, one person would be
able to map the entire world's

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.980 align:middle line:84%
weather patterns, inch by inch,
on the surface of the earth.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.620 align:middle line:90%


00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.580 align:middle line:90%
That kind of complexity.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And so there's something, just
on an informational level,

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.790 align:middle line:90%
that's obvious.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.880 align:middle line:84%
Something, obviously,
is happening here.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And there's all
kinds of other things

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.240 align:middle line:84%
that are changing
very, very rapidly.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.760 align:middle line:84%
The question that I want
to ask is, why is that

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.840 align:middle line:90%
happening now, in 1992?

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.590 align:middle line:84%
What is it that's
making this happen now?

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.760 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't it happen
maybe 1,000 years ago?

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.570 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe 10,000 years
into the future?

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.410 align:middle line:90%
Or why is it happening at all?

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.902 align:middle line:90%


00:06:24.902 --> 00:06:26.860 align:middle line:84%
There must be something
that's triggering this,

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.420 align:middle line:90%
that's making this happen.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.157 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:06:31.157 --> 00:06:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And so we want to look
at these two things--

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.020 align:middle line:84%
why it's happening now
and the star Sirius.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.430 align:middle line:90%
Why is that star so important?

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, here we are,
in this third planet,

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.309 align:middle line:84%
rotating out in space
around this little star.

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:44.350 align:middle line:90%
As least we think we are.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.952 align:middle line:90%
We're not, but we think we are.

00:06:46.952 --> 00:06:48.836 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:48.836 --> 00:06:50.720 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you that later.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.550 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.850 align:middle line:90%
It's an illusion.

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:00.792 align:middle line:84%
And almost everything we see out
there is not happening at all

00:07:00.792 --> 00:07:02.000 align:middle line:90%
like we think it's happening.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.800 align:middle line:90%
Not even close.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:08.550 align:middle line:90%


00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.420 align:middle line:84%
But from within the system where
we are, inside of the earth,

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.310 align:middle line:84%
right here, it's really
hard to understand.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:19.960 align:middle line:84%
Though we have finally
cracked the whole process,

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.410 align:middle line:84%
it's very difficult to
understand some of the things

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.450 align:middle line:90%
we're about to say.

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:29.000 align:middle line:84%
You could go too far out into
space and at which point,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.870 align:middle line:84%
the human mind is not capable
of really understanding it.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.980 align:middle line:84%
This is a quasar out
on the furthest edges

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.590 align:middle line:90%
of our visible space.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:41.050 align:middle line:84%
It's so big that a galaxy would
be a pinpoint inside of it.

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:44.330 align:middle line:84%
It breaks all the laws
of energy that we know.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.752 align:middle line:84%
You can throw out the
e equals mc squared.

00:07:46.752 --> 00:07:47.960 align:middle line:90%
Just throw it out the window.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.116 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't mean anything.

00:07:49.116 --> 00:07:50.490 align:middle line:84%
This is producing
way more energy

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:53.230 align:middle line:84%
than is even possible
by anything we know.

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:57.280 align:middle line:84%
Notice the geometry of the disk
in the middle and the eight

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.720 align:middle line:90%
lines that are coming out of it.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.261 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that we're probably

00:08:00.261 --> 00:08:03.445 align:middle line:90%
more familiar with-- a galaxy.

00:08:03.445 --> 00:08:06.230 align:middle line:90%


00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:08.610 align:middle line:84%
This, by the way, is
not part of the galaxy.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:11.440 align:middle line:84%
This is an exploding
star, a nebula.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And it is probably many,
many, many light years

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:18.000 align:middle line:90%
closer to Earth than this.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.470 align:middle line:90%
This is enormous.

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:23.620 align:middle line:84%
This is just a pinpoint
compared to that.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And if you notice, there
is a spiral of white stars,

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:31.879 align:middle line:90%
coming out like this.

00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And then 180 degrees
away, on the opposite side

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:37.799 align:middle line:84%
of this sphere of
stars, is another one,

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:39.690 align:middle line:90%
going out like that.

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:42.909 align:middle line:84%
For a long time in astrology,
they thought that what you saw

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:44.800 align:middle line:84%
was what you got
and that was it.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.290 align:middle line:90%
And that was the whole thing.

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:50.440 align:middle line:84%
But recently, they're beginning
to discover certain things.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.800 align:middle line:84%
They've discovered
that the space in here,

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:57.320 align:middle line:84%
this dark space in here,
is somehow not the same

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.530 align:middle line:90%
as this dark space out here.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:03.600 align:middle line:90%
There's a difference about this.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.130 align:middle line:84%
They don't know
what you're going

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:06.380 align:middle line:90%
to learn in this workshop.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:09.060 align:middle line:84%
If they did, they would begin
to unravel some of these things.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:13.440 align:middle line:84%
All they know is that,
pragmatically, by the evidence,

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.970 align:middle line:90%
that it's different.

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.890 align:middle line:84%
They know that it's
different because what

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:23.590 align:middle line:84%
they have discovered is that
these stars are not just

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:28.560 align:middle line:84%
coming out of these arms like a
water hose being slung around,

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.630 align:middle line:84%
and the drops going
down in spirals,

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:36.212 align:middle line:84%
and each drop appearing to move
out the spirals-- which is not

00:09:36.212 --> 00:09:37.420 align:middle line:90%
what's happening, by the way.

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:41.610 align:middle line:84%
All these drops are moving,
radially, out in a line.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:48.690 align:middle line:90%
And that is true.

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:50.120 align:middle line:90%
That is what's happening.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.550 align:middle line:84%
These stars are
moving out like that.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.940 align:middle line:84%
There is this expanding
quality to it.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.870 align:middle line:84%
However, there is
another thing going on

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:00.410 align:middle line:84%
and this has been
discovered recently.

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And that is that each one of the
stars orbits the whole thing.

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:07.940 align:middle line:84%
So they're not locked
into these arms,

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:11.100 align:middle line:84%
but any particular star is
actually moving in an orbit,

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:15.240 align:middle line:84%
going from white light, into
the dark area, into the white,

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.147 align:middle line:90%
back again.

00:10:16.147 --> 00:10:17.730 align:middle line:84%
They're going from
arm, to arm, to arm

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:20.050 align:middle line:84%
in an orbit around
the whole thing.

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:24.280 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, these are very,
very, very, very long periods

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.390 align:middle line:84%
of time-- hundreds and hundreds
of millions of years for this

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:28.670 align:middle line:90%
to go around.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:32.250 align:middle line:84%
For any particular star to
leave, you go around one time.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they
know that this area is

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:36.660 align:middle line:84%
different than this area
up here, the black area,

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.090 align:middle line:84%
is that they're finding that
these white light stars--

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:43.370 align:middle line:84%
that's in here where the
death process and the birth

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:45.340 align:middle line:90%
process both take place.

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:49.290 align:middle line:84%
That is, it's inside of there
where the stars blow up.

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And when they blow up and
become these nebulas, like this,

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:53.700 align:middle line:90%
they form baby stars.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.910 align:middle line:84%
For each one that blows up,
approximately 200 new stars

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:58.360 align:middle line:90%
are formed out of it.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And so they began to
realize that there

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:04.760 align:middle line:84%
was some kind of
difference in here.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.718 align:middle line:84%
In a little bit, you'll
see that there's really

00:11:06.718 --> 00:11:10.750 align:middle line:84%
a white light arm here, another
180-- 90 degrees to that,

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.952 align:middle line:84%
there is a black light arm
and another black light arm

00:11:13.952 --> 00:11:15.400 align:middle line:90%
coming out like this.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.030 align:middle line:84%
You'll see this later, but not
until we get into geometries.

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:20.580 align:middle line:90%


00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:24.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, this rotating
motion that we

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.870 align:middle line:84%
have as we go around in
space-- as astrologers began

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:33.150 align:middle line:84%
to study this, they noticed
that our solar system-- our sun

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.150 align:middle line:84%
and our planets, which
are moving, as a unit,

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:40.130 align:middle line:84%
through space--
had a motion in it

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:46.020 align:middle line:84%
that isn't possible unless we
were linked, gravitationally,

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:46.960 align:middle line:90%
with another body.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.570 align:middle line:90%


00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:54.300 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the earth and
the moon-- here's the earth

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.710 align:middle line:90%
and here's the moon.

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:59.550 align:middle line:84%
We tend to think that the
moon rotates around the earth.

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:01.180 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.260 align:middle line:90%
It's an illusion.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.830 align:middle line:84%
What does happen is that there's
a place-- approximately one

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:11.330 align:middle line:84%
third away from the earth, a
central point-- and the earth

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:14.800 align:middle line:84%
and the moon rotate
around that central place,

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:19.070 align:middle line:84%
forming a double helical pattern
as it moves around the sun.

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:20.800 align:middle line:84%
So if you were to look
at just the earth,

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.210 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't move around the
earth in a smooth motion.

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:25.595 align:middle line:84%
It's corkscrewing
through space, like this.

00:12:25.595 --> 00:12:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And the same way with
our entire solar system.

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:31.660 align:middle line:84%
We're corkscrewing
through space.

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.240 align:middle line:84%
We can't do that unless
we're linked with something.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And so over time,
they kept checking out

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:39.560 align:middle line:84%
where it is, they kept narrowing
a space, and narrowing a space,

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:42.370 align:middle line:84%
and narrowing a space down,
and narrowing it down.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And about four years ago or so,
they narrowed it down to-- I

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:47.760 align:middle line:84%
guess, maybe earlier
than that even.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure when.

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:51.320 align:middle line:84%
They narrowed it
down to three stars.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And just recently, in the
last two or three years

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:57.355 align:middle line:84%
or so, they narrowed it
down to exactly which star

00:12:57.355 --> 00:13:00.470 align:middle line:90%
it was that we are linked with.

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:02.578 align:middle line:84%
Of course, what do
you think it is?

00:13:02.578 --> 00:13:03.378 align:middle line:90%
>>Sirius.

00:13:03.378 --> 00:13:07.230 align:middle line:84%
>>Sirius A. That can't
be serious, right?

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:08.520 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:14.400 align:middle line:90%
So we're brothers and sisters.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.330 align:middle line:90%
We're linked.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And there is a connection
between Sirius A and our star

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:29.005 align:middle line:84%
that I can only describe--
I'll describe it in a story.

00:13:29.005 --> 00:13:31.570 align:middle line:90%


00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:35.050 align:middle line:84%
Because we are linked in this
way, the distance between us

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:38.460 align:middle line:84%
is not as great as
you would think.

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:42.240 align:middle line:84%
We're only 90 seconds
away from each other.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:47.490 align:middle line:84%
That's all it takes with
the proper understanding.

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And it is very, very
easy to get from Sirius

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.030 align:middle line:84%
A to this solar system
or the other way around.

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:00.890 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And the dolphins, if
you read the stories

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:07.250 align:middle line:84%
of Peter Shenstone-- who
knows Peter Shenstone?

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:08.050 align:middle line:90%
Nobody.

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:09.360 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.320 align:middle line:84%
Peter Shenstone is the leader
of the dolphin movement

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:18.460 align:middle line:84%
in Australia, who,
very well, may become

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.430 align:middle line:90%
President of Australia someday.

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:22.892 align:middle line:90%
There's a real good chance.

00:14:22.892 --> 00:14:23.692 align:middle line:90%
He will.

00:14:23.692 --> 00:14:25.750 align:middle line:84%
He's loved by almost
everybody there.

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:27.570 align:middle line:84%
There's only 50 million
people in Australia

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:28.960 align:middle line:90%
and they're all kids.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:32.200 align:middle line:84%
They're all really young
and they like Peter a lot.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.560 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And people in power are
real concerned about him.

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And he has been channeling with
the dolphins for a long time.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.250 align:middle line:84%
He channeled a 250 pound
book from the dolphins.

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And it weighs so much
because it's made

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.385 align:middle line:90%
of these big sheets of acetate.

00:14:52.385 --> 00:14:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's these
drawings, describing

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:58.810 align:middle line:84%
the history of the
dolphins and whales, which

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:00.180 align:middle line:90%
are drawn on acetate.

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And each chapter is
about an inch thick.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And the cover is just
a different color.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.880 align:middle line:84%
So you've got a big
pile of these books

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.860 align:middle line:84%
with all these different
colors, but when

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:16.690 align:middle line:84%
you look at the drawings in
them, you see into the acetate.

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:19.540 align:middle line:84%
So as you're moving
the drawings,

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:22.336 align:middle line:84%
it feels like you're moving
through water because you

00:15:22.336 --> 00:15:25.040 align:middle line:84%
see these fuzzy things slowly
coming up and getting clearer

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:25.840 align:middle line:90%
and clearer.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.930 align:middle line:90%
It's really kind of neat.

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:29.630 align:middle line:84%
The whole concept
is really neat.

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:32.080 align:middle line:84%
They're making a movie
of it now in Australia.

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.930 align:middle line:84%
It's called "The Legend
of the Golden Dolphin."

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And this legend describes how
they were in another galaxy,

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:42.260 align:middle line:84%
totally outside of the
one we're in right now.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And a long, long, long time
ago, they had to leave.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.720 align:middle line:90%
And it was the golden dolphin.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.320 align:middle line:84%
When the dolphin is
baby and it's born,

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:53.490 align:middle line:84%
it has a golden
hair all over it.

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And so it was the baby
dolphin that led them out.

00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:01.632 align:middle line:90%


00:16:01.632 --> 00:16:04.420 align:middle line:90%
Let me go over here now.

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:08.150 align:middle line:84%
It led them out of the other
galaxy and into this one

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:12.020 align:middle line:84%
because they had to leave there
because the water was freezing

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.150 align:middle line:90%
over where they were.

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And they went to
Sirius A, according

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.760 align:middle line:90%
to the legend of this book.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And they stayed
there for a long time

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:24.615 align:middle line:84%
until they found the
tunnel that led to here.

00:16:24.615 --> 00:16:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And then they came to
here and they obviously

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:28.460 align:middle line:84%
came to this planet
because it has water on it.

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.918 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, they would have gone
to Venus or somewhere else.

00:16:30.918 --> 00:16:33.910 align:middle line:84%
But they came here
and so there is

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:39.040 align:middle line:84%
this connection between
earth and the other one.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:42.540 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the third planet
from Sirius B, which is the one

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:47.080 align:middle line:90%
that they inhabit over there.

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:57.020 align:middle line:84%
So we see why there's this
importance to the ancients

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:59.690 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Even though that
star is so far away

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:07.220 align:middle line:84%
in normal ways of
thinking, we're linked.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:08.064 align:middle line:90%
We're one with it.

00:17:08.064 --> 00:17:09.439 align:middle line:84%
It's like the
earth and the moon.

00:17:09.439 --> 00:17:11.720 align:middle line:90%
We're linked together.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.302 align:middle line:90%
And that's fact.

00:17:13.302 --> 00:17:14.760 align:middle line:84%
That's not just
somebody saying it.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:19.149 align:middle line:90%
That's astrology-- astronomy.

00:17:19.149 --> 00:17:21.900 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:29.490 align:middle line:84%
Now this is just
showing the galaxy flat.

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:33.120 align:middle line:84%
This is the edge, which
looks like a flying saucer.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is the kind
of motion we're making,

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:38.590 align:middle line:84%
this little, spring-like
motion, as we move around

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:40.776 align:middle line:90%
from one arm to the next.

00:17:40.776 --> 00:17:42.650 align:middle line:84%
If you were to look at
it from the edge-wise,

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:46.200 align:middle line:84%
it would just look like a
spring going back and forth.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.340 align:middle line:84%
It would be just like a
sign for a [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:49.756 align:middle line:84%
I know you guys
aren't going to be

00:17:49.756 --> 00:17:53.050 align:middle line:84%
able to see this one very well
because this light is so bad.

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:55.140 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can, kind
of, from the front.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.610 align:middle line:84%
But you guys, over here,
can't see anything.

00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:59.080 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.790 align:middle line:84%
There's a purple grid
all over that thing.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:03.510 align:middle line:90%
I know you can't see it.

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:05.260 align:middle line:84%
But this is the
galaxy, right here.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.051 align:middle line:84%
What they've now
discovered is that there's

00:18:07.051 --> 00:18:10.350 align:middle line:84%
a sphere of energy
around the galaxy.

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And that inside of
that sphere, there's

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:17.045 align:middle line:84%
a disk, a little sphere in the
middle, a larger sphere that

00:18:17.045 --> 00:18:19.290 align:middle line:84%
goes around that, and
then a lot of loose stars.

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:20.990 align:middle line:84%
But they're all
inside the diameter

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:23.260 align:middle line:84%
of a very specific
sphere of energy.

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And then outside that
is another sphere.

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:27.137 align:middle line:90%
An enormous one.

00:18:27.137 --> 00:18:29.470 align:middle line:84%
So you have a little sphere,
a little bit bigger sphere,

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:30.570 align:middle line:90%
and another sphere.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:35.750 align:middle line:84%
There's three spheres involved
in the construction of it.

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:38.200 align:middle line:84%
The more you study this
meditation, the more you

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:42.040 align:middle line:84%
look at it on atomic
and cosmic levels,

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.800 align:middle line:84%
you'll see the same
process of the meditation

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:48.610 align:middle line:84%
itself is repeated in
nature in all kinds of ways.

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:51.127 align:middle line:84%
And just remember this
little sphere in the center,

00:18:51.127 --> 00:18:53.210 align:middle line:84%
and this big one here, and
this other one out here

00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:56.150 align:middle line:84%
because you're going to see
those again a little later.

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:57.640 align:middle line:90%
And this is the heat envelope.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:03.470 align:middle line:84%
This is the infrared
photograph of a galaxy

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:05.690 align:middle line:84%
that's kind of coming
down at us, like this.

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:08.870 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of coming at
an angle down, like that.

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:11.640 align:middle line:90%
So it's got a ring around here.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And do you notice this black
ring that goes around there?

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:20.360 align:middle line:84%
It's cooler than the other one,
but it's also moving very fast.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
fastest moving part,

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.390 align:middle line:84%
so that's what's
on the outer edge.

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:27.922 align:middle line:84%
If you look at someone that has
a Merkaba rotating around them,

00:19:27.922 --> 00:19:30.130 align:middle line:84%
you'll notice that they have
a black ring around them

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:33.450 align:middle line:84%
out at about 55 feet
out because that Merkaba

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:37.060 align:middle line:84%
is rotating about 9/10ths
the speed of light.

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And it tends to make the
outer edges of it turn black.

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:45.080 align:middle line:84%
Really, you'll see this
black ring around a person,

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.190 align:middle line:90%
way out there.

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And then the colors
will come in from there.

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.200 align:middle line:84%
But the shape of
this heat envelope,

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.430 align:middle line:84%
which looks like
a flying saucer,

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:58.490 align:middle line:84%
is precisely the dimensions and
shape of the Merkaba around you

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:03.502 align:middle line:84%
when you do a particular
thing with your breathing,

00:20:03.502 --> 00:20:05.960 align:middle line:84%
and your patterns, and your
thoughts, and your feelings all

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:09.280 align:middle line:90%
combined in this particular way.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:14.030 align:middle line:84%
This shape is what will
come up around your body.

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:16.348 align:middle line:90%
