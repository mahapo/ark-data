WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.102 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.102 --> 00:00:17.560 align:middle line:84%
>>And then after
the chakra systems

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.070 align:middle line:84%
we're going to start looking at
the energy fields of the body.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And then from the
immediate ones,

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.510 align:middle line:84%
such as the etherical
body and what's

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.690 align:middle line:84%
often called the aura, which
is simply your thoughts

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.120 align:middle line:84%
and your feelings and
your emotional-- I

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.160 align:middle line:84%
mean your physical--
your physical body also

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.380 align:middle line:84%
emits light that sometimes
is mistaken for auras.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.100 align:middle line:84%
It's usually a disease
when it does that.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And we'll look at those
which are in close,

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.170 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll look at--
go to the fields like that,

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.040 align:middle line:84%
the crystalline structure
fields out there,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.915 align:middle line:84%
because that's where I
really want to get to.

00:00:56.915 --> 00:00:58.880 align:middle line:84%
But we'll start in
then go out from there.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.420 align:middle line:84%
But we'll start with
this aspect by talking

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.930 align:middle line:90%
about the inner chakras.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And to understand the
inner chakras that

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.290 align:middle line:84%
run inside the body,
we'll look at first just

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.000 align:middle line:90%
the eight-chakra system.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.460 align:middle line:90%
It's the simpler one.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And see what's the
origin of that.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.970 align:middle line:90%


00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And in order to look at
the eight-chakra system

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.210 align:middle line:84%
it's easiest to compare
it to sound and music.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.280 align:middle line:84%
We've already seen how
music and organic structure

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.640 align:middle line:90%
are interrelated.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.470 align:middle line:84%
We saw that with
the bees, and we

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.080 align:middle line:84%
saw that in the spine, how the
spinal column and the weights

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.390 align:middle line:84%
of it were equivalent to
the differences in cycles

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.820 align:middle line:90%
per second in music.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.930 align:middle line:84%
And so in order to
talk about the way

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.010 align:middle line:84%
that energy flows through
the octave in terms of music,

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.560 align:middle line:84%
and just the way you play
music between the steps

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.020 align:middle line:84%
and the half steps and
all these things in music,

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.940 align:middle line:84%
it is identical to the way
energy flows up the spine.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.560 align:middle line:90%
It's exactly the same.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.350 align:middle line:84%
So if you can
understand it in music,

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.300 align:middle line:90%
you can understand the body.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the Sufi
groups [AUDIO OUT]

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.820 align:middle line:90%
with this, especially Gurdjieff.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.140 align:middle line:90%


00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.030 align:middle line:84%
For those of you who
have studied Gurdjieff,

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give you an image
that he didn't know about.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.100 align:middle line:84%
He searched for
it, I believe, most

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.770 align:middle line:84%
of his life, which is
the sacred image that

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.370 align:middle line:84%
was behind the enneagram and
behind the work he was doing.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.710 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, to start with, we'll
look at the octave up here.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.450 align:middle line:84%
Just do, re, mi,
fa so, la, ti, do.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.330 align:middle line:84%
Between the third
and fourth note--

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.950 align:middle line:84%
this is a whole
set, a whole step,

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.250 align:middle line:84%
but between the third and the
fourth note, between mi and fa,

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.540 align:middle line:90%
there is a half step.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.700 align:middle line:84%
There's also a half
step between ti

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.031 align:middle line:84%
and do, between the
seventh and eighth note.

00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:02.830 align:middle line:90%
Those two places.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.330 align:middle line:84%
Now in musical instruments,
that's built in.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.710 align:middle line:84%
Like in a flute, the way
they arrange the holes

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.890 align:middle line:84%
are such that it's
already built into there.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.360 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have
to work it out.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.850 align:middle line:84%
If you play something like
a violin, where you've

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.480 align:middle line:84%
got a fretless
situation, then you

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.730 align:middle line:90%
have to know how to do that.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.492 align:middle line:90%
It's not built in.

00:03:23.492 --> 00:03:25.200 align:middle line:84%
Or a guitar, it's
built in because you've

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.385 align:middle line:84%
got the frets in there, if you
look at the spacings of them

00:03:27.385 --> 00:03:28.185 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:03:28.185 --> 00:03:32.420 align:middle line:90%


00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.380 align:middle line:84%
So it goes between
those two places.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at it,
it goes into-- there's

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.660 align:middle line:84%
two patterns in there
that repeat themselves.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.050 align:middle line:84%
It goes one, two, three, half
step, four, one, two, three,

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.230 align:middle line:90%
half step, four.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.620 align:middle line:90%
There's two sets of patterns.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.025 align:middle line:84%
And one of them you can
call female and one of them

00:03:53.025 --> 00:03:55.200 align:middle line:84%
you can call male,
though it's debatable

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.360 align:middle line:90%
which way you want to do that.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And that there is a difference
between this male or female

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.845 align:middle line:90%
pattern and this male pattern.

00:04:02.845 --> 00:04:06.520 align:middle line:84%
It's between fa and so, the
fourth and the fifth note.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.370 align:middle line:90%
Right there.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.470 align:middle line:84%
The differences between
male and femaleness.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And Gurdjieff used to
talk about this place

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.220 align:middle line:84%
and how, if this
was a cosmic scale,

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.890 align:middle line:84%
then a tiny, tiny
itty bitty change that

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.370 align:middle line:84%
was made between the
fourth and the fifth note

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.270 align:middle line:84%
would affect the whole cosmos
dramatically in a big way.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And so you got
three places here,

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.890 align:middle line:84%
these two half
steps and this place

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.480 align:middle line:84%
between the fourth
and the fifth,

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.770 align:middle line:84%
that we need to identify
in terms of shape and form.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.430 align:middle line:84%
This is the enneagram
that Gurdjieff used.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.630 align:middle line:84%
It was a two dimensional
representation of this.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And both of these are two
dimensional representations

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.220 align:middle line:84%
of something that is
an actual sacred form.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.060 align:middle line:84%
This isn't-- neither one of
these are sacred geometry.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Gurdjieff didn't know
about sacred geometry.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:11.110 align:middle line:84%
But this is a pattern
that is one step removed.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.860 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of like the
work of Walter Russell.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.810 align:middle line:84%
His work was one step
removed from sacred geometry.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.250 align:middle line:90%


00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.350 align:middle line:84%
But it has a lot
of similarities.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.380 align:middle line:84%
They've discovered that there's
a flow in here, inside of here,

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.176 align:middle line:84%
and that flow in the enneagram
goes from one to four to two

00:05:32.176 --> 00:05:34.770 align:middle line:84%
to eight to five to
seven to one again.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.464 align:middle line:90%
And those are called the wings.

00:05:36.464 --> 00:05:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And there's another
flow that goes

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.875 align:middle line:90%
from three, six, nine in here.

00:05:40.875 --> 00:05:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to get
into the enneagram, that's

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.770 align:middle line:90%
not my real purpose here.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.944 align:middle line:84%
Except to say that
the reason that there

00:05:46.944 --> 00:05:48.860 align:middle line:84%
are nine points in the
enneagram-- and there's

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.730 align:middle line:84%
really a tenth one in the
center, which is seldom talked

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:57.180 align:middle line:84%
about-- the way these two
things relate together,

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.000 align:middle line:84%
why there's nine points
on here and there's

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.416 align:middle line:84%
eight notes up
there, and first it

00:06:00.416 --> 00:06:02.330 align:middle line:84%
doesn't look like
they correspond.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.980 align:middle line:84%
That's because
the two half steps

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.670 align:middle line:84%
are considered as important
as the rest of the pattern.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:11.340 align:middle line:84%
So it really goes one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven,

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.230 align:middle line:90%
eight, nine.

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:17.050 align:middle line:84%
The tenth one, or the retreat,
is the one in the middle.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And this pattern can be applied
to just about everything that

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.140 align:middle line:84%
has a sound implication,
which is everything.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And people like-- you
remember Oscar Ichazo?

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Does anyone remember
him and Arica?

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And his work, he had 12 men
who came around him also,

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:48.740 align:middle line:84%
and then they began to
teach a geometrical means

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.270 align:middle line:90%
of enlightenment.

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And one of those, which
was-- one of his teachers

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.820 align:middle line:84%
was Claudio Naranjo, who
is a really good teacher.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And he discovered
how personality types

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.780 align:middle line:90%
are associated with this.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And that there are 27 primary
personality types, that once

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.500 align:middle line:84%
you know the formula, you
can just look at a person,

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.230 align:middle line:84%
and you know everything about
them, really, really fast.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's far more accurate
than the 12 personality

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.050 align:middle line:90%
types of astrology.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.410 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, that's
not my job here

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.357 align:middle line:90%
to get into all that stuff.

00:07:33.357 --> 00:07:34.940 align:middle line:84%
This is mostly what
I want you to see,

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.900 align:middle line:90%
up here, is how this works.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, the chakra
system-- well, first

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:42.200 align:middle line:84%
of all, the hidden
sacred form that

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.540 align:middle line:84%
is behind it, which
only makes sense anyway

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:51.030 align:middle line:84%
since you've got biology and
sound that are interlinked,

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.810 align:middle line:84%
is the same one that
creates biological life

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:55.540 align:middle line:90%
forms, the egg of life.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:00.600 align:middle line:84%
These are the eight notes
of the eight-note scale.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And you can even
identify these two half

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:07.845 align:middle line:84%
steps in this place between the
male and the fourth and fifth.

00:08:07.845 --> 00:08:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'm going
to do is show you

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:16.300 align:middle line:84%
how this works, though
it's intuitive in what

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.720 align:middle line:90%
you're going to see here.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.350 align:middle line:84%
This is really a
lattice or a grid.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And there is a one below,
there's a one we're in,

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:27.370 align:middle line:90%
there's a one above.

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:30.040 align:middle line:84%
In terms of the
chakras also, there's

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.294 align:middle line:84%
a set of chakras below you,
and there's a set of chakras

00:08:33.294 --> 00:08:37.330 align:middle line:84%
that you are in, and there's
a set of chakras above you.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.780 align:middle line:84%
The set of chakras below
you are compressed,

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.250 align:middle line:84%
and they're in the
ratio of the Phi ratio,

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:46.730 align:middle line:84%
meaning that if this was the
length of a set of chakras

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:50.230 align:middle line:84%
below you, that
the one you're in

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:55.440 align:middle line:84%
would be approximately
that high,

00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:03.310 align:middle line:84%
and the ones that go above you
would be approximately that

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:04.110 align:middle line:90%
high.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.630 align:middle line:90%


00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.690 align:middle line:84%
They are much farther
stretched out above you,

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:13.530 align:middle line:84%
and they are super
compressed below you.

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:16.039 align:middle line:84%
This is where you came from,
this is where you are now,

00:09:16.039 --> 00:09:17.330 align:middle line:90%
and this is where you're going.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:22.620 align:middle line:90%


00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:27.480 align:middle line:84%
But just to look at music,
first of all, this here,

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.170 align:middle line:84%
and to see how
music-- what sound

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:35.030 align:middle line:84%
does when it moves through
this basic structure.

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Sound comes in from
below at this first note,

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:43.040 align:middle line:84%
from what was below, which
is the first note, do.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.532 align:middle line:84%
It's now entered into
this white tetrahedron.

00:09:45.532 --> 00:09:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I should do
it the other way,

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:50.590 align:middle line:84%
and [INAUDIBLE]
arranged like that.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:56.320 align:middle line:84%
It comes in first as
this black tetrahedron.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.036 align:middle line:84%
Now there's three places
that it could go to.

00:10:00.036 --> 00:10:01.410 align:middle line:84%
It's in the black
tetrahedron, it

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:05.230 align:middle line:84%
has to move to one of
these three places.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.900 align:middle line:84%
For our purposes
it doesn't matter.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.733 align:middle line:84%
Experientially it might
matter, because it's

00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:14.950 align:middle line:84%
mother, father, child,
male, female, and neutral.

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:17.315 align:middle line:84%
But for our purposes
it has to go somewhere,

00:10:17.315 --> 00:10:18.690 align:middle line:84%
and we're just
going to pick one.

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:20.410 align:middle line:90%
So say it goes here.

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:24.460 align:middle line:90%
So now this is do and re.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:26.540 align:middle line:84%
It now has two left over,
it's got to pick one.

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:29.390 align:middle line:84%
So we'll pick this one over
here, so it goes to this one.

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.410 align:middle line:90%
So this is do, re, and mi.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:34.450 align:middle line:84%
No matter how it
did it, it moved

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:35.575 align:middle line:90%
in an equilateral triangle.

00:10:35.575 --> 00:10:38.100 align:middle line:90%


00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.260 align:middle line:90%
Do, re, me.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.370 align:middle line:90%
Equal spaces between them.

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:45.470 align:middle line:90%


00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:48.040 align:middle line:84%
But now it has to
change direction.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:51.300 align:middle line:84%
It either went in this
equilateral triangle,

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.170 align:middle line:84%
this equilateral
triangle, or this one.

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:55.290 align:middle line:90%
One of the three.

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:57.150 align:middle line:90%
Or it went this way or this way.

00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:00.420 align:middle line:90%
There's only six possibilities.

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.750 align:middle line:90%
But now it has to get back here.

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:07.420 align:middle line:84%
It has to change direction from
this flat plane it's moving in,

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.750 align:middle line:84%
which is the first
three notes, and it

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:14.090 align:middle line:84%
has to change direction and
come back here, to this one.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And all I can do is kind of--
remember how shadow forms are

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.767 align:middle line:84%
the key, and I can only
give you a right brain

00:11:22.767 --> 00:11:23.600 align:middle line:90%
explanation of this.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.599 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go in here.

00:11:24.599 --> 00:11:33.700 align:middle line:90%


00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.230 align:middle line:90%
OK, you've got this little rod.

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And this would be the whole
note step between the do,

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.490 align:middle line:90%
re, and mi.

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:47.450 align:middle line:84%
But then when it has to turn
and go out of the plane,

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:51.020 align:middle line:84%
look what happens to a
shadow form of a turn.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:51.820 align:middle line:90%
It shortens.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:56.850 align:middle line:90%


00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:57.650 align:middle line:90%
It gets shorter.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:05.790 align:middle line:90%


00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:10.500 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, the links
between this one and this one

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.170 align:middle line:84%
and this one is a
whole note, but when

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:16.930 align:middle line:84%
it turns and goes back to the
other one to get back to here,

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:20.365 align:middle line:84%
the experience of it is,
is that it's shorter.

00:12:20.365 --> 00:12:23.260 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And so you have do, re,
mi, half step to fa.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:32.190 align:middle line:84%
It's now completed
the black tetrahedron.

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And in order to continue on,
it has to change polarity

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.850 align:middle line:90%
from female to male.

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And there's only one
way it can do that.

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:47.990 align:middle line:84%
It goes right through zero
point, from four to five,

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:50.420 align:middle line:90%
over here.

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Right through the
center, through the womb.

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And it passes right
through the middle

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.490 align:middle line:84%
over to the opposite
polarity from four to five.

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Gurdjieff
was really talking about.

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:08.090 align:middle line:84%
It's a zero point between four
and five, between fa and so.

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And so a little tiny
change in the great void

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:15.350 align:middle line:84%
will make a huge change
out in the reality.

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:20.740 align:middle line:84%
So now it gets over here onto--
it went [INAUDIBLE] four,

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:22.940 align:middle line:84%
came over here to
five, like this.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:26.030 align:middle line:84%
It's now here, and it
moves for the next three

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:28.250 align:middle line:84%
in a flat plane, whichever
way it wants to go.

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:32.110 align:middle line:84%
It'll come around, and
it goes for so, la, ti.

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Like this, again, whole
step notes because it's

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:38.750 align:middle line:90%
all in one plane of movement.

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:42.350 align:middle line:84%
But then it has to
make another half step,

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:47.260 align:middle line:84%
another angular change away from
the plane to get up to the top.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.185 align:middle line:84%
So you end up with another
half step between do and ti.

00:13:50.185 --> 00:13:53.220 align:middle line:90%


00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Now your chakra system
is one of these things,

00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:04.740 align:middle line:84%
opened up, running
up your spine.

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And so you have the
same things going on

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.490 align:middle line:90%
between your eight chakras.

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:13.090 align:middle line:84%
You have blocks,
changes of angles,

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:15.130 align:middle line:84%
between three and four
and seven and eight.

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:17.750 align:middle line:90%


00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:22.530 align:middle line:84%
You also have a very special
place between four and five,

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:24.520 align:middle line:84%
between the heart
and between sound.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:30.320 align:middle line:10%
So in the eight-point
chakra, you have one

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.580 align:middle line:10%
at the base of the spine.

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:35.510 align:middle line:90%


00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:38.650 align:middle line:10%
You then have a
second one, which

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:45.260 align:middle line:10%
is just a little bit
higher up in there.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.330 align:middle line:10%
You have another one here.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:15:04.690 align:middle line:90%


00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:06.360 align:middle line:84%
So you've got these
eight chakras.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:10.250 align:middle line:90%


00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:12.460 align:middle line:84%
This one really is
the pineal gland

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:15.070 align:middle line:90%
in the center of the head.

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:18.060 align:middle line:90%
This one's above the head.

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.515 align:middle line:84%
This one doesn't sit here, it
sits over here in the front.

00:15:20.515 --> 00:15:22.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show
you this in a moment.

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Just in the first
time, I just want

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:26.350 align:middle line:84%
to show them as a straight
line, but they're not exactly

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:28.040 align:middle line:90%
that way.

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And so energy comes in from
another dimensional level.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:36.410 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you get
born here into this world,

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:40.090 align:middle line:90%
you came from some other place.

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:47.455 align:middle line:10%
And when you do, you have three
chakras, the first, second,

00:15:47.455 --> 00:15:53.830 align:middle line:10%
and third, that become
your domain of expression.

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:58.940 align:middle line:84%
Or they become like lenses to
interpret the reality through.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And you can't go up any
higher because there's

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.410 align:middle line:90%
this half step here.

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:09.510 align:middle line:10%
There's a block, there's a wall
right here that God put there.

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:15.250 align:middle line:10%
And so let me go
to the body here.

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:16.855 align:middle line:84%
This same thing's
true with color.

00:16:16.855 --> 00:16:23.400 align:middle line:90%


00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:27.540 align:middle line:84%
This cube, the color
wavelengths correspond

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:30.040 align:middle line:90%
to sound in the same way.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Though many people have tried
to take the seven notes of sound

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:38.660 align:middle line:84%
and correspond-- see,
there's only three primary

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:39.760 align:middle line:90%
and three secondary.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:45.110 align:middle line:84%
They tried to add another
color to correspond,

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:47.210 align:middle line:84%
to get the color
linked in with that.

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:50.220 align:middle line:84%
But really what it is,
it comes in as white.

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:52.280 align:middle line:84%
It then goes up to the
three primary colors,

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.280 align:middle line:84%
goes across to the other
side, becomes the three

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:57.690 align:middle line:84%
secondary colors, turns
and becomes black.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:59.680 align:middle line:90%
But then black becomes white.

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.670 align:middle line:90%
On to the next grid.

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really a combination
of three primary, three

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:09.869 align:middle line:84%
secondary, black and white,
that are the key to all of that.

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:13.140 align:middle line:84%
I really need to
redo this drawing.

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:17.619 align:middle line:84%
These are-- and it's
much more complicated.

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:22.060 align:middle line:84%
There's actually a rotational
motion going up the spine.

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And females rotate up one
way and males rotate up

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:27.060 align:middle line:90%
the other way up the spine.

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.100 align:middle line:84%
So I've got this
first division here

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.430 align:middle line:90%
showing this rotational energy.

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:33.930 align:middle line:84%
The one for the male
is actually in space,

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.620 align:middle line:90%
for the sexual energy.

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.032 align:middle line:90%
The penis goes up to.

00:17:37.032 --> 00:17:38.740 align:middle line:84%
The female one is not
back there, though.

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:40.110 align:middle line:90%
It's actually in here further.

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:41.522 align:middle line:84%
But I divided them
further so you

00:17:41.522 --> 00:17:44.140 align:middle line:90%
could see there's a division.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:48.000 align:middle line:10%
And there's a half step
in between here, that

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.390 align:middle line:10%
blocks these, a wall that keeps
anything from consciousness

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:54.140 align:middle line:10%
removing higher.

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And then there is
another wall back here,

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:59.300 align:middle line:90%
which is at the back of head.

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:02.460 align:middle line:84%
This is why the Egyptians
used that 45 degree

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:04.100 align:middle line:90%
thing on the back of the head.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:08.059 align:middle line:84%
The chakra, the half step chakra
is this little bump that's

00:18:08.059 --> 00:18:09.100 align:middle line:90%
on the back of your head.

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:21.920 align:middle line:90%


00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:26.530 align:middle line:84%
This is-- just to give you an
idea, this is what happens.

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:30.970 align:middle line:10%
Life comes in here.

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:33.080 align:middle line:10%
It comes into a brand
new reality, which

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.480 align:middle line:10%
is what we're all about to do.

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.200 align:middle line:10%
We're all about to die
here, you might say, and be

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.600 align:middle line:10%
born into another reality.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And when you go into this
new reality, it's new.

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:50.430 align:middle line:84%
Meaning you don't know
anything about anything.

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Nothing corresponds
with anything you know.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.590 align:middle line:84%
The colors aren't the same,
shapes don't make sense,

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:56.390 align:middle line:90%
nothing.

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:59.700 align:middle line:90%
You don't know what anything is.

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And you just-- you were a little
baby when you came in here.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:05.060 align:middle line:90%
You might not-- you know?

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.840 align:middle line:84%
You didn't know
what anything was.

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.510 align:middle line:84%
It takes a while to
understand what it is.

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:14.516 align:middle line:84%
So you only have really
one thing on your mind.

00:19:14.516 --> 00:19:16.650 align:middle line:84%
You're not interested--
at that point,

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:18.775 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to be
interested in how much money

00:19:18.775 --> 00:19:20.950 align:middle line:84%
you got your bank
account or anything else.

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:23.510 align:middle line:84%
You're going to only be
interested in one thing.

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's survival,
that's staying there.

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:30.800 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be your total,
absolute, complete focus.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.155 align:middle line:84%
You're in this world,
and you're going

00:19:33.155 --> 00:19:38.790 align:middle line:84%
to try to do everything you
can to stay in this new world.

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:42.450 align:middle line:84%
But at some point
you will master that.

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And you will figure
out how to be there.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And then once that
gets mastered,

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:57.570 align:middle line:84%
you will then become aware of
the next chakra, or lens, which

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:01.370 align:middle line:84%
is, you will be aware that
there are other beings there,

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:03.560 align:middle line:84%
or other aspects of
yourself, depending

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.340 align:middle line:90%
on how you want to look at it.

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And it will become a natural
desire, though that desire is

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:11.060 align:middle line:84%
totally different
from place to place,

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:16.080 align:middle line:84%
to make contact, physical
contact with the life

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.430 align:middle line:90%
or consciousness that is there.

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:22.855 align:middle line:84%
And so the second one in terms
of the three dimensional world,

00:20:22.855 --> 00:20:24.510 align:middle line:90%
is called sexual.

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:28.530 align:middle line:10%
So the sexual chakra
lies on the next one.

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:33.297 align:middle line:10%
Once you've usually made those
two connections, the next one

00:20:33.297 --> 00:20:35.630 align:middle line:10%
that follows after that, which
is sitting at the navel--

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:39.816 align:middle line:10%
and by the way, the third
chakra is exactly at the navel.

00:20:39.816 --> 00:20:41.190 align:middle line:10%
This whole thing
where the Hindus

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:43.702 align:middle line:10%
say it's one or two
fingers below, and even

00:20:43.702 --> 00:20:45.660 align:middle line:10%
a lot of the martial arts
that say the center's

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:48.032 align:middle line:10%
down there-- if
it's there, there

00:20:48.032 --> 00:20:50.240 align:middle line:10%
ain't anything that shows
up on the computer screens.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.890 align:middle line:90%
Not a thing.

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And we can go right
into the center of it.

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And we were-- because we
all had that training.

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:58.670 align:middle line:84%
We started looking in
there, and saying god,

00:20:58.670 --> 00:20:59.609 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing here.

00:20:59.609 --> 00:21:00.650 align:middle line:90%
Where's the third chakra?

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:02.330 align:middle line:90%
It's not here.

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:04.100 align:middle line:90%
So we just went up, and bingo.

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, you take
the belly button,

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:10.450 align:middle line:84%
and you go right
down the center.

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:16.029 align:middle line:84%
And I really think the ancients
were trying to hide that.

00:21:16.029 --> 00:21:17.570 align:middle line:84%
They did so many
secret things, and I

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:20.510 align:middle line:84%
think it's one of those things
that we thought was true.

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:22.450 align:middle line:84%
To the best I can
tell, that isn't true.

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:24.300 align:middle line:84%
It is right where you
think it would be.

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:28.380 align:middle line:90%


00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:30.380 align:middle line:90%
Right down the middle.

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:36.430 align:middle line:10%
And so the third one that
comes into your existence

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:45.430 align:middle line:10%
has to do with ego and
controlling the environment,

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:48.210 align:middle line:10%
mastering the
environment itself.

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Being able to work with
these new shapes and forms,

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:54.230 align:middle line:84%
and learning how to move,
all this kind of stuff.

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:57.760 align:middle line:84%
Which ultimately turns
into, in this world

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:02.870 align:middle line:84%
anyway, the control
and the power,

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:05.170 align:middle line:84%
and all these kinds of
things that it leads to.

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:06.984 align:middle line:90%
The distortions of it.

00:22:06.984 --> 00:22:08.025 align:middle line:90%
But then you have a wall.

00:22:08.025 --> 00:22:09.900 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
spirit won't even

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:13.630 align:middle line:84%
know that there's
anything more than that.

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:18.200 align:middle line:10%
And so in the beginning stages
of going into a new dimension,

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:22.740 align:middle line:10%
you become totally involved
in survival, sexual energy,

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:24.290 align:middle line:10%
there's sex and power.

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:26.950 align:middle line:90%


00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And if you take-- this is true
of a person, or a country,

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:35.020 align:middle line:84%
or a planet, or a
galaxy for that matter.

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And so in terms of a country,
you could take the United

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:46.970 align:middle line:84%
States back in say, the
late '40s or early '50s,

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:49.390 align:middle line:84%
that's a really
good time in there.

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And we had not discovered that
there was anything above that

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.320 align:middle line:90%
yet.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And almost everybody
in the United States

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.870 align:middle line:84%
during that period
of time, was totally

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:02.640 align:middle line:84%
involved in the
first three things,

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:07.000 align:middle line:84%
of survival, sex, and
power, and control.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.880 align:middle line:84%
Or combinations of it
in one way or another.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:13.080 align:middle line:84%
That was materialism,
that falls in the thing

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:16.390 align:middle line:84%
of getting money and
houses, and making

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:18.592 align:middle line:90%
sure you've got lots of food.

00:23:18.592 --> 00:23:20.050 align:middle line:84%
All these kinds of
things, all fall

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:21.258 align:middle line:90%
in these kinds of categories.

00:23:21.258 --> 00:23:24.960 align:middle line:90%


00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.900 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, in
the early '40s and 1950s,

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:30.490 align:middle line:84%
you could have gone to another
country, any of the older

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:35.440 align:middle line:84%
countries, in certain areas
of China, a good one is India,

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.250 align:middle line:84%
because we're more familiar
with that one, or Tibet.

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:39.920 align:middle line:90%
But India would be a good one.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:48.150 align:middle line:84%
In India they had long ago found
out about this as a country.

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:51.979 align:middle line:84%
And went up into
these set up here,

00:23:51.979 --> 00:23:53.770 align:middle line:84%
into the fourth, fifth,
sixth, and seventh.

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:56.400 align:middle line:90%
There's another wall up here.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.610 align:middle line:84%
So when you find out
where this doorway is,

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:01.360 align:middle line:90%
then you come up into here.

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And so India wasn't
really concerned so much

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:10.060 align:middle line:84%
anymore about materialism
or all that kind of stuff.

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:15.880 align:middle line:84%
They were concerned about love
and sound, music, causal plane

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:21.520 align:middle line:84%
of how things are together in
the final spiritual realms,

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:22.810 align:middle line:90%
up in here.

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:24.534 align:middle line:84%
They were concerned
about other things

00:24:24.534 --> 00:24:25.575 align:middle line:90%
that were more important.

00:24:25.575 --> 00:24:28.150 align:middle line:90%


00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:31.560 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, while the
United States was down here,

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:36.800 align:middle line:84%
really putting all their
energy into getting

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:39.600 align:middle line:90%
the physical planes together.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And there are people
that are the same way.

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:49.280 align:middle line:84%
So this doorway here is
one that-- I mean, all

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:52.860 align:middle line:84%
you guys have one way or
another found this doorway here.

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:55.150 align:middle line:84%
Because you've all
discovered this up here.

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:58.220 align:middle line:84%
What you're now looking
for is this doorway.

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:00.710 align:middle line:84%
You're now becoming aware
that there's another doorway,

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:04.540 align:middle line:84%
there's something
else even above that.

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:09.300 align:middle line:84%
We have built in to our physical
body-- and why we did it,

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:12.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't know--
another angle in here.

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:14.010 align:middle line:84%
We put this, this is
the pituitary gland,

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:16.510 align:middle line:84%
this is the pineal gland, this
is the-- what do you call it?

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:17.670 align:middle line:90%
The medulla?

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:19.889 align:middle line:90%
At the back?

00:25:19.889 --> 00:25:21.930 align:middle line:84%
All you've got to do is
take this spot right here

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:23.030 align:middle line:90%
and go straight back.

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:27.550 align:middle line:84%
It's in a straight line from
your third eye, straight back.

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:30.950 align:middle line:90%
>>A little higher in the back.

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:32.190 align:middle line:90%
>>Right here?

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:34.460 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:35.260 align:middle line:90%
Now.

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:36.070 align:middle line:90%
Is that even?

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:37.513 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:25:37.513 --> 00:25:38.956 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:25:38.956 --> 00:25:42.323 align:middle line:90%
>>How's that?

00:25:42.323 --> 00:25:43.290 align:middle line:90%
>>Slight angle.

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:46.350 align:middle line:90%
>>Slight angle?

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Whatever this is on me,
this is where it is.

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:51.310 align:middle line:90%
I've got my finger right on it.

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:54.607 align:middle line:90%
It's right there on me.

00:25:54.607 --> 00:25:55.940 align:middle line:90%
So that's the place where it is.

00:25:55.940 --> 00:26:01.270 align:middle line:84%
So maybe it is, maybe it is a
little bit lower down in there.

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:03.600 align:middle line:84%
Believe me, there's
another angle in there.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:07.800 align:middle line:84%
We put this angle in
there for some reason.

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure why we did
it, but it has really

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:14.360 align:middle line:84%
caused an interesting situation
with the ascended masters.

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.360 align:middle line:84%
Because when they went
through the chakra

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:20.610 align:middle line:84%
systems of their own cells,
and they got up to here,

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:24.690 align:middle line:84%
they had a real hard time
finding the seventh one.

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:27.650 align:middle line:84%
So what happened is all the
ascended masters, in terms

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:31.710 align:middle line:84%
of looking at-- in terms of
the chakra system of the earth,

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:33.370 align:middle line:84%
they went up to
the 12th overtone

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:35.400 align:middle line:90%
of the sixth dimension.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:38.245 align:middle line:84%
And you've got about almost
8,000 ascended masters

00:26:38.245 --> 00:26:42.920 align:middle line:84%
as of just recently, and
only three or four of them

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:46.290 align:middle line:84%
were able to figure out where
the seventh dimension was.

00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:48.310 align:middle line:84%
that could find the
doorway through.

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:50.040 align:middle line:90%
There's just like, just a few.

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.930 align:middle line:84%
Of course, all it really
takes is just one.

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:56.210 align:middle line:84%
Eventually those three or four
are training the rest of them,

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:57.980 align:middle line:90%
and they're now getting it.

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:00.210 align:middle line:84%
In the last couple
years they got it.

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:04.270 align:middle line:84%
They're all flowing over now
into the pineal glad area

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:07.470 align:middle line:84%
of the seventh
dimension of the earth.

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:12.436 align:middle line:84%
Which is really the 12
dimension in terms-- or no.

00:27:12.436 --> 00:27:14.970 align:middle line:90%
Is that 12?

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:23.080 align:middle line:90%
No, that would be 10 or 11.

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:23.880 align:middle line:90%
Not sure.

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.842 align:middle line:90%
10 or 11 dimension.

00:27:25.842 --> 00:27:29.730 align:middle line:84%
The 12th is actually a
crown on top of the head.

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:31.700 align:middle line:84%
There are different ways
of approaching this.

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:36.940 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Annunaki didn't do
the system that we are doing.

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:40.240 align:middle line:84%
They did go back here
first, and came out

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.700 align:middle line:84%
this way to a chakra
that's in front of you.

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:45.490 align:middle line:84%
There's another one out here
in space, out in front of you,

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:47.045 align:middle line:90%
in front of your third eye.

00:27:47.045 --> 00:27:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And they'd projected their
consciousness that way,

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:52.450 align:middle line:84%
and then made a 90
degree turn straight up.

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And it was through
that particular way

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.690 align:middle line:84%
that they were able
to find the doorway

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:58.730 align:middle line:90%
to the next dimensional level.

00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And so it was like this L
shape, this 90-degree L.

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And they became known as the
Ls for a long time because

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:08.880 align:middle line:90%
of this meditation.

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And later, because
they were the old ones,

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:13.009 align:middle line:84%
that's where the
word elder came from.

00:28:13.009 --> 00:28:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And knowing what that was,
they were called the elders.

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.750 align:middle line:90%
And the elder race.

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:20.320 align:middle line:84%
Because of the meditation
practice that they used

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:23.280 align:middle line:90%
to make this 90-degree turn.

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.000 align:middle line:84%
From what I'm being
told, we're not

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.520 align:middle line:84%
going to go that direction
that you're talking about.

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:31.600 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to come from
here to here first as a race,

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.910 align:middle line:90%
though that is a possibility.

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Now you may do that, but
as an overall planet,

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:39.230 align:middle line:84%
we have I guess already
decided that we're

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:43.310 align:middle line:84%
going to go up to here, shoot
back over here and then out.

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:46.970 align:middle line:90%
And I'll give the pattern again.

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:49.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying you
have to do this.

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:52.670 align:middle line:84%
This is just what I believe
that we're going to do.

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:56.710 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
concepts on the chakras,

00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:58.830 align:middle line:84%
and I'm only giving
one idea about them.

00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:01.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to give a very
complex one in a minute.

00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:05.490 align:middle line:84%
More complex than what you're
probably just about ever used

00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:06.370 align:middle line:90%
to seeing.

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And the energy flows
also have other channels.

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:11.619 align:middle line:84%
There's the spiraling energy
connections, and things

00:29:11.619 --> 00:29:12.910 align:middle line:90%
that are connected to them too.

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:15.410 align:middle line:90%
But I'm only looking at one way.

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:16.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:19.665 align:middle line:84%
>>Could you please name-- you
named the first three chakras,

00:29:19.665 --> 00:29:22.230 align:middle line:84%
but you sort of
skipped up to the head.

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:27.237 align:middle line:84%
>>In terms of the octave, we
skip from the naval up to here.

00:29:27.237 --> 00:29:28.195 align:middle line:90%
Now we're going to go--

00:29:28.195 --> 00:29:29.111 align:middle line:90%
>>What is that called?

00:29:29.111 --> 00:29:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>>This is the heart chakra.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.980 align:middle line:84%
But this is not the heart
chakra from my point of view

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:35.340 align:middle line:90%
of universal consciousness.

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:38.860 align:middle line:84%
This is the heart chakra
of an individual portion,

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:42.390 align:middle line:84%
or in other words, of love
from one person to another,

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:47.450 align:middle line:84%
or love for music, or love for
something, but not everything.

00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Love for everything is
on the pentatonic scale,

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:52.520 align:middle line:90%
which is a more primary scale.

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:54.610 align:middle line:84%
There's five notes,
the black notes.

00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:57.890 align:middle line:84%
What we're talking about here
is the white notes of the piano.

00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And so that fourth one,
relative to that, is up here.

00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:06.570 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the one that we're
wanting to actually focus on

00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:07.830 align:middle line:90%
is lower than that.

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:10.460 align:middle line:84%
So from my point of
we have two hearts.

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:13.110 align:middle line:84%
We have a heart connection
on the pentatonic scale,

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:16.520 align:middle line:84%
and we have a heart
connection on the octave.

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:24.590 align:middle line:10%
And they're 7.23 centimeters
apart, when we found them.

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:25.800 align:middle line:10%
So this is the heart.

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:31.430 align:middle line:10%
The next one is, if you were
male, it's the Adam's apple.

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:33.870 align:middle line:10%
If you're female, you
don't have an Adam's apple.

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:36.990 align:middle line:10%
And it's right in there,
and that's the fifth one,

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:39.970 align:middle line:10%
and it's the sound current
in terms of the octave.

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:43.840 align:middle line:84%
The next one is up
here between the brow,

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:48.573 align:middle line:84%
but there's really, from
my way of putting here,

00:30:48.573 --> 00:30:50.310 align:middle line:90%
you've got three in there.

00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:52.619 align:middle line:84%
But really there's
five in there.

00:30:52.619 --> 00:30:54.660 align:middle line:84%
There's these three, but
there's one on this side

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:56.701 align:middle line:84%
and there's also another
one in back of that one,

00:30:56.701 --> 00:30:58.780 align:middle line:90%
in space behind it.

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And the pituitary gland is up
here, it's the one in front.

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:05.500 align:middle line:84%
Usually people talk
about the pituitary gland

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.160 align:middle line:90%
as being the third eye.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:09.290 align:middle line:90%
Not from my point of view.

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:11.440 align:middle line:90%
It is not the third eye at all.

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:14.390 align:middle line:84%
To me, this is the causal
plane of the Hindus.

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:21.480 align:middle line:84%
It's where the geometries
and the mental understandings

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.102 align:middle line:90%
of the reality are held.

00:31:23.102 --> 00:31:25.060 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to go back
into the pineal gland

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:27.625 align:middle line:84%
in the center of the head,
and that is literally

00:31:27.625 --> 00:31:29.550 align:middle line:90%
the third eye.

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:32.820 align:middle line:84%
The pineal gland-- remember
that picture of an eye

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:34.270 align:middle line:90%
that I showed at one point?

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:36.380 align:middle line:90%
It was a round ball?

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:38.760 align:middle line:84%
The pineal gland
looks just like that.

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:39.840 align:middle line:90%
It is an eye.

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:41.320 align:middle line:90%
It's an eyeball.

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:46.060 align:middle line:84%
It is round, it has a lens on
it for receiving light through,

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:49.960 align:middle line:84%
it's hollow, it has color
receptors on it, on the inside,

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:52.280 align:middle line:90%
just like an eye.

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:53.260 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>>Yes, it's to receive
light from above.

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:58.450 align:middle line:84%
Just as these eyes
can see out this way,

00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:02.100 align:middle line:84%
but can't see that way, the
pineal gland can see up,

00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:04.410 align:middle line:90%
but can't see down.

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And so it receives
light from above.

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:09.933 align:middle line:84%
But these eyes see
a certain portion

00:32:09.933 --> 00:32:12.560 align:middle line:84%
of the electromagnetic
spectrum; these eyes

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:20.290 align:middle line:84%
see fourth dimensional prana,
it's a different kind of light.

00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:23.640 align:middle line:84%
But the eye, I believe, the
pineal gland can look around.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.770 align:middle line:90%
It has a movement.

00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And if the pineal gland looks
through the pituitary gland,

00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:35.860 align:middle line:84%
that's when the psychic
energy is fully turned on.

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:40.030 align:middle line:84%
But if it's looking up, it's
receiving the prana from above.

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Like if you look at a
bird, their pineal gland

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:46.740 align:middle line:84%
sits on the top of their head,
with a thin, no more thicker

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:49.790 align:middle line:84%
than your eyelid
over the top of it.

00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:54.331 align:middle line:84%
So that it's receiving the light
from above, as it's moving.

00:32:54.331 --> 00:32:57.210 align:middle line:90%
>>A baby's soft spot?

00:32:57.210 --> 00:32:59.967 align:middle line:84%
>>The soft spot
is where-- that's

00:32:59.967 --> 00:33:01.050 align:middle line:90%
where you breathe through.

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:03.530 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
tube comes through.

00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:06.450 align:middle line:84%
It's right at the
top of your head.

00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:09.500 align:middle line:84%
So when a baby-- this
is an important thing

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:12.300 align:middle line:90%
I don't think I said.

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:15.960 align:middle line:84%
Remember I said that
13,000 years ago we fell,

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:18.000 align:middle line:84%
and when we did we started
breathing like this,

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.010 align:middle line:84%
and we didn't take the
prana in here anymore?

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:23.360 align:middle line:84%
So when a woman
has a baby, she's

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:24.890 align:middle line:90%
still breathing like this.

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:28.060 align:middle line:84%
The baby's breathing
in the proper way.

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:30.430 align:middle line:84%
All the way through the
nine months and all the way

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:32.580 align:middle line:84%
after it comes out, it's
breathing in the way

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:34.560 align:middle line:84%
that we're trying
to teach right now.

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And so you can look at the
top of the baby's head,

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:40.020 align:middle line:90%
and you'll see this pulsing.

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:42.390 align:middle line:90%
In and out and in and out.

00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:44.540 align:middle line:90%
It's bringing the prana in.

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to look
underneath the perineum--

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:50.740 align:middle line:84%
perineum is, on a female,
between the vagina

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:53.310 align:middle line:84%
and the anus, that soft
spot in the middle--

00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:56.040 align:middle line:84%
that's where the tube also
runs up through there also.

00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:59.047 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like a solid spot
also, just like this does.

00:33:59.047 --> 00:34:00.630 align:middle line:84%
But if you really
check a baby, you'll

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:03.610 align:middle line:90%
see that end is also pulsing.

00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:05.570 align:middle line:84%
There's a pulsing
from both ends.

00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:09.179 align:middle line:84%
And it's breathing
from both ends.

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:11.580 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately
what happens is,

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:15.449 align:middle line:84%
the mother is a much stronger
field, a much stronger

00:34:15.449 --> 00:34:17.980 align:middle line:90%
resonating field.

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:20.980 align:middle line:84%
If you take a whole room
full of these big clocks,

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:23.400 align:middle line:84%
swinging-- what
do you call them?

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:25.386 align:middle line:90%
Pendulum clocks.

00:34:25.386 --> 00:34:27.010 align:middle line:84%
You can do this,
science has done this,

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:28.676 align:middle line:84%
you can just take a
whole bunch of them.

00:34:28.676 --> 00:34:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And whatever the strongest
clock is, within about an hour,

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:35.905 align:middle line:84%
all the clocks will
be moving with it.

00:34:35.905 --> 00:34:38.030 align:middle line:84%
Every one of them in the
room will be doing exactly

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:40.469 align:middle line:90%
in tune with the strongest one.

00:34:40.469 --> 00:34:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And so in the same kind of
way, when the baby comes out,

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:44.449 align:middle line:90%
it's breathing properly.

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:47.420 align:middle line:84%
But the mommy's got
the stronger field.

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:52.150 align:middle line:84%
So in about two weeks or so, the
baby quits breathing this way,

00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:55.469 align:middle line:90%
and starts with the mommy.

00:34:55.469 --> 00:34:58.145 align:middle line:84%
In the same way,
the animals that we

00:34:58.145 --> 00:35:00.667 align:middle line:84%
have brought in close to
us, the cows and the horses

00:35:00.667 --> 00:35:03.000 align:middle line:84%
and the dogs and the chickens
and all these other things

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.220 align:middle line:84%
like that, we
overpower them too.

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:11.862 align:middle line:84%
And very quickly they
start breathing like we do.

00:35:11.862 --> 00:35:15.730 align:middle line:84%
But not the deers and the
elks, and the wild things that

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:17.680 align:middle line:90%
have stayed away from us.

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:20.670 align:middle line:84%
Especially things like coyotes,
who are highly advanced.

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:23.114 align:middle line:84%
They know, man, don't
get near the humans.

00:35:23.114 --> 00:35:26.460 align:middle line:90%


00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:27.585 align:middle line:90%
And they're not doing that.

00:35:27.585 --> 00:35:30.150 align:middle line:84%
This is why, again, I
think I mentioned this,

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:31.564 align:middle line:90%
but that's why they graze.

00:35:31.564 --> 00:35:32.480 align:middle line:90%
Did I talk about this?

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.670 align:middle line:84%
They graze-- if you
notice, when they first

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:36.850 align:middle line:84%
started doing all
their experimentation,

00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:40.260 align:middle line:90%
it was first with cows.

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And a few horses, a few
dogs, but mostly cows.

00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:47.450 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember the cattle
mutilation that took place?

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:51.056 align:middle line:84%
The cattle mutilation took place
primarily over the Colorado,

00:35:51.056 --> 00:35:52.430 align:middle line:84%
New Mexico border,
because that's

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:54.471 align:middle line:84%
where their main installation
last, was in Dulce.

00:35:54.471 --> 00:35:57.520 align:middle line:84%
They have underground
cities in constellation.

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:00.215 align:middle line:84%
They have them all
over the whole world.

00:36:00.215 --> 00:36:01.015 align:middle line:90%
Or they did have.

00:36:01.015 --> 00:36:02.450 align:middle line:90%
They don't have them any more.

00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:08.500 align:middle line:84%
And the cattle mutilation took
place over the whole planet.

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:10.410 align:middle line:84%
They found cows that
had been mutilated out

00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:12.470 align:middle line:90%
on isolated-- just everywhere.

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Out on islands and countries
all over the world.

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:19.830 align:middle line:84%
But most of it was done around
Colorado and New Mexico.

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And the mutilation,
if you want to call it

00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:26.432 align:middle line:84%
that, it was not--
mutilation implies

00:36:26.432 --> 00:36:28.140 align:middle line:84%
that they were ripped
apart or something.

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:30.240 align:middle line:90%
This was not a mutilation.

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Linda Howe, is the
expert on that.

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:33.740 align:middle line:90%
She works with ABC.

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:36.400 align:middle line:84%
She's done a move on it called
"Strange Harvest," which

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.022 align:middle line:90%
was aired on ABC, by the way.

00:36:39.022 --> 00:36:40.730 align:middle line:84%
You can still get that
if you really want

00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:43.290 align:middle line:90%
to know the story behind this.

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:46.910 align:middle line:84%
I've spent time with
her, talking with her.

00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And she said that when
they first gave her the--

00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:54.360 align:middle line:84%
she got all this money
from ABC to go check

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.400 align:middle line:84%
out this cattle
mutilation, which was

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.890 align:middle line:90%
a big thing a few years back.

00:36:57.890 --> 00:36:59.780 align:middle line:84%
I guess it was in the
'70s, pretty much,

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:03.270 align:middle line:84%
and the '80s, though it
still occasionally happens.

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And she just started
investigating it like a murder,

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:11.370 align:middle line:90%
to see who was doing this.

00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And she went through a lot
of governmental agencies

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:15.500 align:middle line:84%
and police departments
and everything else,

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:17.875 align:middle line:84%
and talked to
direct eye witnesses

00:37:17.875 --> 00:37:20.970 align:middle line:90%
and all this other stuff.

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:22.470 align:middle line:84%
Originally, she
thought it was going

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:28.400 align:middle line:84%
to be either some kind of
Satanic cult or the government

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:31.000 align:middle line:84%
themselves or something
else like that doing it.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.380 align:middle line:84%
But the more she checked,
and the more she checked

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:37.249 align:middle line:84%
and the deeper she got, she
goes, it can't be a cult.

00:37:37.249 --> 00:37:38.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it can't be
some little cult,

00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:41.600 align:middle line:84%
it's all over the whole
planet, and it's everywhere.

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that, everything
was done with lasers.

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:47.720 align:middle line:90%
Laser technology.

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And super, super,
intelligent laser surgery,

00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:59.590 align:middle line:84%
which is only a few people
in the world who can do this.

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And there was hundreds
of thousands of cows.

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:05.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, somebody would have been
real busy doing all this stuff.

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.635 align:middle line:84%
And this was-- all they did
is they removed, primary,

00:38:07.635 --> 00:38:10.940 align:middle line:84%
their breathing apparatus
and the sexual organs out

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:11.740 align:middle line:90%
of the cows.

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:13.170 align:middle line:84%
Those were the main things
they were interested in,

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:15.628 align:middle line:84%
because it was the sexual energy
and the breathing patterns

00:38:15.628 --> 00:38:18.300 align:middle line:84%
that they were mostly
concerned with.

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:21.700 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that got them,
that she knew absolutely

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:25.920 align:middle line:84%
beyond any doubt whatsoever
that it was no one on Earth,

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:30.032 align:middle line:84%
was because they have
found these cows, lots

00:38:30.032 --> 00:38:31.781 align:middle line:84%
and lots and lots of
them, not all of them

00:38:31.781 --> 00:38:35.442 align:middle line:84%
but almost all of them,
they found them everywhere.

00:38:35.442 --> 00:38:37.150 align:middle line:84%
When they do find
these cows, by the way,

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:41.790 align:middle line:84%
they find them with no
trace whatsoever of any way

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:43.850 align:middle line:90%
that they got there.

00:38:43.850 --> 00:38:47.020 align:middle line:84%
There's no car tracks,
there's no anything.

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:49.160 align:middle line:84%
There wouldn't even be
a blade of grass touched

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:51.220 align:middle line:90%
anywhere around them at all.

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:54.720 align:middle line:84%
So they had to be
lowered from the air.

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:57.100 align:middle line:84%
What they couldn't explain
is they've even found them

00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:00.610 align:middle line:84%
underneath trees, like this,
where the trees are completely

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:07.230 align:middle line:84%
over the top, and still no
signs of anything at all,

00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:09.740 align:middle line:84%
and I mean from a-- we're
talking about a police force

00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:13.160 align:middle line:84%
going in there and looking for
the slightest little thing.

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:14.730 align:middle line:90%
I mean, just like a murder.

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And absolutely no
explanation whatsoever,

00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:20.050 align:middle line:84%
because it couldn't even
have come from the air,

00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:22.870 align:middle line:90%
because it was under a tree.

00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And yet still, the main
thing that really got them,

00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:29.520 align:middle line:84%
and which is the totally
unsolved murder-- murder.

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:30.850 align:middle line:90%
Unsolved mystery.

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Is that they have had
every single red blood

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:36.510 align:middle line:90%
cell drained from them.

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:38.400 align:middle line:84%
We don't have any
technology known

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:43.840 align:middle line:84%
on the planet that can remove
every single last red blood

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:45.322 align:middle line:90%
cell out of a body.

00:39:45.322 --> 00:39:46.530 align:middle line:90%
We don't know how to do that.

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:48.404 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can drain
the blood out of a body,

00:39:48.404 --> 00:39:51.230 align:middle line:84%
but it's still totally
saturated with red blood cells.

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:55.860 align:middle line:84%
They won't even find one, not
even one, in the entire body.

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's when she
began to realize

00:39:57.790 --> 00:40:02.010 align:middle line:84%
that this had to be done
from someone off planet.

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And since then she's
had tons of evidence,

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:07.860 align:middle line:84%
they've had eyewitnesses,
where they've watched them

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:09.710 align:middle line:90%
come down and do this stuff.

00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And lots of people
have seen it, with

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:15.710 align:middle line:84%
the same exact descriptions
of what they look like,

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:16.970 align:middle line:90%
what the ships look like.

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:19.350 align:middle line:84%
She's even got the
landing pad things where

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:22.377 align:middle line:90%
they landed a couple times.

00:40:22.377 --> 00:40:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And they've got the
photographs of all this stuff,

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:26.110 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:28.571 align:middle line:84%
She is utterly totally
convinced who it is,

00:40:28.571 --> 00:40:31.070 align:middle line:84%
and it's the Grays who are doing
this, along with about five

00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:34.750 align:middle line:84%
or six other cultures that
are working with them.

00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>>And does the energy run
counterclockwise for females,

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:43.670 align:middle line:84%
of the chakras, and
clockwise for the--

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>>No, I believe
that it's-- well,

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.175 align:middle line:84%
if you were looking down your
own spine you would find that

00:40:49.175 --> 00:40:52.835 align:middle line:84%
it goes clockwise for the
female and counterclockwise

00:40:52.835 --> 00:40:55.350 align:middle line:90%
for the male.

00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>>If the mother is practicing
the prana breathing,

00:40:57.890 --> 00:41:01.250 align:middle line:84%
will the baby be able to stay
doing the prana breathing,

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:02.050 align:middle line:90%
or is it--

00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:04.600 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, we've been able to
demonstrate this-- my one--

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:09.530 align:middle line:84%
[? Mackey, ?] when she had
[? Alina, ?] who is now four

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:13.992 align:middle line:84%
years old, [? Mackey ?]
at the time--

00:41:13.992 --> 00:41:15.450 align:middle line:84%
now [? Mackey ?]
is not doing this.

00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:17.230 align:middle line:84%
We went through an
interesting change,

00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:21.260 align:middle line:84%
which I'm going to share
with you at one time.

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:23.810 align:middle line:84%
But for a long time [? Mackey ?]
was doing the breathing.

00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:29.190 align:middle line:84%
At this point she's now become a
Baptist, because of her father.

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:30.552 align:middle line:90%
I can't explain all that stuff.

00:41:30.552 --> 00:41:33.010 align:middle line:84%
But while she was doing the
breathing, when [? Alina ?] was

00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:41.350 align:middle line:84%
born, Alina's soft spot, it took
almost nine months before she

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:43.750 align:middle line:90%
was influenced by other people.

00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:45.490 align:middle line:84%
So when she was eight,
nine months old,

00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:47.530 align:middle line:90%
this thing was still pulsing.

00:41:47.530 --> 00:41:49.560 align:middle line:90%
It was still going on.

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:53.490 align:middle line:84%
These guys really
had the right idea.

00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:56.116 align:middle line:84%
They just put the hole where
you breathe on top of your head.

00:41:56.116 --> 00:41:59.590 align:middle line:90%


00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:03.670 align:middle line:84%
Make sure that it
never does what we do.

00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:06.010 align:middle line:84%
So you can't even
possibly bypass.

00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:09.820 align:middle line:84%
So they take their prana
and their air right through,

00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:11.860 align:middle line:84%
and it goes right through
their pineal gland.

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And so they don't ever--
they can't make that mistake

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:18.327 align:middle line:90%
that we do.

00:42:18.327 --> 00:42:20.910 align:middle line:84%
This doorway here, I'm going to
talk about these two doorways.

00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:25.820 align:middle line:10%
This doorway here, between
the third and the fourth one,

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:29.820 align:middle line:10%
that one can be opened in
many, many different ways.

00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:33.270 align:middle line:10%
But in everyday experience
here in the United States,

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:36.380 align:middle line:10%
probably the way that a lot
of people have been opened up

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:38.370 align:middle line:10%
is in a near death experience.

00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:41.790 align:middle line:10%
A near death experience will
show you where that doorway is,

00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:44.560 align:middle line:10%
and you find yourself
up in the higher realms.

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:46.680 align:middle line:90%
And you're never the same.

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:50.620 align:middle line:84%
If you don't die, and
you come back through,

00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:55.370 align:middle line:84%
you know that there is more
to reality than what you've

00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:59.270 align:middle line:84%
been told, and so you will
then-- you will be altered,

00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:03.030 align:middle line:84%
completely changed, and
you'll start seeking for that.

00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:04.260 align:middle line:90%
It's just an automatic thing.

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:06.850 align:middle line:84%
You can't help it, because
you know there's more.

00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Once you know, no one can
ever take it away from you.

00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:12.410 align:middle line:90%
There's other ways.

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:14.720 align:middle line:84%
The Hindus have
learned a long time ago

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.800 align:middle line:84%
how to do that
through meditation.

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And so there's things
like Vipassana meditation,

00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:22.860 align:middle line:84%
where you sit for 18
hours in a meditation.

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And in that kind of
stillness, and the letting go

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:29.920 align:middle line:84%
of all of this world,
you can find the opening

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:31.370 align:middle line:90%
in ways like this.

00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And there's other
kinds of meditation

00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:37.830 align:middle line:84%
that can find this opening
into the higher centers.

00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:40.390 align:middle line:90%


00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:43.315 align:middle line:84%
Many of the natural
peoples around the world

00:43:43.315 --> 00:43:45.850 align:middle line:84%
have used things
like psychedelics.

00:43:45.850 --> 00:43:48.850 align:middle line:84%
For example, the American
Indians use peyote.

00:43:48.850 --> 00:43:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And the psychedelics will
also open that doorway.

00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And the Americans
in the 1960s came

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:01.870 align:middle line:84%
across one that changed
the United States forever

00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:04.140 align:middle line:84%
and ever and ever, it'll
never be the same after that,

00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:06.430 align:middle line:90%
and that was LSD 25.

00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And that one, 20 million
Americans tried that thing,

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:14.420 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly found
out-- a lot of people

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:16.060 align:middle line:90%
were wiped out from it, also.

00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:19.450 align:middle line:84%
Because there was no training,
there was no initiation,

00:44:19.450 --> 00:44:20.960 align:middle line:90%
there was no nothing.

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:24.340 align:middle line:84%
But they found out about these
higher dimensional levels,

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:27.330 align:middle line:84%
and of course almost all those
people turned right around

00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:29.090 align:middle line:90%
and became very spiritual.

00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:34.400 align:middle line:84%
If you go through all the ranks
and files of all the like, Yogi

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.970 align:middle line:84%
Bhajan and the Sikhs and
all these things, people

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:39.400 align:middle line:84%
who are not involved in drugs
or anything else at all,

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:43.010 align:middle line:84%
but if you sit them down and
say, how did it all begin?

00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Because I did, I talked to lots
and lots and lots of people.

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:49.260 align:middle line:90%
Well, I went to this party.

00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:56.710 align:middle line:90%


00:44:56.710 --> 00:45:01.811 align:middle line:84%
There is a vast difference
in-- there's different kinds,

00:45:01.811 --> 00:45:03.310 align:middle line:84%
just like if you
go into a drugstore

00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:04.768 align:middle line:84%
there are different
kinds of drugs.

00:45:04.768 --> 00:45:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And all the drugs, like cocaine,
which we were talking about

00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:10.400 align:middle line:84%
is one of-- Gurdjieff
used to talk about that.

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:13.740 align:middle line:84%
He felt it was the, in
terms of spiritual growth,

00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:16.290 align:middle line:84%
it was probably the worst
thing he could possibly do.

00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:22.760 align:middle line:84%
Because it enhances the sense
of individualism and ego.

00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:25.780 align:middle line:90%
And it's also addicting.

00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And all of your pleasure drugs,
your opiums and your heroins,

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:33.040 align:middle line:84%
and all these kinds of things,
that's just like, to do these

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:36.420 align:middle line:84%
is like committing
spiritual suicide.

00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:40.110 align:middle line:84%
It's really hard to
get back out of that.

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And some of them, like crack,
is just about impossible.

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:46.100 align:middle line:90%
>>I can relate to that.

00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:49.732 align:middle line:90%
>>It's pretty hard.

00:45:49.732 --> 00:45:52.190 align:middle line:84%
But the psychedelics, on the
other hand, are not addicting.

00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And they have been used
all around the world

00:45:55.200 --> 00:46:00.530 align:middle line:84%
by almost every natural
person there are.

00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:02.360 align:middle line:90%
The Incas used San Pedro cactus.

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:05.270 align:middle line:90%


00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:07.990 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians, by the
way, though I never

00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:10.240 align:middle line:84%
talk about it, though
it's all of their walls,

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:11.980 align:middle line:84%
and papers have been
written about it,

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:15.090 align:middle line:84%
they used a really
powerful one, a mushroom

00:46:15.090 --> 00:46:17.960 align:middle line:90%
called amanita muscaria.

00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And you see it all
over their walls.

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:23.610 align:middle line:84%
So when they put you in
that the final phase,

00:46:23.610 --> 00:46:25.100 align:middle line:84%
they put you in a
casket in there.

00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:29.450 align:middle line:84%
They also gave you this
mushroom to find this door.

00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:34.240 align:middle line:84%
They were looking for you to
get out through the top doorway.

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:36.312 align:middle line:84%
We don't need these
things with this,

00:46:36.312 --> 00:46:37.730 align:middle line:90%
with what we're showing here.

00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:41.250 align:middle line:84%
You won't need any
drugs or anything all.

00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:44.180 align:middle line:84%
This is powerful
enough all by itself.

00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:47.040 align:middle line:84%
You'll be able to experience
the things directly

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:51.040 align:middle line:84%
without anything at
all, absolutely clean.

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:56.140 align:middle line:84%
But we have to explain
what the rest the world is.

00:46:56.140 --> 00:47:00.030 align:middle line:84%
Can't just totally close
your eyes to all this stuff.

00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>>Just to comment on
the Reiki attunements

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:08.880 align:middle line:84%
seem to have done that
for many, many people.

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:12.210 align:middle line:84%
It was that consciousness shift,
and it opened their worlds.

00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, I work with
cocaine addicted women,

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:19.130 align:middle line:84%
and I teach them to
meditate from their hearts

00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:20.380 align:middle line:90%
to their babies.

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And I have found that that has
been the key to helping them

00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:27.370 align:middle line:84%
with their addictions, is
being in that heart space,

00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:29.720 align:middle line:84%
and empowering them
in that heart space.

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's totally gotten them
off of the cocaine and substance

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:34.150 align:middle line:90%
abuse.

00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:36.250 align:middle line:90%
Which is a doorway.

00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:38.170 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:40.400 align:middle line:84%
Cocaine is-- you can
get off of that one.

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:41.700 align:middle line:90%
It's possible.

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:45.060 align:middle line:84%
Certain ones, though
are really hard.

00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:47.780 align:middle line:90%
Heroin is really hard.

00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:49.880 align:middle line:84%
It's, well-- I've never
tried any of those things,

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:52.950 align:middle line:90%
but I've seen so many people.

00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's just-- it's really hell
for them to get out of there.

00:47:57.510 --> 00:48:02.090 align:middle line:84%
But it's not a
spiritual-- you're not

00:48:02.090 --> 00:48:04.470 align:middle line:84%
going to find a way
to the higher worlds

00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:06.238 align:middle line:90%
through those things, for sure.

00:48:06.238 --> 00:48:08.990 align:middle line:90%
You're just not going to do it.

00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:12.930 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, there has to be,
as Gurdjieff would say,

00:48:12.930 --> 00:48:15.340 align:middle line:84%
there has to be some
kind of outside source.

00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:18.940 align:middle line:84%
This is what he means by a near
death experience or meditation

00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:23.830 align:middle line:84%
or a psychedelic or
something that shows you

00:48:23.830 --> 00:48:26.290 align:middle line:84%
the way up into
these higher-- finds

00:48:26.290 --> 00:48:28.080 align:middle line:90%
this doorway, this opening.

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:31.250 align:middle line:84%
It's an opening in you
that gets up there.

00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:34.520 align:middle line:84%
Then once you get up
there, there's another one.

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And this is what the
Merkaba is all about,

00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:39.960 align:middle line:84%
to show you this
doorway right here.

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:42.420 align:middle line:84%
It's a meditation
that will show you how

00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:44.840 align:middle line:90%
to get up into the next levels.

00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:50.283 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to do that,
we believe, as a planet.

00:48:50.283 --> 00:48:52.960 align:middle line:90%
We have kind of chosen a way.

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:54.820 align:middle line:90%
Though there are other ways.

00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And that way has to do--
the different worlds are all

00:48:58.170 --> 00:48:59.525 align:middle line:90%
separated by 90 degrees.

00:48:59.525 --> 00:49:02.530 align:middle line:90%


00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:06.980 align:middle line:84%
>>I wonder if you could make
comments about individuals

00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:10.610 align:middle line:84%
that I'm aware of, and I'm sure
many in the room are aware of,

00:49:10.610 --> 00:49:16.020 align:middle line:84%
who are not necessarily going
up, from the base on up,

00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:19.140 align:middle line:84%
but have come fully
into their heart,

00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:20.870 align:middle line:90%
with their heart fully open.

00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:22.050 align:middle line:90%
>>You mean born that way?

00:49:22.050 --> 00:49:23.210 align:middle line:90%
>>Born that way.

00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And they have to deal with
maintaining their consciousness

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:33.070 align:middle line:84%
and staying connected
with the earth,

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:35.850 align:middle line:84%
and have to deal
with actually being--

00:49:35.850 --> 00:49:41.460 align:middle line:84%
I cannot tell you how many
people cross my path who are

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:43.740 align:middle line:84%
in that space, so
fully in their heart,

00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:47.200 align:middle line:84%
and they have to learn to
be connected with the earth,

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:50.770 align:middle line:84%
and then bring in the
information and integrate it

00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:51.570 align:middle line:90%
with it here.

00:49:51.570 --> 00:49:53.460 align:middle line:90%
They're already open.

00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And so if you could
comment on that place.

00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:57.790 align:middle line:90%
>>It's just called wisdom.

00:49:57.790 --> 00:49:59.660 align:middle line:90%
It takes time.

00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:00.860 align:middle line:90%
I don't really know.

00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:06.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's hard because
we live in a world

00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:09.220 align:middle line:84%
from like Wilhelm Reich, if
you're familiar with his work.

00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:12.590 align:middle line:90%


00:50:12.590 --> 00:50:15.439 align:middle line:84%
He pretty much just saw
that there was a disease.

00:50:15.439 --> 00:50:17.230 align:middle line:84%
His way of looking at
it was that there was

00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:19.530 align:middle line:90%
a disease that swept the world.

00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And that we're not
in a normal state.

00:50:22.070 --> 00:50:24.530 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is,
in a normal state,

00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:27.780 align:middle line:84%
we're a little-- we
come into this world

00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:29.930 align:middle line:90%
and we have an open heart.

00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:32.940 align:middle line:84%
When we first come in, we're
just children, we're babies.

00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:36.234 align:middle line:90%
We just want to love each other.

00:50:36.234 --> 00:50:38.400 align:middle line:84%
But the world's already
sick from his point of view.

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:39.890 align:middle line:84%
So this little
innocent little baby

00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:43.200 align:middle line:84%
walks up to another
little kid and says, hi.

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:47.240 align:middle line:90%
And the little kid goes, wham.

00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And the little innocent
one goes, whoa.

00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is,
there's a constriction

00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:57.450 align:middle line:90%
of your nervous system.

00:50:57.450 --> 00:50:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And the pain that you felt
from that while your heart was

00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:02.340 align:middle line:84%
open-- because it's very painful
to have something like that

00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:06.210 align:middle line:84%
happen-- you hide it in
your muscles somewhere.

00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And you stick it down
in some muscle down

00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:12.270 align:middle line:84%
in there, which tightens up,
so you don't have to feel it.

00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And also there's
constriction here.

00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:20.050 align:middle line:84%
There's also an area in your
aura that gets toughened,

00:51:20.050 --> 00:51:21.090 align:middle line:90%
you might say.

00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And there's an aura in
your crystalline structure,

00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:27.140 align:middle line:84%
out here, out in the
furthest realms out here,

00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:29.810 align:middle line:90%
that gets a distortion in it.

00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:32.300 align:middle line:84%
The distortion could be
a hole or a little bump

00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:34.460 align:middle line:84%
or a plane or something
else like that.

00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:37.970 align:middle line:84%
Which we were actually able
to pick up with the computers.

00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And so this just
keeps happening,

00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:48.590 align:middle line:84%
until finally we
end up with what

00:51:48.590 --> 00:51:51.990 align:middle line:90%
Reich calls an armor around us.

00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:54.440 align:middle line:84%
We get this toughened
up shell around us.

00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:56.430 align:middle line:90%
So you could do anything, man.

00:51:56.430 --> 00:51:57.930 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't hurt you anymore.

00:51:57.930 --> 00:52:01.110 align:middle line:84%
Because your heart's closed
up and you're closed off.

00:52:01.110 --> 00:52:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And so much of
Reich's work was how

00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:08.320 align:middle line:84%
to live, exactly the thing--
how do you live in this world

00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:11.700 align:middle line:84%
with all this stuff that's
coming at you all the time,

00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:16.770 align:middle line:84%
that's not nice, and
still keep an open heart?

00:52:16.770 --> 00:52:22.670 align:middle line:84%
And that is a really-- I mean,
that's kind of the question.

00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:25.590 align:middle line:90%
How do you do this?

00:52:25.590 --> 00:52:30.760 align:middle line:84%
The Merkaba will, if you can get
into the Merkaba and know it,

00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:34.015 align:middle line:84%
then you can insulate
yourself in such a way

00:52:34.015 --> 00:52:35.390 align:middle line:84%
that you can keep
your heart open

00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:37.790 align:middle line:90%
and the things won't bother you.

00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:40.900 align:middle line:84%
But if the person doesn't
know that then-- well,

00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:45.440 align:middle line:84%
Reich did figure out a
system, at least from someone

00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:48.410 align:middle line:90%
who is already armored.

00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:50.522 align:middle line:84%
He figured out a
system called ergonomy,

00:52:50.522 --> 00:52:52.230 align:middle line:84%
and it's the finest
system that I've ever

00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:56.890 align:middle line:84%
seen of healing that
I've ever met, ever seen.

00:52:56.890 --> 00:52:58.750 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I experimented
with it a long time

00:52:58.750 --> 00:53:01.970 align:middle line:84%
ago, I went with it for a year
and a half to see what it was,

00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:03.430 align:middle line:90%
and it was extraordinary.

00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:06.950 align:middle line:90%


00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:10.100 align:middle line:84%
Reich didn't know about
the chakra system,

00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:12.790 align:middle line:84%
except that he had developed
mirrors that would reflect life

00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:15.790 align:middle line:84%
force energy, and was able to
calculate it and measure it

00:53:15.790 --> 00:53:17.350 align:middle line:84%
in instruments that
could measure it.

00:53:17.350 --> 00:53:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And so he discovered that there
were these centers in the body.

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:22.460 align:middle line:84%
He gave them other
names, I don't remember.

00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:25.670 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know about the
Eastern philosophy beliefs.

00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And in the beginning
he figured out

00:53:28.370 --> 00:53:30.550 align:middle line:84%
how to open these things,
because they found

00:53:30.550 --> 00:53:32.440 align:middle line:90%
them all constricted, enclosed.

00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And he figured out how
to open them, [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:35.970 align:middle line:84%
open the bottom
one, but that when

00:53:35.970 --> 00:53:38.725 align:middle line:84%
he got to the second one, which
was the sexual energy, which

00:53:38.725 --> 00:53:40.350 align:middle line:84%
allow the Kundalini
and all this energy

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:43.930 align:middle line:84%
to rise-- then when he
opened that one up, I think

00:53:43.930 --> 00:53:46.855 align:middle line:90%
it was several people died.

00:53:46.855 --> 00:53:48.537 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they died of an orgasm.

00:53:48.537 --> 00:53:49.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a great way to go, I guess.

00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:52.980 align:middle line:90%


00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:56.980 align:middle line:84%
It was so much energy that
it just blew everything out.

00:53:56.980 --> 00:54:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And so he started by saying,
well, I'll go to the top.

00:54:01.010 --> 00:54:03.410 align:middle line:84%
He didn't even realize,
I guess, a lot was there.

00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:05.560 align:middle line:90%
He went to the eyes.

00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And he learned how
to unlock the eyes.

00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:09.195 align:middle line:84%
Because our eyes
are locked, also.

00:54:09.195 --> 00:54:12.450 align:middle line:90%
Our eyes can't move very well.

00:54:12.450 --> 00:54:15.180 align:middle line:84%
Our eye energy, because
of this stuff that

00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:18.610 align:middle line:84%
has been going on from the time
we were conceived of, and even

00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:20.977 align:middle line:84%
in the womb, all the
way out, and especially

00:54:20.977 --> 00:54:22.560 align:middle line:84%
all the way up between
the time you're

00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:25.290 align:middle line:84%
conceived up to about 12 years
old, that's when most of it

00:54:25.290 --> 00:54:28.790 align:middle line:90%
happens, your eyes get locked.

00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:30.450 align:middle line:90%
You can't really move them.

00:54:30.450 --> 00:54:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And they'll have you
spin your eyes like this,

00:54:32.690 --> 00:54:34.666 align:middle line:90%
where you can spin them around.

00:54:34.666 --> 00:54:36.290 align:middle line:84%
You can get them
going whack, this way,

00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:38.130 align:middle line:90%
and whack, back the other way.

00:54:38.130 --> 00:54:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And get them loosened
up and working around.

00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And then he opened up
this chakra down here.

00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And then they
started coming down.

00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:49.710 align:middle line:84%
They opened up all the
centers, and then they

00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:51.330 align:middle line:90%
open up the sexual center.

00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And found that it
didn't kill people then,

00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:54.413 align:middle line:90%
that they can handle the energy.

00:54:54.413 --> 00:54:57.180 align:middle line:90%


00:54:57.180 --> 00:55:00.610 align:middle line:84%
But then after they did that,
then they found that once

00:55:00.610 --> 00:55:02.920 align:middle line:84%
they got the central column
opened up and everything

00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:05.660 align:middle line:84%
and you could handle
the kind of flows,

00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:10.430 align:middle line:84%
then they tried to deal with
the actual armor itself.

00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And the experience
is remarkable.

00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:14.896 align:middle line:90%


00:55:14.896 --> 00:55:17.190 align:middle line:84%
I went through with a
group of about 30 people.

00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:19.512 align:middle line:84%
And we all have real
similar expenses.

00:55:19.512 --> 00:55:22.404 align:middle line:90%
Uh, expenses.

00:55:22.404 --> 00:55:25.296 align:middle line:90%
It was expensive.

00:55:25.296 --> 00:55:28.375 align:middle line:90%
About $120 an hour.

00:55:28.375 --> 00:55:29.175 align:middle line:90%
Experiences.

00:55:29.175 --> 00:55:32.310 align:middle line:90%


00:55:32.310 --> 00:55:35.600 align:middle line:84%
You'd lay on this table
in a soundproof room.

00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:39.090 align:middle line:90%
And my doctor was a woman.

00:55:39.090 --> 00:55:41.850 align:middle line:84%
You lay there, you
take your clothes off.

00:55:41.850 --> 00:55:43.600 align:middle line:84%
But she wasn't really
looking at the body,

00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:46.230 align:middle line:84%
she's looking at the aura,
and the way the energy fields

00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:47.850 align:middle line:90%
come out of the body.

00:55:47.850 --> 00:55:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And you'd just be
sitting there, just

00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:56.094 align:middle line:84%
laying there on this
thing, and she'd just

00:55:56.094 --> 00:55:57.010 align:middle line:90%
be sitting over there.

00:55:57.010 --> 00:55:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And she'd look at you for
about 10 or 15 minutes,

00:55:59.110 --> 00:56:00.884 align:middle line:84%
and she'd watch and
watch and watch.

00:56:00.884 --> 00:56:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And then she'd just go over
to somewhere near your body

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:06.180 align:middle line:90%
and go, pop.

00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:08.580 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:11.370 align:middle line:84%
Really, that's all she did, just
make a little circle like that.

00:56:11.370 --> 00:56:13.610 align:middle line:84%
Usually a little
tiny one like that.

00:56:13.610 --> 00:56:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And you'd be sitting there,
and all of a sudden, this wave

00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:17.200 align:middle line:90%
would come up.

00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And within a few
seconds, whatever

00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:21.860 align:middle line:84%
it was that she just
released, whatever

00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:26.350 align:middle line:84%
that pain was that you felt,
that you tried to hide before,

00:56:26.350 --> 00:56:28.100 align:middle line:90%
comes up.

00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:29.790 align:middle line:90%
And you can't stop it.

00:56:29.790 --> 00:56:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's uncontrollable, and
it just starts coming out.

00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:37.132 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like
in waves that are

00:56:37.132 --> 00:56:39.980 align:middle line:84%
so-- I'm sure these
waves are every bit as

00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:42.120 align:middle line:90%
strong as childbirth.

00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:43.650 align:middle line:90%
It's so powerful.

00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:45.317 align:middle line:84%
And they come up
and they come up,

00:56:45.317 --> 00:56:47.150 align:middle line:84%
and they'll keep coming
up for about an hour

00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:50.070 align:middle line:84%
to an hour and a half,
sometimes two hours.

00:56:50.070 --> 00:56:51.830 align:middle line:84%
Until they finally
start receding.

00:56:51.830 --> 00:56:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And you feel what an
incredible pain you felt

00:56:55.490 --> 00:56:58.040 align:middle line:90%
when you were a little baby.

00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And then when it's all over
you feel like you're floating.

00:57:04.610 --> 00:57:08.186 align:middle line:84%
I always wanted to see if I was
actually off the table or not,

00:57:08.186 --> 00:57:12.380 align:middle line:84%
but I couldn't move
anything, so I couldn't tell.

00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:17.490 align:middle line:84%
But I was sure I was floating,
because I felt so good.

00:57:17.490 --> 00:57:19.690 align:middle line:90%
It felt so good to get that out.

00:57:19.690 --> 00:57:23.057 align:middle line:84%
And they would do
that every week.

00:57:23.057 --> 00:57:24.640 align:middle line:84%
I remember I used
to ride motorcycles,

00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:27.330 align:middle line:90%
and I'd drive to this thing.

00:57:27.330 --> 00:57:30.330 align:middle line:84%
But when I came home
it was like flying.

00:57:30.330 --> 00:57:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Felt just every turn, you could
be so sensitive to everything.

00:57:35.180 --> 00:57:38.195 align:middle line:84%
But then just within one
week, just in one week,

00:57:38.195 --> 00:57:39.570 align:middle line:84%
you'd start to go
back, you would

00:57:39.570 --> 00:57:42.440 align:middle line:84%
start to desensitize
again, and they'd

00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:44.260 align:middle line:84%
have to go through
it all over again.

00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:48.305 align:middle line:84%
Until they finally break
down all these energy things,

00:57:48.305 --> 00:57:50.980 align:middle line:90%
and you could begin to breathe.

00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And so the only thing
I know-- I don't really

00:57:54.290 --> 00:57:59.390 align:middle line:84%
know what to tell you,
except that the connection

00:57:59.390 --> 00:58:02.730 align:middle line:84%
with a higher self, if they
can make that connection,

00:58:02.730 --> 00:58:07.190 align:middle line:84%
and you can get
in trust, then you

00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:08.540 align:middle line:90%
know that you're beyond this.

00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:10.214 align:middle line:84%
You know that
you're immortal, you

00:58:10.214 --> 00:58:11.630 align:middle line:84%
know that you're
not going to die,

00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:14.690 align:middle line:84%
you know that you can
survive all this stuff.

00:58:14.690 --> 00:58:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And you know that you're more
powerful than the disease.

00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:20.190 align:middle line:84%
Then you can keep
your heart open.

00:58:20.190 --> 00:58:23.342 align:middle line:90%


00:58:23.342 --> 00:58:25.425 align:middle line:84%
Let's just have three
people sitting on a hilltop.

00:58:25.425 --> 00:58:28.100 align:middle line:90%


00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And a UFO flies
right up to them.

00:58:30.350 --> 00:58:34.410 align:middle line:84%
A real one comes
right up to them.

00:58:34.410 --> 00:58:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And one person
says, look at this.

00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:39.700 align:middle line:84%
Holy cow, it's
only 10 feet away.

00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And the other two go,
I don't see anything.

00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And you could say to yourself,
how can that possibly be?

00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:49.500 align:middle line:84%
That a real object
can be sitting there,

00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:54.000 align:middle line:84%
and they look right through
it as though it's not there.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.870 align:middle line:84%
We had an actual
recorded incident

00:58:56.870 --> 00:59:00.790 align:middle line:84%
in history, recorded in
history, of this exact thing,

00:59:00.790 --> 00:59:02.680 align:middle line:90%
very similar.

00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was the--
what's it called?

00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:08.855 align:middle line:90%
Magellan?

00:59:08.855 --> 00:59:09.655 align:middle line:90%
Circum-navigator?

00:59:09.655 --> 00:59:15.000 align:middle line:90%


00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.320 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, he landed somewhere
in South America.

00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:20.724 align:middle line:90%
With all these big sail ships.

00:59:20.724 --> 00:59:23.440 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:26.240 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, it's a real
important story to realize,

00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:30.110 align:middle line:84%
if there's even one person
here who hasn't heard it.

00:59:30.110 --> 00:59:34.660 align:middle line:84%
These big sail ships landed
out, you know, the big ones

00:59:34.660 --> 00:59:36.630 align:middle line:84%
with the huge ships,
came in as close

00:59:36.630 --> 00:59:39.750 align:middle line:84%
as they could to the shore,
to somewhere in South America.

00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:42.200 align:middle line:84%
I think it was around
Chile, actually.

00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And they got in these row
boats and came ashore.

00:59:44.900 --> 00:59:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And when they did, they were
met by all these Indians,

00:59:47.810 --> 00:59:49.510 align:middle line:90%
this whole tribe of Indians.

00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And they were all standing
there on the shore,

00:59:52.410 --> 00:59:54.490 align:middle line:84%
trying to communicate,
probably, all

00:59:54.490 --> 00:59:58.160 align:middle line:90%
that stuff, how'd you get here?

00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And Magellan was
trying to tell them

01:00:01.210 --> 01:00:03.650 align:middle line:84%
they came with these
big ships, which

01:00:03.650 --> 01:00:05.880 align:middle line:90%
are just like right there.

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:07.430 align:middle line:90%
You can see them right there.

01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:09.150 align:middle line:84%
The Indians couldn't
see those ships.

01:00:09.150 --> 01:00:10.860 align:middle line:84%
They could see the
boats they came in on,

01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:13.720 align:middle line:84%
but they could
not see the ships.

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:16.300 align:middle line:90%
They saw right through them.

01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:17.720 align:middle line:90%
They weren't visible to them.

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:21.420 align:middle line:84%
Except for two or three
of them, and those

01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:23.830 align:middle line:90%
were the medicine men.

01:00:23.830 --> 01:00:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Who are used to working in
fourth dimensional levels.

01:00:27.830 --> 01:00:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And those guys
could see the ships.

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:33.620 align:middle line:84%
But for the ordinary
people, there

01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:36.200 align:middle line:84%
wasn't anything in
that water, because it

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:39.330 align:middle line:90%
was beyond their imagination.

01:00:39.330 --> 01:00:42.062 align:middle line:84%
It was simply beyond
their imagination.

01:00:42.062 --> 01:00:43.770 align:middle line:84%
They could see the
boats they came in on,

01:00:43.770 --> 01:00:46.100 align:middle line:84%
that wasn't really
beyond their imagination.

01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:47.325 align:middle line:90%
But not the ships.

01:00:47.325 --> 01:00:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's exactly the same
thing today with UFOs.

01:00:53.470 --> 01:00:56.280 align:middle line:84%
If it's beyond your
ability to accept,

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:59.500 align:middle line:84%
or beyond your imagination,
you won't see it.

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:01.916 align:middle line:90%
Your mind will just erase it.

01:01:01.916 --> 01:01:04.040 align:middle line:84%
It's the same way with
sounds and things like that.

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:05.650 align:middle line:84%
We've got all kinds
of sounds, moving

01:01:05.650 --> 01:01:10.280 align:middle line:84%
through this building, high
pitched, squeak, real loud.

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:11.430 align:middle line:90%
All kinds of sounds.

01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:13.069 align:middle line:90%
We just erase all that stuff.

01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:14.110 align:middle line:90%
We don't want to hear it.

01:01:14.110 --> 01:01:16.300 align:middle line:84%
This is another way that
we can block things out.

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:18.740 align:middle line:90%
We don't want to see something.

01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of
your angelic realms

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:26.210 align:middle line:84%
and your ETs and UFOs and all
this kind of stuff like that.

01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:29.370 align:middle line:84%
It's whether or not you can
accept it, if your belief

01:01:29.370 --> 01:01:31.650 align:middle line:90%
patterns will allow it in.

01:01:31.650 --> 01:01:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And then even if
you can allow it in,

01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:36.200 align:middle line:90%
is it beyond your imagination?

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:38.500 align:middle line:84%
Can you perceive
of something that's

01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:40.850 align:middle line:84%
so far outside of
your imagination

01:01:40.850 --> 01:01:44.320 align:middle line:84%
that you can't even
conceive of it?

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.490 align:middle line:84%
Area 39 doesn't know how
to function without it.

01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:47.497 align:middle line:90%
Just doesn't turn on.

01:01:47.497 --> 01:01:50.240 align:middle line:90%


01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.080 align:middle line:84%
>>I have a question
about the heart chakra

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:55.320 align:middle line:84%
and the importance of it
when we do the exercise,

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:59.290 align:middle line:84%
and how important it is that
you said to have an open heart.

01:01:59.290 --> 01:02:01.940 align:middle line:84%
Now for people who have
a problem with that,

01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:05.150 align:middle line:84%
because you know since
childhood they may have closed

01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:09.730 align:middle line:84%
their heart, what type-- are
there any exercises besides,

01:02:09.730 --> 01:02:12.540 align:middle line:90%
OK, looking at the two dots--

01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, those kind-- that's
not going to be enough.

01:02:16.930 --> 01:02:22.500 align:middle line:84%
If you've got real problems
with your emotional body,

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:25.300 align:middle line:84%
then to really work
with it it's going

01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:27.580 align:middle line:84%
to be an area that you may
have to go out and seek

01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:31.870 align:middle line:84%
help or something to
start working with.

01:02:31.870 --> 01:02:35.240 align:middle line:84%
A lot of things
out there, again,

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:37.520 align:middle line:84%
the ergonomy is one of
the finest ones, well,

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.520 align:middle line:90%
waveform will help you.

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:41.085 align:middle line:84%
But if you've got
emotional blocks,

01:02:41.085 --> 01:02:43.450 align:middle line:84%
if you've got physical,
emotional blocks

01:02:43.450 --> 01:02:46.110 align:middle line:84%
and things out there,
you need to somehow work

01:02:46.110 --> 01:02:47.480 align:middle line:90%
with this stuff.

01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:53.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to bring my
nephew in here tonight.

01:02:53.130 --> 01:02:57.530 align:middle line:84%
For about 15 minutes
I'll let him talk to you.

01:02:57.530 --> 01:03:00.950 align:middle line:84%
He's not the only one that
does these kinds of things.

01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:03.990 align:middle line:84%
Let me just put out
a little bit here.

01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:05.790 align:middle line:84%
There are various ways
to work with this.

01:03:05.790 --> 01:03:08.430 align:middle line:84%
You could go through something
like what I did with ergonomy,

01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:11.960 align:middle line:90%
or there's Rolfing.

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:15.370 align:middle line:84%
See, the Rolfing, for
example, what they discovered

01:03:15.370 --> 01:03:18.530 align:middle line:84%
was that you've got the
blocks out here and in here,

01:03:18.530 --> 01:03:20.630 align:middle line:90%
but they're also in the muscles.

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And so Ida Rolf decided, well,
let's just go inside there

01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:26.670 align:middle line:84%
and go directly to it, which
is little more painful.

01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:30.870 align:middle line:84%
But that's another way that
you can approach getting rid

01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:32.660 align:middle line:90%
of some of these things.

01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:35.299 align:middle line:84%
There are other ways too,
and there's lots of them.

01:03:35.299 --> 01:03:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And there's one
that's been developed

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:40.390 align:middle line:84%
in the last few years, which
is called hypnotherapy,

01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:45.060 align:middle line:84%
that is reaching it's kind
of maturity right about now.

01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:47.050 align:middle line:84%
For a while they
were kind of learning

01:03:47.050 --> 01:03:48.202 align:middle line:90%
what all this was about.

01:03:48.202 --> 01:03:50.990 align:middle line:90%


01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:54.437 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the things that--
one of the problems a lot

01:03:54.437 --> 01:03:55.895 align:middle line:84%
of people have--
first of all, just

01:03:55.895 --> 01:03:58.540 align:middle line:84%
to kind of explain real
quickly what Ken does,

01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:01.080 align:middle line:90%
or people like Ken.

01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:03.810 align:middle line:84%
The first thing they
do, like what Ken does,

01:04:03.810 --> 01:04:07.710 align:middle line:84%
is he lays you down, he touches
you and you go into a trance.

01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:08.524 align:middle line:90%
Just like that.

01:04:08.524 --> 01:04:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Only it's a different
kind of trance than what

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.710 align:middle line:90%
you would normally think of.

01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And you communicate usually
through your fingers,

01:04:16.290 --> 01:04:18.420 align:middle line:84%
because that's about
all you can move.

01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And the very first thing
that he'll do is go in there

01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:25.280 align:middle line:84%
and make direct contact
with all these entities

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:29.980 align:middle line:84%
that are in you, if you have
any, and almost everybody does.

01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And that is a
remarkable experience,

01:04:32.290 --> 01:04:34.700 align:middle line:84%
to have them talk
through you, while you're

01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:35.790 align:middle line:90%
sitting there listening.

01:04:35.790 --> 01:04:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And these things start
snarling up your face

01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:40.146 align:middle line:84%
and growling at him, and
all this other stuff.

01:04:40.146 --> 01:04:43.620 align:middle line:84%
You can't believe this is coming
out of you or someone else.

01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And he'll go right in
there and get them all.

01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:48.700 align:middle line:84%
They'll come out and
give their names.

01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:50.690 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting, you ask how
long they've been in there.

01:04:50.690 --> 01:04:52.215 align:middle line:84%
I've watched him
do about 40 people,

01:04:52.215 --> 01:04:54.214 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't believe this.

01:04:54.214 --> 01:04:57.198 align:middle line:84%
It makes the whole hair on
the back of you next stand up.

01:04:57.198 --> 01:05:00.860 align:middle line:90%


01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:04.404 align:middle line:84%
And he'll come in there
and get-- they'll come in

01:05:04.404 --> 01:05:06.820 align:middle line:84%
and they'll talk through, and
he'll find out who they are.

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And then he'll ask how
long they've been in there,

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:15.270 align:middle line:84%
and you'll hear these things,
8,000 years, 10,000, 500,

01:05:15.270 --> 01:05:17.480 align:middle line:84%
you know, long periods
of time they've been

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:18.790 align:middle line:90%
connected with that person.

01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:21.284 align:middle line:90%


01:05:21.284 --> 01:05:22.950 align:middle line:84%
Just to explain it,
that's what he does.

01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:26.840 align:middle line:84%
He takes the-- I don't
know what he does any more.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:28.620 align:middle line:84%
He used to make
this golden pyramid.

01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:32.610 align:middle line:84%
We actually saw this
happen, when he first

01:05:32.610 --> 01:05:34.420 align:middle line:90%
began this years and years ago.

01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:36.130 align:middle line:84%
He would get the
entity to come out,

01:05:36.130 --> 01:05:38.546 align:middle line:84%
and someone else would be at
the end of the room watching,

01:05:38.546 --> 01:05:41.160 align:middle line:90%
you'd go, boom.

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And the entity would start
talking after that person.

01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:46.936 align:middle line:84%
You know, and he'd have to run
over there and get that one.

01:05:46.936 --> 01:05:51.420 align:middle line:90%


01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:54.900 align:middle line:84%
So they learned to make
this golden octahedron,

01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:57.050 align:middle line:84%
and then he brings the
angelic realms down.

01:05:57.050 --> 01:05:59.120 align:middle line:84%
He used to, I don't know
what he does any more.

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:02.230 align:middle line:84%
And that would bring the entity
and lift it out of the body

01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:04.940 align:middle line:84%
and take it into the
proper dimensional level.

01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And you would see a total
change in the person's face.

01:06:08.490 --> 01:06:11.480 align:middle line:84%
It's just like, you're
there by yourself now.

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:13.520 align:middle line:90%
But sometimes it's not just one.

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:16.930 align:middle line:84%
I remember one lady had
down there-- just list

01:06:16.930 --> 01:06:19.310 align:middle line:90%
little old sweet little lady.

01:06:19.310 --> 01:06:22.531 align:middle line:84%
She said, I don't know if I
really believe in this stuff.

01:06:22.531 --> 01:06:24.479 align:middle line:90%
And lay down.

01:06:24.479 --> 01:06:27.890 align:middle line:90%
And holy cow.

01:06:27.890 --> 01:06:32.073 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these things
just kept coming out

01:06:32.073 --> 01:06:33.323 align:middle line:90%
and coming out and coming out.

01:06:33.323 --> 01:06:34.800 align:middle line:90%
It was like 30 or 40 of them.

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.950 align:middle line:90%
They just kept coming out.

01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:39.650 align:middle line:84%
Totally different voice,
totally different expression,

01:06:39.650 --> 01:06:42.290 align:middle line:84%
different names, and he
just kept pulling them out.

01:06:42.290 --> 01:06:45.679 align:middle line:84%
If you've had a lot of certain
drugs, especially like heroin,

01:06:45.679 --> 01:06:47.720 align:middle line:84%
things like this, you
could have like 100 or more

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:50.500 align:middle line:84%
in there, because you
really lay yourself open

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:51.992 align:middle line:90%
for certain things like this.

01:06:51.992 --> 01:06:53.450 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, that's
the first level.

01:06:53.450 --> 01:06:55.366 align:middle line:84%
He'll go through and get
all those things out,

01:06:55.366 --> 01:06:56.990 align:middle line:90%
if you have any.

01:06:56.990 --> 01:07:01.510 align:middle line:84%
The next thing is, if you
have very definite blocks

01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:04.860 align:middle line:84%
from past lifetimes, things that
have happened to you that you

01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:09.120 align:middle line:84%
still hold, the real
traumatic things, like you got

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:13.060 align:middle line:84%
your head cut off or your hands
cut off, or stabbed, or shot,

01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:15.590 align:middle line:84%
or blown up, or these
kinds of things,

01:07:15.590 --> 01:07:18.490 align:middle line:84%
you'll usually hold those
energies in yourself,

01:07:18.490 --> 01:07:19.630 align:middle line:90%
around you.

01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:21.374 align:middle line:84%
And Ken can just go
over and feel them.

01:07:21.374 --> 01:07:23.165 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't lead you
there, or say anything,

01:07:23.165 --> 01:07:26.070 align:middle line:84%
he'll just feel them,
and say, what's here?

01:07:26.070 --> 01:07:29.510 align:middle line:84%
You'll immediately go back
to the time, and be there.

01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And he will work through those
things and get rid of them

01:07:32.090 --> 01:07:32.890 align:middle line:90%
one by one.

01:07:32.890 --> 01:07:34.950 align:middle line:84%
So once he gets all
the things out of you

01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:37.158 align:middle line:84%
and then works through all
the past life stuff, which

01:07:37.158 --> 01:07:39.340 align:middle line:84%
takes a while, then
you're in a position

01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:43.900 align:middle line:84%
where you can start working
with the emotional stuff that

01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:46.620 align:middle line:90%
has occurred in this lifetime.

01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And then once you went
through all that karmic stuff,

01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:52.000 align:middle line:84%
then usually what's
been happening lately

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.420 align:middle line:90%
is something real incredible.

01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to
tell you what it is.

01:07:56.210 --> 01:07:58.980 align:middle line:90%


01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:00.980 align:middle line:84%
Maybe let him see
what he says about it.

01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:01.780 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:04.618 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to bring it
up unless-- it's something

01:08:04.618 --> 01:08:06.242 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't really
think is occurring.

01:08:06.242 --> 01:08:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to be happening
with hypnotherapists

01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:10.880 align:middle line:84%
all over the place, not
just him, lots of them.

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:15.130 align:middle line:90%


01:08:15.130 --> 01:08:18.939 align:middle line:84%
But this is not, this is
not my expertise or my area.

01:08:18.939 --> 01:08:21.200 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I don't even like
to be in the same room

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:22.200 align:middle line:90%
when this guy's working.

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:25.319 align:middle line:90%


01:08:25.319 --> 01:08:27.172 align:middle line:84%
Or in the same city,
if I can help it.

01:08:27.172 --> 01:08:33.390 align:middle line:90%


01:08:33.390 --> 01:08:39.076 align:middle line:84%
Somebody's got to do
it, and he loves it.

01:08:39.076 --> 01:08:40.492 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how he does it.

01:08:40.492 --> 01:08:44.410 align:middle line:84%
He loves to get in there and
do battle and do these things.

01:08:44.410 --> 01:08:45.210 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

01:08:45.210 --> 01:08:48.330 align:middle line:84%
You can talk to him
when he gets here.

01:08:48.330 --> 01:08:52.537 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like a
more than 15 minutes.

01:08:52.537 --> 01:08:53.620 align:middle line:90%
I may lose the group here.

01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:56.620 align:middle line:90%


01:08:56.620 --> 01:08:59.979 align:middle line:84%
But it is a real important
part of all of this.

01:08:59.979 --> 01:09:03.760 align:middle line:90%


01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very,
very deep subject.

01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:06.670 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot to it.

01:09:06.670 --> 01:09:10.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've just slightly
covered the whole subject.

01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:13.439 align:middle line:84%
But this all started with--
Liz was talking about how

01:09:13.439 --> 01:09:15.350 align:middle line:90%
to keep your heart open.

01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And it is a real, it
is the whole thing.

01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:22.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even if you're totally
healed, you got it all,

01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:25.000 align:middle line:84%
there you are, totally
healed and everything, you've

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.180 align:middle line:84%
got to figure out how to be
able to move through this world

01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:29.979 align:middle line:90%
and not let it happen again.

01:09:29.979 --> 01:09:32.264 align:middle line:84%
And the Merkaba will
do a great deal of this

01:09:32.264 --> 01:09:34.430 align:middle line:84%
once you can get to the
level where you can actually

01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:36.880 align:middle line:84%
create the Merkaba, and a
living Merkaba field around you.

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:39.609 align:middle line:90%


01:09:39.609 --> 01:09:40.977 align:middle line:90%
You'll be OK after that.

01:09:40.977 --> 01:09:42.560 align:middle line:84%
You could move right
through anything,

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:44.430 align:middle line:84%
you can go right in through
the middle of anything.

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:46.013 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make any
difference at all.

01:09:46.013 --> 01:09:47.530 align:middle line:90%
And it won't affect you.

01:09:47.530 --> 01:09:49.750 align:middle line:84%
No spirits could come in
you, none of these things.

01:09:49.750 --> 01:09:53.140 align:middle line:84%
Nobody can direct thoughts at
you, nobody can do anything.

01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And they can't harm you in
any of those kinds of ways.

01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:58.280 align:middle line:90%
But we've got to get there.

01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:00.140 align:middle line:84%
That's the part, is
this last little bit

01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:03.230 align:middle line:84%
of how to get that
field truly created

01:10:03.230 --> 01:10:07.430 align:middle line:90%
around every single person.

01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:09.920 align:middle line:84%
>>So once you've
created the Merkaba,

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:12.230 align:middle line:84%
if you haven't gone through
any of these processes

01:10:12.230 --> 01:10:16.120 align:middle line:84%
to release these entities,
wouldn't the lightning and the

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:18.000 align:middle line:84%
energy be so great
that they would simply

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.740 align:middle line:90%
be driven off at that point?

01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:25.050 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, if you haven't cleared
yourself of all these things,

01:10:25.050 --> 01:10:27.960 align:middle line:84%
and you've got entities and
you're doing the Merkaba work,

01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:29.800 align:middle line:90%
you're going to be real limited.

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:32.496 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the
Merkaba will be--

01:10:32.496 --> 01:10:34.730 align:middle line:84%
it'll never get
to the place where

01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:39.130 align:middle line:90%
it's a living field on its own.

01:10:39.130 --> 01:10:42.209 align:middle line:84%
And whether or not you have
really created that thing,

01:10:42.209 --> 01:10:44.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you're going to
be able to do that until you're

01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:47.150 align:middle line:84%
clear on all those
kinds of levels.

01:10:47.150 --> 01:10:49.350 align:middle line:84%
You've got to work
through all that stuff.

01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:52.730 align:middle line:84%
This is an extraordinary
state we are in here.

01:10:52.730 --> 01:10:54.465 align:middle line:84%
This is not normal,
it's not natural,

01:10:54.465 --> 01:10:56.790 align:middle line:84%
this doesn't normally
happen in nature.

01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:58.510 align:middle line:84%
Normally we're like
little babies that

01:10:58.510 --> 01:11:00.920 align:middle line:84%
get to grow up nice
and clean and easy,

01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:02.920 align:middle line:84%
and all the way through,
and we have the Merkaba

01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:04.880 align:middle line:84%
all the way through
from the beginning.

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have
all these kinds

01:11:06.730 --> 01:11:11.300 align:middle line:84%
of incredible negative
distortions and things that are

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:15.015 align:middle line:90%
being flown at us all the time.

01:11:15.015 --> 01:11:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>Couldn't a person kind of
bootstrap themselves and just

01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:19.700 align:middle line:84%
make such a solid connection
with their higher self

01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:23.610 align:middle line:84%
and go through such a solid
series of affirmations

01:11:23.610 --> 01:11:27.165 align:middle line:84%
and whatever, that they can
just drive those things away

01:11:27.165 --> 01:11:30.020 align:middle line:90%
and reclaim their sovereignty?

01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:33.100 align:middle line:84%
>>You have the
ability to do anything

01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:39.020 align:middle line:90%
at all, if you believe it.

01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you really trust and
feel the power of yourself, yes,

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:46.390 align:middle line:90%
you can do anything at all.

01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:50.150 align:middle line:84%
You can heal anything, you
can solve any problems at all.

01:11:50.150 --> 01:11:54.150 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't think
you can, and maybe

01:11:54.150 --> 01:11:56.905 align:middle line:84%
all your life you haven't,
when you do make content

01:11:56.905 --> 01:12:01.480 align:middle line:84%
with higher self, higher self,
realizing you're kind of stuck,

01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:05.790 align:middle line:84%
may say, why don't you go
talk to this guy over here,

01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:08.110 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

01:12:08.110 --> 01:12:14.030 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is, you always--
you have God within you.

01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:17.270 align:middle line:84%
The creator, who created
everything in existence,

01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:20.790 align:middle line:84%
including the demons and
everything else, is within you,

01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:24.040 align:middle line:84%
is you, really, on
the deepest level.

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:26.280 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing
that you cannot do,

01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:29.520 align:middle line:84%
but only if you can get to
that place where you can truly

01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:33.625 align:middle line:84%
believe in yourself and who
you are, and take action.

01:12:33.625 --> 01:12:34.425 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

01:12:34.425 --> 01:12:37.215 align:middle line:90%


01:12:37.215 --> 01:12:38.150 align:middle line:90%
>>That's right.

01:12:38.150 --> 01:12:39.640 align:middle line:90%
And even the reality itself.

01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Higher self can actually
warp the very reality itself

01:12:42.770 --> 01:12:45.530 align:middle line:84%
in all kinds of ways
that you might not even

01:12:45.530 --> 01:12:47.390 align:middle line:90%
imagine right now.

01:12:47.390 --> 01:12:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
lead into a point

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:53.730 align:middle line:84%
where we're going to talk about
the ankh, and their concepts

01:12:53.730 --> 01:12:56.540 align:middle line:84%
and ideas a little bit on
that, on what they meant

01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:59.420 align:middle line:90%
by it was the key to life.

01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:01.540 align:middle line:84%
I can't go into this
in great detail.

01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:04.082 align:middle line:90%


01:13:04.082 --> 01:13:06.660 align:middle line:84%
But again, I'm just laying
out little keys and pieces

01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:08.990 align:middle line:84%
and things here,
and you're going

01:13:08.990 --> 01:13:15.030 align:middle line:84%
to have to go deeper within your
own self to find full opening.

01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:16.525 align:middle line:84%
Now almost all
these subjects, you

01:13:16.525 --> 01:13:18.800 align:middle line:84%
could sit here
and talk for days.

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And all I can do is just
kind of cross over them.

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:28.350 align:middle line:84%
So this chakra
system is pretty much

01:13:28.350 --> 01:13:32.550 align:middle line:84%
what you see in most books
and things like that.

01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:34.550 align:middle line:84%
But in music it's
not just an octave.

01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:39.540 align:middle line:84%
There are the five
black keys on a piano,

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:42.300 align:middle line:90%
so there's really 13 notes.

01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And what we found
purely from science

01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:46.720 align:middle line:84%
was when we were checking
the chakra system,

01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:50.790 align:middle line:84%
is that there are 13
chakras running up the body.

01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And that the chakras
are topographically,

01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:59.310 align:middle line:84%
on the body, 7.23
centimeters apart.

01:13:59.310 --> 01:14:00.995 align:middle line:84%
And you can take
your-- from the tip

01:14:00.995 --> 01:14:04.640 align:middle line:84%
of your nose to the tip of
your chin, or across your eyes

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:07.119 align:middle line:90%
if you want to jab them out.

01:14:07.119 --> 01:14:08.660 align:middle line:84%
But you can take--
this one's easier.

01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:10.701 align:middle line:84%
Take the tip of your nose
to the tip of your chin

01:14:10.701 --> 01:14:11.930 align:middle line:90%
to get that distance.

01:14:11.930 --> 01:14:14.180 align:middle line:84%
You got to lay down on the
bed or something like this.

01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:15.350 align:middle line:90%
You can try this.

01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:18.010 align:middle line:84%
You put one finger
at the perineum,

01:14:18.010 --> 01:14:20.172 align:middle line:84%
and then just come
up around, then

01:14:20.172 --> 01:14:22.380 align:middle line:84%
where that hits in the body,
if you went straight in,

01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:26.642 align:middle line:84%
is where the second
chakra's going to be.

01:14:26.642 --> 01:14:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And then when you come up the
same distance from that point

01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:31.740 align:middle line:84%
again, and you can try
this, when you come back up,

01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:35.720 align:middle line:84%
your thumb is going to go
right inside your navel.

01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:37.870 align:middle line:90%
Which is where the third one is.

01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And then when you come
up again, to here,

01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:42.990 align:middle line:84%
it's going to come up
to the solar plexus.

01:14:42.990 --> 01:14:45.317 align:middle line:84%
It'll hit right in the
mouth of the solar plexus.

01:14:45.317 --> 01:14:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And you come up--
which is the fourth.

01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And you come up again, and
this is the sternum chakra,

01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:51.570 align:middle line:90%
number five.

01:14:51.570 --> 01:14:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And again, you
come to the heart.

01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And when you do
it again, you come

01:14:55.170 --> 01:14:59.680 align:middle line:84%
right to the Adam's apple, which
is number five, six, seven.

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And then from the Adam's apple,
it will come to the chin.

01:15:02.290 --> 01:15:05.670 align:middle line:90%
The chin as a chakra.

01:15:05.670 --> 01:15:06.935 align:middle line:90%
The Hindus do about it.

01:15:06.935 --> 01:15:08.710 align:middle line:84%
The only one that
really gets into it--

01:15:08.710 --> 01:15:12.500 align:middle line:84%
the one who thinks it's very,
very important is Yogi Bhajan.

01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:14.954 align:middle line:84%
He talks about the importance
of the chin chakra.

01:15:14.954 --> 01:15:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And from there it goes to
the tip of the nose, which

01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:20.010 align:middle line:90%
is another chakra.

01:15:20.010 --> 01:15:22.945 align:middle line:84%
This is eight, nine,
and from here, it

01:15:22.945 --> 01:15:25.540 align:middle line:84%
will go to the third eye, which
we're familiar with, which

01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:26.342 align:middle line:90%
is number 10.

01:15:26.342 --> 01:15:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And from 10, it goes to what
we call a 45-degree chakra.

01:15:30.770 --> 01:15:32.040 align:middle line:90%
It's at an angle.

01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:33.720 align:middle line:84%
It comes down in here,
which is actually

01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:37.077 align:middle line:84%
connected to the pineal
gland also, which is 11,

01:15:37.077 --> 01:15:39.660 align:middle line:84%
and then from there to the top
of the head, which is sometimes

01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:41.810 align:middle line:84%
called the crown
chakra, number 12.

01:15:41.810 --> 01:15:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And number 13 is over
the top of the head.

01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:47.550 align:middle line:84%
There's also a mini
chakra from the top

01:15:47.550 --> 01:15:51.510 align:middle line:84%
of the chin to the top of
the head, another one, which

01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:52.440 align:middle line:90%
you saw on him.

01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:54.000 align:middle line:90%
They're closer together.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.280 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you that
one in just a moment.

01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And according to the Egyptians,
there's not one chakra there,

01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:02.880 align:middle line:90%
but there's five in a row.

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:05.480 align:middle line:90%


01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:08.200 align:middle line:84%
There's five total
different channels.

01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And the five rotate up
from one chakra to the next

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:14.610 align:middle line:90%
by 90 degrees.

01:16:14.610 --> 01:16:15.410 align:middle line:90%
They ratchet.

01:16:15.410 --> 01:16:17.526 align:middle line:84%
The first one is this
way, then this way.

01:16:17.526 --> 01:16:19.775 align:middle line:84%
Then if I can move my hand
around, then this way, then

01:16:19.775 --> 01:16:22.310 align:middle line:84%
this way-- click,
click, click-- just

01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:25.270 align:middle line:84%
like-- remember the
drawing of light?

01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:26.695 align:middle line:90%
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.

01:16:26.695 --> 01:16:30.154 align:middle line:84%
Well, that drawing of light
happens to be exactly--

01:16:30.154 --> 01:16:31.600 align:middle line:90%
that's this one.

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:37.390 align:middle line:90%


01:16:37.390 --> 01:16:38.730 align:middle line:90%
Somebody's moved it around.

01:16:38.730 --> 01:16:41.300 align:middle line:90%
Here it is.

01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:43.540 align:middle line:90%
This one here.

01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:45.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't have it on
the screen right now,

01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:50.690 align:middle line:84%
but this one is an area-- if you
were to look at a human being

01:16:50.690 --> 01:16:54.820 align:middle line:84%
from above, that
happens to be one

01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:59.750 align:middle line:84%
of the patterns of the
complex patterns of the body

01:16:59.750 --> 01:17:02.110 align:middle line:84%
and the sharpest move
according to light,

01:17:02.110 --> 01:17:05.010 align:middle line:84%
exactly the way light
moves, moving up there,

01:17:05.010 --> 01:17:09.840 align:middle line:84%
each one being 90 degrees
away from the next one, 7.23

01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:11.906 align:middle line:90%
centimeters apart.

01:17:11.906 --> 01:17:15.547 align:middle line:84%
And so there's five
channels, and I'm

01:17:15.547 --> 01:17:16.880 align:middle line:90%
going to describe what they are.

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'm then just going
to very lightly show you

01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:23.350 align:middle line:84%
how the body conforms to
these rotating patterns

01:17:23.350 --> 01:17:24.360 align:middle line:90%
as it moves up.

01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:27.060 align:middle line:84%
You'll intuitively
see what I'm saying.

01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:31.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could sit down and
very carefully work it all out

01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:33.900 align:middle line:84%
and see a lot more
than that, but this

01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:37.660 align:middle line:84%
will be enough, I think, to get
an idea of what the body does.

01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:40.660 align:middle line:90%


01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:45.910 align:middle line:84%
The first channel is
at the perineum itself,

01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:51.080 align:middle line:84%
and it goes straight
up the body,

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:54.480 align:middle line:90%
absolutely straight as an arrow.

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:56.120 align:middle line:90%
It is this big around.

01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:59.330 align:middle line:84%
If you take your thumb
and middle, longest finger

01:17:59.330 --> 01:18:02.560 align:middle line:84%
and connect it together,
the size of that opening,

01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:06.680 align:middle line:84%
if you had some object that you
can just lightly put around,

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:10.760 align:middle line:84%
that's how big around
that is, the tube,

01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:14.200 align:middle line:84%
and it is as straight
as a fluorescent tube.

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:16.790 align:middle line:84%
It stretches all the
way up into the top

01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:19.130 align:middle line:84%
of the crystalline
structure above your head

01:18:19.130 --> 01:18:21.036 align:middle line:90%
and below your feet.

01:18:21.036 --> 01:18:24.510 align:middle line:84%
It runs all the way up
through the whole body.

01:18:24.510 --> 01:18:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And so you just have
this straight shot

01:18:31.930 --> 01:18:33.800 align:middle line:90%
from top to bottom.

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:36.180 align:middle line:84%
This is the base
of the spine here.

01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:42.460 align:middle line:84%
But that one keeps on going all
the way down to below the feet.

01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:43.830 align:middle line:90%
Now, I have no choice here.

01:18:43.830 --> 01:18:47.430 align:middle line:84%
I have to be a little graphic in
order to describe these things.

01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:50.352 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking from
underneath a person,

01:18:50.352 --> 01:18:54.209 align:middle line:84%
whether it's male or female,
there's the central tube.

01:18:54.209 --> 01:18:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And these tubes are
like overlapping.

01:18:55.750 --> 01:19:01.970 align:middle line:84%
They're large energy tubes, and
they're overlapping like this,

01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:04.630 align:middle line:90%
like a Pisces, OK?

01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:06.700 align:middle line:84%
So it would be
like five circles,

01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:07.700 align:middle line:90%
but they're overlapping.

01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:10.550 align:middle line:84%
They're bigger that they
overlap over top of each other.

01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:13.800 align:middle line:84%
You go back from the
perineum back to the anus,

01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:18.910 align:middle line:90%
and it is another channel.

01:19:18.910 --> 01:19:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And it moves up the spine,
not in a straight line,

01:19:21.390 --> 01:19:23.310 align:middle line:90%
but it moves like this.

01:19:23.310 --> 01:19:32.430 align:middle line:90%


01:19:32.430 --> 01:19:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And then directly
behind the anus,

01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:38.590 align:middle line:90%
you go back to the coccyx.

01:19:38.590 --> 01:19:41.220 align:middle line:84%
You have a spinal
column coming down,

01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:43.850 align:middle line:84%
and you have the sacrum,
which is a triangle,

01:19:43.850 --> 01:19:46.290 align:middle line:84%
and off the a sacrum is this
little tube that comes down,

01:19:46.290 --> 01:19:49.170 align:middle line:84%
which comes down and
meets on the same plane

01:19:49.170 --> 01:19:53.770 align:middle line:90%
as the anus and the perineum.

01:19:53.770 --> 01:19:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And you have your
entire spinal column

01:19:57.580 --> 01:20:00.850 align:middle line:90%
is focused at that point.

01:20:00.850 --> 01:20:02.584 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
whole thing, which

01:20:02.584 --> 01:20:05.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if want to get
into it a whole lot right now,

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:12.030 align:middle line:84%
but let me see if I've got
it here, this one here.

01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:15.830 align:middle line:90%


01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:21.490 align:middle line:84%
An angle creates an actual
measurable frequency.

01:20:21.490 --> 01:20:25.320 align:middle line:84%
It's in megahertz
that you can measure.

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:31.960 align:middle line:90%
So does a rod like this.

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:37.570 align:middle line:84%
If you have a rod, there
is a standing wavelength

01:20:37.570 --> 01:20:40.150 align:middle line:90%
that will come from tip to tip.

01:20:40.150 --> 01:20:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And you can measure the
frequency coming off of it.

01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:48.920 align:middle line:84%
If you shorten it, you're going
to get a higher wavelength,

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:52.180 align:middle line:84%
shorter wavelength but
higher frequency off of that,

01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:55.270 align:middle line:84%
and you can measure
coming off of both tips.

01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:56.190 align:middle line:90%
People have done that.

01:20:56.190 --> 01:20:58.320 align:middle line:90%
This is DJ Nelson's work.

01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And they have all only
put one more thing.

01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:06.350 align:middle line:84%
With every rod length,
there is an angle.

01:21:06.350 --> 01:21:08.950 align:middle line:84%
So anything that has
a sharp point on it

01:21:08.950 --> 01:21:13.835 align:middle line:84%
like that has a frequency
that you can measure,

01:21:13.835 --> 01:21:18.710 align:middle line:84%
that comes off of it,
just by its shape.

01:21:18.710 --> 01:21:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And so from 0 to 360 degrees,
there is a different frequency.

01:21:26.670 --> 01:21:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And these are all
listed on here.

01:21:28.170 --> 01:21:30.980 align:middle line:84%
There's pages and
pages of this of all

01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:35.190 align:middle line:84%
the different frequencies
that come off of there.

01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And with every angle, there is
a rod length associated with it.

01:21:40.150 --> 01:21:42.870 align:middle line:84%
So you can either
use a rod or an angle

01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:45.280 align:middle line:90%
to produce these things.

01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And if you look, what
the Egyptians used,

01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:49.970 align:middle line:90%
though, was primarily rods.

01:21:49.970 --> 01:21:51.220 align:middle line:90%
And they did everything.

01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:53.310 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian philosophy
could do anything and just

01:21:53.310 --> 01:21:57.550 align:middle line:84%
about everything you can
imagine with just a stick.

01:21:57.550 --> 01:21:59.415 align:middle line:90%
They were just made out of wood.

01:21:59.415 --> 01:22:02.290 align:middle line:84%
We've looked at over 200 of
these and took photographs.

01:22:02.290 --> 01:22:04.032 align:middle line:84%
They were usually
just made out of wood.

01:22:04.032 --> 01:22:06.240 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make any difference
what it's made out of.

01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:10.135 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember-- was it Moses
took his thing down and turned

01:22:10.135 --> 01:22:10.935 align:middle line:90%
it into a snake?

01:22:10.935 --> 01:22:13.670 align:middle line:90%


01:22:13.670 --> 01:22:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And the thing of thy rod and
thy staff will comfort thee.

01:22:19.890 --> 01:22:23.050 align:middle line:90%


01:22:23.050 --> 01:22:26.300 align:middle line:84%
It was an ancient science
that we've long forgotten.

01:22:26.300 --> 01:22:28.400 align:middle line:84%
But you can do-- we
were studying this,

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:32.990 align:middle line:84%
and they would put, again,
these tuning forks it in,

01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:35.240 align:middle line:84%
which was another thing, and
these various things that

01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:36.040 align:middle line:90%
can go on the top.

01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:37.514 align:middle line:90%
Like one of them was an ankh.

01:22:37.514 --> 01:22:38.930 align:middle line:84%
One of them was
the 45-degree one.

01:22:38.930 --> 01:22:41.250 align:middle line:84%
These various things
are going on there.

01:22:41.250 --> 01:22:43.010 align:middle line:84%
They put an ankh on
there, by the way.

01:22:43.010 --> 01:22:44.130 align:middle line:90%
And you strike the rod.

01:22:44.130 --> 01:22:47.030 align:middle line:84%
What happens is it
just keeps increasing

01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:51.780 align:middle line:84%
because it circulates the
energy back into the rod again,

01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:53.405 align:middle line:84%
which is one of the
keys about which we

01:22:53.405 --> 01:22:55.380 align:middle line:90%
were about to talk about.

01:22:55.380 --> 01:23:01.860 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, the spine comes
down, and then here's

01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:07.910 align:middle line:84%
this angle, this triangle
coming off of there.

01:23:07.910 --> 01:23:11.720 align:middle line:84%
I tried to find someone
who could figure out

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:12.520 align:middle line:90%
what that angle is.

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:14.890 align:middle line:84%
I figured somebody must
have measured it in books,

01:23:14.890 --> 01:23:16.677 align:middle line:90%
some doctor somewhere.

01:23:16.677 --> 01:23:19.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't think anybody's ever
thought about it because we

01:23:19.010 --> 01:23:20.050 align:middle line:90%
couldn't find anywhere.

01:23:20.050 --> 01:23:21.000 align:middle line:84%
We looked through
all kinds of stuff.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:21.833 align:middle line:90%
We couldn't find it.

01:23:21.833 --> 01:23:24.260 align:middle line:84%
Finally we had to go
get a couple skeletons,

01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:26.470 align:middle line:84%
you know, these real
ones that they use.

01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And we got one male and one
female, and looked at them,

01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:32.845 align:middle line:84%
and just best we could try
to measure what it was at.

01:23:32.845 --> 01:23:36.100 align:middle line:90%
And it was right at 52 degrees.

01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know for sure,
just measuring two of them.

01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:42.030 align:middle line:84%
But it was real
close to 52 degrees.

01:23:42.030 --> 01:23:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And we're thinking
probably, just

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:47.220 align:middle line:84%
because it is so close to it,
that's the angle the Great

01:23:47.220 --> 01:23:48.370 align:middle line:90%
Pyramid is 52.

01:23:48.370 --> 01:23:49.600 align:middle line:90%
51 and 51 minutes.

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:51.690 align:middle line:90%
Almost two degrees.

01:23:51.690 --> 01:23:53.420 align:middle line:90%
It may be related to that.

01:23:53.420 --> 01:23:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Because we do have the
actual entire shape

01:23:56.140 --> 01:24:01.430 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid around
our body in its perfection.

01:24:01.430 --> 01:24:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, the whole spinal
column comes down here

01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:07.540 align:middle line:90%
and focuses on this point.

01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And it has a flow of
energy up the chakra.

01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:12.670 align:middle line:84%
Not up the spine, but
up the chakra system.

01:24:12.670 --> 01:24:14.350 align:middle line:90%
It swings wide.

01:24:14.350 --> 01:24:15.790 align:middle line:90%
It goes like this.

01:24:15.790 --> 01:24:23.032 align:middle line:90%


01:24:23.032 --> 01:24:23.917 align:middle line:90%
Like that.

01:24:23.917 --> 01:24:27.080 align:middle line:90%


01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:28.870 align:middle line:90%
That's with your male or female.

01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:33.470 align:middle line:84%
If your female than the
one in front of that

01:24:33.470 --> 01:24:37.990 align:middle line:84%
is the vagina, and the one in
front of that is the clitoris.

01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:41.850 align:middle line:84%
If you're male
instead of the vagina

01:24:41.850 --> 01:24:44.680 align:middle line:84%
it's the opening
inside the scrotum.

01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And instead of the
clitoris it's the penis.

01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:53.134 align:middle line:84%
But the first one, the vagina
opening comes like this.

01:24:53.134 --> 01:24:58.710 align:middle line:90%


01:24:58.710 --> 01:25:05.946 align:middle line:84%
And the clitoris or
penis is a wider swing.

01:25:05.946 --> 01:25:11.970 align:middle line:84%
It comes out like
this to go up there.

01:25:11.970 --> 01:25:15.520 align:middle line:84%
Now we have to turn each
one of these by 90 degrees.

01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:16.820 align:middle line:90%
So this one's facing that way.

01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:18.072 align:middle line:90%
This one's facing out.

01:25:18.072 --> 01:25:19.030 align:middle line:90%
This one's facing back.

01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:20.420 align:middle line:90%
This one's facing that way.

01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:22.110 align:middle line:90%
You understand?

01:25:22.110 --> 01:25:24.015 align:middle line:84%
Does everybody
understand what I mean?

01:25:24.015 --> 01:25:26.200 align:middle line:84%
You turn each one so you
make this pattern going up

01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:28.130 align:middle line:90%
like that.

01:25:28.130 --> 01:25:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'll just show you
what I mean by where they

01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:36.370 align:middle line:90%
have these angular directions.

01:25:36.370 --> 01:25:38.750 align:middle line:84%
Everything at the
base of the spine

01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:42.960 align:middle line:84%
is all flowing in this
direction and out that way

01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:44.570 align:middle line:90%
towards the front.

01:25:44.570 --> 01:25:48.640 align:middle line:84%
You have a full direction going
out that way and in this line.

01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:51.230 align:middle line:84%
You've got the
coccyx coming down.

01:25:51.230 --> 01:25:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And you have the anus, and
the perineum, and the vagina.

01:25:55.240 --> 01:26:00.930 align:middle line:84%
The vagina is a vesica picsis,
and it's flowing that way also.

01:26:00.930 --> 01:26:03.310 align:middle line:84%
You have the penis which
also moves that way,

01:26:03.310 --> 01:26:05.760 align:middle line:84%
and the opening of the penis
is also a vesica picsic,

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:06.560 align:middle line:90%
moving that way.

01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Everything is line facing
out that direction.

01:26:10.370 --> 01:26:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And then this whole thing comes
up, 7.23 centimeters, rotates.

01:26:14.730 --> 01:26:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And if it's male it
would go this way.

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:19.940 align:middle line:84%
If it's female it'd
rotate that way.

01:26:19.940 --> 01:26:21.500 align:middle line:90%
It goes over this way.

01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And at which point we'll
just pick one thing.

01:26:24.270 --> 01:26:25.710 align:middle line:84%
Right at that level
right in there

01:26:25.710 --> 01:26:29.469 align:middle line:84%
you see the ovaries come
out like this over here.

01:26:29.469 --> 01:26:31.260 align:middle line:84%
The next one comes up
and rotates this way.

01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:34.090 align:middle line:84%
Now you have a directional
going this way at the navel.

01:26:34.090 --> 01:26:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the umbilical
cord coming up that way again.

01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:43.070 align:middle line:84%
It'll come up again one more
time to the solar plexus.

01:26:43.070 --> 01:26:48.220 align:middle line:84%
The solar plexus is a vesica
picsis facing this way, out

01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:49.990 align:middle line:90%
like that.

01:26:49.990 --> 01:26:52.960 align:middle line:84%
It's just like a little
mouth, only it's facing out

01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:55.380 align:middle line:90%
in this direction here.

01:26:55.380 --> 01:27:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And then it rotates one
more time to right here.

01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:03.310 align:middle line:90%
This is a very special place.

01:27:03.310 --> 01:27:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that it's
a very special place

01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:07.980 align:middle line:84%
is because it's the
place of completion.

01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:12.840 align:middle line:90%


01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:15.195 align:middle line:84%
The first one was
pointing this way.

01:27:15.195 --> 01:27:17.026 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] that
the front of it.

01:27:17.026 --> 01:27:18.950 align:middle line:84%
The next one pointed
over this way.

01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:20.760 align:middle line:90%
That's the second chakra.

01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:23.310 align:middle line:84%
The third chakra at the
navel pointed this way.

01:27:23.310 --> 01:27:26.660 align:middle line:84%
The fourth one at the solar
plexus pointed this way.

01:27:26.660 --> 01:27:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And the fifth one,
here, points back.

01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:34.280 align:middle line:90%
It comes full circle.

01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the first time
that this one here has both.

01:27:40.810 --> 01:27:43.380 align:middle line:84%
It has the awareness
of all planes now.

01:27:43.380 --> 01:27:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And so this place is real
special, the fifth one.

01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:53.370 align:middle line:84%
The first musical octave is five
notes, the pentatonic scale,

01:27:53.370 --> 01:27:55.210 align:middle line:90%
also.

01:27:55.210 --> 01:27:57.210 align:middle line:90%
So it hits right here.

01:27:57.210 --> 01:27:58.890 align:middle line:90%
And this one has both.

01:27:58.890 --> 01:28:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And so you see the breasts
are separated this way.

01:28:02.970 --> 01:28:06.400 align:middle line:84%
But they also go that
way at the same time.

01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:11.100 align:middle line:84%
Right here is that spot
that we're talking about,

01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:14.710 align:middle line:84%
right in the center of
that place, right there,

01:28:14.710 --> 01:28:17.760 align:middle line:84%
which is the place of
Christ's consciousness.

01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And in that spot, if you
drew the line coming down

01:28:20.430 --> 01:28:23.610 align:middle line:84%
the center, which I don't
have on this one here,

01:28:23.610 --> 01:28:27.660 align:middle line:84%
you would see what appears
to be like a Christian cross.

01:28:27.660 --> 01:28:28.620 align:middle line:90%
You see it?

01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:32.360 align:middle line:84%
The top of this line here, and
imagine a line coming straight

01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:36.430 align:middle line:84%
down the middle
would be the cross.

01:28:36.430 --> 01:28:39.260 align:middle line:84%
That's an actual energy
field line that's there.

01:28:39.260 --> 01:28:41.360 align:middle line:84%
But the cross is
not, like a Christian

01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:56.130 align:middle line:84%
cross you think of it being
going like this, which is-- OK.

01:28:56.130 --> 01:28:58.340 align:middle line:84%
You think of this
like that, which

01:28:58.340 --> 01:29:00.290 align:middle line:90%
is the energy field of that.

01:29:00.290 --> 01:29:04.180 align:middle line:84%
But because of what we
just talked about of this,

01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:09.550 align:middle line:84%
it also has a line
coming out from there.

01:29:09.550 --> 01:29:11.895 align:middle line:84%
So there's an arm of
energy that comes out

01:29:11.895 --> 01:29:13.020 align:middle line:90%
in the tetrahedranal field.

01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:18.690 align:middle line:84%
It goes out this way and out the
back, as well as out that way.

01:29:18.690 --> 01:29:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And so if you were to look
at it from above looking down

01:29:22.730 --> 01:29:29.092 align:middle line:90%
what you would see is this.

01:29:29.092 --> 01:29:30.400 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:32.650 align:middle line:90%
So everybody get that?

01:29:32.650 --> 01:29:36.360 align:middle line:84%
Both of these are
symbols for Christ.

01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:39.187 align:middle line:84%
They're both different views
of marking the same place.

01:29:39.187 --> 01:29:43.010 align:middle line:90%


01:29:43.010 --> 01:29:46.490 align:middle line:84%
What it took the Egyptians
a long time to realize,

01:29:46.490 --> 01:29:50.430 align:middle line:84%
and was one of the primary
keys to their unfoldment,

01:29:50.430 --> 01:29:52.700 align:middle line:84%
was as they studied
these energy fields very,

01:29:52.700 --> 01:29:57.900 align:middle line:84%
very carefully was that if
you were to look at the human

01:29:57.900 --> 01:30:01.320 align:middle line:84%
from the front at that
particular chakra,

01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:02.310 align:middle line:90%
this is what you see.

01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:05.180 align:middle line:84%
If you look at it from the
top, that's what you see.

01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:07.060 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at
it from the side,

01:30:07.060 --> 01:30:10.430 align:middle line:84%
if you come over here
and look at that,

01:30:10.430 --> 01:30:13.910 align:middle line:84%
then you see an arm
coming out into space

01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:15.780 align:middle line:90%
and going into the back.

01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:22.225 align:middle line:84%
So the bottom part of
it would look like this.

01:30:22.225 --> 01:30:25.180 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you
wouldn't see this arm.

01:30:25.180 --> 01:30:26.790 align:middle line:90%
This arm would become a dot.

01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:29.850 align:middle line:84%
But the arm that comes out into
space would look like that.

01:30:29.850 --> 01:30:32.090 align:middle line:90%
Does everybody see that so far.

01:30:32.090 --> 01:30:38.080 align:middle line:84%
But this top arm here has
another component to it.

01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And it was not known
for a long time.

01:30:40.730 --> 01:30:45.010 align:middle line:84%
But the component is a
curve that passes through,

01:30:45.010 --> 01:30:48.625 align:middle line:84%
that goes from here through
the 13th chakra and back again.

01:30:48.625 --> 01:31:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And that curve looks like
this, which is called the ankh.

01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:10.730 align:middle line:90%


01:31:10.730 --> 01:31:14.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you were to rotate
the ankh in its full 3D

01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:18.300 align:middle line:84%
and turn it again, it
would look like this.

01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:21.215 align:middle line:84%
From this view, and these
two are exactly the same

01:31:21.215 --> 01:31:22.590 align:middle line:84%
if you look at
this one this way.

01:31:22.590 --> 01:31:25.140 align:middle line:84%
But that ankh, which
is a curve, actually

01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:27.650 align:middle line:84%
becomes a straight line
when seen from the side.

01:31:27.650 --> 01:31:31.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is a line running
through the middle of this,

01:31:31.490 --> 01:31:33.870 align:middle line:90%
like that.

01:31:33.870 --> 01:31:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to show
you one more symbol now,

01:31:37.790 --> 01:31:44.560 align:middle line:84%
which you'll realize is
another symbol for Christ.

01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And it will probably tie
all these things together.

01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:49.436 align:middle line:90%
You've probably seen this one.

01:31:49.436 --> 01:32:00.835 align:middle line:90%


01:32:00.835 --> 01:32:01.750 align:middle line:90%
You've seen this one?

01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:02.780 align:middle line:90%
>>Mm-hm.

01:32:02.780 --> 01:32:03.580 align:middle line:90%
>>Who hasn't?

01:32:03.580 --> 01:32:04.660 align:middle line:90%
Who's never seen that?

01:32:04.660 --> 01:32:05.037 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

01:32:05.037 --> 01:32:06.203 align:middle line:90%
It's a very Catholic symbol.

01:32:06.203 --> 01:32:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>>It's a very Catholic symbol.

01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:08.480 align:middle line:90%
Right.

01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:10.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's about as
Christian as you can get.

01:32:10.620 --> 01:32:13.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you think
[INAUDIBLE] I retract that.

01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:14.400 align:middle line:90%
Heh, heh.

01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:15.940 align:middle line:90%
It depends on who you are.

01:32:15.940 --> 01:32:19.140 align:middle line:90%
But it goes way back there.

01:32:19.140 --> 01:32:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's showing the cross,
the three dimensionality

01:32:22.420 --> 01:32:24.910 align:middle line:84%
of that point, the line
running up the middle,

01:32:24.910 --> 01:32:27.160 align:middle line:84%
and the piece of the
ark that is on there.

01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:34.460 align:middle line:84%
It's showing all three of these
things combined into one image.

01:32:34.460 --> 01:32:38.010 align:middle line:84%
So if you asked a Christian
priest what that meant

01:32:38.010 --> 01:32:41.340 align:middle line:84%
I'd really doubt if
they could tell you.

01:32:41.340 --> 01:32:43.245 align:middle line:84%
All they'd know is
that it's a symbol.

01:32:43.245 --> 01:32:44.440 align:middle line:90%
It's an old symbol.

01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:47.936 align:middle line:90%


01:32:47.936 --> 01:32:50.252 align:middle line:84%
And here's another thing
I want to read to you.

01:32:50.252 --> 01:32:53.940 align:middle line:90%


01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:59.030 align:middle line:84%
This is from Richard
Newton's book, May 5, 2000,

01:32:59.030 --> 01:32:59.830 align:middle line:90%
whatever it is.

01:32:59.830 --> 01:33:02.610 align:middle line:90%


01:33:02.610 --> 01:33:08.460 align:middle line:84%
In the ancient Greek alphabet
the letter P symbolically

01:33:08.460 --> 01:33:13.040 align:middle line:84%
represented a man,
number one, who

01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:16.440 align:middle line:84%
having overcome his lowest
nature, his sexual center,

01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:19.470 align:middle line:84%
joined his emotional
nature, his heart center,

01:33:19.470 --> 01:33:22.800 align:middle line:84%
with his intellectual
center in his physical body.

01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:25.500 align:middle line:90%


01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And P thus represented a man
in control of his physical,

01:33:29.550 --> 01:33:33.540 align:middle line:90%
emotional, and mental nature.

01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:37.520 align:middle line:90%
Just the letter P itself.

01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:48.350 align:middle line:84%
And so many of the Greek
people who understood this

01:33:48.350 --> 01:33:51.670 align:middle line:84%
changed their names to
start with the letter

01:33:51.670 --> 01:33:55.900 align:middle line:84%
P, such as Pythagoras, and
Plato, and Plenum, Prometheus

01:33:55.900 --> 01:33:57.692 align:middle line:90%
and many, many others.

01:33:57.692 --> 01:33:59.900 align:middle line:84%
They all changed their name
to begin with that letter

01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:04.630 align:middle line:84%
P because of the relationship
of what it meant to what

01:34:04.630 --> 01:34:06.790 align:middle line:90%
we're about to talk about.

01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:07.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:34:07.590 --> 01:34:10.430 align:middle line:84%
What I'm about to tell you is
what it's really all about.

01:34:10.430 --> 01:34:14.560 align:middle line:90%


01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:18.942 align:middle line:84%
And I studied for two years
with Thoth and his wife

01:34:18.942 --> 01:34:20.315 align:middle line:90%
and studying tantra.

01:34:20.315 --> 01:34:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is not my job here
to go deeply into this.

01:34:24.210 --> 01:34:26.950 align:middle line:84%
I just want to remind
you of something.

01:34:26.950 --> 01:34:29.870 align:middle line:90%
And you can remember it later.

01:34:29.870 --> 01:34:34.620 align:middle line:84%
But many of the
Hindu systems feel

01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:40.750 align:middle line:84%
that if the male ejaculates that
they have died a little bit.

01:34:40.750 --> 01:34:42.370 align:middle line:84%
And so there's this
whole thing where

01:34:42.370 --> 01:34:44.052 align:middle line:90%
he's not supposed to do that.

01:34:44.052 --> 01:34:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And they have either
invented, if they are true

01:34:46.010 --> 01:34:49.255 align:middle line:84%
or not, these
particular tubes that

01:34:49.255 --> 01:34:52.797 align:middle line:84%
are supposed to take this
up and bring it up around.

01:34:52.797 --> 01:34:54.130 align:middle line:90%
No one's ever found these tubes.

01:34:54.130 --> 01:34:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And whether it's known it's
even true, I don't know.

01:34:57.040 --> 01:35:00.990 align:middle line:84%
But according to
Egyptian philosophy,

01:35:00.990 --> 01:35:04.220 align:middle line:84%
they don't feel that
that is necessary at all.

01:35:04.220 --> 01:35:07.250 align:middle line:84%
The problem is in terms
of pure electronics

01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:10.760 align:middle line:84%
is that at the moment
the male or the female

01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:15.280 align:middle line:84%
has orgasm the energy will
either be sent up or down.

01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:17.660 align:middle line:84%
Some people sent it
down believe it or not.

01:35:17.660 --> 01:35:21.110 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is it
goes to one of the poles,

01:35:21.110 --> 01:35:24.030 align:middle line:84%
either to the north
or the south pole.

01:35:24.030 --> 01:35:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And if you do that you
do die a little bit.

01:35:28.210 --> 01:35:31.490 align:middle line:84%
You ground out that energy,
and you just lost it.

01:35:31.490 --> 01:35:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And to continue that process
from an Egyptian point of view

01:35:35.050 --> 01:35:37.220 align:middle line:90%
leads to death.

01:35:37.220 --> 01:35:39.720 align:middle line:84%
However, there is
a way that it can

01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:41.600 align:middle line:84%
be done where it does
not lead to death,

01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:45.290 align:middle line:84%
and in fact it does
just the exact opposite.

01:35:45.290 --> 01:35:47.300 align:middle line:84%
Instead of losing
energy it causes

01:35:47.300 --> 01:35:52.280 align:middle line:84%
you to gain energy and
increase your strength

01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:55.460 align:middle line:90%
and your spiritual nature.

01:35:55.460 --> 01:36:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And so without going into the
complexity of this whole thing,

01:36:01.540 --> 01:36:04.330 align:middle line:84%
because they made you learn
how to do it through all

01:36:04.330 --> 01:36:07.550 align:middle line:84%
these systems, just thinking
of the central tube running

01:36:07.550 --> 01:36:11.690 align:middle line:84%
at the middle, they
would train in such a way

01:36:11.690 --> 01:36:15.630 align:middle line:84%
that at the moment of orgasm you
would control the energy coming

01:36:15.630 --> 01:36:18.350 align:middle line:84%
up until it got to
this chakra right

01:36:18.350 --> 01:36:22.910 align:middle line:84%
here, which happens to be
right where the ankh is.

01:36:22.910 --> 01:36:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And then you would send
the energy out the back.

01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:31.010 align:middle line:84%
Which is the meaning of you must
receive the ankh from behind.

01:36:31.010 --> 01:36:32.560 align:middle line:84%
It won't work going
out the front.

01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:35.270 align:middle line:84%
The polarity is such
that it doesn't work.

01:36:35.270 --> 01:36:38.045 align:middle line:90%
And so it goes out the back.

01:36:38.045 --> 01:36:39.450 align:middle line:90%
It comes around.

01:36:39.450 --> 01:36:41.710 align:middle line:84%
It goes through
this point, which is

01:36:41.710 --> 01:36:43.720 align:middle line:90%
where the top of the head is.

01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:45.050 align:middle line:90%
And it curves down.

01:36:45.050 --> 01:36:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And the energy comes right
back to the same place

01:36:47.110 --> 01:36:53.630 align:middle line:84%
again, and puts the energy
right back into your system,

01:36:53.630 --> 01:36:57.440 align:middle line:84%
and actually strengthens
rather than weakens.

01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:01.540 align:middle line:90%


01:37:01.540 --> 01:37:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And there's all
kinds of thoughts,

01:37:04.170 --> 01:37:09.190 align:middle line:84%
even in Egyptian thought,
of exactly how to do this,

01:37:09.190 --> 01:37:13.100 align:middle line:84%
in terms of controlling
and these kinds of things.

01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to
get into all of that.

01:37:15.540 --> 01:37:18.420 align:middle line:84%
But I do want you
to be aware of it.

01:37:18.420 --> 01:37:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And if you start
experimenting you probably

01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:25.690 align:middle line:84%
will remember very
quickly something,

01:37:25.690 --> 01:37:28.110 align:middle line:90%
because it's ancient.

01:37:28.110 --> 01:37:30.180 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very ancient.

01:37:30.180 --> 01:37:36.950 align:middle line:84%
But that was the real
hidden Egyptian meaning

01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:38.700 align:middle line:90%
behind what that is about.

01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:41.305 align:middle line:84%
Just to go on this
a little bit more,

01:37:41.305 --> 01:37:43.320 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptian idea
of tantra, which

01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:46.140 align:middle line:84%
I started to talk about
before, is so complex.

01:37:46.140 --> 01:37:47.530 align:middle line:90%
It's hardly imaginable.

01:37:47.530 --> 01:37:50.050 align:middle line:84%
It's no wonder it took
them 12 years to even begin

01:37:50.050 --> 01:37:51.270 align:middle line:90%
to get through it.

01:37:51.270 --> 01:37:54.282 align:middle line:84%
They saw that there was eight
different personalities.

01:37:54.282 --> 01:37:55.490 align:middle line:90%
Remember I talked about that?

01:37:55.490 --> 01:37:57.380 align:middle line:90%
Didn't I?

01:37:57.380 --> 01:38:03.430 align:middle line:84%
Associated with the
eight original cells,

01:38:03.430 --> 01:38:06.270 align:middle line:84%
and associated with the
eight electrical circuits.

01:38:06.270 --> 01:38:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And their idea of
reincarnation is that, OK,

01:38:10.660 --> 01:38:12.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm focused in here right now.

01:38:12.030 --> 01:38:16.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, that means that I've
got my little grid arranged

01:38:16.050 --> 01:38:18.680 align:middle line:84%
around my body in
such a way that I

01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:22.220 align:middle line:84%
have one of the
personalities that is opened.

01:38:22.220 --> 01:38:24.630 align:middle line:84%
But they would teach them
how to rotate this grid,

01:38:24.630 --> 01:38:27.940 align:middle line:84%
or spin this grid
around to other ones.

01:38:27.940 --> 01:38:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And a totally completely
different person steps forward.

01:38:32.270 --> 01:38:33.200 align:middle line:90%
It's very interesting.

01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:36.827 align:middle line:84%
And we've done experiments
with several people on this.

01:38:36.827 --> 01:38:38.660 align:middle line:84%
It is very, very
interesting, I'll tell you.

01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:41.390 align:middle line:90%


01:38:41.390 --> 01:38:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And each one of you has four
females and four males in you.

01:38:45.030 --> 01:38:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And in each case you'll have
an older male, a little bit

01:38:50.050 --> 01:38:52.010 align:middle line:84%
younger, a little bit
younger, and usually one

01:38:52.010 --> 01:38:55.410 align:middle line:84%
that in most people kind
of is about a teenager.

01:38:55.410 --> 01:38:57.525 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll have an
older female, et cetera,

01:38:57.525 --> 01:38:59.320 align:middle line:90%
all the way down to teenager.

01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens
is the first time

01:39:02.620 --> 01:39:05.690 align:middle line:84%
you ever come to Earth you
have to first go around

01:39:05.690 --> 01:39:07.280 align:middle line:90%
and hit all eight.

01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:09.550 align:middle line:84%
You'll tend to rotate
to all eight places.

01:39:09.550 --> 01:39:11.660 align:middle line:90%
I've only been here twice.

01:39:11.660 --> 01:39:13.100 align:middle line:90%
Only one other lifetime.

01:39:13.100 --> 01:39:14.115 align:middle line:90%
I just got here.

01:39:14.115 --> 01:39:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And so I've only got two places
on my cube that are activated.

01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:23.320 align:middle line:84%
But you'll first go
through all eight places.

01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And then you might
come to one, and you

01:39:26.290 --> 01:39:30.300 align:middle line:84%
may run down that one for a
certain number of lifetimes,

01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:32.110 align:middle line:84%
and then switch to
another one, and do

01:39:32.110 --> 01:39:33.669 align:middle line:84%
another certain
number of lifetimes,

01:39:33.669 --> 01:39:34.960 align:middle line:90%
and then switch to another one.

01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And so you're trying to complete
yourself in all these eight

01:39:39.030 --> 01:39:41.160 align:middle line:90%
different possible ways.

01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And the Egyptians have you
work with the sexual energy.

01:39:45.130 --> 01:39:47.900 align:middle line:84%
We're just talking about
sexual energy flow in this one.

01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:52.050 align:middle line:84%
But they have you work
not only with the flow,

01:39:52.050 --> 01:39:55.550 align:middle line:84%
but with the polarities
within yourself.

01:39:55.550 --> 01:39:57.340 align:middle line:84%
The male, female,
eight personality

01:39:57.340 --> 01:39:59.700 align:middle line:90%
flows within your own self.

01:39:59.700 --> 01:40:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And simultaneously with
the five different flows

01:40:03.530 --> 01:40:05.540 align:middle line:84%
that are moving up
here, associated

01:40:05.540 --> 01:40:06.890 align:middle line:90%
with each one of those.

01:40:06.890 --> 01:40:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And then all of the
possible sexual polarities.

01:40:12.250 --> 01:40:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And there are 64 of them
according to the Egyptians.

01:40:15.660 --> 01:40:18.410 align:middle line:84%
Which the yi-ching happens
to be an exact mirror

01:40:18.410 --> 01:40:20.208 align:middle line:90%
of their philosophy.

01:40:20.208 --> 01:40:21.666 align:middle line:84%
And if you notice
yi-ching, it goes

01:40:21.666 --> 01:40:24.490 align:middle line:84%
from male to female, male
to female, male to female,

01:40:24.490 --> 01:40:25.610 align:middle line:90%
each one of them.

01:40:25.610 --> 01:40:28.680 align:middle line:84%
And they're all
associated in there.

01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:30.620 align:middle line:90%
And it's a very complex system.

01:40:30.620 --> 01:40:31.834 align:middle line:90%
It takes them a long time.

01:40:31.834 --> 01:40:34.250 align:middle line:84%
When they finally get to the
very end of this whole thing,

01:40:34.250 --> 01:40:38.170 align:middle line:84%
at the very end of the
school after 12 years,

01:40:38.170 --> 01:40:42.060 align:middle line:84%
they bring them in
there, and whoever's

01:40:42.060 --> 01:40:45.220 align:middle line:84%
in that body, whichever
personality's out there,

01:40:45.220 --> 01:40:48.830 align:middle line:84%
by this time they know how to
move and rotate this thing.

01:40:48.830 --> 01:40:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And that takes real skill
in learning how to do that.

01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And they will have
them then bring

01:40:56.500 --> 01:40:59.830 align:middle line:84%
forth in very rapid
succession all

01:40:59.830 --> 01:41:01.620 align:middle line:84%
eight of the beings
of themselves,

01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:04.003 align:middle line:84%
all the eight
components at once.

01:41:04.003 --> 01:41:05.370 align:middle line:90%
They have a conference.

01:41:05.370 --> 01:41:08.020 align:middle line:90%


01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:10.830 align:middle line:84%
At which point they
compare within themselves,

01:41:10.830 --> 01:41:13.570 align:middle line:84%
or within yourself, what
you've learned in this way.

01:41:13.570 --> 01:41:16.470 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, you
have eight different things

01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:20.270 align:middle line:84%
coming out here, each
one being a lifeline.

01:41:20.270 --> 01:41:24.920 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, if
you were to go back

01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:28.080 align:middle line:84%
into your past lives,
you're almost certainly

01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:31.760 align:middle line:84%
going only back
into one of them.

01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:33.710 align:middle line:84%
You've got seven other
lines going out there

01:41:33.710 --> 01:41:35.900 align:middle line:84%
that you may not even
know that are even there.

01:41:35.900 --> 01:41:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And as long as you keep this
thing fixed in that one place

01:41:39.250 --> 01:41:41.480 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to
know they're there,

01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:43.950 align:middle line:84%
no matter how much hypnotherapy
or anything else you got.

01:41:43.950 --> 01:41:47.490 align:middle line:84%
It's not accessible
through hypnotherapy.

01:41:47.490 --> 01:41:49.740 align:middle line:90%
The whole circuit has to change.

01:41:49.740 --> 01:41:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And so they will bring
them all in at once,

01:41:53.940 --> 01:41:58.910 align:middle line:84%
and then they all kind of
compare their experiences

01:41:58.910 --> 01:42:01.060 align:middle line:84%
and what needs to be worked
on and everything else

01:42:01.060 --> 01:42:06.219 align:middle line:84%
like this to find this balance
in the cube, in this aspect.

01:42:06.219 --> 01:42:07.510 align:middle line:90%
That was the emotional balance.

01:42:07.510 --> 01:42:08.426 align:middle line:90%
This is what they did.

01:42:08.426 --> 01:42:11.575 align:middle line:84%
It was very, very,
very complex work.

01:42:11.575 --> 01:42:13.450 align:middle line:84%
I worked with it for
two years, and it was so

01:42:13.450 --> 01:42:16.582 align:middle line:90%
complex I couldn't believe it.

01:42:16.582 --> 01:42:17.518 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:42:17.518 --> 01:42:19.858 align:middle line:84%
>>That wouldn't be
the multi-personality

01:42:19.858 --> 01:42:21.740 align:middle line:90%
created by most people?

01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:22.880 align:middle line:90%
>>It is.

01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:25.160 align:middle line:84%
In most cases, unless
you're possessed

01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:28.320 align:middle line:84%
and this kind of thing,
assuming you're clean

01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:30.186 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have
anybody in there,

01:42:30.186 --> 01:42:33.100 align:middle line:84%
then all you gotta do is
you could be sitting here,

01:42:33.100 --> 01:42:38.200 align:middle line:84%
and if you know how, just turn
your field, just rotate it.

01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:40.350 align:middle line:90%
You could be sitting in there.

01:42:40.350 --> 01:42:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And all you gotta do is if
you were looking out there,

01:42:43.510 --> 01:42:48.060 align:middle line:84%
just rotate your field, like
that, to another one over here.

01:42:48.060 --> 01:42:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And you won't believe
what will happen.

01:42:51.170 --> 01:42:53.937 align:middle line:84%
A whole different person will
step forth out of your body.

01:42:53.937 --> 01:42:54.770 align:middle line:90%
Which is really you.

01:42:54.770 --> 01:42:56.650 align:middle line:90%
It's not a different person.

01:42:56.650 --> 01:43:01.750 align:middle line:84%
It's a different aspect of your
spirit, a different reflection,

01:43:01.750 --> 01:43:04.382 align:middle line:84%
a different series
of experiences

01:43:04.382 --> 01:43:08.900 align:middle line:90%
that that part has experienced.

01:43:08.900 --> 01:43:09.700 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

01:43:09.700 --> 01:43:11.366 align:middle line:84%
Look at those hands
going up everywhere.

01:43:11.366 --> 01:43:14.392 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:43:14.392 --> 01:43:16.720 align:middle line:90%


01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:19.790 align:middle line:90%
>>She's got it I guess.

01:43:19.790 --> 01:43:23.020 align:middle line:84%
>>The other question was about
raising the sexual energy

01:43:23.020 --> 01:43:24.160 align:middle line:90%
and ankhing it.

01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Is that something that's
done during the entire time

01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:28.750 align:middle line:84%
of making love, or is
that something that's

01:43:28.750 --> 01:43:30.750 align:middle line:90%
done at the time of orgasm.

01:43:30.750 --> 01:43:32.785 align:middle line:84%
>>It's only done at
the moment of orgasm.

01:43:32.785 --> 01:43:40.952 align:middle line:90%


01:43:40.952 --> 01:43:42.428 align:middle line:90%
>>Do you take the ankh?

01:43:42.428 --> 01:43:44.888 align:middle line:84%
If I show you your ankh
I can explain to you

01:43:44.888 --> 01:43:46.856 align:middle line:84%
better what the question
is that I've got.

01:43:46.856 --> 01:43:47.656 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:43:47.656 --> 01:43:48.824 align:middle line:90%
I ain't showing you mine.

01:43:48.824 --> 01:43:51.284 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:43:51.284 --> 01:43:52.268 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, my ankh.

01:43:52.268 --> 01:43:53.068 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:43:53.068 --> 01:43:57.188 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:43:57.188 --> 01:43:58.380 align:middle line:90%


01:43:58.380 --> 01:43:59.180 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:43:59.180 --> 01:44:02.550 align:middle line:84%
So here this thing
goes this way, right?

01:44:02.550 --> 01:44:03.490 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

01:44:03.490 --> 01:44:05.970 align:middle line:90%
It's sitting like that.

01:44:05.970 --> 01:44:09.640 align:middle line:84%
>>I thought that was
supposed to be the arms.

01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:12.950 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, you mean
when it shows it

01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:14.700 align:middle line:84%
when the little arms
are doing this thing?

01:44:14.700 --> 01:44:15.100 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

01:44:15.100 --> 01:44:16.933 align:middle line:84%
But I thought that was
supposed to represent

01:44:16.933 --> 01:44:19.417 align:middle line:90%
the arms of the person.

01:44:19.417 --> 01:44:20.750 align:middle line:90%
>>Not from this way of thinking.

01:44:20.750 --> 01:44:23.830 align:middle line:90%


01:44:23.830 --> 01:44:27.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't know who
came up with that.

01:44:27.020 --> 01:44:32.030 align:middle line:84%
But there is one on the
walls that shows the ankh,

01:44:32.030 --> 01:44:33.783 align:middle line:84%
and these two things
being these two arms

01:44:33.783 --> 01:44:34.824 align:middle line:90%
that came out from there.

01:44:34.824 --> 01:44:34.974 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

01:44:34.974 --> 01:44:36.180 align:middle line:90%
I've seen that one too.

01:44:36.180 --> 01:44:44.110 align:middle line:84%
>>But according to Thoth this
can only be seen from the side,

01:44:44.110 --> 01:44:45.274 align:middle line:90%
and not from the front.

01:44:45.274 --> 01:44:50.210 align:middle line:90%


01:44:50.210 --> 01:44:52.780 align:middle line:84%
>>When you're bringing
up the sexual energies

01:44:52.780 --> 01:44:54.420 align:middle line:84%
and you're feeling
these lines up,

01:44:54.420 --> 01:44:58.110 align:middle line:84%
are you creating a sphere
in there before the moment?

01:44:58.110 --> 01:44:58.910 align:middle line:90%
>>Where?

01:44:58.910 --> 01:44:59.370 align:middle line:90%
Here?

01:44:59.370 --> 01:45:00.170 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:45:00.170 --> 01:45:02.330 align:middle line:84%
So you're creating a
sphere up in that area.

01:45:02.330 --> 01:45:04.289 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could feel
the energy is coming out

01:45:04.289 --> 01:45:05.621 align:middle line:90%
in several different directions.

01:45:05.621 --> 01:45:06.920 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:08.090 align:middle line:90%
I mean, if you are-- No.

01:45:08.090 --> 01:45:10.040 align:middle line:90%
It's just up.

01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And then you just
direct it, right.

01:45:11.530 --> 01:45:13.800 align:middle line:90%
It'll go automatically.

01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:15.885 align:middle line:84%
If you don't do anything
it'll just go up.

01:45:15.885 --> 01:45:17.760 align:middle line:84%
But if you direct
it at that moment

01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:19.960 align:middle line:90%
it will very easily move.

01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find that
there's an actual energy

01:45:24.710 --> 01:45:26.030 align:middle line:90%
tube running around there.

01:45:26.030 --> 01:45:29.550 align:middle line:84%
So once you turn one channel
off and open the other one up,

01:45:29.550 --> 01:45:32.340 align:middle line:84%
it will just sort of
automatically do this thing.

01:45:32.340 --> 01:45:34.010 align:middle line:84%
You don't even hardly
have to do much.

01:45:34.010 --> 01:45:37.526 align:middle line:84%
It'll just automatically come
back around this other channel.

01:45:37.526 --> 01:45:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>>Because I'm feeling
at times it'll

01:45:40.610 --> 01:45:42.340 align:middle line:84%
come out from the
shoulders first,

01:45:42.340 --> 01:45:44.779 align:middle line:84%
and then it'll start
coming in a full sphere.

01:45:44.779 --> 01:45:47.112 align:middle line:84%
But I haven't yet experienced
coming out and coming back

01:45:47.112 --> 01:45:47.912 align:middle line:90%
around.

01:45:47.912 --> 01:45:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, what they teach
relative to the Merkaba

01:45:51.880 --> 01:45:54.580 align:middle line:84%
is that it comes
back around one time.

01:45:54.580 --> 01:45:57.690 align:middle line:84%
As soon as it hits then
you immediately send

01:45:57.690 --> 01:45:59.855 align:middle line:84%
the energy from the two
ends down to this place

01:45:59.855 --> 01:46:01.548 align:middle line:84%
and radiate out
into a big sphere.

01:46:01.548 --> 01:46:05.460 align:middle line:90%


01:46:05.460 --> 01:46:06.438 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you.

01:46:06.438 --> 01:46:09.372 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:46:09.372 --> 01:46:11.328 align:middle line:90%


01:46:11.328 --> 01:46:13.054 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:46:13.054 --> 01:46:14.262 align:middle line:90%
>>Can you repeat that please?

01:46:14.262 --> 01:46:17.690 align:middle line:90%


01:46:17.690 --> 01:46:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>>When you were speaking
about [INAUDIBLE]

01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:25.940 align:middle line:84%
saving their whole civilization
by teaching tantra,

01:46:25.940 --> 01:46:28.480 align:middle line:84%
is it because they're teaching
all the different aspects

01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:30.730 align:middle line:84%
and how to accept
all the aspects

01:46:30.730 --> 01:46:32.690 align:middle line:84%
as well as creating
the Merkaba Is that

01:46:32.690 --> 01:46:35.158 align:middle line:90%
what stabilized everything?

01:46:35.158 --> 01:46:37.975 align:middle line:90%


01:46:37.975 --> 01:46:38.775 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:46:38.775 --> 01:46:45.300 align:middle line:84%
They didn't teach just energy
flows and these kind of things.

01:46:45.300 --> 01:46:51.610 align:middle line:84%
Whatever they did changed them
so much that they taught that

01:46:51.610 --> 01:46:54.159 align:middle line:84%
and how it relates to
everything, and not just to--

01:46:54.159 --> 01:46:55.075 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you mean?

01:46:55.075 --> 01:46:55.875 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:46:55.875 --> 01:46:58.430 align:middle line:90%
Does that system still exist?

01:46:58.430 --> 01:47:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, to the
degree that-- Well,

01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:09.950 align:middle line:84%
they were the founders of
the Naacal Mystery School.

01:47:09.950 --> 01:47:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And this is Naacal Mystery
School information.

01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:14.430 align:middle line:90%
This is what they were teaching.

01:47:14.430 --> 01:47:17.970 align:middle line:84%
>>When you were saying that you
studied this for a few years

01:47:17.970 --> 01:47:20.840 align:middle line:84%
and how complex it
is, is that the system

01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:23.370 align:middle line:84%
that [INAUDIBLE] used to
save their civilization.

01:47:23.370 --> 01:47:24.170 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

01:47:24.170 --> 01:47:25.640 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:28.845 align:middle line:84%
And there is a way
that from this system

01:47:28.845 --> 01:47:31.340 align:middle line:84%
that you can mate
interdimensionally

01:47:31.340 --> 01:47:33.720 align:middle line:90%
and all these other things.

01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:37.090 align:middle line:90%
But I only got a little ways.

01:47:37.090 --> 01:47:41.670 align:middle line:84%
I only studied for two
years, and then they left.

01:47:41.670 --> 01:47:44.010 align:middle line:90%
And so I didn't get it all.

01:47:44.010 --> 01:47:49.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I only got a certain
amount of the information.

01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:52.322 align:middle line:84%
Though I know I
have the rest of it,

01:47:52.322 --> 01:47:59.660 align:middle line:84%
and I'm still studying
what all of that is.

01:47:59.660 --> 01:48:01.300 align:middle line:90%
They left me with all the keys.

01:48:01.300 --> 01:48:04.640 align:middle line:84%
I know where it all is and
where all the information is.

01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:08.220 align:middle line:90%
But it's a long process.

01:48:08.220 --> 01:48:12.150 align:middle line:84%
It isn't something that can be
done in a short period of time.

01:48:12.150 --> 01:48:15.230 align:middle line:84%
>>Is the creation of
the Merkaba part of it?

01:48:15.230 --> 01:48:18.150 align:middle line:90%


01:48:18.150 --> 01:48:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>>Yes it is, except
that I'm not real sure

01:48:30.230 --> 01:48:37.712 align:middle line:84%
if they fully understood
the Merkaba in all of its.

01:48:37.712 --> 01:48:42.880 align:middle line:84%
This was the area like when you
go back to 52,000 years ago,

01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:48.878 align:middle line:84%
much of the processes that they
were using were real primitive.

01:48:48.878 --> 01:48:55.257 align:middle line:84%
And to what's being
taught here, I

01:48:55.257 --> 01:48:57.215 align:middle line:84%
don't think they understood
all the things that

01:48:57.215 --> 01:48:57.560 align:middle line:90%
were understood here.

01:48:57.560 --> 01:49:00.250 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the first things
[? Phyllis ?] did when I came

01:49:00.250 --> 01:49:02.570 align:middle line:84%
in here, I was
directed to go to him--

01:49:02.570 --> 01:49:04.830 align:middle line:84%
there's parts of the
story that I don't say.

01:49:04.830 --> 01:49:05.859 align:middle line:90%
I can't say everything.

01:49:05.859 --> 01:49:07.400 align:middle line:84%
But one of the very
first things that

01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:11.500 align:middle line:84%
happened was the reason
that I was directed to him

01:49:11.500 --> 01:49:15.310 align:middle line:84%
was I had to get his memories,
because I haven't been here

01:49:15.310 --> 01:49:17.990 align:middle line:84%
but just for a short--
I only got here in 1819.

01:49:17.990 --> 01:49:20.210 align:middle line:84%
So I haven't been
here for very long,

01:49:20.210 --> 01:49:21.600 align:middle line:90%
and I don't have those memories.

01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:23.160 align:middle line:90%
So I needed his memories.

01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And he needed the
information of the Merkaba.

01:49:26.060 --> 01:49:27.505 align:middle line:90%
So we exchanged.

01:49:27.505 --> 01:49:29.140 align:middle line:90%
And I gave him.

01:49:29.140 --> 01:49:32.050 align:middle line:84%
That was the first thing
he wanted before we even

01:49:32.050 --> 01:49:34.100 align:middle line:90%
started getting into anything.

01:49:34.100 --> 01:49:38.270 align:middle line:84%
He wanted the information
on the Merkaba,

01:49:38.270 --> 01:49:39.890 align:middle line:90%
which they were lacking.

01:49:39.890 --> 01:49:41.650 align:middle line:84%
They had developed
certain degrees of it

01:49:41.650 --> 01:49:49.454 align:middle line:84%
and certain aspects of it, but
they didn't know everything

01:49:49.454 --> 01:49:55.580 align:middle line:84%
that we have brought back
from a much higher level.

01:49:55.580 --> 01:49:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>>So who taught you
the Merkaba then?

01:49:59.820 --> 01:50:03.030 align:middle line:84%
>>I've known it for a long,
long, long, long time.

01:50:03.030 --> 01:50:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And nobody really
had to teach me that.

01:50:07.310 --> 01:50:10.252 align:middle line:90%
I brought it down here.

01:50:10.252 --> 01:50:11.647 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't belong to me.

01:50:11.647 --> 01:50:12.980 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it belongs to all of us.

01:50:12.980 --> 01:50:13.780 align:middle line:90%
We all know it.

01:50:13.780 --> 01:50:17.080 align:middle line:90%
But I brought that with me.

01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:20.430 align:middle line:84%
That was the one thing
I brought with me.

01:50:20.430 --> 01:50:28.332 align:middle line:84%
But it was what I would call my
great great great grandfather,

01:50:28.332 --> 01:50:34.350 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] who was the
one that re-instructed me

01:50:34.350 --> 01:50:36.730 align:middle line:84%
on the use of it as
soon as I got here.

01:50:36.730 --> 01:50:39.390 align:middle line:90%


01:50:39.390 --> 01:50:42.340 align:middle line:84%
So I guess if I had to
say where it came from,

01:50:42.340 --> 01:50:43.710 align:middle line:90%
that's where it came from.

01:50:43.710 --> 01:50:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And he's been here for a little
over 200,000 years, watching

01:50:51.950 --> 01:50:56.920 align:middle line:84%
over this experiment that's
been taking place here

01:50:56.920 --> 01:51:01.720 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, making sure
that to the best of his ability

01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:04.150 align:middle line:90%
that nothing goes too crazy.

01:51:04.150 --> 01:51:07.178 align:middle line:90%
