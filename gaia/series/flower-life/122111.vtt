[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.952 --> 00:00:16.329 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>>This is this spiral
that I talked about

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.240 align:middle line:84%
once before that was
discovered a few years ago

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.790 align:middle line:84%
by aerial photography
that if you

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.080 align:middle line:84%
put a spiral through the
tips of the three pyramids,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.790 align:middle line:84%
it comes around, forms
a golden mean spiral.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.590 align:middle line:90%
Comes in here.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.015 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
another one that

00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:38.630 align:middle line:84%
comes in here, which this
guy didn't know about.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And comes around and wraps
around and forms another one

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.960 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.210 align:middle line:84%
The other one I talked
about was the one

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.168 align:middle line:84%
with the little hole in
the room, the room that

00:00:45.168 --> 00:00:46.100 align:middle line:90%
was next to it.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.810 align:middle line:84%
This one was just a
little-- about a block away.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.930 align:middle line:90%


00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.007 align:middle line:84%
Has three-- well, what--
there's a controversy

00:00:57.007 --> 00:00:58.840 align:middle line:84%
whether there's three
or four pillars there.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.644 align:middle line:90%


00:01:01.644 --> 00:01:03.310 align:middle line:84%
These people write
that there was three.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.185 align:middle line:84%
But when I sent John
Anthony West over there,

00:01:05.185 --> 00:01:06.395 align:middle line:90%
he said there were four.

00:01:06.395 --> 00:01:07.195 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:01:07.195 --> 00:01:09.170 align:middle line:90%
It's three or four pillars.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.220 align:middle line:84%
But these pillars mark precisely
the center of this place,

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.260 align:middle line:90%
and they mark this line.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.510 align:middle line:90%
And they're out in the desert.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And around all of that is
a golden mean rectangle.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.640 align:middle line:84%
So just the very
placement of them

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.790 align:middle line:84%
has made this invisible
golden mean rectangle

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.884 align:middle line:84%
on the desert floor, only
discernible from the air.

00:01:31.884 --> 00:01:36.270 align:middle line:90%


00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.190 align:middle line:84%
Now this is-- also
forms a circle.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.420 align:middle line:90%


00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.635 align:middle line:90%
Point z.

00:01:44.635 --> 00:01:45.435 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:01:45.435 --> 00:01:49.235 align:middle line:90%


00:01:49.235 --> 00:01:55.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, just remember that point
z for when I go one more slide.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.424 align:middle line:84%
There is a ramp that goes
off the great pyramid.

00:01:59.424 --> 00:02:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And there's another ramp that
comes off the middle pyramid

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.200 align:middle line:90%
that just misses the snakes.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And there's another ramp
that comes off here.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.509 align:middle line:84%
They look like
they're just at random

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.030 align:middle line:84%
and that there's nothing
important about it,

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.460 align:middle line:84%
except that the ramp
between these two

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.340 align:middle line:84%
here makes a perfect
30-degree angle.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And this ramp points
exactly to the phi ratio

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.720 align:middle line:84%
on the golden mean
invisible spiral.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And what is it-- so this
makes sense about this

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.980 align:middle line:84%
is being the phi
ratio thing, but what

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.640 align:middle line:90%
is this 30 degrees about?

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.030 align:middle line:90%


00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.300 align:middle line:10%
There is also a circle that
passes through the three

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.230 align:middle line:10%
great pyramids, this large
circle that's like two,

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.880 align:middle line:10%
three miles around.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:53.380 align:middle line:10%
And what they've discovered
now is several things recently.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.000 align:middle line:10%
For a long time, they thought
that the great pyramid

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.410 align:middle line:10%
was aligned north and south
to the magnetic field.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.110 align:middle line:84%
You've read it probably
in lots of books.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.490 align:middle line:10%
But when they checked
it very, very carefully,

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.420 align:middle line:10%
they noticed it was
off a tiny, tiny bit.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.440 align:middle line:84%
And so there's been
speculation that it

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.550 align:middle line:84%
was continental drift over this
length of time or something

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.780 align:middle line:84%
like that, trying to
figure out why there

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.540 align:middle line:90%
was this little tiny bit off.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.830 align:middle line:84%
But what the computers
have now found

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.180 align:middle line:84%
is that they don't believe
that there's anything

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.450 align:middle line:84%
off at all, because the
faces of-- the eastern faces

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.990 align:middle line:84%
of all three pyramids and
the eyeballs of the snakes

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.650 align:middle line:84%
are all looking at the precise
exact spot on the horizon.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.840 align:middle line:84%
In other words, each
one is slightly turned

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.820 align:middle line:84%
and everything else
like that so they all

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:55.720 align:middle line:84%
converge on this very
specific spot, which

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.340 align:middle line:84%
is where, at a certain day--
I guess it's on July 23rd--

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.890 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know exactly
whether it was at the time

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.376 align:middle line:84%
the pyramids were
[INAUDIBLE] built

00:04:06.376 --> 00:04:08.420 align:middle line:84%
or-- there's a
certain factor here.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.650 align:middle line:84%
But they're aimed at the
heliacal rising of Sirius,

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.150 align:middle line:84%
which makes sense
anyway because all

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.430 align:middle line:84%
their calendars and
everything were based on that,

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.519 align:middle line:90%
which is almost due east.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.360 align:middle line:84%
It's off so little that you
can hardly tell the difference.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.530 align:middle line:84%
Well anyway, whether they used
the heliacal rising of Sirius

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.810 align:middle line:84%
or east could make a
difference if you're

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.192 align:middle line:90%
looking at this as a calendar.

00:04:33.192 --> 00:04:35.150 align:middle line:10%
But in terms of what
we're about to talk about,

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.520 align:middle line:10%
it won't make a whole
lot of difference.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.110 align:middle line:10%
Anyway, you put that
circle around there.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.470 align:middle line:10%
And the two ramps that make the
30-degree angles, if you broke

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.540 align:middle line:10%
that circle up into
30-degree slots,

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.200 align:middle line:10%
you'd come up with 12 places.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.980 align:middle line:10%
And starting from
here, you could

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:58.120 align:middle line:10%
put the 12 signs of the
constellations around there.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.340 align:middle line:84%
We know they knew this because
the constellation sign was

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.110 align:middle line:90%
at Dendera, clearly.

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.440 align:middle line:84%
The exact pattern was
all there, broken up

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.640 align:middle line:90%
into 30-degree angles.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.910 align:middle line:90%


00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:15.800 align:middle line:10%
And if you do that, it
places the great pyramids

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.130 align:middle line:10%
between Virgo and Leo
physically on such a structure.

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.040 align:middle line:10%
Even though it was
made a long time ago,

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.910 align:middle line:10%
that's where they
physically sit.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.767 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we
physically are right now.

00:05:29.767 --> 00:05:32.950 align:middle line:90%


00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.500 align:middle line:10%
What these guys
were thinking was

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.600 align:middle line:10%
that perhaps they were
placed there in that way

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.090 align:middle line:10%
and that, if you drew
bisecting lines and possibly

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.260 align:middle line:10%
the lines of all the
edges and everything else

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.320 align:middle line:10%
over onto-- across
here, it would

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.880 align:middle line:10%
throw an entire
spectrum of dates

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.500 align:middle line:10%
between Pisces and Aquarius.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:03.060 align:middle line:10%
It may be that we have some
kind of calendar that's

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.680 align:middle line:10%
happening here.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.170 align:middle line:10%
They're still unfolding it all.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.730 align:middle line:10%
I don't know where they're--
where it's come to at this

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.930 align:middle line:10%
level now, but there's a lot of
people real interested in this

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.980 align:middle line:10%
now, because they didn't even
know it existed until just

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:16.780 align:middle line:10%
a few years ago.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.220 align:middle line:90%


00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting that
we just became aware of it

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.474 align:middle line:84%
now that we are
between Virgo and Leo.

00:06:27.474 --> 00:06:28.890 align:middle line:84%
We didn't even--
we weren't even--

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.265 align:middle line:84%
you have to be in an airplane--
have it be an airplane be

00:06:31.265 --> 00:06:34.260 align:middle line:84%
able to before you can even
discover that it's there.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.180 align:middle line:10%
And the Sphinx, of
course, like I said,

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:41.417 align:middle line:10%
is half virgin and half
lion, the two symbols

00:06:41.417 --> 00:06:42.250 align:middle line:10%
of this whole thing.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:48.670 align:middle line:90%


00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:51.240 align:middle line:10%
So you can work with
that if you want.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.480 align:middle line:90%


00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And the location of the
Sphinx, which is important,

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.750 align:middle line:84%
appears to be just out
in the middle of sand

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:01.958 align:middle line:90%
out in the middle of nowhere.

00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.776 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't seem--
if you were not

00:07:03.776 --> 00:07:05.400 align:middle line:84%
initiated, you wouldn't
know that there

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:10.720 align:middle line:84%
was any kind of logic to
its placement whatsoever,

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.150 align:middle line:84%
except this invisible
golden mean rectangle that's

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.650 align:middle line:84%
very precise around
here, if you bisect it

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:20.200 align:middle line:84%
and put a line right
down the middle,

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:25.330 align:middle line:84%
it passes exactly through
the headdress of the Sphinx.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And if you draw a line along
the southern face of the great--

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.170 align:middle line:84%
of this middle pyramid,
it passes exactly

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:38.400 align:middle line:84%
along the right
paw of the Sphinx.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.840 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:44.470 align:middle line:84%
The edge of this and
the edge of the Sphinx

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.440 align:middle line:84%
are in perfect
alignment from the air.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.950 align:middle line:90%


00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:52.190 align:middle line:90%
And the middle of the-- wow.

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.080 align:middle line:84%
The middle of the
golden mean rectangle

00:07:55.080 --> 00:08:00.710 align:middle line:84%
is exactly on this
line coming down,

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:05.990 align:middle line:84%
locating a spot right
here on the right paw.

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:11.270 align:middle line:84%
This place has been
marked from the air.

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Who's familiar with Edgar
Cayce's predictions?

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.090 align:middle line:90%
What was the right paw?

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:18.780 align:middle line:84%
It was the-- it was
through the right paw

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:23.103 align:middle line:84%
that the opening would be
found to the halls of records.

00:08:23.103 --> 00:08:25.100 align:middle line:84%
The halls of records
are all the proof

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:29.360 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient civilizations
that have lived on this earth,

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.940 align:middle line:90%
going back 5.5 million years.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:37.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, when we first
went there in 1985,

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:41.140 align:middle line:84%
we were told that we had
to do-- we were working

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:45.006 align:middle line:84%
with the angels, and they
made us go behind the Sphinx,

00:08:45.006 --> 00:08:46.880 align:middle line:84%
about a quarter mile,
and there's this tunnel

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:47.921 align:middle line:90%
that leads to the Sphinx.

00:08:47.921 --> 00:08:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And we were to put down this
very special certain kind

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.492 align:middle line:90%
of sound down this tunnel.

00:08:53.492 --> 00:08:55.920 align:middle line:84%
It's a very interesting
kind of sound.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.400 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there-- we
have the only machine

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.830 align:middle line:84%
in the world that can
make this kind of sound.

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:04.885 align:middle line:84%
It's a sound being converted
directly into light.

00:09:04.885 --> 00:09:09.780 align:middle line:84%
It's a-- anyway, I'm not
gonna get into that too much,

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.730 align:middle line:84%
but we-- but we put this
sound down this tunnel

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:15.550 align:middle line:84%
for a couple hours, and we
said OK, that was enough.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:17.550 align:middle line:84%
When we did that--
and I'm not gonna say

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm responsible for what
happened with the Sphinx,

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:24.670 align:middle line:84%
but anyway, the Sphinx
was absolutely straight.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.125 align:middle line:10%
But when we went back
there a couple years later,

00:09:27.125 --> 00:09:31.891 align:middle line:10%
the Sphinx was off on its
side, falling over on its side.

00:09:31.891 --> 00:09:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And the Egyptian government
is-- and I mean a lot.

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:38.710 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a little bit,
it's way over like that.

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening is it's
crushing over on its right paw,

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:46.610 align:middle line:84%
and the right paw
keeps breaking open.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And they keep fixing
it, patching it back up.

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And it just keeps
leaning onto it

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.091 align:middle line:84%
and smashing open,
and breaking open.

00:09:55.091 --> 00:09:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
that's happening

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:58.820 align:middle line:90%
is the head is falling off.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And head-- and someone
told me a long time

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.110 align:middle line:84%
ago eventually the
head will fall off,

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:07.320 align:middle line:84%
which is a real important--
when that happens,

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.514 align:middle line:84%
that's a real important
date in history.

00:10:09.514 --> 00:10:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And there will be a golden
sphere in its neck, which

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.180 align:middle line:90%
is like a time capsule.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:16.550 align:middle line:84%
It's about so big around, which
will-- when it breaks off,

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:18.411 align:middle line:90%
half of it will be exposed.

00:10:18.411 --> 00:10:20.564 align:middle line:90%
So they'll see it immediately.

00:10:20.564 --> 00:10:22.230 align:middle line:84%
Well right now, they're
doing everything

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.270 align:middle line:84%
they can to keep the
head from falling off,

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:26.790 align:middle line:84%
and the right shoulder from
breaking open any more.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:29.430 align:middle line:90%


00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, and I
believe that it's either

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:34.850 align:middle line:84%
already happened or it's
still in the process,

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:37.660 align:middle line:84%
but I think at this point
it's already occurred,

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.940 align:middle line:84%
there will be three
people from the West

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:43.040 align:middle line:84%
that will enter into
this doorway right here.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And there is a physical door
right there behind the stones.

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And go down a circular
staircase to a room

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.680 align:middle line:84%
below, which they know
the room is there.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.890 align:middle line:84%
The Japanese have
located it precisely.

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And over in the corner
will be a clay pot.

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:00.660 align:middle line:84%
But the Japanese say
there's also a coil of rope.

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:01.910 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know what that is.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:05.000 align:middle line:84%
But the clay pot holds
on it the information

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.370 align:middle line:84%
for those people
of how to proceed.

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And from there, they will have
a very interesting experience

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:14.330 align:middle line:84%
that will lead them
through a long tunnel

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.770 align:middle line:84%
deep down-- I don't
know-- I don't know

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:21.460 align:middle line:84%
if I want to describe
all this, but all 48

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:23.430 align:middle line:84%
chromosomes of
Christ consciousness,

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:27.190 align:middle line:84%
which are geometrical images,
will be etched into the-- high

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.820 align:middle line:84%
up into this wall, one right
after another, beginning

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:31.874 align:middle line:90%
with the flower of life.

00:11:31.874 --> 00:11:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And soon after that, they
will emerge into a room

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.250 align:middle line:84%
where the-- where
the records are held,

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:42.681 align:middle line:90%
the physical records are held.

00:11:42.681 --> 00:11:46.740 align:middle line:90%


00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:51.870 align:middle line:84%
I believe-- I'm not certain,
but I think that that's probably

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:53.672 align:middle line:90%
already occurred.

00:11:53.672 --> 00:11:59.990 align:middle line:84%
Although time will have
to tell on that one.

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:01.500 align:middle line:90%
