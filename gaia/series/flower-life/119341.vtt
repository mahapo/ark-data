00:00:16.848 --> 00:00:19.430 align:middle line:84%
>>The instructions
that I'm about to give

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.350 align:middle line:84%
is the first aspect-- there
are four primary aspects--

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.120 align:middle line:90%
into teaching the Merkaba.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:33.165 align:middle line:84%
This is the very most
important instructions of all.

00:00:33.165 --> 00:00:35.900 align:middle line:84%
It is the easiest
one to tell you.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.814 align:middle line:90%
It is the hardest one to do.

00:00:38.814 --> 00:00:42.380 align:middle line:90%


00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.110 align:middle line:84%
No amount of understanding
of the science

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.580 align:middle line:84%
of the reality or the Merkaba
will create a living field

00:00:52.580 --> 00:01:00.170 align:middle line:84%
around a person, unless they
are in the state of love.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.700 align:middle line:90%


00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.420 align:middle line:84%
Your heart chakra
must be open, and you

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.358 align:middle line:84%
must be feeling love in
order for this to take place.

00:01:12.358 --> 00:01:15.430 align:middle line:90%


00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.002 align:middle line:84%
I guess this is the rules of
the game that God laid down.

00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:22.204 align:middle line:90%
This is just the way it is.

00:01:22.204 --> 00:01:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And there are two heart chakras,
and most of the chakra systems

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.990 align:middle line:84%
that run off the
body are thought

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.910 align:middle line:84%
of in terms of octaves--
and the Hindus, Tibetans.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.980 align:middle line:84%
But there are really
13 chakras running up

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.038 align:middle line:84%
the body-- 12 in the body,
and a 13th one above the head.

00:01:42.038 --> 00:01:45.460 align:middle line:90%


00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.730 align:middle line:84%
One of the heart chakras
is on the octave,

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.360 align:middle line:84%
and one of the heart chakras
is on the pentatonic scale.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.440 align:middle line:90%
One's on the white notes.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.340 align:middle line:90%
One's on the black notes.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And at this point right
here, just slightly

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.410 align:middle line:84%
above the sternum--
can everybody

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.380 align:middle line:90%
see this place right here?

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.620 align:middle line:84%
This is the place of the first
heart chakra, which is actually

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.580 align:middle line:84%
on the pentatonic
scale, which is

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.030 align:middle line:84%
the heart chakra of
universal, unconditional love

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.830 align:middle line:90%
for all life.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.260 align:middle line:84%
This would be one
way of putting it.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.180 align:middle line:84%
It's love for
everything for God.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.820 align:middle line:84%
There is one that's
higher in position,

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.420 align:middle line:90%
which is on the octave.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.740 align:middle line:84%
It's 7.23 centimeters
above it, right up here.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And that one is for a
portion of the reality.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.590 align:middle line:84%
Love for one person
to another, or love

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.640 align:middle line:84%
for something-- love for music,
love for something, but not

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.810 align:middle line:90%
for the entire reality.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And it is the lower one
down here at the sternum

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:00.530 align:middle line:84%
that, for our purposes
here, we need to focus on.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.710 align:middle line:90%


00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And so before you ever
begin into the meditation,

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.810 align:middle line:84%
one would sit down and
become still and clear

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:22.480 align:middle line:84%
their mind of all the world by
just being still and relaxing

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.090 align:middle line:84%
and letting go of all your
thoughts and your feelings

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.120 align:middle line:84%
to the best of your ability,
which is all you can do.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And then to begin to focus on
the fifth chakra of your body

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.670 align:middle line:84%
and to open your heart,
and it's a feeling--

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.900 align:middle line:84%
when you're in
love with someone,

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.190 align:middle line:84%
that is a feeling, a
sensation, an experience.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And it is also an experience
to be in love with God,

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.970 align:middle line:84%
or all life everywhere,
or the entire reality.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And so to the best of
your ability when you do

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.690 align:middle line:84%
this is that you
must first begin

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.430 align:middle line:84%
to open that area
of your energy field

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:18.190 align:middle line:84%
and to feel love for
everything and everyone

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.420 align:middle line:90%
with no exceptions at all.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.450 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we all have
certain people we don't like

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.014 align:middle line:84%
and certain things we
don't like and stuff.

00:04:29.014 --> 00:04:29.930 align:middle line:90%
That's the way we are.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.660 align:middle line:90%
We're in a polarized world.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.530 align:middle line:84%
So all you can do
is the best you can,

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.770 align:middle line:84%
and you just begin to just
focus on opening and gratitude

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:40.990 align:middle line:90%
for being alive.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And just whatever the
words or the images that

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.916 align:middle line:84%
help you to open, you work
with those to open your heart

00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:52.892 align:middle line:90%
and to open up.

00:04:52.892 --> 00:04:56.310 align:middle line:90%


00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Once you actually
feel that feeling,

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.140 align:middle line:84%
and you're in that
state of love,

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.790 align:middle line:84%
then you can begin
to do the practice.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And I'll just say
right now to the degree

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.920 align:middle line:84%
that you are able
to open that chakra

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.980 align:middle line:84%
and to feel love for all life
will be in direct proportion

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.640 align:middle line:84%
to your success with working
with this meditation,

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:34.930 align:middle line:84%
if you choose to use
this meditation, of

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.840 align:middle line:84%
When I walked around
the room here,

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.790 align:middle line:84%
I said
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.680 align:middle line:90%
there is no God but God.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's a Muslim,
or a Sufi, prayer.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.930 align:middle line:90%


00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And there is another
Sufi sound that

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.946 align:middle line:84%
actually has been used
by many other cultures

00:06:01.946 --> 00:06:03.320 align:middle line:84%
around the world,
because they've

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.560 align:middle line:90%
discovered that it works.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:11.120 align:middle line:84%
There is a sound that is
a very simple sound that

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.160 align:middle line:84%
will resonate in that
particular chakra of your body.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.340 align:middle line:90%
And the sound is hu.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.090 align:middle line:84%
It's spelled H-U, usually
in Sufism, anyway.

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:28.550 align:middle line:90%
And it's just the sound hu, hu.

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'd like to do
right now for about five minutes

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:40.260 align:middle line:84%
or so is all of us to begin
making this sound together.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And you can get creative with
it, if you want-- that's OK--

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.550 align:middle line:90%
and have a good time with it.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.790 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to be
real serious about it.

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:53.430 align:middle line:84%
But to feel what it
does to your body

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:54.920 align:middle line:84%
and to this flow
of energy that's

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.610 align:middle line:84%
moving through this room,
at the end of that I

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.160 align:middle line:84%
will bring the sound
down in intensity,

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.830 align:middle line:90%
and we'll say the prayers.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:11.750 align:middle line:84%
Great spirit, oh, holy trinity,
mother, father, child-god,

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:17.290 align:middle line:84%
creator of all life
everywhere, thank you.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:20.164 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for everything
that you've given us.

00:07:20.164 --> 00:07:23.336 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for this
circle and for the love

00:07:23.336 --> 00:07:25.880 align:middle line:90%
that flows through the circle.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.540 align:middle line:84%
For without this
love, we would never

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:32.584 align:middle line:84%
be able to see in the eyes
of every person before us.

00:07:32.584 --> 00:07:35.300 align:middle line:90%


00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And may all the
beings of light who

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:43.105 align:middle line:84%
wish there to be love and
truth and beauty and trust

00:07:43.105 --> 00:07:47.410 align:middle line:84%
and harmony and peace
throughout the cosmos--

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:50.282 align:middle line:84%
may those beings be
here who work with us

00:07:50.282 --> 00:07:52.820 align:middle line:90%
and have responsibility with us.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:59.800 align:middle line:84%
May they be here to help us to
open our hearts and our minds,

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:04.930 align:middle line:84%
so that we can understand and
make this real in our lives

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:09.586 align:middle line:84%
and live it and breathe it
and make it real here on Earth

00:08:09.586 --> 00:08:10.386 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:08:10.386 --> 00:08:17.670 align:middle line:90%


00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And one more time,
the angels of light

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:25.785 align:middle line:84%
who never separated from
God, those who have helped us

00:08:25.785 --> 00:08:29.420 align:middle line:84%
and protected us and
guided us and never let

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:34.720 align:middle line:84%
go of us during our time
of darkness-- we are all

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.440 align:middle line:90%
connected to those realms.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.901 align:middle line:90%
We are there.

00:08:38.901 --> 00:08:42.620 align:middle line:90%
We are one with them.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And I ask one more time
that you go within yourself

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:51.290 align:middle line:84%
and ask your angels to
be here, to be by you,

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:56.216 align:middle line:84%
and to help you during this time
and the times that are coming--

00:08:56.216 --> 00:08:58.880 align:middle line:84%
the incredible times
of transformation that

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:02.690 align:middle line:90%
are about to occur on Earth.

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:04.220 align:middle line:90%
Please ask them to be here.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:08.420 align:middle line:84%
We ended up with the-- they
call it Mystery School.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:11.720 align:middle line:84%
They meet up in three different
areas of this world-- Egypt,

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:18.110 align:middle line:84%
and Peru, Yucatan and
Tibetan area, up in there.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And the Egyptian one
was the male aspect

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:30.480 align:middle line:84%
of this grid that was going to
be created around the world.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:42.820 align:middle line:10%
And the people who started,
or the primary person

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.290 align:middle line:10%
who started that particular
school over there,

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:50.750 align:middle line:10%
was Ra-- sometimes spelled
R-A, sometimes spelled R-E.

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:54.660 align:middle line:10%
And he was another one
of the mortal beings who

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:57.180 align:middle line:10%
were found about out
about immortality

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.540 align:middle line:10%
during the time of Atlantis.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And you see, the history
of Egypt is so weird.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.380 align:middle line:84%
I started to talk
about it before,

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:17.540 align:middle line:84%
but you can't
really understand it

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.330 align:middle line:90%
unless you actually study it.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:22.040 align:middle line:84%
But it's the same
way with Sumeria.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Both of these two cultures,
both Sumeria and Egypt,

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.210 align:middle line:84%
they just appeared
out of nowhere.

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And no one knows
where they came from.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:37.180 align:middle line:84%
They just appeared one
day with everything

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:43.450 align:middle line:84%
intact, like a
civilization intact.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:46.250 align:middle line:84%
They don't tell you about this
too much in the history books,

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:50.300 align:middle line:84%
but if you study it, you'll
find out that's the way it is.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:54.350 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they have a special
name for it in archeology.

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:57.996 align:middle line:84%
It's called
stair-step evolution.

00:10:57.996 --> 00:11:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And the reason it's called
stair-step is because in Egypt

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:08.420 align:middle line:84%
what would happen is
a particular subject

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:13.700 align:middle line:84%
would come forth, like writing,
for example, in its full bloom

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.230 align:middle line:90%
with no evolution.

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And so there would just be this
sudden straight up evolution

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:21.060 align:middle line:90%
and up to another plateau.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And then there might be
a little bit of time,

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:27.050 align:middle line:84%
and then suddenly
another subject

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:29.980 align:middle line:84%
would be known about
in its full bloom.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.580 align:middle line:84%
It would just go straight up
with nothing coming before

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.090 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And so there were
these like stairs,

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:42.240 align:middle line:84%
which defies all understanding
of how this could possibly be.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:49.750 align:middle line:90%
Aha, we got lit up again now.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:54.730 align:middle line:90%
And so this continued on.

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And to this day,
archaeologists have--

00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:59.320 align:middle line:84%
especially Egyptian
archeologists--

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.930 align:middle line:84%
have no explanation
whatsoever-- just zero, zip.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:05.270 align:middle line:84%
All they know is
that's what happened.

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:07.336 align:middle line:84%
If you ask them how,
they don't know.

00:12:07.336 --> 00:12:11.500 align:middle line:84%
But what was going on and
the reason behind all of this

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.300 align:middle line:90%
was this.

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:13.800 align:middle line:84%
It's very simple
once you understand

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.390 align:middle line:90%
what was happening behind it.

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Underneath the Great Pyramid,
in that little temple villa city

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:27.990 align:middle line:84%
under there, was about
1,600 fully aware

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:34.790 align:middle line:84%
self-aware beings, which was
part of the Naacal Mystery

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:37.110 align:middle line:90%
School branch in Egypt.

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:40.400 align:middle line:84%
They became known as
the Tat Brotherhood.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.980 align:middle line:84%
It was Tat Brotherhood
because Tat

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:47.490 align:middle line:84%
was one of Thoth's sons,
his only son actually.

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:50.280 align:middle line:90%
And Tat stayed with Ra.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And it eventually became
known as the Tat Brotherhood.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.391 align:middle line:84%
Even today there's a
Tat Brotherhood there,

00:12:54.391 --> 00:12:57.620 align:middle line:84%
but it's the superficial ones
who are the guys outside,

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:58.900 align:middle line:90%
and they protect the temples.

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.120 align:middle line:84%
They're the protectors
of the temples.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.080 align:middle line:84%
But there's the hidden,
inner Tat Brotherhood,

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.040 align:middle line:90%
which are the immortal beings.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And after the destruction,
when the poles shifted

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.210 align:middle line:84%
and the whole
thing collapsed in,

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:19.430 align:middle line:84%
and we dropped in consciousness,
and we started eating food

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:25.350 align:middle line:84%
again and a lot of other things
that we didn't do before,

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:26.740 align:middle line:90%
the Mayans were erased.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.370 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing there.

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And so they had to sit for
a very long time and wait.

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:35.540 align:middle line:84%
They had to wait for
almost 6,000 years

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:40.380 align:middle line:84%
while we regenerated
ourselves and recreated

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.830 align:middle line:84%
much of our patterns
and started-- it's

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:44.050 align:middle line:90%
like someone who has amnesia.

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:48.259 align:middle line:84%
You've got to start learning
how to read all over again,

00:13:48.259 --> 00:13:49.800 align:middle line:84%
and all these other
things like that.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.607 align:middle line:90%
So the mechanisms were fine.

00:13:51.607 --> 00:13:52.690 align:middle line:90%
They just had been erased.

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:54.170 align:middle line:90%
So they had to wait.

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And then about
6,000 years went by,

00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:00.130 align:middle line:84%
which happens to be
another point in the orbit.

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:08.020 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really talk about
this, but in this cycle

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:11.740 align:middle line:84%
we talked about these two
places here as being special.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:17.660 align:middle line:84%
But there is also
these places here,

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:23.254 align:middle line:84%
which is approximately one
quarter of the way around.

00:14:23.254 --> 00:14:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And then you get this
other quarter of the way

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:26.800 align:middle line:90%
around right here.

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.860 align:middle line:90%
There's really four places.

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:30.290 align:middle line:90%
These are the major ones.

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:32.260 align:middle line:90%
And these are the minor ones.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:36.852 align:middle line:84%
These are also places when
dramatic change can take place,

00:14:36.852 --> 00:14:40.170 align:middle line:84%
though not usually
as often or anywhere,

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:43.494 align:middle line:84%
but you could have a pole shift
there as well as over there,

00:14:43.494 --> 00:14:45.160 align:middle line:84%
but it's almost always
going to be here,

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:48.220 align:middle line:84%
but things can happen
here and here too.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And they waited until
they got to this one here.

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:56.705 align:middle line:84%
And they also had to wait until
they evolved farther enough.

00:14:56.705 --> 00:15:01.510 align:middle line:90%
And so it was about 3800 BC.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Two groups-- there was
not the Tat Brotherhood,

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:09.800 align:middle line:84%
which were Syrian-based, which
were the father image of us.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.770 align:middle line:84%
The 32 members of
the Syrian base

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:14.837 align:middle line:84%
were connected directly
to that particular group.

00:15:14.837 --> 00:15:16.670 align:middle line:84%
And so it was not only
the ascended masters,

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:20.550 align:middle line:84%
but they had the direct
guidance of the 32

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:23.950 align:middle line:84%
members of the Syrian race
that originally started it.

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And pretty obviously it was the
Anunnaki from the 12th planet

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.720 align:middle line:90%
who began the one in Sumeria.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, I believe these two
started at the same time,

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.190 align:middle line:84%
and I think eventually
this will be proven.

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you why this
is in just a few minutes.

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:47.390 align:middle line:84%
Although at present they
separate them by 500 years.

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:51.411 align:middle line:84%
They say Sumeria first, and then
Egypt started 500 years later.

00:15:51.411 --> 00:15:54.840 align:middle line:84%
I really disagree
with this, strongly.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think they
started the same time,

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.630 align:middle line:90%
but from two different sources.

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:03.250 align:middle line:90%
Really, it's the same.

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:06.760 align:middle line:84%
It's like mommy, daddy, but it's
the same family, same parents,

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.260 align:middle line:90%
but different words.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And so the Anunnaki
came in and simply gave

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:18.710 align:middle line:84%
the Sumerians the information,
just said, here it is.

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, the
Tat brotherhood,

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:23.240 align:middle line:84%
their approach was
a little different,

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.890 align:middle line:84%
because the Anunnaki gave it
to the Sumerians really fast.

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:30.792 align:middle line:84%
They just gave them a big
blast of the whole thing.

00:16:30.792 --> 00:16:33.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was just like if
suddenly you came in here

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:41.840 align:middle line:84%
and a ship comes down,
and you're never the same

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.640 align:middle line:90%
after that.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're just
totally picked up

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.660 align:middle line:84%
and remember all this stuff,
and all that kind of thing.

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:48.150 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they were changed fast.

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:52.290 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians were changed very
fast, but a little bit longer

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:55.480 align:middle line:90%
period of time.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.660 align:middle line:84%
What the Tat Brotherhood
was doing was

00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.710 align:middle line:84%
they were sitting there
waiting-- all of them--

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:02.217 align:middle line:84%
until they saw that we had
gotten to the right place,

00:17:02.217 --> 00:17:04.050 align:middle line:84%
and we were in the right
place in the orbit,

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:06.381 align:middle line:84%
and everything else, all
of the things were right.

00:17:06.381 --> 00:17:07.839 align:middle line:84%
And then they sent
either one, two,

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:09.819 align:middle line:84%
or three members of the
Tat Brotherhood, which

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:15.609 align:middle line:84%
were mortal beings, out to
either the person or the group,

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:17.180 align:middle line:84%
whichever it was
that had reached

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:21.089 align:middle line:84%
the particular level that could
accept what was being told.

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And they would come
out looking like them

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:27.839 align:middle line:84%
and dressed like them, and
would go out and just tell him,

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:30.437 align:middle line:84%
remind them, of something
they already knew.

00:17:30.437 --> 00:17:32.270 align:middle line:84%
But of course, it sounded
brand new to them,

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:33.960 align:middle line:84%
but it wasn't
really new to them.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.290 align:middle line:84%
They had known this
at one time before.

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:38.924 align:middle line:90%
And they told them.

00:17:38.924 --> 00:17:40.090 align:middle line:90%
They gave them the language.

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:41.506 align:middle line:84%
They gave them the
various things.

00:17:41.506 --> 00:17:43.190 align:middle line:84%
They'd give them
various aspects,

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:46.950 align:middle line:84%
then go back under there and
wait and let them absorb that.

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:49.066 align:middle line:84%
And then when they'd
get to another level

00:17:49.066 --> 00:17:50.690 align:middle line:84%
where they were ready,
then another one

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:53.185 align:middle line:84%
would come out and give
them another group of this.

00:17:53.185 --> 00:17:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And so what would
happen is you'd

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:59.370 align:middle line:84%
see these things going
like this in evolution.

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:02.630 align:middle line:84%
It's like hydraulics,
for example.

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:05.002 align:middle line:84%
They would suddenly know
everything about hydraulics.

00:18:05.002 --> 00:18:06.460 align:middle line:84%
They'd know things
about hydraulics

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.180 align:middle line:84%
that would take
thousands of years

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:10.690 align:middle line:84%
to evolve through
normal ways of thinking,

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:12.836 align:middle line:84%
and yet they'd know
it all in one year.

00:18:12.836 --> 00:18:14.210 align:middle line:84%
You know, where
did it come from?

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:17.160 align:middle line:84%
How do they possibly know
this stuff just like that?

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.710 align:middle line:90%
But they did.

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's what was
hidden underneath this,

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:24.430 align:middle line:84%
is you had these two
very intelligent races--

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:30.740 align:middle line:84%
the Anunnaki and the ascended
masters, along with the Syrians

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:33.220 align:middle line:84%
that were injecting the
information directly

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:37.160 align:middle line:84%
back into these two cultures,
so that within a very, very

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:42.620 align:middle line:84%
extremely short period of time,
in one lifetime of one person,

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:46.140 align:middle line:84%
they went from zero
to 90 miles an hour.

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:49.690 align:middle line:84%
They went zhoop, and
they were full-tilt on.

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:54.630 align:middle line:90%


00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:59.400 align:middle line:84%
There was a problem that
began to develop, specifically

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:02.360 align:middle line:90%
in the Egyptian side.

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't
nearly-- I don't even

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:15.630 align:middle line:84%
know if it was a problem on
the Sumerian side for sure,

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:17.830 align:middle line:84%
but it definitely was
one on the Egyptian side.

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:21.420 align:middle line:84%
Egyptian culture began
as two countries.

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:24.340 align:middle line:84%
It began as a
polarized state, where

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:27.132 align:middle line:90%
you have upper and lower Egypt.

00:19:27.132 --> 00:19:28.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, in their
memories, they still

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:32.380 align:middle line:84%
had the memory of what it was
like before the poles shifted,

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:35.250 align:middle line:84%
which everything
was reversed around.

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:38.860 align:middle line:84%
The sun rose in the west
and set in the east,

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:41.342 align:middle line:84%
and the polarities were
different, and everything.

00:19:41.342 --> 00:19:48.800 align:middle line:90%


00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.340 align:middle line:84%
What you think and what you
feel creates your reality

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.320 align:middle line:90%
more than you know.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And they created a world
where upper Egypt was

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:59.980 align:middle line:84%
to the south and lower
Egypt was to the north

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:02.860 align:middle line:84%
and the Nile runs from
the south to the north.

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:08.540 align:middle line:84%
It's the only river in the world
that does-- major river that

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:10.820 align:middle line:90%
runs from south to north.

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:13.960 align:middle line:84%
All the rest of them
go the other way.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And even if you go
to Dendera-- I'll

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:20.220 align:middle line:84%
show you a thing which is
the heart chakra in one

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:24.000 align:middle line:84%
of the temples in Egypt--
there's a place up there where

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.880 align:middle line:84%
you'll see the astrological
signs on the ceiling.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:31.080 align:middle line:84%
They look just exactly like the
ones you would recognize today

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:34.990 align:middle line:84%
in precisely the same
way and everything else,

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:38.137 align:middle line:84%
except that they're moving
the other direction.

00:20:38.137 --> 00:20:40.220 align:middle line:84%
The heavens are rotating
in the opposite direction

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:42.198 align:middle line:84%
that we're used to
seeing them move.

00:20:42.198 --> 00:20:45.800 align:middle line:90%


00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.540 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't the problem, though.

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:50.850 align:middle line:84%
The problem is they started
out in this polarized way,

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:54.450 align:middle line:84%
and the problem developed
around religion,

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:56.420 align:middle line:84%
not around the
understanding of language,

00:20:56.420 --> 00:21:02.080 align:middle line:84%
and the sciences, and
these kinds of things.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:02.980 align:middle line:90%
It was religion.

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:06.148 align:middle line:84%
It was the understanding of
God that was the problem.

00:21:06.148 --> 00:21:11.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, the religion of that
time was the Osirian religion.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.210 align:middle line:10%
And Osiris was not an Egyptian.

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:17.190 align:middle line:10%
He was an Atlantean.

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:20.170 align:middle line:10%
And he was the first
person, according

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:24.540 align:middle line:10%
to Thoth, that graduated from
the Naacal Mystery School.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:27.340 align:middle line:84%
The people that were in
Lemuria were teaching

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:32.750 align:middle line:90%
how to be an immortal being.

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And here they are, eon after
eon, sitting there teaching it.

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't
get anybody to do it.

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:45.400 align:middle line:84%
It went for somewhere
around 20,000

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.930 align:middle line:84%
to maybe as long as
even 30,000 years--

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:51.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm not really sure-- before
they got one person that

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:53.210 align:middle line:90%
could figure out how to do it.

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:56.230 align:middle line:90%


00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:57.030 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:58.640 align:middle line:84%
They just couldn't
get them to do it.

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.560 align:middle line:90%
And they finally got one person.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And that one person's
name was Osiris.

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And the second person and third
person was Isis and Horace.

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:11.190 align:middle line:84%
It was really kind
of simultaneous.

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:17.170 align:middle line:84%
But Osiris was the one that
made the direct attempt.

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:21.320 align:middle line:90%


00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And the story of Isis
and Osiris is really

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:31.800 align:middle line:90%
the basis of Christianity.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.280 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very similar
in a lot of ways.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:37.930 align:middle line:90%


00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:42.840 align:middle line:84%
Isis and Osiris were
brother and sister.

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.050 align:middle line:90%
They were also married.

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And they had also had
another brother and sister,

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:51.930 align:middle line:90%
which was Seth and Nephthys.

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:54.200 align:middle line:84%
So Isis and Nephthys
were sisters,

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.920 align:middle line:84%
and Seth and Osiris
were brothers.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:04.206 align:middle line:84%
And Seth and Nephthys were
also married together.

00:23:04.206 --> 00:23:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And at one point
Seth killed Osiris.

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:16.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, you may take that
as a negative act.

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
we can judge this

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:22.780 align:middle line:84%
or not, whether or
not Seth was actually

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:24.070 align:middle line:90%
the bad guy in all of this.

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:26.818 align:middle line:90%


00:23:26.818 --> 00:23:31.790 align:middle line:84%
It may have been something
that was more or less agreed

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:33.760 align:middle line:90%
upon between the two of them.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.930 align:middle line:84%
This is my feelings about
this, because it's just

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:40.130 align:middle line:84%
the understanding of
what was going on here.

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:42.340 align:middle line:90%
But that's my own feelings.

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:45.700 align:middle line:90%
But anyway, he killed Osiris.

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And the story has all
been transposed over

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.640 align:middle line:90%
into Egyptian times.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.470 align:middle line:84%
So he was put in
this wooden casket

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:56.810 align:middle line:90%
and floated down the Nile.

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:59.150 align:middle line:84%
But of course it
wasn't really the Nile.

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:05.319 align:middle line:84%
And Seth and Nephthys went and
looked for him for a long time

00:24:05.319 --> 00:24:07.110 align:middle line:84%
and finally found him
and brought him back.

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And when he did, Seth
then took the body

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:13.390 align:middle line:84%
and cut it into 14 pieces
and distributed them

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:15.310 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:17.220 align:middle line:84%
So they would never
find him again.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:22.814 align:middle line:84%
And so then Isis
and Nephthys went

00:24:22.814 --> 00:24:24.980 align:middle line:84%
around searching for these
pieces to bring him back.

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:28.320 align:middle line:90%
They found 13 of the 14 pieces.

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.120 align:middle line:84%
They found everything
but the phallus,

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.260 align:middle line:84%
which was the 14th
piece, which has

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:34.670 align:middle line:90%
to do with the creative flow.

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:37.900 align:middle line:90%


00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And so they went
to that temple--

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.724 align:middle line:90%
the one that we showed you.

00:24:40.724 --> 00:24:42.890 align:middle line:84%
Remember, that long one I
dropped down into and took

00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:45.570 align:middle line:84%
pictures-- and it
was there that they

00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:48.580 align:middle line:84%
put, according to the story,
because that could not

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:55.930 align:middle line:84%
have been this, because, this
was 36,000 years-- or actually,

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:58.035 align:middle line:84%
well, I don't know
how long it was.

00:24:58.035 --> 00:24:59.410 align:middle line:84%
It was tens of
thousands of years

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:01.944 align:middle line:84%
before that in another
place and time.

00:25:01.944 --> 00:25:09.980 align:middle line:84%
But they put 13 of
these pieces together

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.080 align:middle line:90%
and recreated his body.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And then it was
Thoth [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:17.110 align:middle line:84%
who went in and
recreated the phallus,

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:21.580 align:middle line:84%
gave him back his
life force energy,

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:28.730 align:middle line:84%
and he then became an immortal
person through this process.

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:30.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, the process
was that he began

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:32.980 align:middle line:84%
in one state-- the
first state-- and then

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:36.460 align:middle line:84%
he was killed and
separated-- he was cut up--

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:39.710 align:middle line:84%
and then his pieces were put
back together and resurrected

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:40.650 align:middle line:90%
from there.

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was done also through
immaculate conception, which

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:46.500 align:middle line:84%
is another element in
all of this, which I'll

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.830 align:middle line:90%
talk about a little bit later.

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:51.880 align:middle line:84%
It was done through
the holy trinity.

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.200 align:middle line:84%
We'll have to
discuss what that was

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.726 align:middle line:90%
all about at the right time.

00:25:56.726 --> 00:26:01.240 align:middle line:84%
I'll come back to this story
a little later at another time

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.800 align:middle line:84%
when we talk about
immaculate conception.

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:11.900 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, the
procedure that Osiris

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:18.660 align:middle line:84%
used to make the transformation
from one level of consciousness

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:24.780 align:middle line:84%
to another corresponded with
the chromosome patterns that

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:27.720 align:middle line:90%
are in every cell of your body.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:34.136 align:middle line:84%
And in those days
of Atlantis, they

00:26:34.136 --> 00:26:35.910 align:middle line:84%
didn't need to write
these things down,

00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:38.710 align:middle line:84%
like I described to you
before about memory.

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:41.830 align:middle line:84%
So that was understandable
by other people

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:44.200 align:middle line:90%
without that having to be done.

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.480 align:middle line:84%
But when it got to Egypt,
it had to be written down,

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.390 align:middle line:84%
because writing had
been introduced,

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:50.500 align:middle line:84%
which caused us
to grow-- as we'll

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:54.020 align:middle line:84%
talk about later-- another
part of a skull up here.

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:56.236 align:middle line:84%
And it changed our
body height and changed

00:26:56.236 --> 00:26:58.110 align:middle line:84%
our perception of reality
and a lot of things

00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:59.323 align:middle line:90%
just by introducing writing.

00:26:59.323 --> 00:27:06.050 align:middle line:90%


00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:07.910 align:middle line:90%
Let me see.

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:18.700 align:middle line:90%


00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:19.616 align:middle line:90%
Here it is.

00:27:19.616 --> 00:27:23.130 align:middle line:90%


00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:29.730 align:middle line:84%
So in the Egyptian times, they
had to put it into book form.

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:32.490 align:middle line:10%
And they put it into this
book, which was called

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:34.370 align:middle line:10%
"The Forty-Two Books of Thoth."

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:36.700 align:middle line:10%
But there were two more
books that were set aside.

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:40.040 align:middle line:10%
There are 42 plus 2 books,
because they started with 42

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:42.450 align:middle line:10%
plus 2 chromosomes, starting
from the first level

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:45.450 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness,
like the Aboriginals.

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And the chromosome
levels, or the pathways,

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:53.220 align:middle line:84%
were called nefers, and
they were represented

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:58.880 align:middle line:84%
by people with either human
heads or animal heads,

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:01.660 align:middle line:84%
and they had various symbols
over the top of their heads.

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:05.350 align:middle line:84%
This one was Maat,
which meant truth.

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:15.050 align:middle line:10%
And they all had their
different meaning,

00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:19.230 align:middle line:10%
and they represented
movements in the great void,

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:21.690 align:middle line:10%
which we are about to
talk about a little later.

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:25.360 align:middle line:90%


00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And so the study of this was
important to the Egyptians.

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:35.710 align:middle line:84%
However, when they developed
those two countries

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:39.510 align:middle line:84%
of upper and lower Egypt, they
had two kings and two ways

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:42.470 align:middle line:90%
of looking at things.

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:53.250 align:middle line:84%
These 44 different nefers
took on 44 different images

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:58.600 align:middle line:84%
actually in lower Egypt
and 44 different images

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:03.080 align:middle line:90%
over here in upper Egypt.

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And then, to
complicated it more,

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:09.600 align:middle line:84%
the people began to think
that each one of these nefers

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:15.240 align:middle line:84%
with a small g for "god"-- they
gave it a big old capital G

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:19.630 align:middle line:84%
and started saying that Isis
was God or Sekhmet was god,

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:24.410 align:middle line:84%
or Anubis was God,
et cetera, like this.

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:29.980 align:middle line:84%
And each little community
started polarizing all the way

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:30.990 align:middle line:90%
down the whole thing.

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:34.340 align:middle line:84%
This is where your occults all
begin to take place in here.

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:38.000 align:middle line:90%


00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And this just kept getting
worse and stronger and stronger

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:43.027 align:middle line:90%
and worse as time went by.

00:29:43.027 --> 00:29:45.610 align:middle line:84%
And the ascended masters and the
Tat Brotherhood were sitting,

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:49.910 align:middle line:84%
and they were going, we've got
to do something about this.

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:53.040 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's only one God,
and they don't realize this.

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And they knew that
the plans that

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:59.900 align:middle line:84%
were laid down at that
time, if it was not changed,

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:05.056 align:middle line:84%
by the time we got to
here, we wouldn't possibly

00:30:05.056 --> 00:30:06.180 align:middle line:90%
be able to make it through.

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And it has affected
us strongly, even now.

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And so they decided
that they would

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:20.580 align:middle line:84%
try to intervene directly again
to make another change in this

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:23.565 align:middle line:84%
to guide us toward one god--
the interesting understanding

00:30:23.565 --> 00:30:25.670 align:middle line:90%
that there's only one.

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And they waited until
the 17th dynasty.

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:37.310 align:middle line:84%
So by the 17th
dynasty, Thoth, who

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:43.370 align:middle line:84%
was elected to be the one to do
it, went to the King of Egypt.

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:45.405 align:middle line:84%
And they were kings up
until the 17th dynasty.

00:30:45.405 --> 00:30:49.770 align:middle line:84%
They weren't pharaohs
until the 18th dynasty.

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:52.590 align:middle line:10%
And they went to
the King of Egypt,

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:54.290 align:middle line:10%
and his name was Imhotep II.

00:30:54.290 --> 00:31:02.260 align:middle line:90%


00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And Thoth, according to him,
walked right into the room

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:10.300 align:middle line:84%
to greet Imhotep II--
which probably just

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:14.000 align:middle line:84%
blew his mind,
because I sure that he

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.250 align:middle line:84%
thought he was just that guy
in the wall all the time.

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:22.260 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't really a real
person-- and convinced him

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:26.340 align:middle line:84%
that he should do something that
no King would normally ever do,

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:30.360 align:middle line:84%
and that is that he would
not allow his son to be King,

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:35.470 align:middle line:84%
but to interject
someone else to be king.

00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:38.860 align:middle line:84%
So he probably
convinced him real well.

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:42.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what he did,
but he got him real sure.

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:46.280 align:middle line:84%
He explained to him
the whole situation.

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:47.215 align:middle line:90%
And so they agreed.

00:31:47.215 --> 00:31:48.506 align:middle line:90%


00:31:48.506 --> 00:31:49.630 align:middle line:90%
And you can check this out.

00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:51.450 align:middle line:84%
This is all
outrageous, and there

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:56.230 align:middle line:84%
is controversy over certain
aspects of this in archeology,

00:31:56.230 --> 00:32:00.040 align:middle line:84%
but this is what's written
down in many of the books.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:04.130 align:middle line:84%
You remember Tiya
and Ay from Lemuria?

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:06.080 align:middle line:90%
Well, they're still here.

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:09.550 align:middle line:84%
They have a real nice
house in Egypt now.

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:10.730 align:middle line:90%
It's a round house.

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:13.530 align:middle line:84%
It's probably the only
round house in all of Egypt.

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:17.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a round house with a wall
down the middle, completely

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:19.030 align:middle line:90%
separately both halves.

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:22.450 align:middle line:84%
So you have to go outside to
come back in in the other one.

00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:24.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, really.

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And on one side of this wall,
it shows Imhotep looking

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:32.194 align:middle line:90%
like a normal human being.

00:32:32.194 --> 00:32:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And on the other
side of the wall,

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:37.957 align:middle line:84%
it shows him about 14 1/2 feet
tall with this very large head,

00:32:37.957 --> 00:32:40.290 align:middle line:84%
looking like what you're going
to see here in just a few

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:43.250 align:middle line:84%
minutes, showing that he was
able to go back and forth

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:46.690 align:middle line:84%
between those two
states of being.

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:52.380 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, Ay and Tiya were
two of the most powerful people

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:54.060 align:middle line:90%
in all of Egypt.

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Everybody knew they
had been there forever

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:59.940 align:middle line:84%
and that these
people didn't die.

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And they had a great
deal of respect

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:07.420 align:middle line:84%
and I would imagine
a little bit of fear.

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:09.310 align:middle line:84%
They were pretty
well feared in a way,

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:12.362 align:middle line:84%
though not that
they did anything.

00:33:12.362 --> 00:33:13.570 align:middle line:90%
They were very loving people.

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:17.540 align:middle line:84%
It's just that they
were so unusual.

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And so what was decided
was that they needed

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:25.220 align:middle line:90%
to bring forth certain things.

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And the first step
that they decided to do

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:31.080 align:middle line:84%
was that they were going
to bring an actual Christ

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:35.750 align:middle line:84%
consciousness being in a real
fourth dimensional Christ

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:38.930 align:middle line:84%
consciousness body and have
that person walk on the Earth.

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:42.190 align:middle line:90%


00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:44.510 align:middle line:84%
That person would be
called the pharaoh.

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And what pharaoh means is
that which we will become.

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:51.380 align:middle line:90%
That's what it means.

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And that is exactly what
they were trying to do

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:58.530 align:middle line:84%
was to give you the example
of where our consciousness was

00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:01.150 align:middle line:84%
leading to, that we were going
to go through metamorphosis

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:02.810 align:middle line:90%
from this state to another one.

00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:05.210 align:middle line:90%
And we would appear differently.

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:07.550 align:middle line:84%
We would still be
somewhat human,

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:11.170 align:middle line:84%
but very, very different in
a lot of many, many ways--

00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:15.400 align:middle line:84%
physiologically as well as
consciously, and lots of ways.

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And so they wanted to put it
right into the akashic record,

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:21.239 align:middle line:84%
the example, so that
it would be there

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:23.594 align:middle line:84%
all the way down
until this time now.

00:34:23.594 --> 00:34:24.760 align:middle line:90%
That was real important too.

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:27.790 align:middle line:90%


00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And then the next step
after that was-- there

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:35.389 align:middle line:84%
was another step also agreed
upon at that time, which I

00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:37.635 align:middle line:90%
will explain in just a moment.

00:34:37.635 --> 00:34:39.010 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
is they wanted

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:42.334 align:middle line:84%
to get this person walking out
on the surface of the Earth.

00:34:42.334 --> 00:34:44.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, to create a Christ
consciousness being,

00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:47.600 align:middle line:84%
you can't use the chromosomes
of an ordinary people.

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:49.724 align:middle line:84%
You have to 46
plus 2 chromosomes.

00:34:49.724 --> 00:34:54.570 align:middle line:84%
So you have start
with that level.

00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And so who they chose
was Tiya and Ay.

00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:01.317 align:middle line:90%
These people are very old.

00:35:01.317 --> 00:35:02.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're very
old no matter how

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:04.300 align:middle line:90%
you want to look at it.

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:05.980 align:middle line:90%
They weren't kids.

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And they were asked
to have babies.

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:10.890 align:middle line:90%
And so they had this baby.

00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:15.820 align:middle line:84%
And the baby, then, was
interjected into the lineage

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:21.480 align:middle line:84%
and became Imhotep III,
or the last King of Egypt.

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And then when Imhotep III
grew up and became an adult,

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:29.370 align:middle line:90%
he had a baby.

00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And that baby's name, of
course, was Imhotep IV, which

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:40.394 align:middle line:90%
we know more as Akhenaten.

00:35:40.394 --> 00:35:42.990 align:middle line:90%
His name was Akhenaten.

00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And he became the
first pharaoh of Egypt

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:49.730 align:middle line:84%
and the first pharaoh
of the 18th dynasty.

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:52.198 align:middle line:84%
There was a dramatic
change between the 17th

00:35:52.198 --> 00:35:54.030 align:middle line:90%
and the 18th dynasty.

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:58.700 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, before,
while Imhotep III

00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:04.930 align:middle line:84%
was having this little
baby of Imhotep IV,

00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Tiya and Ay had-- these names
get confusing-- another baby.

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.302 align:middle line:84%
And that baby's
name was Nefertiti.

00:36:18.302 --> 00:36:21.520 align:middle line:90%


00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And so Nefertiti and
Akhenaten were indirectly

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:28.904 align:middle line:90%
brother and sister.

00:36:28.904 --> 00:36:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And again, when we talk
about immaculate conception,

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:35.240 align:middle line:84%
you'll see that there is
a saying about brothers

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:37.900 align:middle line:84%
and sisters that's
been going on all

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:41.310 align:middle line:90%
over the world for a long time.

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not trying to
judge it or anything else.

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:45.791 align:middle line:84%
I'll just give you the
information, at your time,

00:36:45.791 --> 00:36:48.990 align:middle line:84%
you can make up your
own decisions about it.

00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:52.850 align:middle line:84%
But there seems to be
something around this.

00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And so they had
this little baby.

00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, Nefertiti
and Akhenaten grew up,

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:02.540 align:middle line:90%
and they got married.

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And they became the
first pharaoh and queen

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:07.840 align:middle line:90%
of the 18th dynasty.

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:15.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, Akhenaten did not
look anything hardly

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.710 align:middle line:90%
at all like a human being.

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:22.220 align:middle line:84%
For one thing, he
was 14 1/2 feet tall.

00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:25.620 align:middle line:84%
Nefertiti was 10 foot
6", I think it was,

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:27.300 align:middle line:90%
somewhere around there.

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And they were, as
you're going to see here

00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:32.690 align:middle line:84%
in a little bit,
very unusual people.

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:37.090 align:middle line:84%
This is Abu Simbel, which is
the base chakra at the end

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:39.380 align:middle line:90%
of the bottom of the Nile.

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:44.280 align:middle line:84%
It corresponds to the
base chakra of the spine.

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.696 align:middle line:10%
You see this very, very
large statues there.

00:37:46.696 --> 00:37:50.100 align:middle line:90%


00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:53.810 align:middle line:10%
Here are some more, same place.

00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:57.504 align:middle line:84%
They're standing here, which
is better when you see.

00:37:57.504 --> 00:37:59.170 align:middle line:84%
You can see the heights
of these people,

00:37:59.170 --> 00:38:00.545 align:middle line:84%
and you see these
very high ones.

00:38:00.545 --> 00:38:05.900 align:middle line:84%
These beings here are
roughly 55 feet tall.

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:13.060 align:middle line:90%


00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:20.910 align:middle line:84%
We think that this is it,
that our height and our place

00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:23.280 align:middle line:84%
is kind of the standard
of the universe.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.620 align:middle line:90%


00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:29.130 align:middle line:84%
But actually there are
many, many different heights

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:31.860 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness or
bodies out there,

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:35.120 align:middle line:84%
from little tiny ones
to very big ones.

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And in human
consciousness on Earth,

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:41.480 align:middle line:84%
there are actually
five different heights

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:47.670 align:middle line:84%
of beings that have lived and do
live on Earth at various times,

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:51.830 align:middle line:84%
and they correspond with five
different consciousness levels

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:55.630 align:middle line:84%
that are possible, because when
we reach the fifth one-- the 55

00:38:55.630 --> 00:39:03.330 align:middle line:84%
foot high one-- we leave
totally this concept of reality.

00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:05.741 align:middle line:84%
It's a stepping stone
to somewhere else.

00:39:05.741 --> 00:39:08.570 align:middle line:90%


00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is demonstrated
in Egypt in the sense

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:13.900 align:middle line:84%
that every king that
has ever lived in Egypt

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:18.450 align:middle line:84%
all had five names, representing
these five different conscious

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:20.420 align:middle line:90%
levels.

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And these five different
heights of beings--

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:28.170 align:middle line:84%
the first one is about 3 and
1/2 to 4 and 1/2 feet tall,

00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:30.550 align:middle line:90%
could even be 5 feet tall.

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:34.440 align:middle line:84%
It's a range around
in there, usually.

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And that one has 42
plus 2 chromosomes.

00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:40.500 align:middle line:84%
The next one is
the one we're in.

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And we're about 5
feet to 7 feet tall.

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:46.690 align:middle line:84%
We all fall somewhere in
there, usually pretty much.

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:47.490 align:middle line:90%
There's exceptions.

00:39:47.490 --> 00:39:50.880 align:middle line:84%
There's always exceptions,
but pretty much.

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And we have 44
plus 2 chromosomes.

00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:56.770 align:middle line:84%
The next one goes
up quite a bit.

00:39:56.770 --> 00:39:59.910 align:middle line:90%
It goes 10 to 16 feet tall.

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:02.550 align:middle line:90%
And they have 46 plus 2.

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the Christ
consciousness first enters in.

00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:08.939 align:middle line:84%
Then the one after that, which
I know very little about,

00:40:08.939 --> 00:40:11.480 align:middle line:84%
which is another stepping stone
consciousness like this one--

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:17.330 align:middle line:84%
it's another disharmonic
consciousness-- is roughly 30,

00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:19.020 align:middle line:90%
35 feet tall.

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And they are 48
plus 2 chromosomes.

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And the final one is
between 50 and 60 feet tall.

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:27.070 align:middle line:90%
It's averaging about 55 feet.

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And that one is 50
plus 2 chromosomes.

00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:34.730 align:middle line:84%
Right now, we are
on the second level.

00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:38.207 align:middle line:84%
And so all you're ever
concerned with in consciousness

00:40:38.207 --> 00:40:40.415 align:middle line:84%
is that which you just came
from-- the past, present,

00:40:40.415 --> 00:40:41.900 align:middle line:84%
and future-- the one
you just came from,

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:44.275 align:middle line:84%
the one you're in now, and
the one where you're going to.

00:40:44.275 --> 00:40:45.255 align:middle line:90%
It's like a leaf.

00:40:45.255 --> 00:40:47.320 align:middle line:84%
A plant's saying, I
just grew three leaves.

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.120 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm at five.

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.790 align:middle line:90%
And I need to go to eight.

00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And so we have
three consciousness.

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:54.540 align:middle line:84%
We're concerned with
the Aboriginal-- 42.

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:59.780 align:middle line:84%
We're concerned with our self
and the one we're going to.

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And so these other two--
these really tall ones--

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.020 align:middle line:90%
we don't need.

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:06.240 align:middle line:84%
But the Egyptians left
all the actual sizes

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:09.740 align:middle line:84%
of these beings
sitting all over Egypt.

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And no one knows
why they did this.

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:16.290 align:middle line:84%
They created actual
rooms for these people

00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:19.330 align:middle line:84%
to really, literally,
walk around in them,

00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:22.060 align:middle line:84%
because they literally
did walk around in them.

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:24.370 align:middle line:90%


00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:27.420 align:middle line:84%
The Hathor race, for
example, which is from Venus

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:29.100 align:middle line:90%
are 10 to 16 feet tall.

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:32.890 align:middle line:84%
They are the most evolved
race in this solar system.

00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:35.175 align:middle line:84%
They live fourth
dimensionally on Venus.

00:41:35.175 --> 00:41:36.550 align:middle line:84%
You won't see
anything coming up.

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:39.390 align:middle line:90%
Well, you will see some things.

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:43.552 align:middle line:84%
Our governments have already
seen structures on Venus.

00:41:43.552 --> 00:41:46.120 align:middle line:84%
That has been
documented clearly.

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:50.572 align:middle line:84%
But primarily, they're on
the fourth dimensional level

00:41:50.572 --> 00:41:51.372 align:middle line:90%
of Venus.

00:41:51.372 --> 00:41:54.840 align:middle line:90%


00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And for example,
you'll see a room here

00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:00.906 align:middle line:84%
with 18 foot high
ceilings inside of here.

00:42:00.906 --> 00:42:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And then right
next to it, you'll

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:07.700 align:middle line:84%
see a room with eight foot
ceilings, just by side,

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:08.840 align:middle line:90%
so you got a room.

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And all the temples had these
very, very high structures

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:15.780 align:middle line:84%
moving around so that
very big beings can

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:18.580 align:middle line:84%
walk through those things
without being influenced

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:22.298 align:middle line:84%
by them and having very special
places for them to go to.

00:42:22.298 --> 00:42:28.310 align:middle line:90%


00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Here you see an
ordinary person here

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:38.550 align:middle line:84%
and a 55-foot-tall one sitting
beside each other here.

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:40.210 align:middle line:84%
This is the king and
this is the queen.

00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:42.000 align:middle line:84%
But what archaeologists
say is, well,

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.479 align:middle line:84%
that's because the male's more
important is why they did that.

00:42:47.479 --> 00:42:49.270 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, it has
nothing to do with that.

00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:51.800 align:middle line:84%
They're talking about
levels of awareness here.

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:55.490 align:middle line:84%
They're not talking about
who is more important.

00:42:55.490 --> 00:43:02.930 align:middle line:90%


00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And this, by the
way, is this thing

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:11.550 align:middle line:84%
on the eve theory,
where biologists

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:16.010 align:middle line:84%
have traced using the DNA, the
overlapping patterns of all

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:20.230 align:middle line:84%
the various races in the
world, all the way back

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:24.460 align:middle line:84%
to a single person in this
very specific valley that

00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:29.590 align:middle line:84%
is talked about in the Sumerian
records as where we all

00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:31.340 align:middle line:90%
started.

00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And the time that they give
is about 200,000 years ago.

00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And according to
according to Sitchin, it

00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:45.700 align:middle line:90%
was 250,000 years ago.

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:47.370 align:middle line:90%
He's guessing.

00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:52.100 align:middle line:84%
According to the Melchizedek,
it was 200,207 years ago,

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:55.640 align:middle line:84%
to be specific, when
that took place.

00:43:55.640 --> 00:44:00.000 align:middle line:10%
And even the timing
is extremely accurate.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.480 align:middle line:10%
And this is Tiya.

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:04.710 align:middle line:10%
That's what she looks like.

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:08.680 align:middle line:10%
That's a statue that was made
of her when she was in Egypt.

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:12.270 align:middle line:84%
But she looks young
like that all the time.

00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:15.550 align:middle line:90%
She never ages at all.

00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:20.500 align:middle line:84%
So she's an ancient,
ancient person.

00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:22.860 align:middle line:84%
So he or she was walking down
the street you were just,

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:24.025 align:middle line:90%
how are you going to know?

00:44:24.025 --> 00:44:25.050 align:middle line:90%
You won't know.

00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:25.850 align:middle line:90%
You'd never know.

00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:33.660 align:middle line:90%


00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:39.620 align:middle line:10%
This is Saqqara, which is where
the Egyptian archaeologists say

00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:41.570 align:middle line:10%
that it all began.

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:44.990 align:middle line:84%
They say that before
Saqqara, there was nothing--

00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:47.870 align:middle line:90%
absolutely nothing.

00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:50.040 align:middle line:90%
It all began here.

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And Saqqara is an
incredible place.

00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:54.320 align:middle line:84%
It's really big,
and there's rooms

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:57.150 align:middle line:84%
that are 200 feet under the
ground and all kinds of things.

00:44:57.150 --> 00:45:00.650 align:middle line:84%
It's an immense complex that
stretches for miles around,

00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:03.220 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:05.060 align:middle line:84%
This being the
primary center, this

00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:06.760 align:middle line:84%
is the first pyramid
built in Egypt,

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:08.100 align:middle line:90%
according to archaeologists.

00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:10.960 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the Great Pyramid
was already sitting there

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:12.755 align:middle line:90%
before that ever started.

00:45:12.755 --> 00:45:16.930 align:middle line:90%


00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:19.120 align:middle line:90%
But I tell you this is not it.

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And eventually they
will prove this.

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:28.190 align:middle line:84%
This is the writing that
just came out of nowhere.

00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:31.000 align:middle line:90%
This is a better one over here.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.810 align:middle line:84%
It's very perfect, clean,
straight, to the point,

00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:40.550 align:middle line:84%
clear writing that first
came out at Saqqara

00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:46.840 align:middle line:84%
and then very soon got more
and more complex and muddled

00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:49.907 align:middle line:84%
and not as clear,
and kept getting

00:45:49.907 --> 00:45:52.240 align:middle line:84%
worse and worse and worse and
worse and worse and worse.

00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:55.225 align:middle line:84%
In no time, the Egyptian
thing collapsed.

00:45:55.225 --> 00:45:58.070 align:middle line:90%


00:45:58.070 --> 00:45:59.648 align:middle line:90%
It had degenerated greatly.

00:45:59.648 --> 00:46:03.510 align:middle line:90%


00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:05.407 align:middle line:84%
This little thing
here is a rod, which

00:46:05.407 --> 00:46:06.490 align:middle line:90%
we're going to talk about.

00:46:06.490 --> 00:46:09.470 align:middle line:84%
It has a rod with a
tuning fork on the bottom.

00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And it has a 44-degree angle
at the top, which you're

00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:14.776 align:middle line:84%
going to see that they were
put back at this chakra,

00:46:14.776 --> 00:46:16.650 align:middle line:84%
strike the rod, and they
had this other thing

00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:18.860 align:middle line:84%
that they could tune the
rod with, and get exactly

00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:22.110 align:middle line:84%
that they could turn and
tune the sound going down

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:26.710 align:middle line:84%
the spine just exactly and get
exactly the frequency moving

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:28.970 align:middle line:84%
through them to tune
them perfectly along

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:31.166 align:middle line:84%
with sexual energy
that they were using.

00:46:31.166 --> 00:46:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And at the moment
of orgasm, they

00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:34.650 align:middle line:84%
would direct the
flow in such a way

00:46:34.650 --> 00:46:37.150 align:middle line:84%
that they could put
themselves directly

00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:40.749 align:middle line:84%
into a very specific
universe, though it

00:46:40.749 --> 00:46:42.040 align:middle line:90%
was only part of what they did.

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:42.930 align:middle line:90%
And these were the tools.

00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:44.096 align:middle line:90%
They not only used this one.

00:46:44.096 --> 00:46:46.500 align:middle line:84%
But they used this
one and this one.

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:48.070 align:middle line:84%
This was the egg
of metamorphosis.

00:46:48.070 --> 00:46:50.620 align:middle line:84%
These are all talking
about resurrection here.

00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:54.510 align:middle line:84%
This is the key
of life, the ankh,

00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:58.480 align:middle line:84%
which is the secret to how they
directed the flow of energy

00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:00.430 align:middle line:84%
so that they would
become immortal.

00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:04.276 align:middle line:84%
And I'll actually tell you
exactly how to do that in here,

00:47:04.276 --> 00:47:05.650 align:middle line:84%
though I'm not
going to teach it.

00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:07.210 align:middle line:90%
But I will tell you the key.

00:47:07.210 --> 00:47:10.290 align:middle line:84%
You can get the rest of it
from your higher aspect.

00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And this-- I don't
quite understand

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:15.720 align:middle line:90%
how they used that one there.

00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:18.330 align:middle line:84%
This one here is an
interesting symbol.

00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:20.400 align:middle line:84%
That triangle with the
triangle in the middle

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:22.575 align:middle line:84%
is hieroglyphics
for the star Sirius.

00:47:22.575 --> 00:47:25.290 align:middle line:90%


00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:29.242 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you see that one,
they're talking about Sirius.

00:47:29.242 --> 00:47:32.377 align:middle line:84%
You see it down here
again over here.

00:47:32.377 --> 00:47:35.696 align:middle line:84%
>>Is the triangle at the bottom
[INAUDIBLE] little one inside?

00:47:35.696 --> 00:47:36.496 align:middle line:90%
>>This one?

00:47:36.496 --> 00:47:37.230 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:39.146 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, it had a little
triangle inside of it.

00:47:39.146 --> 00:47:40.041 align:middle line:90%
>>At the bottom.

00:47:40.041 --> 00:47:41.290 align:middle line:90%
>>Where are you talking about?

00:47:41.290 --> 00:47:42.290 align:middle line:90%
>>Inside the pyramid.

00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:43.660 align:middle line:90%
It's at the bottom of the chart.

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>>This one?

00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:44.940 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, there's a
triangle and then

00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:47.250 align:middle line:90%
there's a little one inside.

00:47:47.250 --> 00:47:48.913 align:middle line:84%
Oh, is there a little one
inside the little one?

00:47:48.913 --> 00:47:49.720 align:middle line:90%
>>No, no--

00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:49.790 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:50.590 align:middle line:90%
>>No no.

00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:51.650 align:middle line:90%
>>--it wasn't inside.

00:47:51.650 --> 00:47:53.025 align:middle line:84%
No, it's just this
one down here.

00:47:53.025 --> 00:47:54.850 align:middle line:84%
It's representing
Sirius A and Sirius B.

00:47:54.850 --> 00:47:57.790 align:middle line:84%
>>Coming off the chair,
is that a golden mean

00:47:57.790 --> 00:47:59.260 align:middle line:90%
or a Fibonacci spiral?

00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:00.750 align:middle line:90%
>>This?

00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:03.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's neither a
golden mean, nor Fibonacci.

00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:06.240 align:middle line:90%
And I can't remember all that.

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:11.370 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with the crown
of upper or lower Egypt.

00:48:11.370 --> 00:48:12.740 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember.

00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:16.568 align:middle line:84%
But I don't remember
what that is about.

00:48:16.568 --> 00:48:22.940 align:middle line:90%


00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:25.610 align:middle line:84%
This is what's going to destroy
that history that they're

00:48:25.610 --> 00:48:35.700 align:middle line:84%
saying about-- you
see, the Egyptians

00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:42.120 align:middle line:84%
tell you that it all started
about 6,000 years ago--

00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:46.830 align:middle line:84%
a little less than
that-- in Saqqara.

00:48:46.830 --> 00:48:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And if you present them with
information of something that's

00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:54.170 align:middle line:84%
older than 6,000 years, they'll
just walk away from you.

00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:57.030 align:middle line:84%
They won't to talk to you,
refuse to talk to them.

00:48:57.030 --> 00:49:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And so they can't
contradict the Quran.

00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And almost all the
Egyptian archeologists--

00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:04.260 align:middle line:84%
all the archaeologists
in the world

00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:07.070 align:middle line:84%
are all Egyptian-- there's
only a few-- and the ones that

00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:11.090 align:middle line:84%
aren't, they're not
going to get access

00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:13.940 align:middle line:84%
to Egypt if they start saying
things are older than that.

00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:16.034 align:middle line:90%
You just can't buck it.

00:49:16.034 --> 00:49:17.325 align:middle line:90%
It's just like you can't do it.

00:49:17.325 --> 00:49:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And what they've
done-- there are

00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:24.540 align:middle line:84%
pyramids that are much
older than 6,000 years old,

00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:26.380 align:middle line:84%
but they won't let you
even get near them.

00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:29.050 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they've placed
military installations

00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:32.630 align:middle line:84%
around all of them--
these big high fences

00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:34.520 align:middle line:90%
and machine guns and everything.

00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:37.230 align:middle line:84%
They will not let you
even get near them.

00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And then they tell you all
they are is just nothing.

00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:40.846 align:middle line:84%
They're just mud
mastabas-- that's

00:49:40.846 --> 00:49:42.900 align:middle line:84%
what they call it--
made out of adobe,

00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:45.850 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing there,
not even worth looking at.

00:49:45.850 --> 00:49:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And you won't even find
any photographs of them,

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:48.860 align:middle line:90%
hardly at all.

00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:50.940 align:middle line:90%
You can't get anything on them.

00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And anytime you try to get
any information on them,

00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:55.750 align:middle line:84%
they just, oh,
they're not important.

00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:58.220 align:middle line:90%
It was before it all began.

00:49:58.220 --> 00:50:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I went and said,
let me just see one.

00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:02.122 align:middle line:90%
No, you can't see one.

00:50:02.122 --> 00:50:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me just
walk up near one.

00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:05.580 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well, OK, maybe we'll
let you walk near one.

00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:09.636 align:middle line:84%
They wanted me to give them
$7,000 just to get near one.

00:50:09.636 --> 00:50:14.014 align:middle line:84%
You know, this kind of stuff--
no pictures, nothing like that.

00:50:14.014 --> 00:50:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And I kept bribing people
and everything else.

00:50:15.930 --> 00:50:17.770 align:middle line:84%
I finally got them to
take me to this one.

00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:21.412 align:middle line:84%
This was the only one that isn't
on a military installation.

00:50:21.412 --> 00:50:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is
because there was

00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:24.870 align:middle line:84%
little villages that
were all around it,

00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:26.280 align:middle line:90%
and they couldn't do it.

00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And so you've got to go
through people's backyards

00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:30.000 align:middle line:90%
to get this thing.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.640 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is incredible.

00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And I finally, after a
week of talking to people,

00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:39.360 align:middle line:84%
begging, and paying people off--
I mean, I lost a lot of money

00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:40.360 align:middle line:90%
on this one to give you.

00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:46.180 align:middle line:84%
It was an expensive thing--
I finally got there.

00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:48.115 align:middle line:84%
And they tell you that
there's nothing to it.

00:50:48.115 --> 00:50:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is
because there's

00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:51.540 align:middle line:84%
little villages that
were all around it,

00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:52.960 align:middle line:90%
and they couldn't do it.

00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And so you've got to go
through people's back yards

00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:56.670 align:middle line:90%
to get to this thing.

00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:58.790 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is incredible.

00:50:58.790 --> 00:51:02.830 align:middle line:84%
But I finally got
there, and they tell you

00:51:02.830 --> 00:51:04.085 align:middle line:90%
that there's nothing to it.

00:51:04.085 --> 00:51:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And so they bring you up on
top of this place where it is.

00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:11.887 align:middle line:84%
And I look around, and instead
of just being mud mastabas,

00:51:11.887 --> 00:51:13.470 align:middle line:84%
these are old, old,
old, old, and they

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:15.400 align:middle line:90%
don't take care of them.

00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:16.905 align:middle line:90%
They want them to fall down.

00:51:16.905 --> 00:51:20.770 align:middle line:90%


00:51:20.770 --> 00:51:24.370 align:middle line:84%
The whole things were covered
with these huge granite blocks.

00:51:24.370 --> 00:51:26.370 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was real pyramids.

00:51:26.370 --> 00:51:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And you look around,
and for 10 miles around

00:51:30.490 --> 00:51:34.852 align:middle line:84%
this complex are
pyramids everywhere.

00:51:34.852 --> 00:51:39.190 align:middle line:84%
It's just totally
a forgotten place.

00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And there's a ramp
that goes down

00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:45.470 align:middle line:84%
this thing, a big huge ramp
going several hundred feet down

00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:48.510 align:middle line:90%
into the Nile.

00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:49.651 align:middle line:90%
A pyramid is a water pump.

00:51:49.651 --> 00:51:50.900 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if you know this.

00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:52.899 align:middle line:84%
It's a pump that will
pump huge amounts of water

00:51:52.899 --> 00:51:55.310 align:middle line:90%
without any moving parts in it.

00:51:55.310 --> 00:51:58.710 align:middle line:84%
They've been able to reproduce
these in the United States.

00:51:58.710 --> 00:52:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And this one's
still functioning.

00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:04.570 align:middle line:84%
It's 207 feet above
the Nile, and the baby

00:52:04.570 --> 00:52:05.670 align:middle line:90%
fills up with water.

00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:09.704 align:middle line:84%
They kind of pump that out
to get in there every time.

00:52:09.704 --> 00:52:11.840 align:middle line:84%
They pump all the water
out to go inside of it.

00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:14.720 align:middle line:84%
It'll fill right back
up with water again.

00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And the whole interior is
nothing but geometrical images

00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:23.290 align:middle line:90%
all over the walls.

00:52:23.290 --> 00:52:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, as you're about to
see, geometrical images

00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:30.250 align:middle line:84%
is of a higher level of
writing than heiroglyphics--

00:52:30.250 --> 00:52:31.050 align:middle line:90%
much higher.

00:52:31.050 --> 00:52:33.730 align:middle line:90%


00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Only they just say, oh,
this is geometrical images.

00:52:36.490 --> 00:52:38.100 align:middle line:90%
They don't mean anything.

00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:39.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they just
really play it down.

00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:42.450 align:middle line:84%
They don't want you to even
say that it's anything.

00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:47.960 align:middle line:84%
But while I was
there, there had been

00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:54.120 align:middle line:84%
a team of approximately
30 American linguistics

00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:59.900 align:middle line:84%
experts who had finally got
permission to get in there.

00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And I happened to
be on the airplane

00:53:01.570 --> 00:53:02.814 align:middle line:90%
with one of them riding back.

00:53:02.814 --> 00:53:05.480 align:middle line:90%


00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:08.240 align:middle line:90%
And he was so excited.

00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:12.000 align:middle line:84%
They felt that they had finally
cracked the code of language.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.120 align:middle line:84%
They believed this pyramid held
the key to all the languages

00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:17.220 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And knowing what
I know, especially

00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:22.700 align:middle line:84%
with what you're about
to see here real soon,

00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:24.188 align:middle line:90%
they very well may be correct.

00:53:24.188 --> 00:53:24.988 align:middle line:90%
>>Where was that?

00:53:24.988 --> 00:53:27.404 align:middle line:90%


00:53:27.404 --> 00:53:28.820 align:middle line:84%
>>The name of it,
although I don't

00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:37.570 align:middle line:84%
know how to write it in Arabic,
is called [INAUDIBLE] It's

00:53:37.570 --> 00:53:38.480 align:middle line:90%
not even a village.

00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:40.385 align:middle line:90%
It's just a bunch of houses.

00:53:40.385 --> 00:53:42.460 align:middle line:84%
It probably does have
some kind of name.

00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:46.630 align:middle line:84%
It's about 30 miles
north of Saqqara.

00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:50.630 align:middle line:90%


00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And someday this place-- now,
see if they tie this one down,

00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:59.410 align:middle line:84%
this pyramid is about 500 or
600 years older than Saqqara.

00:53:59.410 --> 00:54:02.020 align:middle line:90%


00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:05.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, if they establish that
this was the beginning place,

00:54:05.850 --> 00:54:11.630 align:middle line:84%
then you find that
puts Egypt at exactly

00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:14.253 align:middle line:90%
the same age as Sumeria.

00:54:14.253 --> 00:54:18.470 align:middle line:90%


00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:20.970 align:middle line:84%
These are some of the kinds of
things that they found there,

00:54:20.970 --> 00:54:25.480 align:middle line:84%
which are these six-petal little
flower of light pattern things

00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:30.346 align:middle line:84%
that came out of that era--
these sharp, pointed things.

00:54:30.346 --> 00:54:36.090 align:middle line:90%


00:54:36.090 --> 00:54:40.860 align:middle line:10%
This is Osiris here,
with this green skin.

00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:44.180 align:middle line:10%
And he's holding the
tools of resurrection.

00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:48.100 align:middle line:10%
You see the rod with the
45 degree little rod.

00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:51.450 align:middle line:84%
There's a flail on the
hook, and the little tuning

00:54:51.450 --> 00:54:55.540 align:middle line:84%
fork down at the
bottom down here.

00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:56.660 align:middle line:10%
This is Anubis.

00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:59.624 align:middle line:10%


00:54:59.624 --> 00:55:02.730 align:middle line:10%
He represents the star Sirius.

00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:08.470 align:middle line:10%
And again, he is
one of the nefers,

00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:14.570 align:middle line:10%
one of the plan--
you'll understand here

00:55:14.570 --> 00:55:15.370 align:middle line:10%
in a little bit.

00:55:15.370 --> 00:55:19.580 align:middle line:84%
But he's one of the keys to
how to move in the great void

00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:27.115 align:middle line:90%
to create immortality.

00:55:27.115 --> 00:55:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know why I
put that slide there.

00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Oh, at this point this
is where I usually

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:39.350 align:middle line:84%
talk about her being
the mommy of Nefertiti.

00:55:39.350 --> 00:55:45.080 align:middle line:84%
This is Akhenaten and Nefertiti
and one of their daughters.

00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's not drawn
to perfect scale.

00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:51.190 align:middle line:84%
You'll see the perfect
scale in just a moment.

00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:52.400 align:middle line:90%
Akhenaten had a purpose.

00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:55.690 align:middle line:84%
He had a few purposes to
come out into the world.

00:55:55.690 --> 00:55:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And one of them was to
change the religions of all

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.547 align:middle line:84%
these cults that had
happened all over there

00:56:00.547 --> 00:56:02.130 align:middle line:84%
to a single religion,
so that they can

00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:04.720 align:middle line:90%
know that there's only one god.

00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And so Akhenaten took
power, and he took power

00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:14.150 align:middle line:84%
under very extraordinary
circumstances.

00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:16.790 align:middle line:84%
There was actually two kings
in Egypt and two cities.

00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:20.230 align:middle line:84%
They built him a brand new
city called Tel el Amarna.

00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:23.770 align:middle line:10%
And there's a stela there that
is in the middle of the city.

00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:27.770 align:middle line:10%
And if you took a
satellite view of Egypt,

00:56:27.770 --> 00:56:31.990 align:middle line:10%
it is in the precise, absolute,
dead center of the country.

00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:34.220 align:middle line:84%
We have no idea how
they got so accurate.

00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:37.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's right down
to the-- it's perfect.

00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And they marked the center,
and they put the city right

00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:41.740 align:middle line:90%
around that.

00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:44.720 align:middle line:84%
The city was made of
only white stones.

00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:48.632 align:middle line:84%
And they waited until
the city was built,

00:56:48.632 --> 00:56:50.090 align:middle line:84%
and then when it
was finally built,

00:56:50.090 --> 00:56:53.200 align:middle line:84%
then Akhenaten and Nefertiti
left Thebes and came over.

00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And the country
was actually ruled

00:56:54.690 --> 00:56:59.140 align:middle line:84%
from two cities and two kings
simultaneously for a while.

00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:00.790 align:middle line:90%
That had never happened before.

00:57:00.790 --> 00:57:02.684 align:middle line:84%
And then they finally
let the transition go,

00:57:02.684 --> 00:57:04.100 align:middle line:84%
because this was
a real transition

00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:07.960 align:middle line:90%
period to a new way of being.

00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And they gave the
image of the sun--

00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:15.720 align:middle line:84%
the solar disk-- as
the image of God.

00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, it isn't that he knew
that the sun was not God,

00:57:19.570 --> 00:57:22.810 align:middle line:84%
but they were dealing with
a people that used statues.

00:57:22.810 --> 00:57:24.070 align:middle line:90%
They worshipped statues.

00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:26.140 align:middle line:90%
They had to worship something.

00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And he was trying to make
a transition from there,

00:57:30.730 --> 00:57:32.380 align:middle line:84%
and so when you
make transitions,

00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:34.760 align:middle line:90%
you sometimes make compromises.

00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:37.180 align:middle line:84%
And so he picked the
image of the sun,

00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:38.420 align:middle line:90%
which is a very good image.

00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:41.930 align:middle line:84%
If you've got to pick something,
at least that's the light.

00:57:41.930 --> 00:57:43.650 align:middle line:84%
It's all the life,
and everything

00:57:43.650 --> 00:57:46.829 align:middle line:84%
that comes from the
sun comes to us here.

00:57:46.829 --> 00:57:48.620 align:middle line:84%
The geometry of the
sphere and everything--

00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:50.826 align:middle line:90%
there's a lot of reasons why.

00:57:50.826 --> 00:57:53.150 align:middle line:84%
Prana-- from a third
dimensional point of view, prana

00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:54.842 align:middle line:90%
comes from the Sun also.

00:57:54.842 --> 00:57:56.800 align:middle line:84%
Though, from fourth
dimensional points of view,

00:57:56.800 --> 00:58:00.120 align:middle line:90%
prana's anywhere and everywhere.

00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And you see the rays
coming from the sun,

00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:06.970 align:middle line:84%
holding the ankh to the
nose, to the breath,

00:58:06.970 --> 00:58:09.130 align:middle line:84%
showing that eternal
life comes from the prana

00:58:09.130 --> 00:58:11.970 align:middle line:90%
and from the sun.

00:58:11.970 --> 00:58:16.060 align:middle line:84%
It's not a perfect religion that
they were given here, for sure,

00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:19.710 align:middle line:84%
but it was much, much better
than what they had before.

00:58:19.710 --> 00:58:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And this, by the way, is
the lotus flower, which

00:58:23.890 --> 00:58:27.249 align:middle line:90%
was the symbol for Atlantis.

00:58:27.249 --> 00:58:28.790 align:middle line:84%
It was the Naacal
mystery school that

00:58:28.790 --> 00:58:31.740 align:middle line:90%
brought the lotus to India.

00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:34.150 align:middle line:84%
It's written in India
that they did that.

00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And it says the Naacal
mystery school did it.

00:58:36.530 --> 00:58:38.690 align:middle line:90%
It says right in there.

00:58:38.690 --> 00:58:41.810 align:middle line:84%
There's several, several
writings about the Naacals

00:58:41.810 --> 00:58:45.440 align:middle line:84%
that were there even before
Buddha, long before Buddha.

00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:48.890 align:middle line:84%
But here you see them out
of the vase and dying,

00:58:48.890 --> 00:58:53.210 align:middle line:84%
because Atlantis
was dead and dying.

00:58:53.210 --> 00:58:56.680 align:middle line:90%


00:58:56.680 --> 00:59:00.070 align:middle line:84%
This is the actual stela
that that came from.

00:59:00.070 --> 00:59:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And now what you're
going to be seeing

00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:05.790 align:middle line:84%
is the actual height
differences true.

00:59:05.790 --> 00:59:06.590 align:middle line:90%
Now, look at him.

00:59:06.590 --> 00:59:09.410 align:middle line:84%
Look at this shape, this long
skinny neck, little tiny waist,

00:59:09.410 --> 00:59:10.210 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:59:10.210 --> 00:59:12.570 align:middle line:84%
What you're looking at
is a very close image

00:59:12.570 --> 00:59:14.446 align:middle line:90%
of what he really looked like.

00:59:14.446 --> 00:59:17.930 align:middle line:90%


00:59:17.930 --> 00:59:19.460 align:middle line:90%
And I'll show you one here now.

00:59:19.460 --> 00:59:22.670 align:middle line:90%


00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:28.450 align:middle line:84%
When Akhenaten took over, he
said, first of all, number one,

00:59:28.450 --> 00:59:30.130 align:middle line:90%
we have to be truthful.

00:59:30.130 --> 00:59:34.800 align:middle line:84%
We can't hide anymore, because
there was a lot of conspiracy

00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:36.740 align:middle line:84%
and the kind of
stuff that's going

00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:37.950 align:middle line:90%
on now-- a lot of that stuff.

00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:40.033 align:middle line:84%
It would be like a president
coming in and saying,

00:59:40.033 --> 00:59:41.577 align:middle line:90%
OK, all this stuff.

00:59:41.577 --> 00:59:43.410 align:middle line:84%
We're going to end all
this stuff right now.

00:59:43.410 --> 00:59:45.470 align:middle line:90%
We are going to really end it.

00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And Maat became the primary
symbol of the 18th dynasty.

00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:53.370 align:middle line:10%
Maat is the one the wings
with a feather over her.

00:59:53.370 --> 00:59:59.470 align:middle line:10%
And Maat means truth-- the
essence of truthfulness.

00:59:59.470 --> 01:00:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And so he changed all
kinds of ceremonies.

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:06.810 align:middle line:90%
I mean, everything got changed.

01:00:06.810 --> 01:00:09.970 align:middle line:84%
He went around and
re-geomanced all the temples.

01:00:09.970 --> 01:00:13.130 align:middle line:84%
They really got pissed
at him for doing that.

01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:18.670 align:middle line:84%
Where you start seeing he says,
draw, paint, make the statues

01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:20.230 align:middle line:90%
just like you see it.

01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:23.120 align:middle line:84%
Don't lie, because
to them, when you

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:28.910 align:middle line:84%
start making these people who
are standing like this and all

01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:32.660 align:middle line:84%
these distorted things like
that, that's a lie, because you

01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:35.040 align:middle line:90%
didn't draw it like you saw it.

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:38.380 align:middle line:84%
So he says, all your art has
to be just like a photograph,

01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:40.860 align:middle line:84%
well, because he knew
about photographs.

01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:44.570 align:middle line:84%
But just like what you
see, that's how you do it.

01:00:44.570 --> 01:00:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And so you began to see
the art of the 18th dynasty

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:50.210 align:middle line:90%
looks rather modern.

01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:52.670 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't look like anything
like you ever saw before.

01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Just suddenly this whole
new art form came up,

01:00:55.650 --> 01:01:00.210 align:middle line:84%
which included the statues
were to made just exactly

01:01:00.210 --> 01:01:02.450 align:middle line:90%
like the person would see.

01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:04.630 align:middle line:90%
And here is Akhenaten.

01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:05.812 align:middle line:90%
This is in the Cairo Museum.

01:01:05.812 --> 01:01:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And according to
Thoth, you are now

01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:10.200 align:middle line:84%
looking at exactly
what he looks like.

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:11.706 align:middle line:84%
And this thing, to
the top up here,

01:01:11.706 --> 01:01:15.940 align:middle line:90%
is almost 15 something feet.

01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:19.180 align:middle line:84%
He was 14 and 1/2 feet
tall from his head

01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:20.700 align:middle line:90%
to the top of his body.

01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And you're looking exactly at
the body, this high waist way

01:01:24.030 --> 01:01:28.910 align:middle line:84%
up here, coming out with
these long, sloping things,

01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:31.890 align:middle line:84%
his knees are much lower,
and his skinny little legs

01:01:31.890 --> 01:01:33.230 align:middle line:90%
at the bottom.

01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And he had two
hearts in his body,

01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:37.780 align:middle line:90%
because Sirius has two suns.

01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:45.550 align:middle line:90%
Most systems are polar suns.

01:01:45.550 --> 01:01:48.620 align:middle line:84%
You reflect what's going on in
your sun more than you know.

01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:49.684 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you.

01:01:49.684 --> 01:01:52.100 align:middle line:84%
What's happening in the internal
processes and things that

01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:55.030 align:middle line:84%
are going on in there, and
the nature of your system

01:01:55.030 --> 01:01:59.520 align:middle line:84%
that you're in, your
bodies reflect this.

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:01.360 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, where were we?

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:04.820 align:middle line:90%


01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:08.980 align:middle line:84%
So this is what he
actually looked like.

01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:12.464 align:middle line:84%
And this is Nefertiti,
which was found when--

01:02:12.464 --> 01:02:13.880 align:middle line:84%
I'll explain in
just a moment here

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:19.960 align:middle line:84%
what happened to-- well might
as well tell you now, I guess.

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:22.960 align:middle line:90%
No, not the right moment.

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:24.960 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, this is Nefertiti.

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:29.580 align:middle line:84%
She was found-- this bust of
her was found in Tel el Amarna.

01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:31.170 align:middle line:84%
They just totally
destroyed the city.

01:02:31.170 --> 01:02:34.300 align:middle line:84%
They removed every
rock after he was gone.

01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:36.470 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want the
world to ever know

01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:39.110 align:middle line:90%
that Akhenaten ever existed.

01:02:39.110 --> 01:02:44.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they went around,
and they combed everything

01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:46.010 align:middle line:84%
and destroyed
everything they could.

01:02:46.010 --> 01:02:49.180 align:middle line:84%
They completely removed an
entire city stone by stone

01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:50.820 align:middle line:90%
and spread it to the world.

01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:53.560 align:middle line:84%
They went around to all the
murals throughout all of Egypt

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:56.360 align:middle line:84%
and erased any
mention of Akhenaten,

01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:02.970 align:middle line:84%
because-- she's asking why--
because he was considered

01:03:02.970 --> 01:03:05.530 align:middle line:84%
the great heretic,
because he was the one

01:03:05.530 --> 01:03:08.900 align:middle line:84%
that destroyed their
beloved religion.

01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:12.050 align:middle line:90%
And so they all hated him.

01:03:12.050 --> 01:03:16.870 align:middle line:84%
You see the
priesthood hated him,

01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:18.930 align:middle line:84%
because the priesthood
were all the millionaires

01:03:18.930 --> 01:03:21.150 align:middle line:90%
and the powerful people.

01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you don't
need them anymore.

01:03:24.190 --> 01:03:25.060 align:middle line:90%
God is within you.

01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:28.240 align:middle line:90%


01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:31.849 align:middle line:90%
And the priesthood, what?

01:03:31.849 --> 01:03:33.890 align:middle line:84%
I won't be able to drive
my gold chariot anymore.

01:03:33.890 --> 01:03:38.010 align:middle line:90%


01:03:38.010 --> 01:03:39.895 align:middle line:84%
And they did not
like to hear that.

01:03:39.895 --> 01:03:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And then the military was
the most powerful military

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:43.260 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:45.150 align:middle line:84%
They were ready to just
take over the planet,

01:03:45.150 --> 01:03:47.370 align:middle line:90%
and they could.

01:03:47.370 --> 01:03:48.890 align:middle line:90%
They were ready.

01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:51.110 align:middle line:90%
They were incredible.

01:03:51.110 --> 01:03:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And Akhenaten was a pacifist
and said, no, you can't do that,

01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:01.040 align:middle line:84%
and made them all come back
onto their shore, and said,

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:03.050 align:middle line:90%
you can't do that.

01:04:03.050 --> 01:04:05.360 align:middle line:84%
If we're attacked, OK,
but other than that,

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:07.830 align:middle line:90%
only for defense only.

01:04:07.830 --> 01:04:09.610 align:middle line:84%
But he was also a
very good politician.

01:04:09.610 --> 01:04:13.920 align:middle line:84%
So he put a lot of the military
people in political power

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:16.160 align:middle line:90%
places to appease them.

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:18.310 align:middle line:84%
But basically, they
did not like him,

01:04:18.310 --> 01:04:22.771 align:middle line:84%
because they wanted to go
out there and cause hell.

01:04:22.771 --> 01:04:24.620 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't let them do it.

01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And then the people
didn't like him,

01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:30.702 align:middle line:84%
because they are liked
their little religions,

01:04:30.702 --> 01:04:33.160 align:middle line:84%
and they were really into it,
and they really believed them

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:34.050 align:middle line:90%
with their whole hearts.

01:04:34.050 --> 01:04:36.133 align:middle line:84%
Even though they were going
in the wrong direction

01:04:36.133 --> 01:04:39.630 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't true, they
believed it was true.

01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:42.810 align:middle line:84%
They didn't really
like this new religion

01:04:42.810 --> 01:04:44.615 align:middle line:84%
that everybody was
supposed to follow.

01:04:44.615 --> 01:04:47.390 align:middle line:84%
It'd be like George
Bush coming in, making

01:04:47.390 --> 01:04:50.630 align:middle line:84%
all our military come back
onto the United States

01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:53.520 align:middle line:84%
and saying, OK, all the
religions are wiped out.

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:57.737 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be
the Bush religion,

01:04:57.737 --> 01:04:58.820 align:middle line:90%
and these kinds of things.

01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:03.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was a great
deal of extreme-- people

01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:06.190 align:middle line:84%
were really, really
uptight over this.

01:05:06.190 --> 01:05:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And the Tat Brotherhood
knew that this

01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:11.400 align:middle line:90%
was going to be incredible.

01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:14.260 align:middle line:90%
But they had to try.

01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And so they destroyed
this whole city.

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:23.209 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you what they
did in just a moment.

01:05:23.209 --> 01:05:24.500 align:middle line:90%
They destroyed this whole city.

01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And this was found
in an underground

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:29.560 align:middle line:84%
that they didn't know
was there, and that's

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:31.850 align:middle line:90%
how this survived that.

01:05:31.850 --> 01:05:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And a few things survived
that were hidden in places.

01:05:35.470 --> 01:05:37.060 align:middle line:84%
So there were a
lot of people that

01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:39.720 align:middle line:84%
really did love
Akhenaten and Nefertiti

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:44.770 align:middle line:84%
and saw the beauty of what
they were trying to do.

01:05:44.770 --> 01:05:46.770 align:middle line:84%
But it was a relatively
small group compared

01:05:46.770 --> 01:05:48.160 align:middle line:90%
to the rest of the country.

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:49.990 align:middle line:84%
By the way,
underneath this hat--

01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:52.170 align:middle line:84%
she's always considered
this very beautiful person,

01:05:52.170 --> 01:05:52.970 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

01:05:52.970 --> 01:05:55.360 align:middle line:84%
She is-- she doesn't
have a normal skull.

01:05:55.360 --> 01:06:01.470 align:middle line:84%
She has a much higher skull
here, which you can now see.

01:06:01.470 --> 01:06:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And she's not wearing
clothes-- that

01:06:02.970 --> 01:06:06.160 align:middle line:84%
was the other thing-- because
they felt that clothes is not

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:07.750 align:middle line:90%
being truthful.

01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And so they didn't wear
clothes, except for ceremonies

01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:12.320 align:middle line:90%
and certain things like that.

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:14.020 align:middle line:84%
But most of the
rest of the time,

01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:18.400 align:middle line:84%
you just didn't wear
clothes to just be

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:21.419 align:middle line:90%
open in every conceivable way.

01:06:21.419 --> 01:06:22.960 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot of
things about her,

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:26.377 align:middle line:84%
you notice these huge
ears, long, skinny neck,

01:06:26.377 --> 01:06:28.960 align:middle line:84%
and if you can see, her waist
is right underneath her breasts.

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:30.610 align:middle line:84%
It's not down where
[INAUDIBLE] is.

01:06:30.610 --> 01:06:32.370 align:middle line:84%
It's just right
underneath there.

01:06:32.370 --> 01:06:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And this kind of
a pot belly thing

01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:39.540 align:middle line:90%
is just part of their nature.

01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:40.720 align:middle line:90%
This is two of the sisters.

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:42.512 align:middle line:84%
This is a little
detail of something.

01:06:42.512 --> 01:06:47.620 align:middle line:84%
What you're looking at is
just like an actual, just what

01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:49.120 align:middle line:84%
the artist was
seeing here-- again,

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:52.370 align:middle line:84%
this really high waist,
these little tiny legs

01:06:52.370 --> 01:06:56.970 align:middle line:84%
underneath there, these huge
skulls and this long neck.

01:06:56.970 --> 01:06:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Nefertiti's skull
was not anything

01:06:58.690 --> 01:07:03.200 align:middle line:84%
as big as Akhenaten's
or the daughters.

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:06.340 align:middle line:84%
This is an actual one of one
of the older adult daughters

01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:08.930 align:middle line:90%
when she grew up here.

01:07:08.930 --> 01:07:10.745 align:middle line:90%
And you can't see the angle.

01:07:10.745 --> 01:07:12.890 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you the
angle in just a moment.

01:07:12.890 --> 01:07:15.285 align:middle line:90%
But that skull is really big.

01:07:15.285 --> 01:07:18.010 align:middle line:90%
It really goes back there.

01:07:18.010 --> 01:07:20.340 align:middle line:90%
And these ears are enormous.

01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:23.240 align:middle line:84%
Sound and sound
vibration and voice sound

01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:26.870 align:middle line:84%
is a real big part
of their lives,

01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:28.560 align:middle line:84%
very much like it is
with the dolphins.

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:33.270 align:middle line:84%
Sound is a very crucial
aspect with them also.

01:07:33.270 --> 01:07:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And so their ears and
their hearing sensitivity

01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:41.086 align:middle line:84%
is way, way, way, way over
what we've got going right now.

01:07:41.086 --> 01:07:46.100 align:middle line:90%


01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:47.190 align:middle line:90%
This is another one.

01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:50.700 align:middle line:84%
You can see how big this
skull is that goes back here

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:54.020 align:middle line:84%
like that, because they
were interpreting reality

01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:58.670 align:middle line:84%
from a totally different way,
and it required more brain mass

01:07:58.670 --> 01:08:00.455 align:middle line:90%
back in there to do this.

01:08:00.455 --> 01:08:04.220 align:middle line:90%


01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:07.848 align:middle line:84%
But the amount of brain
mass is real important.

01:08:07.848 --> 01:08:10.920 align:middle line:90%


01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:17.660 align:middle line:84%
It's like the biggest
brain in the world

01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:23.604 align:middle line:84%
other than dolphins, whales, and
humans, I think is the gorillas

01:08:23.604 --> 01:08:24.479 align:middle line:90%
or whatever they are.

01:08:24.479 --> 01:08:31.220 align:middle line:84%
They have about 750 milligrams,
I think it is, of brain mass.

01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:33.960 align:middle line:84%
It takes approximately
1000 milligrams

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:36.879 align:middle line:90%
before language is developed.

01:08:36.879 --> 01:08:39.170 align:middle line:84%
A little baby when it's
approximately a year and a half

01:08:39.170 --> 01:08:41.750 align:middle line:84%
or two years old, or
somewhere around in there,

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:44.720 align:middle line:84%
that's when their brain
mass reaches 1,000 grams.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:47.000 align:middle line:84%
Grams-- that's what
it is-- 1,000 grams.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's when language
starts happening.

01:08:51.370 --> 01:08:53.880 align:middle line:84%
So what they suspect is
that when a gorilla ever

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:57.270 align:middle line:84%
reaches 1,000 grams, then
it will start talking,

01:08:57.270 --> 01:08:59.428 align:middle line:90%
just like we do.

01:08:59.428 --> 01:09:00.394 align:middle line:90%
Koko?

01:09:00.394 --> 01:09:02.380 align:middle line:90%
Could she talk?

01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:03.187 align:middle line:90%
Sign language.

01:09:03.187 --> 01:09:05.810 align:middle line:90%


01:09:05.810 --> 01:09:12.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, when we're an adult,
we have about 1,500 grams

01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:14.609 align:middle line:90%
average brain.

01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:18.830 align:middle line:84%
The dolphin brain
is 1,850 grams.

01:09:18.830 --> 01:09:21.300 align:middle line:84%
They have a much
bigger brain than us.

01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:31.359 align:middle line:84%
And they reached 1,000 grams
about 30 million years ago.

01:09:31.359 --> 01:09:33.529 align:middle line:84%
They had language 30
million years ago.

01:09:33.529 --> 01:09:38.720 align:middle line:90%


01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:40.930 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, the
dolphins are a little bit

01:09:40.930 --> 01:09:46.189 align:middle line:84%
further along than we are,
in terms of a lot of things.

01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:48.010 align:middle line:84%
They have certain
areas of their brain

01:09:48.010 --> 01:09:50.550 align:middle line:84%
that we don't even know
what the heck they are.

01:09:50.550 --> 01:09:52.310 align:middle line:90%
We don't even know what they do.

01:09:52.310 --> 01:09:54.158 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
they're for or anything.

01:09:54.158 --> 01:09:57.232 align:middle line:84%
>>What does the archaeologist
say about the religion?

01:09:57.232 --> 01:09:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>>They don't know what
to say about this.

01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:01.500 align:middle line:84%
They really don't
have any idea at all.

01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:02.330 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah, they do.

01:10:02.330 --> 01:10:02.860 align:middle line:90%
I know what they--

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:03.620 align:middle line:90%
>>--a disease.

01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:04.578 align:middle line:90%
>>That's what they say.

01:10:04.578 --> 01:10:08.630 align:middle line:84%
They say they're sick, that
they got this disease to cause

01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:10.050 align:middle line:90%
these bodies to be distorted.

01:10:10.050 --> 01:10:11.010 align:middle line:90%
That's why.

01:10:11.010 --> 01:10:13.930 align:middle line:90%
That's what they say.

01:10:13.930 --> 01:10:15.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it was a real big thing.

01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:16.770 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:10:16.770 --> 01:10:18.270 align:middle line:90%
It was a real, real big thing.

01:10:18.270 --> 01:10:20.198 align:middle line:84%
It was a really big--
they were really big.

01:10:20.198 --> 01:10:23.070 align:middle line:90%


01:10:23.070 --> 01:10:28.285 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if somebody 14 foot
came crawling in this room,

01:10:28.285 --> 01:10:30.570 align:middle line:84%
it would definitely
be a big thing to you.

01:10:30.570 --> 01:10:31.656 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you.

01:10:31.656 --> 01:10:32.530 align:middle line:90%
The rest of them too.

01:10:32.530 --> 01:10:34.390 align:middle line:84%

01:11:42.435 --> 01:11:44.060 align:middle line:84%
that was such a
powerful thing that she

01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:45.290 align:middle line:90%

You can see also why their hips
went phew way out like that.

these really wide hips deliver

Anyway, here's another one.

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:55.230 align:middle line:84%
This is King Tut, and
he was only 18 years old

01:13:55.230 --> 01:13:56.030 align:middle line:90%
when he took over.

01:13:56.030 --> 01:13:59.430 align:middle line:84%
He took over directly after
Akhenaten and Nefertiti.

They don't know
where he came from.

He has no lineage.

They don't know where he
showed up or how he came from.

01:14:06.730 --> 01:14:09.590 align:middle line:10%
He wasn't from Akhenaten and
Nefertiti, they don't think.

01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And yet, he's still
got this bigger skull

01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:12.230 align:middle line:90%
and these big ears.

01:14:12.230 --> 01:14:13.720 align:middle line:90%
He's obviously part of it.

He was in telepathic

the very, very end-- this

01:14:23.913 --> 01:14:28.800 align:middle line:84%
is the part you'll
kind of need to know--

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:32.830 align:middle line:84%
the population of Egypt, the
military, and the priesthood

01:14:32.830 --> 01:14:37.180 align:middle line:84%
all got together and said,
let's get rid of this guy.

01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:38.960 align:middle line:84%
But they couldn't
kill him, because you

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:41.840 align:middle line:90%
can't kill an immortal being.

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:43.840 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing you can do.

out at one point.

You can't shoot him.

You can't do anything.

Nothing will work,
because they have

01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:58.040 align:middle line:84%
a field around them
that will just not

You can't do anything.

01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:06.640 align:middle line:84%
So they did something very,
very, very interesting.

01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:10.160 align:middle line:90%
It was really ingenious.

01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:13.610 align:middle line:84%
The actual story goes
that they poisoned him,

01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:16.270 align:middle line:84%
because the people who
were watching it happen

01:15:16.270 --> 01:15:18.600 align:middle line:84%
and who wrote it
down saw him drink

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:21.180 align:middle line:84%
this stuff which they
thought was poison,

01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:22.770 align:middle line:90%
and they saw him fall over.

01:15:22.770 --> 01:15:25.050 align:middle line:90%
And he looked like he was dead.

01:15:25.050 --> 01:15:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And they went there,
and he had no heartbeat.

01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And after I read all the
stuff, I asked Thoth, I said,

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:31.880 align:middle line:90%
what happened?

01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:34.000 align:middle line:90%
He said, well, it's close.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.130 align:middle line:90%
I says, well, what happened?

01:15:36.130 --> 01:15:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you know, they
hired three black Nubians

01:15:41.790 --> 01:15:47.200 align:middle line:84%
who were like magicians, and
they made this substance,

01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:48.160 align:middle line:90%
he says.

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:50.118 align:middle line:84%
The closest thing that
he could described to me

01:15:50.118 --> 01:15:53.290 align:middle line:84%
was what they use in voodoo
where you drink the stuff.

01:15:53.290 --> 01:15:54.730 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't kill you.

01:15:54.730 --> 01:15:57.440 align:middle line:84%
It makes your heartbeat and
everything go down so slow

01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:00.490 align:middle line:90%
that you look like you're dead.

01:16:00.490 --> 01:16:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And so he said what they did is
they had this whole sarcophagus

01:16:05.730 --> 01:16:07.130 align:middle line:90%
created and planned.

01:16:07.130 --> 01:16:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And when he fell over, then the
physician came up and checked

01:16:10.050 --> 01:16:11.520 align:middle line:90%
and says, he's dead.

01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And so everybody
thought he was dead.

01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And they immediately
carried him out

01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:19.050 align:middle line:84%
and put him into the sarcophagus
and put this magical seal--

01:16:19.050 --> 01:16:23.710 align:middle line:84%
whatever that means-- around
the lid and put the lid on.

01:16:23.710 --> 01:16:27.350 align:middle line:90%
And they embalmed him.

01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:28.350 align:middle line:90%
They never did anything.

01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:31.710 align:middle line:84%
They just put him in
there and got rid of him

01:16:31.710 --> 01:16:35.850 align:middle line:84%
and took him
somewhere and hid him.

01:16:35.850 --> 01:16:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And he remained in there for
2,000 years approximately,

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:41.200 align:middle line:84%
until a little bit of
the seal broke free.

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:44.329 align:middle line:84%

out of that body and left.

that were found in Peru.

01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:58.070 align:middle line:90%
I took the wrong angle.

01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:59.600 align:middle line:84%
If you got the
right angle, you'd

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:04.290 align:middle line:84%
see it's the same huge skull and
the same kind of thing, again.

01:18:04.290 --> 01:18:06.480 align:middle line:10%
And this is one of my
teachers-- Kalu Rinpoche.

01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:08.800 align:middle line:10%
I'd like to give you his image.

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:10.810 align:middle line:10%
He's a Tibetan Lama.

01:18:10.810 --> 01:18:14.580 align:middle line:10%
He was one of the teachers that
I really, really love a lot.

01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And if you could see him, he has
a real similar kind of thing.

01:18:17.370 --> 01:18:19.430 align:middle line:84%
His neck is real
long, skinny neck.

01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:20.940 align:middle line:90%
This is a collar.

01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:23.430 align:middle line:84%
His neck this long
skinny neck that comes up

01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:24.640 align:middle line:90%
like this kind of thing.

01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:26.980 align:middle line:84%
But those same skulls have
been found in all three

01:18:26.980 --> 01:18:29.155 align:middle line:90%
of those places.

01:18:29.155 --> 01:18:35.620 align:middle line:84%
OK, I want to tell
you what happened.

01:18:35.620 --> 01:18:37.691 align:middle line:84%
And this is the important
part of all of this.

01:18:37.691 --> 01:18:41.220 align:middle line:90%


01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:42.020 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:46.340 align:middle line:90%


01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:51.970 align:middle line:84%
What Akhenaten's purpose was
first of all, was just to be,

01:18:51.970 --> 01:18:55.430 align:middle line:84%
just show you what
you're going to become.

01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:57.812 align:middle line:84%
And then second of all,
he started the school.

01:18:57.812 --> 01:19:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And the school was called
the Egyptian Mystery School

01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:02.950 align:middle line:90%
of Akhenaten, the Law of One.

01:19:02.950 --> 01:19:08.782 align:middle line:84%
And the school was a school of
immortality, of resurrection.

01:19:08.782 --> 01:19:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And it was only functional
for 17 and 1/2 years

01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:16.340 align:middle line:84%
before they had him
drink this thing.

01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:20.940 align:middle line:84%
So he only had 17 and 1/2
years to complete something

01:19:20.940 --> 01:19:23.100 align:middle line:90%
that he had to do.

01:19:23.100 --> 01:19:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And he did complete
what he needed to do.

01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:30.490 align:middle line:84%
The next phase of this was that
they needed to not just bring

01:19:30.490 --> 01:19:35.060 align:middle line:84%
an actual form of what
we're going to become,

01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:36.640 align:middle line:84%
but they needed to
bring someone out

01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:40.970 align:middle line:84%
on the surface who
was half and half.

01:19:40.970 --> 01:19:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'll explain that
in just a moment.

01:19:43.530 --> 01:19:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And so to do that they had
to get a very special group

01:19:48.610 --> 01:19:51.330 align:middle line:84%
together, and that's what the
purpose of the Egyptian Mystery

01:19:51.330 --> 01:19:52.650 align:middle line:90%
School was.

01:19:52.650 --> 01:19:54.390 align:middle line:90%
And so they began this training.

01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:59.550 align:middle line:84%
They selected from
the people that

01:19:59.550 --> 01:20:01.800 align:middle line:84%
were the followers
of Akhenaten that

01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:05.800 align:middle line:84%
believed in him, people who had
done the 12 years of training

01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:07.696 align:middle line:90%
of the left eye of Horus.

01:20:07.696 --> 01:20:11.850 align:middle line:84%
The left eye of Horus, which is
controlled by the right brain,

01:20:11.850 --> 01:20:14.062 align:middle line:84%
is the female, psychic
side of things.

01:20:14.062 --> 01:20:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And so the temples
that started out

01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:17.960 align:middle line:84%
as symbolic that went
all the way up there,

01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:21.160 align:middle line:84%
which are equivalent to the
chakra centers in the spine.

01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:24.300 align:middle line:84%
Each one has a different
aspect of a school.

01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And I'll talk about this
more in a little bit too.

01:20:27.410 --> 01:20:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And they were there
to teach about

01:20:30.430 --> 01:20:33.680 align:middle line:84%
the emotional and
psychic aspects

01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:38.390 align:middle line:90%
of the left eye of Horus.

01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:41.465 align:middle line:84%
And so they taught about
tantra and sexual energy

01:20:41.465 --> 01:20:43.640 align:middle line:84%
and emotional body
work and fears

01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:46.247 align:middle line:90%
and all these kinds of things.

01:20:46.247 --> 01:20:48.330 align:middle line:84%
When someone had been
through all of that training

01:20:48.330 --> 01:20:50.860 align:middle line:84%
after 12 years, and they
were at least 45 years old,

01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:56.010 align:middle line:84%
then they were eligible to go
to the right eye of Horus, which

01:20:56.010 --> 01:20:59.110 align:middle line:84%
is through the Egyptian Mystery
School that I just mentioned.

01:20:59.110 --> 01:21:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And out of this, they
had a few hundred

01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:08.090 align:middle line:84%
people that were selected
and went through the school.

01:21:08.090 --> 01:21:10.930 align:middle line:84%
It took 12 years to get
the right eye of Horus.

01:21:10.930 --> 01:21:13.880 align:middle line:84%
The right eye of Horus had
never been given before.

01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And what's written on all
the walls is the left eye.

01:21:16.370 --> 01:21:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And the missing
information, the other half

01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:21.400 align:middle line:84%
of the information, the male
part of the information,

01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:24.144 align:middle line:84%
was only written in
one place in Egypt.

01:21:24.144 --> 01:21:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And they don't
know where that is,

01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:29.000 align:middle line:84%
because it's down
underneath-- it's leading way,

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.030 align:middle line:90%
way underneath the pyramids.

01:21:31.030 --> 01:21:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And so that information
was never given to them.

01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:40.870 align:middle line:84%
They never had the full
set of what was necessary.

01:21:40.870 --> 01:21:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And so it was finally
given in this school.

01:21:45.210 --> 01:21:47.850 align:middle line:84%
At the end of 12
years, they then

01:21:47.850 --> 01:21:50.285 align:middle line:84%
could begin to process the
people through an initiation

01:21:50.285 --> 01:21:53.310 align:middle line:84%
in the Great Pyramid, which I'll
describe exactly what they did.

01:21:53.310 --> 01:21:59.790 align:middle line:90%


01:21:59.790 --> 01:22:01.650 align:middle line:84%
So it means that they
only have 5 and 1/2

01:22:01.650 --> 01:22:04.744 align:middle line:84%
years to reap the
benefits of all this work

01:22:04.744 --> 01:22:06.910 align:middle line:84%
that they've been doing for
all this length of time.

01:22:06.910 --> 01:22:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And this guy must have been
the world's greatest teacher,

01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:16.600 align:middle line:84%
because in 5 and 1/2 years
they got almost 300 people

01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:21.171 align:middle line:90%
to realize immortality.

01:22:21.171 --> 01:22:24.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's amazing,
considering the Naacal Mystery

01:22:24.430 --> 01:22:28.610 align:middle line:84%
School in the 60-something
thousand years,

01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:32.760 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it was-- Atlantis
was 65 or 70,000 years,

01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:35.090 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know when they
started the Naacal mystery

01:22:35.090 --> 01:22:37.710 align:middle line:84%
school there, but in that
entire period of time,

01:22:37.710 --> 01:22:41.830 align:middle line:84%
they only manage
to reap 600 people.

01:22:41.830 --> 01:22:46.420 align:middle line:84%
He did 300 people in 17 and
1/2 years, which is incredible.

01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:49.510 align:middle line:84%
But of course, if you've got a
14 and 1/2 foot person sitting

01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:51.240 align:middle line:84%
there, I guess
you'll listen to him

01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:54.730 align:middle line:84%
and probably really
believe what he has to say.

01:22:54.730 --> 01:22:58.430 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, he was
very successful.

01:22:58.430 --> 01:23:02.290 align:middle line:84%
They were almost all women--
almost totally women.

01:23:02.290 --> 01:23:08.060 align:middle line:90%


01:23:08.060 --> 01:23:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And this group then went
back underneath with the Tat

01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:12.500 align:middle line:90%
Brotherhood and remained there.

01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:15.840 align:middle line:90%


01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:20.070 align:middle line:84%
This took place in
about 1350 BC, roughly,

01:23:20.070 --> 01:23:21.570 align:middle line:90%
give or take a few years.

01:23:21.570 --> 01:23:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And they remained there
until about 500 BC.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And then in 500 BC,
this group as a whole

01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:34.340 align:middle line:84%
got up, left the Great Pyramids,
and migrated over to a place

01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:37.390 align:middle line:90%
called Masada, Israel.

01:23:37.390 --> 01:23:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And they became known as
the Essene Brotherhood.

01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:45.680 align:middle line:84%
The core of the Essene
Brotherhood were these 300,

01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:49.850 align:middle line:84%
primarily women, who
were really Egyptians

01:23:49.850 --> 01:23:54.180 align:middle line:84%
and were immortal beings, had
already obtained immortality.

01:23:54.180 --> 01:23:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And they then created
another school around them--

01:23:57.890 --> 01:23:59.880 align:middle line:84%
another mystery
school around them--

01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:03.720 align:middle line:84%
which contained both
males and females, which

01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:05.750 align:middle line:84%
were the outer aspect
of the school, which

01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:08.305 align:middle line:84%
were ordinary people trying
to understand immortality.

01:24:08.305 --> 01:24:11.030 align:middle line:90%


01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And Mary was one
of these people.

01:24:15.790 --> 01:24:18.595 align:middle line:84%
If you're Christian, you
can just accept this or not,

01:24:18.595 --> 01:24:19.470 align:middle line:90%
or whatever you want.

01:24:19.470 --> 01:24:22.860 align:middle line:84%
But I've got to say it,
because this is what I believe.

01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:26.460 align:middle line:90%
Mary was one of the inner core.

01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:31.306 align:middle line:84%
She was an immortal being
before Jesus was ever born.

01:24:31.306 --> 01:24:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And she was
Egyptian, and she was

01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:34.180 align:middle line:90%
part of the Egyptian school.

01:24:34.180 --> 01:24:38.870 align:middle line:84%
A statement in the Bible that
could be interpreted many ways

01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:43.520 align:middle line:84%
but when God was talking about
his son, what did he say there?

01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:47.780 align:middle line:84%
He says, out of Egypt
will come my son.

01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And many here have said,
well, that was the time when

01:24:50.570 --> 01:24:52.610 align:middle line:84%
he went back to
Egypt, because Jesus

01:24:52.610 --> 01:24:54.350 align:middle line:90%
lived in Egypt for a long time.

01:24:54.350 --> 01:24:57.589 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, that's
what they meant by that,

01:24:57.589 --> 01:24:59.630 align:middle line:84%
but it could have been
interpreted in another way

01:24:59.630 --> 01:25:02.070 align:middle line:90%
also.

01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:07.180 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, according with
Thoth, Mary was an Egyptian.

01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:08.530 align:middle line:90%
She was an immortal being.

01:25:08.530 --> 01:25:12.470 align:middle line:84%
She came from this original
school, and she was an Essene.

01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And Joseph was also an
Essene, but he was not

01:25:16.610 --> 01:25:20.730 align:middle line:84%
an immortal being, and he
was from the outer ring.

01:25:20.730 --> 01:25:22.130 align:middle line:90%
And they crossed the two rings.

01:25:22.130 --> 01:25:27.980 align:middle line:90%


01:25:27.980 --> 01:25:33.960 align:middle line:84%
They crossed immortality
with mortality.

01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And it opened the way for a very
special spirit to come here,

01:25:40.170 --> 01:25:42.530 align:middle line:84%
who has a name that
I don't want to say.

01:25:42.530 --> 01:25:46.040 align:middle line:84%
It's a very beautiful
name from somewhere else.

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And he was one of the
most advanced souls

01:25:51.310 --> 01:25:58.240 align:middle line:84%
that this universe
has ever created,

01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:01.710 align:middle line:84%
who came from a
level of existence

01:26:01.710 --> 01:26:04.510 align:middle line:84%
totally beyond our
imagination at this point

01:26:04.510 --> 01:26:07.970 align:middle line:84%
and came down to this
extremely low level of life

01:26:07.970 --> 01:26:11.860 align:middle line:84%
to live a life
who we call Jesus.

01:26:11.860 --> 01:26:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And it was the cross
between Mary and Joseph--

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:17.550 align:middle line:84%
between the mortal
and the immortal.

01:26:17.550 --> 01:26:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And so he started
out as the Son of Man

01:26:20.700 --> 01:26:22.260 align:middle line:90%
and became the Son of God.

01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:25.190 align:middle line:84%
He started out as
a mortal person

01:26:25.190 --> 01:26:29.660 align:middle line:84%
and transmutated into
an immortal person

01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:33.270 align:middle line:84%
and gave the example
out to the world.

01:26:33.270 --> 01:26:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And if you really start
looking at things like baptism

01:26:35.710 --> 01:26:38.540 align:middle line:84%
and all the principles of
resurrection and everything,

01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:41.110 align:middle line:84%
you'll find that these
didn't start in Christianity,

01:26:41.110 --> 01:26:44.707 align:middle line:84%
but all had their roots in
Egypt, and even some of them--

01:26:44.707 --> 01:26:46.290 align:middle line:84%
baptism-- even further
back than that.

01:26:46.290 --> 01:26:50.210 align:middle line:90%


01:26:50.210 --> 01:26:54.200 align:middle line:84%
So again, you don't
have to accept that.

01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:57.580 align:middle line:90%
But I have to believe to say it.

01:26:57.580 --> 01:27:04.062 align:middle line:84%
And so now we have a person
who was teaching resurrection,

01:27:04.062 --> 01:27:07.960 align:middle line:84%
the same basic principles of
Egypt from the very beginning,

01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:12.780 align:middle line:84%
only who-- again, you
can't just talk about it.

01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:14.130 align:middle line:90%
You've got to do it.

01:27:14.130 --> 01:27:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And so you've got to actually
live it or present everything.

01:27:18.870 --> 01:27:22.350 align:middle line:84%
It's like a lot
of people-- and I

01:27:22.350 --> 01:27:25.090 align:middle line:84%
don't mean to put them
down in this way-- who

01:27:25.090 --> 01:27:28.540 align:middle line:84%
teach sacred geometry
and what this is about,

01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:32.000 align:middle line:84%
you get reams and reams and
reams of showing it, but then

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.860 align:middle line:84%
giving no way to bring
it in to make it real,

01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:38.920 align:middle line:84%
no way to ground it
into the experience.

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:40.470 align:middle line:90%
You've got to have that.

01:27:40.470 --> 01:27:44.930 align:middle line:84%
Without that, knowledge
is completely useless.

01:27:44.930 --> 01:27:47.920 align:middle line:90%
It has no purpose for me.

01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
they were doing.

01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:53.800 align:middle line:84%
They were having
someone live it and go

01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:55.290 align:middle line:90%
through the whole process.

01:27:55.290 --> 01:28:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And so now Jesus gave
the final example

01:28:00.630 --> 01:28:02.720 align:middle line:84%
of what the next step of
all this was all about.

01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:11.680 align:middle line:90%


01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going to leave
that there at this point.

01:28:15.490 --> 01:28:18.450 align:middle line:90%
And will ask questions.

01:28:18.450 --> 01:28:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And we'll just do
this for a little bit.

01:28:20.290 --> 01:28:22.270 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to
ask-- last time what

01:28:22.270 --> 01:28:24.900 align:middle line:84%
happened was there was only a
few people who asked questions,

01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:27.080 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people who
didn't get to ask questions.

01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:28.080 align:middle line:90%
So you get one question.

01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:28.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:31.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you must give
it to someone else.

01:28:31.030 --> 01:28:34.030 align:middle line:90%
So who's got that?

01:28:34.030 --> 01:28:34.830 align:middle line:90%
>>It's behind you.

01:28:34.830 --> 01:28:35.824 align:middle line:90%
>>It's behind me?

01:28:35.824 --> 01:28:38.697 align:middle line:90%


01:28:38.697 --> 01:28:39.780 align:middle line:90%
>>Let's start at the back.

01:28:39.780 --> 01:28:42.020 align:middle line:84%
>>We'd like to start at the
back this time, because--

01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:42.853 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:28:42.853 --> 01:28:44.710 align:middle line:90%
>>OK, hand it in the back.

01:28:44.710 --> 01:28:46.082 align:middle line:90%
Those guys never get anything.

01:28:46.082 --> 01:28:51.020 align:middle line:90%


01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:52.680 align:middle line:84%
No, those guys in
back know everything.

01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:57.938 align:middle line:90%


01:28:57.938 --> 01:29:00.250 align:middle line:90%
>>--the China experiments?

01:29:00.250 --> 01:29:02.470 align:middle line:90%
>>Probably.

01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:05.880 align:middle line:84%
See we met a whole other level
of consciousness and awareness

01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:09.550 align:middle line:84%
and information in China and
Tibet and all over in there.

01:29:09.550 --> 01:29:11.160 align:middle line:90%
There's Pyramids over there.

01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:14.550 align:middle line:84%
My sister, who's been all
over China-- my sister

01:29:14.550 --> 01:29:17.510 align:middle line:84%
is real famous in
China, and they allow

01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:19.091 align:middle line:90%
her to go anywhere, just about.

01:29:19.091 --> 01:29:20.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know if
there's a just about.

01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:22.950 align:middle line:84%
They allow her to
go anywhere she

01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:26.450 align:middle line:84%
wants-- and she said that
she's been taken to places.

01:29:26.450 --> 01:29:28.800 align:middle line:90%
She's been to Egypt 22 times.

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And she said that she's been
taken to places in China that

01:29:33.580 --> 01:29:35.420 align:middle line:90%
make Egypt look like nothing.

01:29:35.420 --> 01:29:37.170 align:middle line:84%
And yet the rest of
the world doesn't even

01:29:37.170 --> 01:29:41.067 align:middle line:84%
know it's there--
totally secret.

01:29:41.067 --> 01:29:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And they've got pyramids
all over the place,

01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:46.710 align:middle line:84%
and they completely deny
it that they're even there.

01:29:46.710 --> 01:29:49.604 align:middle line:90%


01:29:49.604 --> 01:29:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And there's some of
them that we finally

01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:53.070 align:middle line:84%
got photographs of and
everything else like that,

01:29:53.070 --> 01:29:55.170 align:middle line:84%
and they'll say, OK, all
right, that one's there.

01:29:55.170 --> 01:29:58.415 align:middle line:90%


01:29:58.415 --> 01:30:00.790 align:middle line:84%
You know, one of the most
beautiful pyramids in the world

01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:04.450 align:middle line:84%
is between the
Chinese-Tibetan border.

01:30:04.450 --> 01:30:07.870 align:middle line:84%
It's the largest pyramid
that we know of in the world.

01:30:07.870 --> 01:30:10.342 align:middle line:90%
It's solid white capstone.

01:30:10.342 --> 01:30:11.800 align:middle line:84%
It looks like it
was made yesterday

01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:14.970 align:middle line:84%
from people that have
an eyewitness of this.

01:30:14.970 --> 01:30:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's got big solid white
sides with a solid crystal

01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:23.510 align:middle line:84%
capstone on top of it
going to a sharp point.

01:30:23.510 --> 01:30:25.560 align:middle line:90%
It's in perfect condition.

01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And the doorway into it is open,
and you go into this thing,

01:30:31.130 --> 01:30:33.350 align:middle line:84%
and you go through this
thing into this final room,

01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:34.850 align:middle line:84%
into the middle
of this big room.

01:30:34.850 --> 01:30:36.140 align:middle line:90%
There's no words anywhere.

01:30:36.140 --> 01:30:36.940 align:middle line:90%
There's no writing.

01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:37.773 align:middle line:90%
There's no pictures.

01:30:37.773 --> 01:30:39.822 align:middle line:84%
There's no nothing,
except for one.

01:30:39.822 --> 01:30:42.280 align:middle line:84%
And when you go into the middle
up high in the front wall--

01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:44.050 align:middle line:84%
this is from an
eyewitness who was in it--

01:30:44.050 --> 01:30:48.570 align:middle line:84%
there's only one thing, and
that's the flower of life.

01:30:48.570 --> 01:30:50.800 align:middle line:90%
It says it all.

01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:52.610 align:middle line:84%
You know what the
flower of life is.

01:30:52.610 --> 01:30:55.090 align:middle line:84%
You just said everything
that you could possibly say

01:30:55.090 --> 01:30:57.440 align:middle line:90%
in the least amount of words.

01:30:57.440 --> 01:31:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And the Tibetan
government completely

01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:04.719 align:middle line:84%
denies that's there,
even though people

01:31:04.719 --> 01:31:06.177 align:middle line:84%
have been there
and photographed it

01:31:06.177 --> 01:31:07.160 align:middle line:90%
and everything else like that.

01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:08.618 align:middle line:84%
If you call them,
we have, we tried

01:31:08.618 --> 01:31:11.000 align:middle line:84%
to get the precise
location, everything.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.454 align:middle line:84%
Six months with them trying
to get it, and in the first I

01:31:14.454 --> 01:31:16.870 align:middle line:84%
don't know how many months,
they just said, doesn't exist.

01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:20.570 align:middle line:90%
Forget about it, no such thing.

01:31:20.570 --> 01:31:23.380 align:middle line:84%
Yet our government had
photographed it from the air.

01:31:23.380 --> 01:31:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And we'd finally got--
I talked to one group.

01:31:26.210 --> 01:31:29.492 align:middle line:84%
It takes six months
to get to this thing.

01:31:29.492 --> 01:31:31.600 align:middle line:84%
You've got to really
prepare, because you're

01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:33.540 align:middle line:84%
going through uncharted,
unmapped country.

01:31:33.540 --> 01:31:35.164 align:middle line:84%
You've got to have
food and everything.

01:31:35.164 --> 01:31:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And when you get there,
you've got to get back.

01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:39.740 align:middle line:90%
So you've got to really time it.

01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:39.860 align:middle line:90%
Do

01:31:39.860 --> 01:31:41.901 align:middle line:84%
And the second group I
talked to, they got there.

01:31:41.901 --> 01:31:43.840 align:middle line:84%
They got right to the
rim of the valley.

01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:46.400 align:middle line:84%
They could see it sitting
down in the valley,

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:48.804 align:middle line:84%
but they had to turn back,
because if they'd went in,

01:31:48.804 --> 01:31:51.220 align:middle line:84%
they would all die, because
they wouldn't have enough food

01:31:51.220 --> 01:31:52.170 align:middle line:90%
to get back.

01:31:52.170 --> 01:31:53.930 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
really high and cold.

01:31:53.930 --> 01:31:54.730 align:middle line:90%
So there's no food.

01:31:54.730 --> 01:31:56.790 align:middle line:90%
There's no way of getting back.

01:31:56.790 --> 01:31:58.050 align:middle line:90%
And it's only out of the snow.

01:31:58.050 --> 01:32:00.110 align:middle line:90%
It's buried under the snow.

01:32:00.110 --> 01:32:03.679 align:middle line:84%
It's only out of the snow for
three weeks out of the year.

01:32:03.679 --> 01:32:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's really hard
to see, because you've

01:32:05.470 --> 01:32:06.762 align:middle line:90%
got a white pyramid in snow.

01:32:06.762 --> 01:32:11.680 align:middle line:90%


01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:14.240 align:middle line:84%
But these are the kinds of
things that do exist out here,

01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:18.110 align:middle line:84%
and there's really a
lot going on over there.

01:32:18.110 --> 01:32:19.610 align:middle line:84%
But the Chinese
have really, really,

01:32:19.610 --> 01:32:21.310 align:middle line:90%
really tried to protect it.

01:32:21.310 --> 01:32:22.440 align:middle line:90%
And I'm glad they have.

01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:24.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad they do.

01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:27.590 align:middle line:90%
The Egyptians do the same thing.

01:32:27.590 --> 01:32:31.430 align:middle line:84%
From what we know about
Egypt, you could about

01:32:31.430 --> 01:32:34.950 align:middle line:90%
triple that on what's hidden.

01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And the Egyptian
government knows

01:32:37.220 --> 01:32:40.809 align:middle line:84%
a great deal of
where this stuff is,

01:32:40.809 --> 01:32:42.225 align:middle line:84%
but they're not
going to tell you.

01:32:42.225 --> 01:32:43.990 align:middle line:90%
They're not going to open it up.

01:32:43.990 --> 01:32:46.960 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't do it unless
they were forced to.

01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:53.770 align:middle line:84%
They don't see any reason
to bring that out purposely.

01:32:53.770 --> 01:32:55.910 align:middle line:84%
What's really
interesting after that,

01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:58.750 align:middle line:84%
who would you think they
would trust, of course,

01:32:58.750 --> 01:33:03.510 align:middle line:84%
to make the transition between
that dynasty and the next one?

01:33:03.510 --> 01:33:06.856 align:middle line:84%
They made Ay and Tiya
a king and queen,

01:33:06.856 --> 01:33:08.650 align:middle line:84%
because they were only
ones that tested it.

01:33:08.650 --> 01:33:12.160 align:middle line:84%
So they were king and queen
during the transition,

01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:15.344 align:middle line:84%
and then when Seth came
in the 19th dynasty,

01:33:15.344 --> 01:33:17.510 align:middle line:84%
they turned it over to him,
because he didn't really

01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:20.160 align:middle line:84%
want to be king, but they
had to make the transition

01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:22.555 align:middle line:84%
over to who-- and then
when Seth came in,

01:33:22.555 --> 01:33:26.040 align:middle line:84%
he immediately turned it
back into exactly what it

01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:31.470 align:middle line:84%
was before, he erased everything
and started right back over.

01:33:31.470 --> 01:33:34.640 align:middle line:84%
An Akhenaten was then
called something,

01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:37.050 align:middle line:90%
exactly what Jesus was called.

01:33:37.050 --> 01:33:41.330 align:middle line:84%
He was given the name the
criminal-- same name that Jesus

01:33:41.330 --> 01:33:46.390 align:middle line:84%
was called on the cross later,
the criminal-- and the worst

01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:47.570 align:middle line:90%
king that ever lived.

01:33:47.570 --> 01:33:51.740 align:middle line:90%


01:33:51.740 --> 01:33:55.100 align:middle line:84%
But Nefertiti and none of
the sisters and daughters,

01:33:55.100 --> 01:33:58.750 align:middle line:84%
of all of them, were
never found, not anything.

01:33:58.750 --> 01:34:01.300 align:middle line:84%
However, about three
or four or five years

01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:05.360 align:middle line:84%
ago, they found two things
in Tel el Amarna, which

01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:09.180 align:middle line:90%
was very heartening for me.

01:34:09.180 --> 01:34:14.350 align:middle line:84%
The first one was they found
some more burial caskets.

01:34:14.350 --> 01:34:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And they opened one of
them up, and inside right

I had not been able to tie that
to the 18th dynasty before,

01:34:25.340 --> 01:34:27.600 align:middle line:84%
and so I was glad
to see that one.

01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:29.420 align:middle line:84%
But then they found
another casket, which

01:34:29.420 --> 01:34:30.545 align:middle line:90%
they don't know what to do.

01:34:30.545 --> 01:34:34.070 align:middle line:84%
It is sitting in the basement
of the Cairo Museum right now.

01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:37.870 align:middle line:84%
But they found this big
casket, and they opened it up,

01:34:37.870 --> 01:34:43.930 align:middle line:84%
and there was the bones of
a seven-year-old boy who

01:34:43.930 --> 01:34:50.010 align:middle line:84%
was eight feet tall-- seven
years old, eight feet tall.

01:34:50.010 --> 01:34:51.885 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know what
to think about that,

01:34:51.885 --> 01:34:54.614 align:middle line:84%
but it's physically
sitting in Egypt right now.

>>I don't know about the skull.

01:35:03.110 --> 01:35:07.425 align:middle line:84%
I got this through my
Egyptologists out of Egypt.

01:35:07.425 --> 01:35:12.084 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't get to
see this with my eyes.

Well, wait a
minute-- [INAUDIBLE].

Do you have it?

01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:25.568 align:middle line:90%
Who has the next question?

01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:32.030 align:middle line:84%
Shouldn't she ask the
next question her.

01:35:32.030 --> 01:35:33.640 align:middle line:84%

next after this one.

something into the akashic

that Christ put into it?

01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, Akhenaten was
showing that which

01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:53.005 align:middle line:90%
we would become physically.

We're actually going to go
through metamorphosis of that.

we are here to there.

01:35:59.650 --> 01:36:02.240 align:middle line:90%
So they were working together.

01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:06.110 align:middle line:84%
The two patterns
were both necessary.

01:36:06.110 --> 01:36:07.260 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

01:36:07.260 --> 01:36:08.745 align:middle line:90%
It's got to go back to her.

It's my understanding that
he was the Son of Akhenaten

by a normal woman, by an

01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:23.850 align:middle line:90%
and Nefertiti only had females.

as far as I know and
everything I've written,

01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:39.935 align:middle line:84%
they don't know where
King Tut came from.

communication with Nefertiti.

>>I believe that's true.

01:36:49.900 --> 01:36:51.846 align:middle line:84%
There's no proof of
that, of course, either.

01:36:51.846 --> 01:36:52.646 align:middle line:90%

01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:09.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to say
his name, and I just

01:37:09.940 --> 01:37:13.680 align:middle line:84%
wondered what you
were referring to

01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:15.800 align:middle line:84%
and could you tell us a
little bit about that?

01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And also, as far as Jesus
being a culmination of Joseph

01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:25.130 align:middle line:84%
and Mary-- mortal
and an immortal--

01:37:25.130 --> 01:37:29.160 align:middle line:84%

it is from both sides of
the equation, so to speak.

>>Yeah, I'll explain that
in just a little bit.

When we talk about immortality,
I'll explain what they did

01:37:43.704 --> 01:37:46.370 align:middle line:90%
and how that took place.

01:37:46.370 --> 01:37:48.692 align:middle line:84%
But what was the first
part of the question?

01:37:48.692 --> 01:37:51.034 align:middle line:90%
Oh, Jesus' name.

01:37:51.034 --> 01:37:56.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, his name, Jesus,
is an Earth name.

01:37:56.290 --> 01:37:59.980 align:middle line:84%
He has another name
that's much more ancient.

And I don't know if I have
the right to talk about that.

the-- a lot of people

come from other places.

want that discussed.

we not talk about that.

here that she asked here.

I don't think that
Akhenaten in reality

Osiris was always

depicted as having either a
green or a light blue face.

01:39:18.060 --> 01:39:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's because he
was dead when they got him.

01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:30.130 align:middle line:84%
They resurrected him
literally out of the dead.

01:39:30.130 --> 01:39:31.530 align:middle line:90%
He was a dead person.

01:39:31.530 --> 01:39:34.410 align:middle line:90%
I think that's what it is.

01:39:34.410 --> 01:39:37.730 align:middle line:84%
He's sometimes depicted
with white, also,

01:39:37.730 --> 01:39:39.850 align:middle line:90%
having a white face.
