00:00:02.922 --> 00:00:16.400 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.920 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And now we've got to switch
to another time in history.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.502 align:middle line:90%
It's not too far back.

00:00:24.502 --> 00:00:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And I'm about to
tell you something

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.553 align:middle line:84%
that is more outrageous than
anything else I've said before.

00:00:29.553 --> 00:00:31.220 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.400 align:middle line:90%
[CHATTER]

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.260 align:middle line:90%
You're all ready.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.060 align:middle line:90%
I can tell.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.370 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.630 align:middle line:90%


00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.187 align:middle line:84%
And it was real hard for me
to talk about it when they--

00:00:46.187 --> 00:00:48.520 align:middle line:84%
because I knew what was going
on, but it was hard for me

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.120 align:middle line:84%
when they first
told me to go tell--

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.536 align:middle line:84%
seven and a half
years ago, it was

00:00:51.536 --> 00:00:53.880 align:middle line:90%
very hard to talk about this.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.846 align:middle line:84%
And everybody sort of
walked out, going--

00:00:55.846 --> 00:01:03.290 align:middle line:90%


00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:13.670 align:middle line:84%
But when they started to create
the grid 13,000 years ago,

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:21.080 align:middle line:84%
it was calculated that we
would reach completion and be

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.014 align:middle line:84%
able to step through
in approximately--

00:01:24.014 --> 00:01:25.430 align:middle line:84%
and when I say
approximately, they

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.490 align:middle line:84%
had it down to about one
day, I think-- approximately

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.430 align:middle line:90%
the winter of 1998.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And that we would be able
to move in during that time.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And so everything was set
up, and the sacred sites

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.690 align:middle line:90%
were created.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And people all over the
world, in different races

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.030 align:middle line:84%
that were seemingly disconnected
and had nothing doing

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.350 align:middle line:84%
each other, were working
on this little grid,

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.900 align:middle line:84%
very much like this floor
plan that's on the floor here.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.080 align:middle line:84%
They were placing
them in certain places

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.450 align:middle line:84%
all over the world,
which affected

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.200 align:middle line:84%
and shaped this electromagnetic
field outside of the planet.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.720 align:middle line:90%


00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:11.192 align:middle line:84%
However, about 200 years
ago, sometime in the 1700s,

00:02:11.192 --> 00:02:16.900 align:middle line:84%
it became apparent to
the father aspect of us--

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.580 align:middle line:84%
not the Anunnaki, I don't think,
but the Sumerian aspect of us--

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.500 align:middle line:84%
that the grid may not
be completed in time,

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:36.130 align:middle line:84%
and at least one person not
make it through in time,

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.430 align:middle line:90%
before something would happen.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.900 align:middle line:84%
We needed just
the grid completed

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.090 align:middle line:84%
and one person stepping
through-- which

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.340 align:middle line:90%
happened recently, 1989.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.279 align:middle line:84%
But this needed to take
place earlier than this,

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:53.820 align:middle line:84%
because there was
something coming up

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.070 align:middle line:84%
that we needed to have
this take place earlier.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Not that the whole world
had to make the translation,

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.870 align:middle line:84%
but the grid just
had to be completed,

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.750 align:middle line:84%
and we had to have a certain--
at least one person live in it.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.740 align:middle line:90%


00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And so at some
point in the 1700s,

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.940 align:middle line:84%
it became apparent that
we might not make it.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.261 align:middle line:84%
And if we didn't make
it by a certain time--

00:03:24.261 --> 00:03:26.510 align:middle line:84%
and that time would have
been approximately the winter

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:33.330 align:middle line:90%
of 1972-- we would all die.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.680 align:middle line:90%
We would really die.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.760 align:middle line:84%
This planet would-- we'd
have to go somewhere else.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.530 align:middle line:90%
We'd all transmigrate somewhere.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.360 align:middle line:84%
We'd have to leave
third-dimensionally

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.286 align:middle line:90%
into somewhere else.

00:03:43.286 --> 00:03:44.970 align:middle line:90%
We wouldn't have a body.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.560 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't have bodies
or have a planet.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.950 align:middle line:84%
It would be not a
real good situation.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.100 align:middle line:84%
The planet would no longer
be usable as a Star City,

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.910 align:middle line:90%
maybe ever.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And our daddy did not
want this to happen.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.050 align:middle line:84%
They really did not
want to see us get hurt.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.750 align:middle line:84%
But it looked like there was a
very high probability that we

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.060 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't make it, because they
knew what was going to happen.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:28.365 align:middle line:84%
And so the Sirians began to
make a serious investigation--

00:04:28.365 --> 00:04:30.590 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:37.980 align:middle line:84%
--into the memory
banks of the universe,

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.270 align:middle line:84%
looking for someone who
had thought of a solution

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.460 align:middle line:90%
to our particular predicament.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And what the result
was, after checking

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:55.160 align:middle line:84%
all possible knowledge, was
that there wasn't any solution.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.340 align:middle line:84%
No one, in all cases that
had all happened before,

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.770 align:middle line:84%
when a life form had gotten
this close to making a change

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.290 align:middle line:84%
and didn't make it,
the life form died.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.474 align:middle line:84%
And there was no
solution to the problem.

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:11.620 align:middle line:90%


00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And so it was probably a little
disheartening for a while.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.380 align:middle line:84%
However, they kept
searching, and they

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.910 align:middle line:84%
found hidden deeply
into ancient records--

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.730 align:middle line:84%
ancient, ancient times,
not even in this galaxy--

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.529 align:middle line:84%
somewhere else was the
originator of all of this,

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:33.070 align:middle line:84%
so I'm not sure,
but it could've been

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:42.740 align:middle line:84%
anywhere-- a little tiny seed,
a little possibility of a way

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.290 align:middle line:84%
that, if we did
fail and not make it

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:48.330 align:middle line:84%
through-- that there
might be a way.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.070 align:middle line:84%
Somebody conceived of
a very intricate way

00:05:53.070 --> 00:06:00.560 align:middle line:84%
that, under these
specific circumstances,

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.340 align:middle line:84%
life might be able
to make it through.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.510 align:middle line:84%
No one's ever done it,
but it was a game plan.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.310 align:middle line:90%
It was a possibility.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And so the Sirians
took the information

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.180 align:middle line:84%
from the ancient,
ancient, ancient past,

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:23.080 align:middle line:84%
and they began to proceed
as though we weren't going

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.665 align:middle line:84%
to make it, even though they
didn't actually know if we were

00:06:25.665 --> 00:06:28.460 align:middle line:84%
or we were not, because it
was going to be so close.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And so they began to
proceed, and they made,

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.220 align:middle line:84%
you might say, the
hardware and the software,

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.820 align:middle line:84%
and trained all the people,
and got everything ready to go.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.997 align:middle line:84%
It took a while to do
it, and they did it all.

00:06:42.997 --> 00:06:44.330 align:middle line:90%
They made all their experiments.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:45.130 align:middle line:90%
They studied.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.870 align:middle line:84%
They did everything
else, made sure

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.330 align:middle line:90%
that they had everything ready.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And when they were
all ready-- they even

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.525 align:middle line:84%
had the ambassadors
ready to go, everything

00:06:54.525 --> 00:06:59.740 align:middle line:84%
that they would have needed--
and then they waited.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And in January of 1972, of
the existing cultures that

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.110 align:middle line:84%
were coming in from other
dimensional levels-- of which

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:16.850 align:middle line:84%
there were approximately
80,000 at that time--

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:23.560 align:middle line:84%
they all reviewed the situation
of Earth, and it was a very,

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:28.230 align:middle line:84%
let's just say, extremely heated
debate over whether or not

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:30.600 align:middle line:90%
Earth would make it or not.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:39.530 align:middle line:84%
And it was finally agreed
upon by almost everybody

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:42.980 align:middle line:84%
that Earth did not
stand a chance.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.570 align:middle line:84%
Literally, the words
were, "There is no hope."

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.010 align:middle line:84%
No life would make it
through, not even a bug.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:48.810 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:50.185 align:middle line:90%
Not even a bacteria.

00:07:50.185 --> 00:07:53.470 align:middle line:84%
Not anything would make it
through the situation that

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:57.100 align:middle line:90%
was about to develop in 1972.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.920 align:middle line:90%
And so they left.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:01.720 align:middle line:90%
They left us.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.315 align:middle line:84%
They left us alone
to die, because there

00:08:04.315 --> 00:08:05.700 align:middle line:90%
was nothing they could do.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:10.025 align:middle line:84%
And with the exception of
the Sirians, the Palladians,

00:08:10.025 --> 00:08:15.120 align:middle line:84%
the Aldebarans, Arcturus
and about approximately

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.975 align:middle line:90%
100 other cultures.

00:08:17.975 --> 00:08:19.600 align:middle line:84%
Those are the ones
we're familiar with,

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.090 align:middle line:84%
but there's a lot
of other ones that

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:25.180 align:middle line:90%
are not quite so well-known.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:28.010 align:middle line:84%
Basically, it was the friends
of the Sirians, people

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:30.130 align:middle line:84%
that knew what the
Sirians were trying

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:32.580 align:middle line:84%
to do-- although the whole
body knew what they were trying

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:41.549 align:middle line:84%
to do-- and stayed to give
them support if they needed it.

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:45.640 align:middle line:90%


00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, here was the situation that
the Sirians were faced with.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.408 align:middle line:84%
This is what was going on
fourth-dimensional levels, OK?

00:08:52.408 --> 00:08:55.049 align:middle line:90%


00:08:55.049 --> 00:08:57.340 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be switching
back and forth between what

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.330 align:middle line:84%
was going on on
fourth-dimensional levels

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.186 align:middle line:84%
and what was going on
third-dimensional levels.

00:09:02.186 --> 00:09:03.990 align:middle line:84%
On the third-dimensional
level, we

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:11.824 align:middle line:84%
talked about the pulsing that
was coming off of the sun.

00:09:11.824 --> 00:09:14.859 align:middle line:90%


00:09:14.859 --> 00:09:16.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if I
even need this yet.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:21.174 align:middle line:90%


00:09:21.174 --> 00:09:22.965 align:middle line:84%
There were these
spiralings, these pulsings

00:09:22.965 --> 00:09:24.630 align:middle line:90%
that were coming off the sun.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:34.140 align:middle line:84%
When Suzuki wrote
his paper, he said

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:39.780 align:middle line:84%
that they calculated there
would be this enormous explosion

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:46.460 align:middle line:84%
on the sun in August, September,
October, November of 1972.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:51.350 align:middle line:84%
As it turned out, it
was August 7th of 1972,

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:55.910 align:middle line:84%
and it was the biggest
explosion in the history-- well,

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:58.185 align:middle line:84%
in actual fact, it was
the biggest explosion

00:09:58.185 --> 00:10:00.410 align:middle line:90%
in the history of the earth.

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:03.880 align:middle line:84%
In recorded fact, it was one
of the biggest of solar flare

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.970 align:middle line:84%
activities-- this is
all the data on it

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:10.045 align:middle line:84%
here-- one of the biggest solar
flare activities ever recorded.

00:10:10.045 --> 00:10:14.959 align:middle line:90%


00:10:14.959 --> 00:10:16.250 align:middle line:90%
But it was much more than that.

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:17.708 align:middle line:84%
A bubble was formed
in the sun that

00:10:17.708 --> 00:10:20.760 align:middle line:84%
was 2/3 the size of
the sun, and the sun

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.490 align:middle line:90%
was knocked off its axis.

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.020 align:middle line:90%
It will never quite be the same.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.870 align:middle line:90%
And it actually shifted poles.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:30.750 align:middle line:84%
A shifting of the
axis of the sun

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:35.000 align:middle line:84%
took place, which
inevitably means

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.710 align:middle line:84%
the shifting of the
axis of the planets

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:40.290 align:middle line:84%
that go around it, because
they conform to it.

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:41.990 align:middle line:84%
They didn't really
know what it meant.

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:45.210 align:middle line:84%
But what did-- at the moment
that this was taking place,

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:48.980 align:middle line:84%
right prior to August
7th, we were approaching

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:52.270 align:middle line:90%
Jupiter in a satellite.

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And as we were
approaching Jupiter,

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:56.300 align:middle line:84%
and it was on
worldwide television,

00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:04.950 align:middle line:84%
we were coming into Jupiter
and we were about to--

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:07.200 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about it on
TV, and everyone was like,

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.300 align:middle line:90%
here we come, here we come.

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And they were telling
people up there, well,

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:11.569 align:middle line:84%
we're about to go through
a radiation belt which

00:11:11.569 --> 00:11:13.750 align:middle line:90%
is about 200 miles thick.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And that when we went
in the radiation belt,

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.690 align:middle line:84%
they wouldn't be able to
transmit out to the other side,

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:20.850 align:middle line:84%
so they would go blank
on the world's screens

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:22.840 align:middle line:84%
until they got to
the other side.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.390 align:middle line:84%
At the very moment that we
were approaching Jupiter,

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:27.290 align:middle line:84%
there was this
enormous explosion

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:31.050 align:middle line:84%
on the sun, unparalleled--
on certain levels,

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:32.990 align:middle line:90%
unparalleled in history.

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And the solar wind got up to 2
and 1/2 million miles per hour,

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:43.060 align:middle line:84%
coming through like a tidal
wave coming across the oceans.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:46.130 align:middle line:84%
It would be like about a
400-foot tidal wave coming

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:46.930 align:middle line:90%
over the oceans.

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:49.110 align:middle line:84%
This would be about
equivalent to it.

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And this tidal wave came in and
just went right over Jupiter,

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:56.160 align:middle line:84%
and washed-- just blew
away the radiation belt,

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.820 align:middle line:90%
just blew it up.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And so we transmitted
as we went around.

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And NASA, you could see
these guys in there,

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:08.260 align:middle line:84%
and they were going, oh, I
guess we're transmitting.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.510 align:middle line:90%
They were going, holy cow--

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:10.860 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:11.650 align:middle line:84%
--you know, because
they know what's

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:12.590 align:middle line:90%
going on in the other areas.

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:14.302 align:middle line:84%
And now here they're
being real comical.

00:12:14.302 --> 00:12:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Oh, it looks like we're going
to transmit as we go around.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.710 align:middle line:84%
But this was a real pretty
exciting time for those guys,

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:24.040 align:middle line:84%
because that was a really
big, huge, enormous thing that

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.061 align:middle line:90%
took place.

00:12:25.061 --> 00:12:27.900 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Wouldn't it blow
the satellite out of there, too?

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>>FRISSELL: No, it's
not-- it's little, tiny,

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:37.440 align:middle line:90%
fine particles that are being--

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.970 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: So it just
affected the radiation?

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:42.415 align:middle line:84%
>>FRISSELL: It won't affect
physical things like that,

00:12:42.415 --> 00:12:45.295 align:middle line:84%
but it did affect the
radiation belt dramatically.

00:12:45.295 --> 00:12:49.070 align:middle line:90%


00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:53.184 align:middle line:84%
It was so powerful, probably
a lot of it-- some of it

00:12:53.184 --> 00:12:54.600 align:middle line:84%
would even pass
through the earth.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:58.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know what--
I'm not sure what--

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:03.090 align:middle line:84%
I'd have to do some research
to find out what was

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:05.090 align:middle line:90%
in-- it's called a solar wind.

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:08.200 align:middle line:90%


00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.920 align:middle line:84%
It stayed that way
for about three days,

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.211 align:middle line:84%
and it dropped down to about
a million and a half miles

00:13:12.211 --> 00:13:15.700 align:middle line:84%
an hour for about a
month, about 30 days.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:20.042 align:middle line:84%
And nobody on Earth
really knew what

00:13:20.042 --> 00:13:22.500 align:middle line:84%
it was, because they'd never
experienced anything like that

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.730 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And so from August about 8th
until a few months later--

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:39.720 align:middle line:84%
actually until June
or July of 1973,

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:43.680 align:middle line:84%
you could go to any
scientific journal-- in fact,

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:48.100 align:middle line:84%
to almost all the major cities'
newspapers of the world--

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:50.290 align:middle line:84%
and they would discuss this
thing that was going on,

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:53.180 align:middle line:84%
or had happened on
the sun on August 7th.

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:56.480 align:middle line:84%
It really was about a week
long, but it peaked on that day.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:00.500 align:middle line:90%


00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:01.610 align:middle line:90%
No one knew what it meant.

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:04.420 align:middle line:84%
All they knew was that
it was extraordinary,

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:12.480 align:middle line:84%
and most of the papers just
gave the data on what it was.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:17.540 align:middle line:84%
But from June or
July, Suzuki called--

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:19.860 align:middle line:84%
who knew more about this than
anyone else in the world,

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:23.870 align:middle line:84%
because he wrote the paper on
it, and he planned everything.

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'd been working with him
up until just prior to that.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:33.155 align:middle line:84%
I left-- I think it was
just right after-- I

00:14:33.155 --> 00:14:35.480 align:middle line:90%
don't know when it was.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:40.450 align:middle line:84%
Maybe April or
something of 1973,

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:43.630 align:middle line:84%
I was no longer with him, so
I didn't go to this meeting.

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:47.510 align:middle line:84%
I have no knowledge of what
happened in that meeting.

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:53.900 align:middle line:84%
But what I do know is that there
is-- from June or July of 1973,

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:56.400 align:middle line:84%
whoever was in that meeting--
and it was most of the world's

00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:01.800 align:middle line:84%
scientists-- there has been
an absolute, total, complete

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.015 align:middle line:90%
blackout of information.

00:15:03.015 --> 00:15:06.890 align:middle line:90%


00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:10.270 align:middle line:84%
It's as though it
never occurred.

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:13.210 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing.

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:17.530 align:middle line:84%
Only if you go back between the
period of time of August 7th

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:20.950 align:middle line:84%
of '72 to June or July or '73,
whenever that meeting was,

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:23.010 align:middle line:84%
will you be able
to locate anything

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:25.580 align:middle line:90%
at all written on that subject.

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:30.620 align:middle line:84%
After that, across the
entire planet, nothing,

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:33.137 align:middle line:84%
because they all knew
that whatever it was,

00:15:33.137 --> 00:15:34.330 align:middle line:90%
it was big-time.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And Suzuki was telling
them that it probably

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:40.210 align:middle line:84%
meant the beginning
of the pole shift.

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And actually Suzuki
felt, after that,

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:46.033 align:middle line:84%
that his calculations were--
from everything else they

00:15:46.033 --> 00:15:48.950 align:middle line:84%
had been calculating before
that-- was that we would never

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:52.150 align:middle line:90%
make it past 1984.

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And he's probably still
scratching his head,

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:57.360 align:middle line:84%
because he doesn't
know what happened

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:02.370 align:middle line:84%
right prior to that time on
a fourth-dimensional level.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:05.530 align:middle line:84%
Because he would have
been right probably,

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:10.110 align:middle line:84%
if other things
didn't occur now.

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:middle line:84%
What was really about to
occur was-- Suzuki, what

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.450 align:middle line:84%
he had really
predicted was that this

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:20.490 align:middle line:84%
would be the biggest, most
incredible, all-absorbing

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:23.330 align:middle line:84%
explosion ever seen,
and we may not even

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:27.130 align:middle line:90%
make it alive past 1984.

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And he was much more right than
he knows, though at the moment

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:35.790 align:middle line:84%
he probably thought that he had
made a mistake or something.

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Because what was
really going on is

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:44.260 align:middle line:84%
that we are in a hydrogen sun--
the fusion that's going on

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.230 align:middle line:84%
is a hydrogen fusion
reaction that's

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:49.230 align:middle line:84%
going on in the sun, which
is, like I said before,

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:51.680 align:middle line:84%
two hydrogen atoms
coming together, fusing

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:55.670 align:middle line:84%
together and making helium,
which is the source of all

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:59.030 align:middle line:84%
the life in this room and
all the life of this planet,

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:03.730 align:middle line:84%
and all the light on this
planet, just that one reaction.

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:10.300 align:middle line:90%


00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And for about five
billion years or so

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:15.599 align:middle line:90%
the sun has been doing this.

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:19.102 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is when the sun
reaches-- when the helium has

00:17:19.102 --> 00:17:21.060 align:middle line:84%
been building up, and
building up, and building

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:26.650 align:middle line:84%
up inside of there, and when the
helium reaches a certain level,

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:29.710 align:middle line:84%
you get another
level of fusion which

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:32.080 align:middle line:90%
is called helium reaction.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.770 align:middle line:84%
Three helium atoms come
together and form carbon,

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:37.620 align:middle line:90%
and you get another reaction.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And what our science is
too infant to understand

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:45.000 align:middle line:84%
is that when that
happens, this phenomena

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.230 align:middle line:84%
occurs-- it's rather
rapid-- there's

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:53.880 align:middle line:84%
a pulsing of the sun
when the helium ignites,

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.690 align:middle line:90%
when it goes up the next step.

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:58.155 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
happened on August 7th--

00:17:58.155 --> 00:18:00.850 align:middle line:84%
or leading up to it, a
few days before it peaked

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:04.740 align:middle line:90%
on August 7th-- was it ignited.

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And we had a helium
reaction, which

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:11.360 align:middle line:84%
the original plans knew this was
going to take place a long time

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.160 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.890 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to have the
crystalline grid in place

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:18.840 align:middle line:84%
prior to that time, and have at
least one Christ-consciousness

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:22.710 align:middle line:84%
being come up, raise the
ship up into the sky,

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:28.030 align:middle line:84%
and then our own intelligence
and his life force energy

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:30.630 align:middle line:84%
would be able to
protect us through this.

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:34.010 align:middle line:90%
But that didn't happen.

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And so we weren't going to
be able to protect ourselves.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And without that protection,
we couldn't possibly survive,

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:47.850 align:middle line:84%
because the sun was going to
expand right up past the earth

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:50.410 align:middle line:90%
for a short time.

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:53.160 align:middle line:90%
And it did.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.580 align:middle line:84%
It went on right past
us-- I'm not sure

00:18:55.580 --> 00:19:00.110 align:middle line:84%
how far-- and we were
inside of the sun.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:02.910 align:middle line:90%


00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:06.600 align:middle line:84%
Remember what God
said in the Bible.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.046 align:middle line:84%
He destroyed the earth
with water the last time.

00:19:09.046 --> 00:19:13.600 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'll never do that
again, next time it'll be fire.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And everybody says, how can
the earth be destroyed by fire?

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:21.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you can imagine,
suns expand all the time.

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:23.340 align:middle line:84%
When they die, they'll
expand so much,

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:26.260 align:middle line:84%
they'll go right up past
the entire solar system.

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And [? quaff it ?] up,
and then come back in,

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:31.120 align:middle line:90%
and there's nothing left.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.480 align:middle line:90%
But this is just a pulsing.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:35.250 align:middle line:84%
In terms of the sun's life,
it would just be a [WHOOSH]

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:36.050 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:38.530 align:middle line:84%
It would just be a second
when the helium reaction takes

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:39.330 align:middle line:90%
place.

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:45.880 align:middle line:90%


00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And so they had to figure
out some way to protect us,

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:54.476 align:middle line:84%
and so in January, when
everybody said, there's no way,

00:19:54.476 --> 00:19:56.850 align:middle line:84%
no one's going to make-- nobody
is going to survive this.

00:19:56.850 --> 00:19:59.320 align:middle line:84%
This is what they meant
by not even a bug is

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:01.270 align:middle line:90%
going to survive this one.

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:03.045 align:middle line:90%
And so they all left.

00:20:03.045 --> 00:20:07.090 align:middle line:84%
As soon as they left,
the Syrian ambassadors,

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:11.100 align:middle line:84%
which were all ready to go,
went toward a particular area

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.990 align:middle line:84%
of space and met
with what is called

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:15.650 align:middle line:84%
a Galactic Command--
and this particular one

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:19.940 align:middle line:84%
is the one with 48
members-- and asked

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.950 align:middle line:84%
the Galactic Command
for permission

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:25.480 align:middle line:90%
to do the experiment.

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:28.390 align:middle line:84%
Galactic Command, by law,
had to ask certain things.

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Number one is they had to
know for certain that there

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:35.910 align:middle line:84%
was no chance that any light
whatsoever-- any human life--

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:39.720 align:middle line:90%
would survive the situation.

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:43.740 align:middle line:84%
So it was the opinion
of the 80,000 people

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.760 align:middle line:84%
that were there--
almost all of them--

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.000 align:middle line:90%
that we would not survive.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And because there
was no hope, then

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:53.420 align:middle line:84%
they were given
permission to do it,

00:20:53.420 --> 00:21:00.850 align:middle line:84%
providing that the Sirians could
demonstrate that-- or convince

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:08.445 align:middle line:84%
the Galactic Command that in
so doing their experiment,

00:21:08.445 --> 00:21:11.460 align:middle line:90%
that someone would survive.

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:14.620 align:middle line:84%
So not only had there could be--
no one would make it through,

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.740 align:middle line:84%
which would allow them
to be able to do this.

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:18.824 align:middle line:84%
But simultaneously,
they couldn't just

00:21:18.824 --> 00:21:21.240 align:middle line:84%
do an experiment that they
didn't think would really work.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And so they had to
demonstrate that they

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.770 align:middle line:90%
thought it would work.

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:26.472 align:middle line:84%
And they were able
to convince them.

00:21:26.472 --> 00:21:28.930 align:middle line:84%
However, when they asked them,
how many people do you think

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:31.680 align:middle line:84%
will survive-- this is the
Sirians answering the Galactic

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:36.970 align:middle line:84%
Command-- they said, we don't
think that more than two will--

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:38.440 align:middle line:90%
we hope that two will.

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:41.410 align:middle line:84%
We don't think that
more than 10 will.

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:43.660 align:middle line:84%
That's all the people they
thought would survive this.

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:46.550 align:middle line:90%


00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And they answered
from their heart.

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:50.200 align:middle line:84%
That's really what
they believed.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.610 align:middle line:90%
They had to.

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:55.480 align:middle line:84%
You can't lie to
Galactic Command.

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.219 align:middle line:84%
And so they really
thought it would work,

00:21:58.219 --> 00:22:00.760 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't think very many
people would make it through.

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.250 align:middle line:84%
But if even two people
made it through,

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:06.370 align:middle line:84%
then they're going to say
yes, because that would

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:16.539 align:middle line:84%
mean that the whole thing would
survive, and would survive

00:22:16.539 --> 00:22:17.830 align:middle line:90%
on the third dimensional level.

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:22.500 align:middle line:84%
There'd already been cultures
that had taken humans

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.040 align:middle line:84%
off the third dimensional level
and the fourth dimensional

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.680 align:middle line:84%
levels, et cetera,
and things like this.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:31.880 align:middle line:84%
But they wanted-- it
would be really good

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:35.967 align:middle line:84%
if someone could do
it on their own--

00:22:35.967 --> 00:22:37.300 align:middle line:90%
or at least almost on their own.

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:41.540 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, they got
permission to do it.

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:43.010 align:middle line:90%
Now, what it was is this.

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:46.480 align:middle line:90%


00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.790 align:middle line:84%
Again, I'll have to
put this over here.

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:51.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, to try to explain
this to someone

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.330 align:middle line:84%
seven and a half years
ago was pretty hard,

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:55.580 align:middle line:90%
even with what we had.

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:58.290 align:middle line:84%
These days it's a
little easier, and you

00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:01.680 align:middle line:84%
can imagine if you have not
ever seen this workshop before,

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:05.362 align:middle line:84%
to try to explain this four
days ago would have been hard.

00:23:05.362 --> 00:23:08.020 align:middle line:90%


00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:10.820 align:middle line:84%
You now probably are pretty
familiar with the concept

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:14.710 align:middle line:84%
that there is a star tetrahedral
field inscribed in the planet

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:17.410 align:middle line:90%
Earth.

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:21.480 align:middle line:84%
However, though the
United Nations, et cetera,

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:25.800 align:middle line:84%
are familiar or are now
aware that-- there's

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:26.600 align:middle line:90%
a little bit more.

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.200 align:middle line:84%
There's three of
them, like we said.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:33.340 align:middle line:84%
But there's also a star-- if
you remember the Fruit of Life,

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:36.140 align:middle line:90%
there's a star within a star.

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:39.240 align:middle line:84%
So there's a star in
the planet, but there's

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:43.310 align:middle line:84%
a bigger one that encloses the
planet, where a planet would

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:45.060 align:middle line:84%
be way inside there
and these points would

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:47.710 align:middle line:90%
be way out in space.

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:51.640 align:middle line:84%
So the whole energy field--
does everybody understand that?

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.650 align:middle line:84%
There's a bigger
one way out there.

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:56.189 align:middle line:84%
There's another one that
just encloses inside of it,

00:23:56.189 --> 00:23:57.730 align:middle line:84%
and there's another
one way out here.

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:02.470 align:middle line:90%


00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:05.340 align:middle line:84%
So they went to these places,
these little points out

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:09.157 align:middle line:84%
in space, which are the chakra
points of the planet itself

00:24:09.157 --> 00:24:10.990 align:middle line:84%
that are in space-- the
same ones that we're

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:13.790 align:middle line:90%
dealing with out around here.

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And they placed eight
little, tiny objects

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.960 align:middle line:90%
at each of those eight places.

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.170 align:middle line:84%
They were just a--
weren't very big.

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:24.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember,
12-20 feet or so wide.

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:27.100 align:middle line:84%
They were disk-shaped
objects, [? robots. ?]

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.990 align:middle line:90%
There was nobody on them.

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And they placed them on there
one full overtone higher

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.300 align:middle line:84%
than that the earth
sits on, so that they

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:42.740 align:middle line:84%
were invisible to the earth but
easily able to reach the Earth.

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:43.620 align:middle line:90%


00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And then they came
out to the membrane

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:50.930 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth which sits out
at 440,000 miles away, which

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:54.790 align:middle line:84%
would be out there about
where the wall is, somewhere

00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:55.590 align:middle line:90%
over there.

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:58.860 align:middle line:90%


00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:02.040 align:middle line:90%
Maybe not quite that far.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And they placed a very
large object there

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:11.040 align:middle line:84%
which was about 50 miles
long and cigar shaped.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And it was black,
and it was seamless.

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And it had a transparent
area on one end,

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:23.690 align:middle line:84%
and it was manned by about 350
members of the Sirian race.

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And they wore white
uniforms and gold insignias,

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:28.420 align:middle line:90%
both male and female.

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And they were
[AUDIO OUT] trained race

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:37.320 align:middle line:84%
that knew how to operate this
thing which was really alive.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:41.290 align:middle line:84%
It was a silicon carbon
based life form that

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:44.350 align:middle line:84%
had been created by
the Sirians to cope

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:46.680 align:middle line:84%
with the kind of
complexity that would

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:54.200 align:middle line:84%
be required to do what
this experiment would need.

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:58.350 align:middle line:84%
From the dark of the ship,
not the transparent area,

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:01.600 align:middle line:84%
there was a beam
that was shot down

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.090 align:middle line:84%
through the membrane
of the Earth

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:08.962 align:middle line:84%
down through across
the 440,000 miles.

00:26:08.962 --> 00:26:10.295 align:middle line:90%
This was all fourth dimensional.

00:26:10.295 --> 00:26:12.160 align:middle line:90%


00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.520 align:middle line:84%
Over to either the
top or the bottom.

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:18.520 align:middle line:84%
I really don't know
which one it was.

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:23.210 align:middle line:84%
Either the North or the South
Pole of the Earth, the beam

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:28.250 align:middle line:84%
was approximately six or
seven inches in diameter,

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:34.230 align:middle line:84%
and it was a form of laser
light that we have not got yet.

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:36.290 align:middle line:84%
If you could stop
the light, you would

00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:40.561 align:middle line:84%
see it was little tiny segments
of all these different colors.

00:26:40.561 --> 00:26:41.810 align:middle line:90%
And so it's like multicolored.

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:43.580 align:middle line:84%
It looked like they
were stacked together

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:45.860 align:middle line:84%
and then moving at
the speed of light.

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:50.340 align:middle line:84%
And they could hold immense
amounts of information,

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:51.277 align:middle line:90%
absolutely immense.

00:26:51.277 --> 00:26:52.440 align:middle line:90%


00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:55.230 align:middle line:84%
That was then shot
down-- let's just say

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:58.520 align:middle line:84%
to the North Pole for
convenience-- to this vehicle

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:03.120 align:middle line:84%
here which translated that light
into three primary colors which

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:08.980 align:middle line:84%
were red, green, and blue,
which are the primary colors

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:10.900 align:middle line:90%
of transmitted light.

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:12.770 align:middle line:90%
Not red, yellow, and blue.

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:14.320 align:middle line:84%
And the red, green,
and blue was then

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:17.652 align:middle line:84%
shot to three corners of here,
from there, again, back over

00:27:17.652 --> 00:27:19.110 align:middle line:84%
to these three
corners, from these.

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And it goes around
the whole thing

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:23.480 align:middle line:84%
and wrapped it back
down to the opposite end

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.220 align:middle line:90%
where it came from.

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:27.510 align:middle line:84%
From whence it was
re-integrated back into the beam

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:29.520 align:middle line:84%
and shot into the
center of the Earth.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And from the center of
the Earth by diffraction,

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:36.180 align:middle line:84%
it went out into billions and
billions of beams, little ones,

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:38.780 align:middle line:84%
straight out to there
which was directed

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:45.150 align:middle line:84%
at the human beings and
certain animals of the planet.

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:48.360 align:middle line:84%
Coming in from underneath
the human being,

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:51.380 align:middle line:84%
it came into the bottom
of the human grid

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:55.510 align:middle line:84%
and came out around the
whole field out around here.

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And I don't exactly
know how the interaction

00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:02.440 align:middle line:84%
was around the human
into the center in there.

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:03.680 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how it was.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.430 align:middle line:90%


00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:11.210 align:middle line:84%
What they were doing was--
they had two problems

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:13.650 align:middle line:84%
that they had to
solve simultaneously.

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's what this
experiment was to try to do.

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:20.310 align:middle line:84%
The first one was
they had to protect us

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:24.600 align:middle line:90%
from this wall of flame.

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And so in order to do that, they
created a very special field

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:36.780 align:middle line:84%
around the Earth that
would be able to do so

00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:39.770 align:middle line:84%
which extended from the
fourth to the third dimension.

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:41.830 align:middle line:90%
That was number one.

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:47.190 align:middle line:84%
But number two-- they not
only had to protect us,

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:54.200 align:middle line:84%
but they had to hide it from
us because if we saw it coming,

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:58.490 align:middle line:84%
just the shock alone
would do us in.

00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:00.080 align:middle line:90%
So they had to hide it from us.

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:04.820 align:middle line:84%
So we didn't know that
we were being protected.

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:08.520 align:middle line:84%
You can see why this hadn't
been done for so long.

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:11.190 align:middle line:84%
Same time that they
had to hide it from us,

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:15.710 align:middle line:84%
they had to make us evolve
very rapidly so that we could

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:18.760 align:middle line:84%
get from where we
were up a little

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:22.460 align:middle line:84%
bit further so that
we could make this--

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:26.070 align:middle line:84%
because we weren't quite
evolved far enough fast enough.

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:26.950 align:middle line:90%
We almost made it.

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:29.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, out of
13,000 years, we only

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:31.990 align:middle line:90%
missed it by-- what is that?

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:33.240 align:middle line:90%
26 years or something.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:36.060 align:middle line:84%
So it was not bad,
but we did need

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:40.530 align:middle line:84%
to go a little faster
than what we were going.

00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:42.950 align:middle line:84%
All those things had to be
happening simultaneously.

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:44.694 align:middle line:84%
So what they did
was-- and I know

00:29:44.694 --> 00:29:46.110 align:middle line:84%
this is going to
sound outrageous,

00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:49.770 align:middle line:84%
but I can't help it--
they put this field

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:51.350 align:middle line:90%
around that protected us.

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And then they set
up-- the only thing

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.440 align:middle line:84%
I could call it if I have
to give it a name would

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:59.630 align:middle line:90%
be a holographic incubator.

00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:02.470 align:middle line:84%
They set up a field
around the Earth that

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:06.680 align:middle line:84%
put us into a separate
reality for a period of time

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:11.590 align:middle line:84%
and then protected us from
ourselves, from the sun.

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:15.884 align:middle line:84%
And then at the same
time-- and got permission

00:30:15.884 --> 00:30:17.300 align:middle line:84%
to do what I'm
about to tell you--

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:22.727 align:middle line:84%
they took away our free
will for about two years

00:30:22.727 --> 00:30:24.810 align:middle line:84%
and only could have got
that because we would have

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:27.680 align:middle line:90%
been totally wiped out anyway.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:32.190 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of like if a
mommy and daddy came to a kid

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:34.827 align:middle line:84%
and took all their-- they had
knives or something in there--

00:30:34.827 --> 00:30:36.660 align:middle line:84%
and took them all away
from and said, sorry.

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Can't have these
things right now.

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:44.600 align:middle line:84%
They took away our ability to
choose for a short time, shot

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:50.560 align:middle line:84%
the field around us
which began to control

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:52.816 align:middle line:90%
the actual events in our lives.

00:30:52.816 --> 00:30:56.780 align:middle line:90%


00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:00.140 align:middle line:84%
It took them only 30 days to
totally get the thing running.

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And by the middle
of February of 1972,

00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:06.730 align:middle line:90%
we were in a separate reality.

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:13.337 align:middle line:84%
This continued until-- they had
to make sure it was working.

00:31:13.337 --> 00:31:15.670 align:middle line:84%
When they first got it working,
they didn't do anything.

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:17.990 align:middle line:84%
They didn't take any free
will away or nothing.

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:20.720 align:middle line:84%
They just got it
working and then got

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:25.740 align:middle line:84%
the program going on a
program that would continue on

00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:28.250 align:middle line:90%
as though nothing happened.

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:29.850 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to make
sure it worked.

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:33.610 align:middle line:84%
But before the time when they
knew the fusion reaction would

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:37.752 align:middle line:84%
take place, they then switched
over and began experimenting.

00:31:37.752 --> 00:31:40.410 align:middle line:90%


00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:48.490 align:middle line:84%
They got it to the place
where finally they took away

00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:49.990 align:middle line:84%
the free will,
and they guided us

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:52.330 align:middle line:84%
very carefully over
the next two years

00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:54.710 align:middle line:90%
during this very crucial time.

00:31:54.710 --> 00:32:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And what they did was they would
keep giving you, or all of us,

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:03.000 align:middle line:84%
experiences in life that
you might not normally

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:09.160 align:middle line:84%
have that would make you
evolve as rapidly as possible.

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And so from about
somewhere-- if I

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:17.470 align:middle line:84%
have to guess-- I'd
say May, June, or July,

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:21.470 align:middle line:84%
somewhere around
in there of 1972

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:25.060 align:middle line:84%
we went into a total
artificial reality

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:27.640 align:middle line:90%
with no free will at all.

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And then after about
two years, they

00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:32.880 align:middle line:84%
gave the freewill back--
because they didn't really

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:33.680 align:middle line:90%
want to do that.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:36.120 align:middle line:90%
They had to.

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.600 align:middle line:84%
They gave us free
will back, but they

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:41.630 align:middle line:90%
kept the programming going.

00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:43.789 align:middle line:84%
And so they'd give
choices to you.

00:32:43.789 --> 00:32:45.330 align:middle line:84%
But if you didn't
pick the right one,

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:49.790 align:middle line:84%
they would just keep
coming back at you

00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:51.165 align:middle line:84%
because they really
kind of-- no.

00:32:51.165 --> 00:32:51.330 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:51.860 align:middle line:90%
Go this way.

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:52.130 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:52.930 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:53.816 align:middle line:90%
Go this way.

00:32:53.816 --> 00:32:55.280 align:middle line:90%
>>Are they still doing that?

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:56.160 align:middle line:90%
>>When was this?

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:56.280 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:56.690 align:middle line:90%
They're not.

00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:57.720 align:middle line:90%
They're not doing this anymore.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.890 align:middle line:84%
>>Around what date was
that again? [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:04.080 align:middle line:84%
>>They did that from
about the summer of '72

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:07.010 align:middle line:84%
to about the summer
of '74 roughly.

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>>So were they responsible
for disco music?

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:10.900 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:12.370 align:middle line:90%


00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:14.207 align:middle line:90%
>>It could be.

00:33:14.207 --> 00:33:16.043 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:33:16.043 --> 00:33:17.880 align:middle line:90%


00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:21.210 align:middle line:84%
>>Why did they save the other
planets, the sun and beyond?

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:24.136 align:middle line:84%
>>They weren't concerned about--
the other planets were fine.

00:33:24.136 --> 00:33:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>>How could they
not [INAUDIBLE]?

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:29.042 align:middle line:84%
>>Because the other
planets are alive,

00:33:29.042 --> 00:33:31.000 align:middle line:84%
and they have very high
levels of life on them.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.940 align:middle line:84%
The only one that was a
problem here was Earth.

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:37.950 align:middle line:90%
And all you need really is one.

00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:41.140 align:middle line:84%
But if you got two, then
you're really together.

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:44.800 align:middle line:84%
If you got two beings of at
least Christ consciousness

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.210 align:middle line:90%
level, there's no problem.

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:48.010 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:49.593 align:middle line:84%
It's no problem for
the entire planet.

00:33:49.593 --> 00:33:50.545 align:middle line:90%
It's all it takes.

00:33:50.545 --> 00:33:52.842 align:middle line:84%
>>You mean we didn't
even have two here?

00:33:52.842 --> 00:33:54.240 align:middle line:90%
Not even one?

00:33:54.240 --> 00:34:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>>Not that could do-- no.

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:02.420 align:middle line:90%
We didn't.

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:03.420 align:middle line:90%
We had ascended masters.

00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:15.040 align:middle line:90%


00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:18.110 align:middle line:84%
They were looking
for someone that

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:23.884 align:middle line:84%
had to be able to reach through
and to take out the ship.

00:34:23.884 --> 00:34:27.620 align:middle line:90%


00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:28.420 align:middle line:90%
I don't-- I don't--

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>>It had to be a woman.

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.320 align:middle line:90%
>>Huh?

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>>Because it had to be female.

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:37.404 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, it should be,
but it didn't have to be.

00:34:37.404 --> 00:34:45.789 align:middle line:90%


00:34:45.789 --> 00:34:47.580 align:middle line:84%
This has come up before,
and I don't really

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:53.159 align:middle line:84%
understand what the linkage is
between the ascended masters

00:34:53.159 --> 00:34:57.009 align:middle line:84%
and the body on the Earth
and the relationship of that.

00:34:57.009 --> 00:34:59.300 align:middle line:84%
I know that Thoth, who was
one of the ascended masters,

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:02.356 align:middle line:84%
took the ship up before
and said that he said

00:35:02.356 --> 00:35:03.480 align:middle line:90%
he could never do it again.

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:06.170 align:middle line:90%


00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't understand
that point fully,

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:13.240 align:middle line:84%
and I can't help you on that
exactly why they needed someone

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:16.020 align:middle line:90%
new, someone out of this cycle.

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:19.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if this
is because of the fall

00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:21.120 align:middle line:90%
and that there was a separation.

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:23.190 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand.

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:30.557 align:middle line:84%
They were looking for
someone out of this cycle

00:35:30.557 --> 00:35:31.390 align:middle line:90%
to be able to do it.

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:32.420 align:middle line:90%
Now, why?

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:33.515 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:35:33.515 --> 00:35:35.390 align:middle line:84%
I should be able to get
that from the angels.

00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:36.200 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand.

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.040 align:middle line:84%
It's come up before,
but I don't know.

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:38.840 align:middle line:90%
I can't tell you.

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:40.311 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:35:40.311 --> 00:35:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>>Is that form still out
there, the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:44.962 align:middle line:84%
>>It's still there
right now, yes.

00:35:44.962 --> 00:35:46.420 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know
how long they were

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:47.586 align:middle line:90%
going to be able to do this.

00:35:47.586 --> 00:35:49.766 align:middle line:84%
They needed to get us to
a level of consciousness.

00:35:49.766 --> 00:35:52.560 align:middle line:90%


00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.830 align:middle line:84%
I know what part
of the problem was.

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:56.812 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have
the grid completed.

00:35:56.812 --> 00:35:58.650 align:middle line:90%
The grid wasn't completed.

00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And so it wasn't possible for
us to make a transformation

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.340 align:middle line:90%
without the grid.

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And so it just
simply wasn't done.

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.727 align:middle line:84%
It was almost done,
but it wasn't done.

00:36:11.727 --> 00:36:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And that was the primary thing
that had to be completed.

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:14.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:18.207 align:middle line:84%
>>I remember listening to
this story on your tape.

00:36:18.207 --> 00:36:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And just a couple of
weeks ago on the show,

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:24.745 align:middle line:84%
"Sightings," that's
on Friday nights,

00:36:24.745 --> 00:36:29.478 align:middle line:84%
a Japanese cinematographer
shot a shadow

00:36:29.478 --> 00:36:32.915 align:middle line:84%
onto the moon that's
a 50 mile long lozenge

00:36:32.915 --> 00:36:37.334 align:middle line:84%
shape that would
correspond to the ship

00:36:37.334 --> 00:36:39.298 align:middle line:90%
that you're talking about.

00:36:39.298 --> 00:36:40.280 align:middle line:90%
>>That's interesting.

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:41.089 align:middle line:90%
>>Uh-huh.

00:36:41.089 --> 00:36:42.130 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's about right.

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:46.410 align:middle line:90%


00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:48.279 align:middle line:84%
If it was 50 miles
long though, that ship

00:36:48.279 --> 00:36:50.070 align:middle line:84%
would have to be awfully
close to the moon.

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:50.870 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:55.514 align:middle line:84%
The shadow wasn't, but the
scientists who looked at, they

00:36:55.514 --> 00:36:58.206 align:middle line:84%
calculated from the shadow
how long the ship would be.

00:36:58.206 --> 00:36:59.164 align:middle line:90%
And they said 50 miles.

00:36:59.164 --> 00:37:01.440 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, I see.

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:05.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, this ship sits out
at almost double the orbit

00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:06.630 align:middle line:90%
of the moon.

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:09.350 align:middle line:90%


00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And if it was a
shadow from the sun--

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:19.097 align:middle line:84%
I'm not quite sure how that's
possible from that ship.

00:37:19.097 --> 00:37:20.051 align:middle line:90%
>>I don't know.

00:37:20.051 --> 00:37:24.200 align:middle line:84%
It was a clear lozenge shape on
the movies that-- [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:25.505 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:37:25.505 --> 00:37:26.880 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you, I
don't think it's

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:29.910 align:middle line:84%
that-- see, they put the
ship outside the membrane

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:32.210 align:middle line:84%
and put it up in a
fourth dimensional level

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:35.470 align:middle line:84%
specifically so it
would not be seen

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:39.960 align:middle line:84%
and put it outside the membrane
so it wouldn't even be sensed.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:42.190 align:middle line:84%
That's why they had
to put it so far away.

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think that
that's what that is.

00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:48.050 align:middle line:84%
That might be something else,
but I don't that's what it is.

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:48.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:50.317 align:middle line:90%


00:37:50.317 --> 00:37:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>>Is it active in any
way at this point?

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:54.590 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:56.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm about to tell you
what continued on.

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.120 align:middle line:90%


00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:03.150 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you the
rest of what happened.

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:11.620 align:middle line:90%


00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:12.540 align:middle line:90%
It worked.

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:14.248 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know if
it was going to work.

00:38:14.248 --> 00:38:15.714 align:middle line:90%
They had no idea.

00:38:15.714 --> 00:38:17.005 align:middle line:90%
They accelerated the evolution.

00:38:17.005 --> 00:38:20.950 align:middle line:90%


00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:23.060 align:middle line:84%
This is what started
getting everything going.

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:25.728 align:middle line:84%
They accelerated our
evolution synthetically.

00:38:25.728 --> 00:38:29.600 align:middle line:90%


00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.690 align:middle line:90%
We just haven't stopped.

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:35.680 align:middle line:84%
We started going faster
and faster and faster.

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:41.380 align:middle line:84%
And we started evolving
extremely rapidly.

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And then everything
just started taking off.

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:47.880 align:middle line:90%
And nobody expected this at all.

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:53.687 align:middle line:90%


00:38:53.687 --> 00:38:55.770 align:middle line:84%
There were several times
where they thought, well,

00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:58.810 align:middle line:84%
there's no way they can
hold this field any longer.

00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And then just the whole
Earth and everything

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:05.740 align:middle line:84%
would be such that they would
learn the whole situation was

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:07.930 align:middle line:90%
such that we could keep going.

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And we'll just keep going
beyond all the places

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:13.040 align:middle line:84%
where we thought that it
couldn't go any further.

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:17.540 align:middle line:90%


00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:19.610 align:middle line:84%
It kept going up and
going up and going up,

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:23.150 align:middle line:84%
and we kept going faster and
faster and faster and faster.

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And we went past the
place where we were going

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:30.870 align:middle line:90%
to make it or not make it.

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:32.250 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't any doubt
about it anymore.

00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:34.166 align:middle line:84%
At one point, we were
going to make it or not.

00:39:34.166 --> 00:39:35.720 align:middle line:84%
That wasn't even
the issue anymore.

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:38.705 align:middle line:84%
The issue was what's this
speed that we're going at?

00:39:38.705 --> 00:39:41.830 align:middle line:84%
This became the issue is
this evolutionary speed that

00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:43.120 align:middle line:90%
became extraordinary.

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And again, like I said before,
we can't tell because we're

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:46.905 align:middle line:90%
inside the system.

00:39:46.905 --> 00:39:49.600 align:middle line:84%
But relative to the
rest of reality,

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.460 align:middle line:84%
we're in a synthetic
environment now.

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:53.293 align:middle line:84%
And relative to the
rest of the environment,

00:39:53.293 --> 00:39:57.820 align:middle line:84%
we can't tell that we're moving
at this blinding light speed

00:39:57.820 --> 00:39:59.287 align:middle line:90%
relative to everything else.

00:39:59.287 --> 00:40:05.640 align:middle line:90%


00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:07.400 align:middle line:84%
I remember at one
point, even a long time

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:11.310 align:middle line:84%
ago when Thoth said the ascended
masters were just going,

00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:13.030 align:middle line:90%
holy cow.

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:15.120 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And at one point, I said
well, how fast is it?

00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:23.260 align:middle line:90%


00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:29.330 align:middle line:84%
He was like, well, he
says, in human terms,

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:32.140 align:middle line:84%
it would be like if
you just had a baby

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:34.210 align:middle line:84%
and you look down at
the baby, and then

00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:39.020 align:middle line:84%
suddenly in 15 minutes--
and when he says 15 minutes,

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:40.910 align:middle line:84%
he would calculate
carefully that this

00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:45.360 align:middle line:84%
was why-- in 15 minutes, the
baby becomes an adult right

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:47.150 align:middle line:90%
before your eyes.

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:50.460 align:middle line:84%
That's how fast we're moving
and how outrageous it is.

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:53.236 align:middle line:90%


00:40:53.236 --> 00:40:54.610 align:middle line:84%
The level that
we're moving at is

00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:56.710 align:middle line:90%
outrageous to the rest of life.

00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:59.250 align:middle line:90%
It's just simply outrageous.

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And at first when we
started moving this fast,

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:04.630 align:middle line:84%
we started attracting
the attention

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:09.150 align:middle line:90%
of many nearby other races.

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:11.350 align:middle line:84%
All these guys that left,
the 80,000 that left,

00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:17.370 align:middle line:84%
they all came back and
brought friends with them.

00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon there
was lots and lots

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:22.840 align:middle line:84%
of other people
coming back here.

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:25.592 align:middle line:84%
And then, like I
said before-- or I

00:41:25.592 --> 00:41:28.190 align:middle line:84%
think I did-- the
first overtone, which

00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:31.119 align:middle line:84%
is sort of where they usually
come into, totally filled up.

00:41:31.119 --> 00:41:32.660 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't even
get near the Earth.

00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:34.540 align:middle line:84%
It was just totally
filled up with people.

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:36.240 align:middle line:84%
They went into the
second overtone,

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.735 align:middle line:90%
and that's totally filled up.

00:41:37.735 --> 00:41:40.110 align:middle line:84%
Keep going, we'll have to go
into the third overtone even

00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:42.510 align:middle line:84%
to be able to get
more life here.

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:46.580 align:middle line:84%
You can't get any more life
physically close to this place

00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:47.550 align:middle line:90%
to watch it.

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:50.430 align:middle line:90%
It's ridiculous.

00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:53.940 align:middle line:84%
So we think there's just a
few flying saucers out there.

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:59.560 align:middle line:84%
You've got a zillion
eyeballs on us right now.

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And then we with
intergalactic, not only inner

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.650 align:middle line:84%
dimensional, but we
went intergalactic.

00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:09.100 align:middle line:84%
People from other galaxies,
which is kind of unusual,

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:13.340 align:middle line:84%
started coming here-- even
within the third dimensional

00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:16.500 align:middle line:84%
level of life-- started
coming here and focusing

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.080 align:middle line:90%
on this place.

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And at this point,
all life everywhere,

00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:25.150 align:middle line:84%
all levels, all
dimensions, everything,

00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:29.920 align:middle line:84%
the entire focus of, you
might, say great spirit.

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:32.980 align:middle line:84%
All life everywhere within
the waveform universe,

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:36.360 align:middle line:84%
and maybe even outside
the waveform universe,

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:38.690 align:middle line:84%
are focused on
Earth and watching

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:39.690 align:middle line:90%
the extraordinary thing.

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:42.400 align:middle line:84%
Because everybody
knows and senses

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:48.450 align:middle line:84%
that this amazing, extraordinary
thing is happening on Earth

00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:51.010 align:middle line:84%
is going to affect
all life everywhere.

00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:53.340 align:middle line:90%
We just know it.

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I meant
by this little seed

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:59.250 align:middle line:90%
that God buried down in there.

00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:05.450 align:middle line:84%
He created a situation where
this was the only choice.

00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:06.361 align:middle line:90%
It was the only one.

00:43:06.361 --> 00:43:07.610 align:middle line:90%
There wasn't any other choice.

00:43:07.610 --> 00:43:08.560 align:middle line:90%
It was the only one.

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:11.020 align:middle line:90%
And so the experiment was tried.

00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:12.880 align:middle line:84%
It came from the
Lucifer rebellion

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:17.700 align:middle line:84%
because it came from technology
onto a Lucifer rebellion

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:20.320 align:middle line:90%
planet, planet Earth.

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And now, the thing
seems to be coming up

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:25.670 align:middle line:90%
with the answer for both sides.

00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:26.740 align:middle line:90%
So who am I to say?

00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:27.990 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:29.920 align:middle line:84%
But what appears
to be happening now

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:33.840 align:middle line:84%
is that God appears to be
entering into the situation.

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:36.204 align:middle line:84%
And God, I mean us
on the other side

00:43:36.204 --> 00:43:37.870 align:middle line:84%
of the experiment--
the whole experiment

00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:40.650 align:middle line:84%
outside of the
waveform universe seems

00:43:40.650 --> 00:43:43.350 align:middle line:90%
to be interacting directly.

00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Things are occurring here that
just really are not natural.

00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:49.460 align:middle line:84%
The grid that's around
the Earth that was finally

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:55.350 align:middle line:84%
completed in 1989,
that grid-- which

00:43:55.350 --> 00:43:59.390 align:middle line:84%
again, is based on dodecahedron,
but far more integrated.

00:43:59.390 --> 00:44:02.470 align:middle line:84%
It's still a dodecahedron,
but there's much finer,

00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:05.760 align:middle line:84%
finer aspects to it--
reflects the consciousness

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:10.390 align:middle line:90%
of that life form directly.

00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:12.890 align:middle line:84%
And Christ consciousness
usually evolves

00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:14.640 align:middle line:90%
over a long period of time.

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:18.270 align:middle line:84%
It goes into one stage
of unity consciousness,

00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:21.310 align:middle line:84%
but there's many, many
levels that continue up.

00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:25.430 align:middle line:84%
There's stages of growth that
continue up even from there.

00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:26.964 align:middle line:84%
And you can always
tell where it's

00:44:26.964 --> 00:44:28.255 align:middle line:90%
at just by looking at the grid.

00:44:28.255 --> 00:44:31.220 align:middle line:90%


00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:33.310 align:middle line:84%
They're not really watching
the individual humans

00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:35.950 align:middle line:84%
so much as they're watching
this geometrical image

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:37.620 align:middle line:90%
around the area.

00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And it usually
makes maybe a change

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:48.610 align:middle line:84%
every maybe a 1,000
years or maybe

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:52.990 align:middle line:84%
every 10,000 years or
something like that.

00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:56.390 align:middle line:84%
We're making changes in this
thing hourly and sometimes

00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:58.498 align:middle line:90%
even sooner.

00:44:58.498 --> 00:45:01.570 align:middle line:84%
Whole worldwide global
changes are clicking in hear.

00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:03.656 align:middle line:84%
So click click
click click click.

00:45:03.656 --> 00:45:07.450 align:middle line:90%


00:45:07.450 --> 00:45:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And so whether you know
it or believe it or not,

00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:17.460 align:middle line:84%
we are in the midst of an
extraordinary experiment

00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:20.860 align:middle line:84%
here that all life
is focused on.

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think that has
ever occurred before either.

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:26.140 align:middle line:90%
Though maybe it has.

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:30.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that Melchizedek
has any conscious memory

00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:37.140 align:middle line:84%
of the entire waveform
universe focusing its attention

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:39.086 align:middle line:90%
on a single point.

00:45:39.086 --> 00:45:41.580 align:middle line:90%
>>It must be [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:45.490 align:middle line:90%
>>Just to have that done.

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:46.670 align:middle line:90%
One second.

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:51.820 align:middle line:84%
in January of 1992, another
phenomena took place.

00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:55.890 align:middle line:84%
We reached a very high
level of development

00:45:55.890 --> 00:45:56.920 align:middle line:90%
based upon polarities.

00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:59.650 align:middle line:90%


00:45:59.650 --> 00:46:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And the dark light,
which had been

00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:06.880 align:middle line:84%
more powerful on the Earth for
at least the last 16,000 years,

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:09.980 align:middle line:84%
the light energy--
in other words,

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:16.220 align:middle line:84%
the amount of people that have
connected into the dodecahedron

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:18.960 align:middle line:84%
grid of Christ
consciousness became greater

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:25.650 align:middle line:84%
than those connected
into the other grid.

00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And when that happened, another
milestone or a transformation

00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:37.270 align:middle line:90%
took place on the Earth.

00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And the light became
stronger at which point

00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:46.380 align:middle line:84%
we entered into another area
where certain things were--

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:49.610 align:middle line:84%
well, for one
thing, before I even

00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:52.240 align:middle line:84%
explain that one, let's go
back a little bit further

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:55.210 align:middle line:90%
in August of 1990.

00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:56.010 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:56.010 --> 00:47:00.630 align:middle line:84%
Go back a little bit further,
back about 1988 or so,

00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Thoth told me that's
when he was saying

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:04.275 align:middle line:84%
that we were going
so doggone fast

00:47:04.275 --> 00:47:06.160 align:middle line:84%
and all this stuff
was happening.

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And the ascended
masters were trying

00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:16.310 align:middle line:84%
to figure out some way to
respond to this rapid approach

00:47:16.310 --> 00:47:17.810 align:middle line:84%
because they were
the only ones that

00:47:17.810 --> 00:47:22.920 align:middle line:84%
were inside the system that
could effectively deal with it.

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And so they could see
from inside the system

00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:30.910 align:middle line:84%
that we were going to
reach this point, what's

00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:34.545 align:middle line:84%
called critical mass-- in
other words, of about five

00:47:34.545 --> 00:47:36.080 align:middle line:90%
and a half billion people.

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:40.770 align:middle line:84%
When you reach approximately
a level of-- it's somewhere,

00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:43.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember what
they said exactly.

00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:45.320 align:middle line:90%
It was about 500 million people.

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:48.550 align:middle line:84%
When you reach a certain level,
critical mass takes place.

00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And what usually happens
when that happens

00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:53.560 align:middle line:84%
is the whole planet
goes [MAKES NOISE].

00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:54.620 align:middle line:90%
Everybody.

00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:57.460 align:middle line:84%
The whole planet goes
up to another level.

00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:58.690 align:middle line:90%
It goes into unity.

00:47:58.690 --> 00:48:00.810 align:middle line:84%
It goes into this
certain specific unity

00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:03.810 align:middle line:90%
of Christ consciousness.

00:48:03.810 --> 00:48:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And I have this on tape
as far back as about 1988.

00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:11.480 align:middle line:90%
I think I even have it on video.

00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:14.940 align:middle line:84%
Because he made me go out and
say what I'm about to say,

00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:18.110 align:middle line:84%
which at that time, I thought
was pretty outrageous.

00:48:18.110 --> 00:48:24.030 align:middle line:84%
But he said that it looked
like by the last week of August

00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:25.700 align:middle line:84%
or the first week
of September-- I'm

00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:29.270 align:middle line:84%
saying this two years
earlier than the time, which

00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:37.760 align:middle line:84%
would have been 1990-- that in
that two week period of time

00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:44.108 align:middle line:84%
we would reach-- let me think
a moment just what he said.

00:48:44.108 --> 00:48:56.370 align:middle line:90%


00:48:56.370 --> 00:49:00.599 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember
exactly how he put it.

00:49:00.599 --> 00:49:02.140 align:middle line:84%
I think what he said
is when we reach

00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:13.030 align:middle line:84%
critical mass in that time and
that then the next one coming

00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:16.380 align:middle line:84%
up would be the window-- again,
that we referred to the times

00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:18.590 align:middle line:84%
when I had to go into
Egypt, which was January

00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:21.880 align:middle line:84%
10th to January 19th--
that in that window, just

00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:25.430 align:middle line:84%
a special window when
things can take place,

00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:32.910 align:middle line:84%
that they felt that we would
reach critical mass back then.

00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:33.710 align:middle line:90%
That's what it was.

00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:38.640 align:middle line:84%
But in that window is when we
would make the transformation

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:40.870 align:middle line:84%
and that we would go
into unity at which

00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:44.220 align:middle line:84%
point during the
window, they decided

00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:47.006 align:middle line:84%
that if it looked like we
were really going to do that,

00:49:47.006 --> 00:49:49.270 align:middle line:84%
that they were going
to leave in mass,

00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:53.490 align:middle line:84%
in one big blast of
white light in a sphere.

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And the leaving, they
felt, would pull us all up

00:49:55.610 --> 00:49:57.240 align:middle line:90%
into the southern level.

00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:58.040 align:middle line:90%
>>Who's they?

00:49:58.040 --> 00:49:59.730 align:middle line:90%
>>The ascended masters.

00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:01.680 align:middle line:84%
They were all going
to leave, all of them.

00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:04.020 align:middle line:84%
They were all going to go
onto a higher level in one

00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:05.769 align:middle line:90%
big expanding sphere of light.

00:50:05.769 --> 00:50:07.310 align:middle line:84%
From a third
dimensional way, there'd

00:50:07.310 --> 00:50:08.619 align:middle line:90%
would be a way to look at it.

00:50:08.619 --> 00:50:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And they were going to do that
somewhere between January 10th

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:13.290 align:middle line:90%
and January 19th.

00:50:13.290 --> 00:50:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And then by the
spring of 1991, we

00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:20.210 align:middle line:84%
would be in a whole
other level of existence.

00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:21.900 align:middle line:90%
But what happened?

00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:24.424 align:middle line:84%
And they realized as we started
to get closer and closer

00:50:24.424 --> 00:50:26.090 align:middle line:84%
and closer and we
start to get up there,

00:50:26.090 --> 00:50:29.800 align:middle line:84%
he goes, I don't know if
we're going to do this or not.

00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:32.200 align:middle line:84%
But look what
happened at that time.

00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And again, this was
spoken on video at least

00:50:34.890 --> 00:50:41.690 align:middle line:84%
two years earlier-- coming up
to the last week of August,

00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:45.560 align:middle line:84%
the entire world came
together to declare war

00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:50.490 align:middle line:90%
on one man, Saddam Hussein.

00:50:50.490 --> 00:50:56.310 align:middle line:84%
One man stopped-- we
came short by one person.

00:50:56.310 --> 00:51:02.510 align:middle line:84%
And then on January 15th, right
in the middle of the window,

00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:04.640 align:middle line:90%
the war began.

00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:09.070 align:middle line:84%
We attacked, which
was supposed to be

00:51:09.070 --> 00:51:10.830 align:middle line:90%
the time instead of polarity.

00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:13.760 align:middle line:84%
It was supposed to be the time
when we would come together.

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:15.271 align:middle line:90%
They saw this weeks before.

00:51:15.271 --> 00:51:17.270 align:middle line:84%
They said, I don't think
we're going to make it.

00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:18.570 align:middle line:90%
And so they changed the plan.

00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:20.261 align:middle line:90%
They held back.

00:51:20.261 --> 00:51:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't do it,
and they held back.

00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:23.910 align:middle line:90%
And they waited.

00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:25.880 align:middle line:90%
And they watched what happened.

00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And then by the
spring of 1991, we

00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:35.730 align:middle line:84%
had reached another level in a
way, but it was kind of a dud.

00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:37.890 align:middle line:90%
We didn't quite make it.

00:51:37.890 --> 00:51:40.870 align:middle line:90%
But we did reach critical mass.

00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:42.270 align:middle line:90%
That's was weird.

00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:44.970 align:middle line:84%
That was what was
really weird from higher

00:51:44.970 --> 00:51:47.130 align:middle line:90%
levels is that we reached it.

00:51:47.130 --> 00:51:50.880 align:middle line:84%
We have 500 million people that
were connected to the Christ

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:55.510 align:middle line:84%
consciousness grid, people
who had opened their hearts

00:51:55.510 --> 00:52:01.070 align:middle line:84%
and made changes in their
beingness in such a way

00:52:01.070 --> 00:52:05.050 align:middle line:84%
that there are certain changes
in their emotional mental,

00:52:05.050 --> 00:52:09.420 align:middle line:84%
physical, spiritual beingness
that they would go through.

00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:11.320 align:middle line:90%
They had made it.

00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:14.910 align:middle line:84%
Though we hadn't lived it yet,
they had reached that place.

00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:16.530 align:middle line:84%
They had connected
with the grid.

00:52:16.530 --> 00:52:19.660 align:middle line:84%
They have made a commitment,
you might say, within themselves

00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:22.170 align:middle line:90%
to go into a new way of being.

00:52:22.170 --> 00:52:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And it should by all
rights take place.

00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:26.480 align:middle line:90%
Didn't happen.

00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And the numbers kept growing and
growing and growing and growing

00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:33.800 align:middle line:90%
way past critical mass.

00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's sitting
here going, well.

00:52:38.610 --> 00:52:39.930 align:middle line:90%
Don't know what it means.

00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:42.330 align:middle line:84%
All we know is that
it's not happening,

00:52:42.330 --> 00:52:43.230 align:middle line:90%
but it should happen.

00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:44.810 align:middle line:90%
But it isn't happening.

00:52:44.810 --> 00:52:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And then the critical
mass grew so great

00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:53.473 align:middle line:84%
that in January
of 1992-- this is

00:52:53.473 --> 00:52:58.360 align:middle line:84%
what I started to say--
more than half of the world

00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:02.770 align:middle line:84%
had decided that they'd
had it with the old way

00:53:02.770 --> 00:53:05.590 align:middle line:84%
and had decided in
their hearts that they

00:53:05.590 --> 00:53:08.390 align:middle line:90%
wanted to take a new path.

00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:15.950 align:middle line:90%
And yet, it wasn't igniting.

00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:18.200 align:middle line:84%
It was doing something
totally different.

00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:19.952 align:middle line:84%
It was like a growth
pattern or something.

00:53:19.952 --> 00:53:24.550 align:middle line:90%


00:53:24.550 --> 00:53:28.017 align:middle line:84%
However, because we had
reached more than halfway--

00:53:28.017 --> 00:53:29.600 align:middle line:84%
in other words, the
light was stronger

00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:33.480 align:middle line:84%
than the dark-- at
that point, the Sirians

00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:38.900 align:middle line:84%
decided that we should
be given our power back

00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:41.630 align:middle line:84%
because the light
was now in control.

00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And so the programming
of the Earth--

00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:51.230 align:middle line:84%
in other words, how the events
take place in the world--

00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:54.560 align:middle line:90%
were given back to the Earth.

00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And so since January
of 1972 until now

00:53:58.100 --> 00:54:03.530 align:middle line:84%
what occurs on the planet is
up to us, completely up to us.

00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:05.600 align:middle line:84%
Whatever we think and
feel, if we could just

00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:09.180 align:middle line:84%
understand the nature
of the situation,

00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:12.370 align:middle line:84%
if enough people could just
understand the power that's

00:54:12.370 --> 00:54:16.260 align:middle line:84%
there right now, it could be
changed very, very rapidly

00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:19.060 align:middle line:90%
because it's really real.

00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:20.880 align:middle line:84%
This is important
to know something

00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:23.317 align:middle line:84%
about the balance of
power and the nature

00:54:23.317 --> 00:54:24.400 align:middle line:90%
of the dark and the light.

00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:27.620 align:middle line:90%


00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:30.320 align:middle line:84%
Remember Jesus said
something a long time ago.

00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:31.960 align:middle line:90%
He said, resist not evil.

00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:35.110 align:middle line:90%


00:54:35.110 --> 00:54:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And people have interpreted
that in all kinds of ways.

00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:46.120 align:middle line:84%
My interpretation of
that is that if you

00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:52.050 align:middle line:84%
try to stop something
that you think is evil,

00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:53.720 align:middle line:90%
you give it power.

00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:55.380 align:middle line:90%
You lend it strength.

00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:59.650 align:middle line:84%
You help create that
which it wants to create.

00:54:59.650 --> 00:55:01.970 align:middle line:84%
Though you may think
that you're stopping it.

00:55:01.970 --> 00:55:03.930 align:middle line:90%
And it's not the way.

00:55:03.930 --> 00:55:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And a good example of
that which I love to use

00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:13.670 align:middle line:84%
is one of the movie "The
Last Temptation of Christ"

00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:17.000 align:middle line:84%
because in that movie-- that
was just a grade B movie

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.855 align:middle line:84%
that if they'd had got their
money back on that one then

00:55:19.855 --> 00:55:23.150 align:middle line:90%
it would have been lucky.

00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:25.690 align:middle line:84%
But because the
Christians decided

00:55:25.690 --> 00:55:27.610 align:middle line:84%
that they didn't
like that movie,

00:55:27.610 --> 00:55:29.520 align:middle line:90%
they didn't listen to Jesus.

00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:31.160 align:middle line:90%
And they resisted it like crazy.

00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:31.993 align:middle line:90%
They went out there.

00:55:31.993 --> 00:55:34.800 align:middle line:90%
Don't see this movie.

00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And everybody went
and saw the movie

00:55:36.590 --> 00:55:39.030 align:middle line:90%
because they told them not to.

00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And if they hadn't
have done that-- what

00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:46.210 align:middle line:84%
they should have done, what
Jesus was trying to say is, OK.

00:55:46.210 --> 00:55:47.480 align:middle line:90%
You don't like something.

00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:48.690 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:55:48.690 --> 00:55:50.470 align:middle line:90%
Turn your back on it.

00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:52.450 align:middle line:90%
Put it behind you.

00:55:52.450 --> 00:55:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Put the evil behind you
and turn into the light

00:55:56.390 --> 00:56:00.170 align:middle line:84%
and create that which
you want to see happen.

00:56:00.170 --> 00:56:01.950 align:middle line:84%
So if they really
didn't like that movie,

00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:04.880 align:middle line:84%
they should have said
nothing and went out

00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:08.860 align:middle line:84%
with all that money and all that
energy and made their own movie

00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:12.540 align:middle line:84%
the way they really
wanted to show it.

00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:16.120 align:middle line:84%
And that would have been a
far more powerful statement.

00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:19.040 align:middle line:84%
Instead, it lent
power to the darkness.

00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
nature of the game.

00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:24.300 align:middle line:84%
Whenever the light tries
to stop the darkness,

00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:27.730 align:middle line:84%
it makes the darker
side stronger.

00:56:27.730 --> 00:56:31.850 align:middle line:84%
But you see now, the
roles have been switched,

00:56:31.850 --> 00:56:35.110 align:middle line:84%
and the light is now
stronger than the darkness.

00:56:35.110 --> 00:56:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And it is the nature
of the darkness

00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:39.400 align:middle line:90%
to try to stop the light.

00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And whenever the darkness
tries to stop the light now,

00:56:42.330 --> 00:56:44.550 align:middle line:90%
it lends power to the light.

00:56:44.550 --> 00:56:47.340 align:middle line:84%
It's a different role
because the balance of power

00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:48.680 align:middle line:90%
is different.

00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the
very effects of this

00:56:50.590 --> 00:56:54.590 align:middle line:84%
as the two polarities
begin to build up

00:56:54.590 --> 00:56:58.580 align:middle line:84%
by what happened in Russia when
the Communists, the dark side,

00:56:58.580 --> 00:57:02.040 align:middle line:84%
always tried to suppress the
people, suppress the people.

00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:05.726 align:middle line:84%
And it always worked
until just recently

00:57:05.726 --> 00:57:07.350 align:middle line:84%
when they tried to
suppress the people,

00:57:07.350 --> 00:57:09.370 align:middle line:84%
and it just came
right back at them

00:57:09.370 --> 00:57:11.160 align:middle line:84%
and was the very
thing that caused

00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:14.620 align:middle line:90%
the revolution in Russia.

00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:16.420 align:middle line:84%
The very people stood
up and said, no.

00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:18.410 align:middle line:84%
We're not going
to do it anymore.

00:57:18.410 --> 00:57:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And though it's not over with
yet and there's a lot going on,

00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:26.600 align:middle line:84%
the very thing that would have
normally worked didn't work.

00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And so because we're
in this unique flipped

00:57:30.670 --> 00:57:33.710 align:middle line:84%
around situation,
the Sirians and those

00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:36.810 align:middle line:84%
that are working with this
have opened up the whole thing

00:57:36.810 --> 00:57:43.030 align:middle line:84%
hoping that as we keep growing,
all those that are connected

00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:49.090 align:middle line:84%
to another way of being
where we love one another,

00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:51.300 align:middle line:90%
that love will take over.

00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And we'll start guiding
the events in the world.

00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And the more the dark resists,
the faster we would go.

00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:59.960 align:middle line:90%


00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:00.760 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:03.130 align:middle line:84%
He's got an a
question over there.

00:58:03.130 --> 00:58:04.362 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you got the answer.

00:58:04.362 --> 00:58:05.750 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:09.652 align:middle line:90%


00:58:09.652 --> 00:58:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>>We had this somewhat heated
discussion the other day

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:21.220 align:middle line:84%
about technology and its
dangers and the possible value

00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:25.645 align:middle line:84%
during the transition period
and its addicting nature

00:58:25.645 --> 00:58:27.451 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:58:27.451 --> 00:58:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And here, we have a case where
very sophisticated technologies

00:58:31.570 --> 00:58:39.140 align:middle line:84%
being used in an interventionary
manner to assist revolution

00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:41.944 align:middle line:90%
instead of to addict us further.

00:58:41.944 --> 00:58:43.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, it could be
argued that it's simply

00:58:43.610 --> 00:58:49.940 align:middle line:84%
extraordinary in that within
a duality based universe,

00:58:49.940 --> 00:58:53.110 align:middle line:84%
this kind of intervention is
OK to kind of get ourselves out

00:58:53.110 --> 00:58:54.550 align:middle line:90%
of the problem.

00:58:54.550 --> 00:58:56.170 align:middle line:84%
But from the way
you're describing it,

00:58:56.170 --> 00:59:00.710 align:middle line:84%
it seems that races
not even involved

00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:03.790 align:middle line:84%
with the Lucifer
rebellion are interested

00:59:03.790 --> 00:59:06.320 align:middle line:84%
because of this
speed of evolution

00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:07.790 align:middle line:90%
that it's facilitating.

00:59:07.790 --> 00:59:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And so the question is--
this is a question-- to me,

00:59:14.410 --> 00:59:20.050 align:middle line:84%
that seems to validate the
idea that if technology

00:59:20.050 --> 00:59:23.480 align:middle line:84%
is approached in a balanced way
where the heart is used just as

00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:27.110 align:middle line:84%
much as the mind, at least
in this transition period

00:59:27.110 --> 00:59:30.380 align:middle line:84%
it might be appropriate
in some forms.

00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:35.700 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, like I was trying
to say in the beginning,

00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:40.848 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to say
that doing it is wrong.

00:59:40.848 --> 00:59:47.490 align:middle line:90%


00:59:47.490 --> 00:59:52.570 align:middle line:84%
It's just personally,
my own personal thing,

00:59:52.570 --> 00:59:59.540 align:middle line:84%
I have chosen to go in a totally
non-technical possibility way.

00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:01.250 align:middle line:84%
There is an integration
taking place

01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:07.260 align:middle line:84%
it appears between the
Luciferian technical side

01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:12.590 align:middle line:84%
and the non-technical
other aspects side.

01:00:12.590 --> 01:00:15.890 align:middle line:84%
It appears to be that it
is the Lucifer rebellion

01:00:15.890 --> 01:00:17.850 align:middle line:84%
and it is the
technology of that which

01:00:17.850 --> 01:00:20.685 align:middle line:84%
seems to be triggering
this situation.

01:00:20.685 --> 01:00:27.040 align:middle line:90%


01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And it is beyond anybody
here or anyone anywhere.

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:44.180 align:middle line:90%


01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:46.740 align:middle line:84%
I think the most important
thing in all of this--

01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:49.240 align:middle line:84%
and this is the
real crux of it--

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:53.440 align:middle line:84%
is that a lot of the technology,
like what the Greys have,

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:55.000 align:middle line:90%
there was no heart.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.720 align:middle line:84%
There was no
feelings or emotions.

01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:01.540 align:middle line:84%
But in what you're
implying here is

01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:04.390 align:middle line:84%
that if technology could
be used with a heart,

01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:08.380 align:middle line:84%
with love, that
there may be a way.

01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:11.224 align:middle line:84%
And the Sirians appear
to be demonstrating that.

01:01:11.224 --> 01:01:12.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean the Sirians
are our father.

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:17.060 align:middle line:84%
We are deeply embedded
in the Lucifer rebellion.

01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:18.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure Christians
wouldn't even

01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:22.086 align:middle line:84%
want to consider that,
people who are like

01:01:22.086 --> 01:01:23.480 align:middle line:84%
born again Christians
and things,

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:26.910 align:middle line:84%
that we could possibly
part of Lucifer.

01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:28.690 align:middle line:90%
But we are in here.

01:01:28.690 --> 01:01:34.140 align:middle line:90%


01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not trying
to stop-- personally,

01:01:36.810 --> 01:01:38.210 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to stop either one.

01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:45.830 align:middle line:84%
I want to find this way between
all of it in the whole thing,

01:01:45.830 --> 01:01:50.810 align:middle line:84%
that there's got to be some
kind of path that can satisfy

01:01:50.810 --> 01:01:57.680 align:middle line:84%
the needs of those that have
taken that path and those that

01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:58.810 align:middle line:90%
have not.

01:01:58.810 --> 01:02:05.815 align:middle line:84%
And more than anything,
I'm just watching.

01:02:05.815 --> 01:02:08.880 align:middle line:84%
I am teaching the Merkaba
stuff because that

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:11.390 align:middle line:84%
was one of my instructions
on how to do this

01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:14.250 align:middle line:84%
because right now, we're
way out of balance if you

01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:15.960 align:middle line:90%
want to look at it that way.

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:17.700 align:middle line:84%
You have almost
100% of the people

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:20.620 align:middle line:84%
here totally involved
in the Lucifer thing,

01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:24.970 align:middle line:84%
and there's nobody balancing
out the other side.

01:02:24.970 --> 01:02:28.210 align:middle line:84%
We only have about
less than 8,000 people

01:02:28.210 --> 01:02:33.469 align:middle line:84%
that have taken the path of
non-technological aspect, which

01:02:33.469 --> 01:02:34.677 align:middle line:90%
we call the ascended masters.

01:02:34.677 --> 01:02:38.550 align:middle line:90%


01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:42.060 align:middle line:84%
I really don't know
what the answer is.

01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:44.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
it's going to lie.

01:02:44.690 --> 01:02:48.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm just like a reporter
here, just saying,

01:02:48.330 --> 01:02:50.410 align:middle line:90%
this is what's going on.

01:02:50.410 --> 01:02:53.570 align:middle line:90%
This is what I see.

01:02:53.570 --> 01:02:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to be
a reporter with heart,

01:02:56.620 --> 01:02:59.030 align:middle line:84%
hoping that there'll
be some kind of way

01:02:59.030 --> 01:03:02.579 align:middle line:84%
that we can all come out
of this in a good way.

01:03:02.579 --> 01:03:04.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, these people that
are prophesizing right now,

01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:08.694 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's anybody
that knows where we're going.

01:03:08.694 --> 01:03:10.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't think
anybody, [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:10.110 --> 01:03:14.940 align:middle line:84%
level of [INAUDIBLE] except for
God himself or herself knows

01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:17.200 align:middle line:90%
where this is taking us.

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:21.059 align:middle line:84%
But wherever it's taking us,
we're getting there real quick.

01:03:21.059 --> 01:03:23.350 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to have to
wait a long time on this one

01:03:23.350 --> 01:03:27.920 align:middle line:84%
because this one is like-- right
now, tens of thousands of years

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:33.480 align:middle line:84%
are going by every day on
Earth though we don't know it.

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:36.186 align:middle line:90%
And it's really going fast.

01:03:36.186 --> 01:03:38.058 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:03:38.058 --> 01:03:42.716 align:middle line:84%
>>Do you have an idea of why
these critical mass [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:42.716 --> 01:03:44.460 align:middle line:90%
didn't [INAUDIBLE]?

01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:46.500 align:middle line:90%
>>Not any.

01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:49.807 align:middle line:84%
This is the first time since
the beginning of creation

01:03:49.807 --> 01:03:50.890 align:middle line:90%
this has ever taken place.

01:03:50.890 --> 01:03:55.672 align:middle line:90%
So how can you ever-- who knows?

01:03:55.672 --> 01:03:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, the feeling is
that there's another part

01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:03.600 align:middle line:84%
of the program that hasn't been
revealed to us that is holding

01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:08.420 align:middle line:84%
this critical mass ignition back
so that all of them could go

01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:09.730 align:middle line:90%
rather than just a few--

01:04:09.730 --> 01:04:10.530 align:middle line:90%


01:04:10.530 --> 01:04:13.790 align:middle line:84%
>>It appears to be moving more
like cold fusion rather than

01:04:13.790 --> 01:04:15.340 align:middle line:90%
hot fusion.

01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:18.990 align:middle line:84%
It appears to be
a slow reaction.

01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:21.310 align:middle line:84%
It's a reaction, and it's
moving like a reaction.

01:04:21.310 --> 01:04:22.990 align:middle line:90%
It just isn't moving.

01:04:22.990 --> 01:04:26.240 align:middle line:84%
Instead of a big
[MAKES EXPLOSION SOUND],

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:30.800 align:middle line:84%
it's moving very strongly,
very powerfully, very directly,

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:33.050 align:middle line:90%
continually, nonstop.

01:04:33.050 --> 01:04:34.870 align:middle line:84%
No one's getting
in the way of it,

01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:36.310 align:middle line:90%
and it's just doing its thing.

01:04:36.310 --> 01:04:38.260 align:middle line:90%
And it's never been seen before.

01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:39.778 align:middle line:90%
That's all I can say.

01:04:39.778 --> 01:04:43.200 align:middle line:90%


01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:47.012 align:middle line:84%
>>These two overtones that
are full of all the observers,

01:04:47.012 --> 01:04:48.720 align:middle line:84%
they're looking at a
Christ consciousness

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:51.000 align:middle line:90%
grid around the earth.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.680 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:56.190 align:middle line:84%
That's what they're
interested in.

01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:56.990 align:middle line:90%
>>All right.

01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:59.720 align:middle line:84%
My question is are
they apprehensive

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:00.740 align:middle line:90%
or are they curious?

01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:02.540 align:middle line:90%
Are their thoughts affecting us?

01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And is there any chance that
that grid could be damaged?

01:05:05.070 --> 01:05:08.930 align:middle line:84%
>>There's a tremendous
sense of joy

01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:12.290 align:middle line:84%
because, you see, for so
long in the last four times

01:05:12.290 --> 01:05:17.240 align:middle line:84%
that someone has attempted
to do this, the last one

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:22.440 align:middle line:84%
being Lucifer, in the
first three times anyway,

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:29.760 align:middle line:84%
there was no answer from
God and from all life.

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:30.910 align:middle line:90%
Just everything fell apart.

01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:32.910 align:middle line:84%
There was pain, and
it was horrible.

01:05:32.910 --> 01:05:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And there was just
simply no answer.

01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:36.610 align:middle line:90%
Silence.

01:05:36.610 --> 01:05:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And since Lucifer has done
this one over the last 200,000

01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:42.040 align:middle line:90%
years, there's been no answer.

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:44.110 align:middle line:90%
It's been silence.

01:05:44.110 --> 01:05:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And so the silent majority who's
sitting there watching this

01:05:49.710 --> 01:05:54.660 align:middle line:84%
is just going, when is
God going to answer?

01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And there is no way to
see what the answer was

01:05:57.150 --> 01:06:02.030 align:middle line:84%
to this because they wanted
an answer to the situation.

01:06:02.030 --> 01:06:03.884 align:middle line:90%
And now we're getting an answer.

01:06:03.884 --> 01:06:06.050 align:middle line:84%
>>So we're really working
with two layers of support

01:06:06.050 --> 01:06:07.510 align:middle line:90%
around our grid then.

01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:08.380 align:middle line:90%
>>What do you mean.

01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:10.862 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, those
overtones, the people

01:06:10.862 --> 01:06:13.320 align:middle line:84%
you're saying that are all here
watching us, their support.

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:15.100 align:middle line:90%


01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:15.900 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh.

01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:16.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:19.650 align:middle line:84%
They're cheering us on
for sure because they

01:06:19.650 --> 01:06:23.390 align:middle line:84%
know that depending
on what happens to us,

01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:25.520 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
follow right behind us

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:29.420 align:middle line:84%
because this is what everybody
thinks is going to happen.

01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:32.241 align:middle line:84%
It looks like
whatever occurs there.

01:06:32.241 --> 01:06:33.990 align:middle line:84%
It would be kind of
like if you had a body

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:36.470 align:middle line:84%
and there was cancer
in it, and suddenly

01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:39.860 align:middle line:84%
an area in the
cancer-- and the cancer

01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:41.600 align:middle line:84%
not being the black
or the white side,

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:47.840 align:middle line:84%
but rather the situation--
and suddenly a healing

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:50.050 align:middle line:90%
starts taking place.

01:06:50.050 --> 01:06:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And everybody notices that
there's this rapid healing

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:54.956 align:middle line:90%
taking place in a certain area.

01:06:54.956 --> 01:06:57.769 align:middle line:84%
And it's really going
very, very rapidly,

01:06:57.769 --> 01:06:59.185 align:middle line:84%
so rapidly that
it's extraordinary

01:06:59.185 --> 01:07:00.575 align:middle line:90%
and never been seen before.

01:07:00.575 --> 01:07:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And if through
the consciousness,

01:07:01.950 --> 01:07:03.960 align:middle line:84%
the whole body's watching
on it, the body's

01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:08.800 align:middle line:84%
hoping that this situation
will spread throughout and heal

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:12.060 align:middle line:90%
the whole situation.

01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:13.370 align:middle line:90%
And so am I. I'm hoping too.

01:07:13.370 --> 01:07:16.140 align:middle line:90%


01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:18.730 align:middle line:90%
>>If the Sirians are the--

01:07:18.730 --> 01:07:19.530 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh.

01:07:19.530 --> 01:07:19.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:20.460 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:22.460 align:middle line:84%
You got to wave your hands
because all I can see

01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:23.750 align:middle line:90%
is speakers.

01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>>If the Sirians are
our father element

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:28.140 align:middle line:84%
and they are the
dolphins and stuff

01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:30.930 align:middle line:84%
and the dolphins learned how
to do the Merkaba over 200

01:07:30.930 --> 01:07:33.307 align:middle line:84%
years ago, then could
that be the element

01:07:33.307 --> 01:07:35.140 align:middle line:84%
that's really keeping
us together if there's

01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:37.300 align:middle line:90%
so many of them in the ocean?

01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>>You got an unusual
situation with the dolphins

01:07:40.550 --> 01:07:43.340 align:middle line:90%
and the whales.

01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:48.300 align:middle line:84%
They have more than
one kind of body form.

01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:50.710 align:middle line:84%
On their planet, they have
the dolphins and whales

01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:55.070 align:middle line:84%
and actually some other kinds
of cetacean type body forms,

01:07:55.070 --> 01:07:58.500 align:middle line:84%
but they also have
humanoid body forms.

01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:00.700 align:middle line:84%
It is dolphins-- the
ones in the water

01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:03.800 align:middle line:84%
have been able to
extract themselves out

01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:05.620 align:middle line:90%
of the technological side.

01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:07.260 align:middle line:84%
But the ones on
the land are still

01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:09.420 align:middle line:84%
involved in the
technological side of things.

01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:11.370 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones
that set this up.

01:08:11.370 --> 01:08:13.380 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't the dolphins
who set this up.

01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:14.780 align:middle line:90%


01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>>I know it wasn't
those who set it up.

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:22.795 align:middle line:84%
What my point was that since
there's so many of them here

01:08:22.795 --> 01:08:27.060 align:middle line:84%
and they are basically
a higher race than we

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:29.689 align:middle line:84%
are because they're
located on so many levels,

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:34.040 align:middle line:84%
couldn't it be them who are,
at least in part, responsible

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:36.520 align:middle line:90%
for us getting so far.

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:42.890 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, about all one race
can do to another race--

01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:47.120 align:middle line:84%
they can't-- I mean, the
dolphins can't interfere

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:49.049 align:middle line:90%
directly with us.

01:08:49.049 --> 01:08:51.410 align:middle line:84%
If we're going to do it,
we have to do it ourselves.

01:08:51.410 --> 01:08:55.060 align:middle line:84%
All they've been doing with us
is just being a perfect example

01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:59.500 align:middle line:84%
and loving us like crazy
and cheering us on.

01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:03.490 align:middle line:84%
There has been a few times where
they tried to give us answers

01:09:03.490 --> 01:09:08.771 align:middle line:84%
to things and stuff like this
when we've asked for answers.

01:09:08.771 --> 01:09:10.229 align:middle line:84%
They were real
involved with trying

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:12.460 align:middle line:84%
to get us to grow trees
for a while and things

01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:15.380 align:middle line:84%
like this because they
were scared and worried

01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:16.840 align:middle line:90%
about that kind of thing.

01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:18.850 align:middle line:90%


01:09:18.850 --> 01:09:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And the whales, which are
even much higher evolved

01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:25.649 align:middle line:84%
than the dolphins, their
interaction is even less.

01:09:25.649 --> 01:09:30.455 align:middle line:84%

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:34.010 align:middle line:90%
Which is just-- forget it.

01:17:34.010 --> 01:17:35.420 align:middle line:90%
Can't even talk about it.

01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:38.100 align:middle line:90%
It's just so outrageous.

01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:41.944 align:middle line:84%
And now it's looking
like we're all gone.

01:17:41.944 --> 01:17:43.912 align:middle line:84%
>>So the outer limits
of our consciousness

01:17:43.912 --> 01:17:45.110 align:middle line:90%
is already over the octave.

01:17:45.110 --> 01:17:45.910 align:middle line:90%
>>That's right.

01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:46.826 align:middle line:90%
We've already made it.

01:17:46.826 --> 01:17:48.789 align:middle line:90%
We're already over there.

01:17:48.789 --> 01:17:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And the ascended masters are
going over in groups of 32

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:52.740 align:middle line:90%
at a time.

01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Instead of making one big
blast to go off the Earth

01:17:55.870 --> 01:17:57.400 align:middle line:84%
and send us up into
the next level,

01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:00.920 align:middle line:84%
what they've decide to do is
to do kind of like cold fusion.

01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:03.410 align:middle line:84%
They're sending out
32 members at a time

01:18:03.410 --> 01:18:05.280 align:middle line:84%
all the way over
to the other side

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:12.030 align:middle line:84%
of the wall which pulls us all
up further in our awareness.

01:18:12.030 --> 01:18:15.970 align:middle line:84%
And they're timing these things
so that at the right moment,

01:18:15.970 --> 01:18:19.160 align:middle line:84%
we will keep making
these leaps to go over.

01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And what's looking like
now is that very soon, we

01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:26.620 align:middle line:84%
will make the initial stage
of going from the third

01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:28.270 align:middle line:90%
to the fourth dimension.

01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:32.750 align:middle line:84%
But today anyway-- it may
change tomorrow-- today,

01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:35.760 align:middle line:84%
it looks like we're going to
spend about two years there,

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:39.090 align:middle line:84%
which is just enough
time to become an adult.

01:18:39.090 --> 01:18:40.730 align:middle line:90%
And then [MAKES SWISHING NOISE].

01:18:40.730 --> 01:18:41.530 align:middle line:90%
Take off.

01:18:41.530 --> 01:18:42.330 align:middle line:90%
Go fifth.

01:18:42.330 --> 01:18:43.940 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:46.325 align:middle line:84%
Super streak through
the divisional levels.

01:18:46.325 --> 01:18:48.650 align:middle line:90%
>>So that's thanks to Lucifer.

01:18:48.650 --> 01:18:50.510 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

01:18:50.510 --> 01:18:52.600 align:middle line:90%
We've been resisting.

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:55.470 align:middle line:84%
Now we're finding out
that because of that,

01:18:55.470 --> 01:18:58.430 align:middle line:84%
we've [INAUDIBLE] further
and faster than ever possible

01:18:58.430 --> 01:18:59.760 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE].

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, on a more balanced way,
if you have to give thanks,

01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:10.840 align:middle line:84%
it's thanks to both the dark
and the white brotherhood

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:13.990 align:middle line:90%
for their dance that they have.

01:19:13.990 --> 01:19:16.380 align:middle line:84%
Because see, before
Lucifer and before Jesus,

01:19:16.380 --> 01:19:19.440 align:middle line:84%
there was no dance
in the same way.

01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:22.090 align:middle line:84%
There was a
homogeneous structure.

01:19:22.090 --> 01:19:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And when God polarized the two,
it made one on one side and one

01:19:26.330 --> 01:19:27.490 align:middle line:90%
on the other side.

01:19:27.490 --> 01:19:29.340 align:middle line:90%
He created the dance.

01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a person or
anything that did this.

01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:36.740 align:middle line:84%
It is the very creation
of the dance by God

01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:40.950 align:middle line:84%
that has created this
extraordinary situation that

01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:43.690 align:middle line:84%
is now taking what
has always been

01:19:43.690 --> 01:19:46.940 align:middle line:84%
a very slow process
into something

01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:48.370 align:middle line:90%
that is super accelerated.

01:19:48.370 --> 01:19:51.032 align:middle line:84%
Now, just because
it's super accelerated

01:19:51.032 --> 01:19:53.490 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean that it's positive
or negative, that it's good

01:19:53.490 --> 01:19:55.060 align:middle line:90%
or it's bad.

01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:58.480 align:middle line:84%
All we can say is that
it's different, definitely

01:19:58.480 --> 01:19:59.430 align:middle line:90%
different.

01:19:59.430 --> 01:20:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And the part about it that
I'm mostly happy about

01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:08.570 align:middle line:84%
is that what I can
see taking place here

01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:15.180 align:middle line:84%
is that it's now beyond
any of the players,

01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:16.730 align:middle line:90%
all the players in it.

01:20:16.730 --> 01:20:18.080 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond Lucifer.

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:19.000 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond Jesus.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.000 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond [INAUDIBLE].

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.699 align:middle line:84%
It's beyond all of
them, everybody,

01:20:21.699 --> 01:20:23.740 align:middle line:84%
beyond the Melchizedeks
They're all sitting there

01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:25.440 align:middle line:90%
going-- they've lost control.

01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:27.910 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:29.850 align:middle line:90%
They've lost control, really.

01:20:29.850 --> 01:20:32.360 align:middle line:90%
And God has stepped in.

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And something greater, greater
than all the levels of life,

01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:40.190 align:middle line:84%
all the hierarchy
of life, something

01:20:40.190 --> 01:20:43.260 align:middle line:84%
greater than this created
hierarchy has stepped forth

01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:48.320 align:middle line:90%
and is expressing itself.

01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And from my point of view,
I just say, go for it.

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:52.510 align:middle line:90%
Yay.

01:20:52.510 --> 01:20:55.480 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm not concerned about
life and death or anything else

01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:56.280 align:middle line:90%
like that.

01:20:56.280 --> 01:21:01.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm concerned about
healing on cosmic levels.

01:21:01.850 --> 01:21:05.952 align:middle line:84%
>>Could this be because--
this is kind of intermediate--

01:21:05.952 --> 01:21:11.220 align:middle line:84%
what you mean-- that because so
many people came to watch here

01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:15.186 align:middle line:84%
that they all became involved
and their evolution became

01:21:15.186 --> 01:21:17.496 align:middle line:90%
involved too so that--

01:21:17.496 --> 01:21:18.412 align:middle line:90%
>>Very, very possible.

01:21:18.412 --> 01:21:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>>That's why it's
affecting such a wide--

01:21:20.130 --> 01:21:22.730 align:middle line:84%
>>As far as the trigger,
you're probably correct.

01:21:22.730 --> 01:21:28.190 align:middle line:84%
Because whenever you bring
your attention somewhere,

01:21:28.190 --> 01:21:31.970 align:middle line:90%
that focuses energy.

01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:35.390 align:middle line:84%
We have a little instrument
that can do this.

01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:37.600 align:middle line:84%
I can shine this
instrument on you,

01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:40.700 align:middle line:84%
and you can think about
turning your little finger.

01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And then you could think
your attention up your arm.

01:21:44.010 --> 01:21:45.870 align:middle line:84%
We can track you on
a computer screen

01:21:45.870 --> 01:21:47.696 align:middle line:84%
as you're moving your
attention around.

01:21:47.696 --> 01:21:49.320 align:middle line:84%
You can sit there
and watch on a screen

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:50.654 align:middle line:90%
as you're moving your attention.

01:21:50.654 --> 01:21:52.194 align:middle line:84%
Though you're moving
it in your body,

01:21:52.194 --> 01:21:53.430 align:middle line:90%
you can see it on the screen.

01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:55.929 align:middle line:84%
So you can see that
it focuses energy.

01:21:55.929 --> 01:21:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And so you can
imagine-- I mean, that

01:21:57.470 --> 01:22:01.790 align:middle line:84%
was the part that I was
real intrigued about-- is

01:22:01.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:middle line:84%
that all of life, God
created a situation that

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:10.560 align:middle line:84%
was so interesting that all
of life had to look at it.

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And in looking at
it-- quantum physics

01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:16.450 align:middle line:90%
will tell you the same thing.

01:22:16.450 --> 01:22:19.470 align:middle line:84%
The person who
creates the experiment

01:22:19.470 --> 01:22:24.250 align:middle line:84%
affects the experiment by
the very act of attention

01:22:24.250 --> 01:22:27.040 align:middle line:90%
of looking at the experiment.

01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a rather
interesting situation

01:22:30.410 --> 01:22:31.850 align:middle line:90%
that has been developed.

01:22:31.850 --> 01:22:33.190 align:middle line:90%
I think it's beautiful.

01:22:33.190 --> 01:22:34.480 align:middle line:90%
I think it's great.

01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:36.770 align:middle line:84%
>>So when the first
critical mass was reached,

01:22:36.770 --> 01:22:39.871 align:middle line:84%
it was no longer the situation
because so many more--

01:22:39.871 --> 01:22:41.912 align:middle line:84%
that's why the next one
[INAUDIBLE] because there

01:22:41.912 --> 01:22:45.395 align:middle line:84%
was so many more people
involved than originally.

01:22:45.395 --> 01:22:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>>Let me just say
one more thing.

01:22:46.770 --> 01:22:49.145 align:middle line:84%
This is why all the
prophecies and everything

01:22:49.145 --> 01:22:53.750 align:middle line:84%
that came in before 1972--
and I think all of them

01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:55.556 align:middle line:84%
without exception,
but we'll just

01:22:55.556 --> 01:22:57.680 align:middle line:84%
talk about ones that aren't
quite so controversial,

01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:01.270 align:middle line:90%
like Edgar Cayce for example.

01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:04.590 align:middle line:84%
He had over 12,000
predictions and was only wrong

01:23:04.590 --> 01:23:08.870 align:middle line:84%
in one thing, one
tiny little thing.

01:23:08.870 --> 01:23:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And then after
1972, he went down.

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:15.420 align:middle line:84%
He started becoming wrong
on all kinds of things.

01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And the same way
with Nostradamus.

01:23:19.650 --> 01:23:23.180 align:middle line:84%
He was about 80%
right until 1972,

01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:25.020 align:middle line:84%
and then his
following was way off.

01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think that if you start
looking at all the predictions

01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:30.520 align:middle line:84%
that were made prior to
1972-- because it was

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:33.420 align:middle line:84%
before this thing
was injected-- they

01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:35.460 align:middle line:84%
would have probably
been right if things

01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:36.950 align:middle line:90%
would have continue on.

01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:40.220 align:middle line:90%
But time space had been altered.

01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And so now, to make
a prediction now,

01:23:45.570 --> 01:23:52.750 align:middle line:84%
is really presumptuous
because if you really

01:23:52.750 --> 01:23:55.670 align:middle line:84%
see the situation,
it's moving so fast.

01:23:55.670 --> 01:23:58.300 align:middle line:90%


01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:00.980 align:middle line:84%
You can't say, well,
we're here now.

01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And look down the
time tunnel and say

01:24:03.790 --> 01:24:07.370 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be here real
soon because who knows.

01:24:07.370 --> 01:24:09.450 align:middle line:84%
We may not even be
involved in time real soon.

01:24:09.450 --> 01:24:13.220 align:middle line:90%


01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:14.050 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows.

01:24:14.050 --> 01:24:14.850 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows.

01:24:14.850 --> 01:24:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And so your predictions
could be anything.

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:18.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
predicting anything

01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:20.720 align:middle line:90%
for sure because I don't know.

01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:23.280 align:middle line:84%
All I can do is, when I
talk about these things

01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:26.630 align:middle line:84%
that we're about to talk about,
I can just say what I think,

01:24:26.630 --> 01:24:28.576 align:middle line:90%
what I know usually happens.

01:24:28.576 --> 01:24:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'll keep telling
you over and over

01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:31.574 align:middle line:84%
and over it doesn't
have anything

01:24:31.574 --> 01:24:32.910 align:middle line:90%
to do with what may happen.

01:24:32.910 --> 01:24:36.100 align:middle line:84%
But what I do believe is many
part of the predictions were

01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:38.994 align:middle line:84%
is that we were going to come
into a very violent time,

01:24:38.994 --> 01:24:40.160 align:middle line:90%
that there was going to be--

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:41.092 align:middle line:90%
>>Armageddon.

01:24:41.092 --> 01:24:42.024 align:middle line:90%
>>Huh?

01:24:42.024 --> 01:24:42.824 align:middle line:90%
>>Armageddon.

01:24:42.824 --> 01:24:43.624 align:middle line:90%


01:24:43.624 --> 01:24:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>>Even before the
Armageddon-- or no.

01:24:45.740 --> 01:24:46.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:47.400 align:middle line:90%
Two violent times.

01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:49.090 align:middle line:84%
We were going to
have Armageddon.

01:24:49.090 --> 01:24:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And number two, we were going
to have whole continents going

01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:57.050 align:middle line:84%
up and down and all this kind
of stuff and mass destruction

01:24:57.050 --> 01:25:00.260 align:middle line:90%
on all kinds of levels.

01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:02.570 align:middle line:84%
I really seriously
doubt if that's

01:25:02.570 --> 01:25:06.170 align:middle line:84%
going to occur at
this point primarily

01:25:06.170 --> 01:25:14.652 align:middle line:84%
because the forces of Armageddon
are more closely aligned

01:25:14.652 --> 01:25:15.610 align:middle line:90%
than they've ever been.

01:25:15.610 --> 01:25:17.160 align:middle line:90%
Though that may change.

01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And also, the fact
that the light

01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:26.540 align:middle line:84%
is now stronger and
controlling the events

01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:28.025 align:middle line:84%
where event originally
it was going

01:25:28.025 --> 01:25:29.400 align:middle line:84%
to be that the
darkness was going

01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:31.440 align:middle line:90%
to be in control at the time.

01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And there was the chaotic
aspect of ourselves.

01:25:35.210 --> 01:25:41.030 align:middle line:90%


01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:44.890 align:middle line:84%
I just think that we may
find that we may create

01:25:44.890 --> 01:25:48.990 align:middle line:84%
a situation that we move up into
the time when the poles shift,

01:25:48.990 --> 01:25:52.131 align:middle line:90%
and they will shift, I believe.

01:25:52.131 --> 01:25:54.470 align:middle line:84%
But we may move
into that situation

01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:58.860 align:middle line:84%
with none of the normal violence
that was associated with it.

01:25:58.860 --> 01:26:00.470 align:middle line:90%
It may be very, very smooth.

01:26:00.470 --> 01:26:02.760 align:middle line:84%
That has both a positive
and negative side too,

01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:08.740 align:middle line:84%
and that is it means we might
not have any warning or very

01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:11.530 align:middle line:90%
little warning.

01:26:11.530 --> 01:26:15.180 align:middle line:84%
It just may happen
very, very quickly.

01:26:15.180 --> 01:26:16.260 align:middle line:90%
I don't know for sure.

01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:19.800 align:middle line:84%
I'll try to explain all that I
can possibly explain about what

01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:21.460 align:middle line:90%
I know about what may happen.

01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:25.979 align:middle line:90%

01:26:28.804 --> 01:26:30.220 align:middle line:84%

01:26:30.220 --> 01:26:31.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:33.230 align:middle line:90%
Which they never dreamed.

01:26:33.230 --> 01:26:35.300 align:middle line:84%
In all their calculations
and everything else

01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:38.360 align:middle line:84%
like that, they never
dreamed that they

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:41.260 align:middle line:90%
would be able to go until 1993.

01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:42.730 align:middle line:90%
They just didn't.

01:26:42.730 --> 01:26:46.315 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't even conceive of
being able to hold that field

01:26:46.315 --> 01:26:47.115 align:middle line:90%
that long.

01:26:47.115 --> 01:26:50.030 align:middle line:84%
>>Is it like a holographic
field [INAUDIBLE]?

01:26:50.030 --> 01:26:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>>It's a hologram, and they
are creating a separate reality

01:26:54.740 --> 01:27:01.560 align:middle line:84%
on it and not directly
connected to the actual reality

01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:04.220 align:middle line:84%
outside of it from which
everyone's looking in at.

01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>>It's like a holodome.

01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.790 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:27:06.790 --> 01:27:08.420 align:middle line:90%
With a holodeck on Star Trek.

01:27:08.420 --> 01:27:09.940 align:middle line:90%
That kind of thing.

01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:11.392 align:middle line:84%
Much more
sophisticated than even

01:27:11.392 --> 01:27:12.600 align:middle line:90%
what they were conceiving of.

01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:13.556 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:27:13.556 --> 01:27:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>>So what happened to the Earth
we knew of before the hologram.

01:27:16.770 --> 01:27:19.980 align:middle line:84%
>>This is the Earth that
we still knew of then.

01:27:19.980 --> 01:27:21.530 align:middle line:90%
And these are our bodies.

01:27:21.530 --> 01:27:24.040 align:middle line:90%


01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And they're only
here interfering

01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:33.250 align:middle line:84%
with very subtle certain aspects
of the Earth in terms of right

01:27:33.250 --> 01:27:34.980 align:middle line:84%
here on the surface
of the Earth.

01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Most of the hologram
is extraterrestrial

01:27:38.170 --> 01:27:41.665 align:middle line:90%
and in space protecting--

01:27:41.665 --> 01:27:45.800 align:middle line:90%


01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>>So we can't see
the sun exploding?

01:27:47.300 --> 01:27:47.790 align:middle line:90%
>>We can't.

01:27:47.790 --> 01:27:48.990 align:middle line:90%
That's the main thing.

01:27:48.990 --> 01:27:50.690 align:middle line:90%
We just aren't ready.

01:27:50.690 --> 01:27:55.114 align:middle line:90%
But we will have to probably.

01:27:55.114 --> 01:27:57.280 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get to the
place where the Earth will

01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:00.030 align:middle line:84%
get strong enough and
the kinds of things

01:28:00.030 --> 01:28:03.770 align:middle line:84%
that we are talking about
here will become every day.

01:28:03.770 --> 01:28:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And we will all be aware how
powerful our thoughts are

01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:11.610 align:middle line:84%
and our feelings and that they
create the very light worlds

01:28:11.610 --> 01:28:15.500 align:middle line:84%
that we're in, at
which point we may

01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:21.360 align:middle line:84%
take the responsibility
of the expanding sun

01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:24.310 align:middle line:84%
and probably experience it
from the surface out more

01:28:24.310 --> 01:28:25.110 align:middle line:90%
than likely.

01:28:25.110 --> 01:28:25.943 align:middle line:90%
Though I don't know.

01:28:25.943 --> 01:28:27.150 align:middle line:90%


01:28:27.150 --> 01:28:30.850 align:middle line:84%
I can see how that we
would experience this.

01:28:30.850 --> 01:28:40.960 align:middle line:84%
We would accept the experience
of this, take on its effects,

01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:42.100 align:middle line:90%
and go on from there.

01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:44.340 align:middle line:84%
Because you see, the
sun, if tuned to,

01:28:44.340 --> 01:28:50.150 align:middle line:84%
if consciousness can tune to the
heat of the sun, it isn't hot.

01:28:50.150 --> 01:28:54.110 align:middle line:84%
It's just light,
and it's beautiful.

01:28:54.110 --> 01:28:56.830 align:middle line:84%
It's beautiful you can
go right into the sun.

01:28:56.830 --> 01:28:58.660 align:middle line:90%
I've done it.

01:28:58.660 --> 01:29:01.170 align:middle line:90%
I've flown a ship into the sun.

01:29:01.170 --> 01:29:03.229 align:middle line:90%
I know what it is.

01:29:03.229 --> 01:29:05.312 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just tuning
the ship, everybody on it

01:29:05.312 --> 01:29:06.010 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

01:29:06.010 --> 01:29:07.926 align:middle line:84%
You got to tune the
consciousness right to it,

01:29:07.926 --> 01:29:10.060 align:middle line:90%
and you can just go right in.

01:29:10.060 --> 01:29:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And the sun is not
what you think.

01:29:12.590 --> 01:29:16.250 align:middle line:84%
It's as infinite inside
the sun as it is outside.

01:29:16.250 --> 01:29:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And space is connected
inside as well as outside.

01:29:19.330 --> 01:29:22.450 align:middle line:90%


01:29:22.450 --> 01:29:25.780 align:middle line:84%
The time that it takes to
get from Sirius A to our sun

01:29:25.780 --> 01:29:30.620 align:middle line:84%
is about 90 seconds
going inside the sun.

01:29:30.620 --> 01:29:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>>I don't understand why
the ozone layer and the rays

01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:35.660 align:middle line:84%
of the sun going
through the ozone

01:29:35.660 --> 01:29:37.830 align:middle line:84%
layer, why is it
so harmful to us?

01:29:37.830 --> 01:29:42.540 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, because they're they
are allowing the program

01:29:42.540 --> 01:29:45.360 align:middle line:84%
to continue on as
close to possible

01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:48.090 align:middle line:84%
as what would happen if
nothing was going on.

01:29:48.090 --> 01:29:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And so now it's up to us to try
to change the programming back

01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:55.890 align:middle line:84%
and revert all
these patterns back.

01:29:55.890 --> 01:29:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>>So there's no ocean
that's polluted out there?

01:29:58.100 --> 01:29:58.740 align:middle line:90%
It's just [? the moon? ?]

01:29:58.740 --> 01:29:59.030 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

01:29:59.030 --> 01:30:00.865 align:middle line:84%
There is a polluted
ocean out there.

01:30:00.865 --> 01:30:05.090 align:middle line:90%


01:30:05.090 --> 01:30:09.040 align:middle line:84%
See, the nature of the
reality behind the hologram

01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:11.350 align:middle line:90%
is very similar.

01:30:11.350 --> 01:30:15.090 align:middle line:84%
It's also a functions
that is really--

01:30:15.090 --> 01:30:17.770 align:middle line:90%
remember it started in nothing.

01:30:17.770 --> 01:30:18.710 align:middle line:90%
It's just thoughts.

01:30:18.710 --> 01:30:19.920 align:middle line:90%
It's just feelings.

01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:21.711 align:middle line:84%
If you want to call it
any of those things.

01:30:21.711 --> 01:30:22.710 align:middle line:90%
It's psychic energy.

01:30:22.710 --> 01:30:24.180 align:middle line:90%
It's the movement of spirit.

01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:27.050 align:middle line:84%
It's what created the whole
thing in the first place.

01:30:27.050 --> 01:30:28.694 align:middle line:84%
So even what's
behind what we call--

01:30:28.694 --> 01:30:31.110 align:middle line:84%
if you're thinking like this
is a hologram and then what's

01:30:31.110 --> 01:30:34.800 align:middle line:84%
behind there is real stuff,
it isn't exactly that way.

01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:38.520 align:middle line:90%


01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:44.180 align:middle line:84%
>>Is that like when the masters
say that the relative existence

01:30:44.180 --> 01:30:45.310 align:middle line:90%
is an illusion.

01:30:45.310 --> 01:30:47.730 align:middle line:84%
Are they referring
to the hologram,

01:30:47.730 --> 01:30:51.540 align:middle line:84%
or are they referring to the
duality of the double helix?

01:30:51.540 --> 01:30:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>>Most of the people who said
that when they called it Maya

01:30:55.580 --> 01:30:58.245 align:middle line:84%
did not know or even
conceive of the situation

01:30:58.245 --> 01:30:59.690 align:middle line:90%
that we were in now.

01:30:59.690 --> 01:31:01.440 align:middle line:84%
They were referring
to the very reality

01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:04.420 align:middle line:90%
itself, which is just light.

01:31:04.420 --> 01:31:06.165 align:middle line:90%
It's illusion.

01:31:06.165 --> 01:31:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And so what we have just
done is create an illusion

01:31:08.290 --> 01:31:09.250 align:middle line:90%
within an illusion.

01:31:09.250 --> 01:31:10.050 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:31:10.050 --> 01:31:12.440 align:middle line:84%
So the illusion behind
the created illusion

01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:13.360 align:middle line:90%
is an illusion.

01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:14.290 align:middle line:90%
>>That's right.

01:31:14.290 --> 01:31:15.320 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:18.560 align:middle line:84%
That illusion and
that illusion is

01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:23.504 align:middle line:84%
the duality of the self
is separate from itself,

01:31:23.504 --> 01:31:24.440 align:middle line:90%
the double helix.

01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:31.040 align:middle line:90%


01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:31.840 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:33.750 align:middle line:84%
I think so, from
that point of view.

01:31:33.750 --> 01:31:34.550 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

Lucifer and Jesus

01:31:38.170 --> 01:31:46.060 align:middle line:84%

it forced people

01:32:39.340 --> 01:32:40.850 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

01:32:40.850 --> 01:32:43.066 align:middle line:84%
If it's out of God's
control, we'd be in trouble.

01:32:43.066 --> 01:32:44.940 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

01:32:44.940 --> 01:32:47.390 align:middle line:84%
Because that's us on the
outside of the system.

01:32:47.390 --> 01:32:49.099 align:middle line:84%
With us out on the
outside of the system,

01:32:49.099 --> 01:32:51.556 align:middle line:84%
not outside of this system and
outside of the other system,

01:32:51.556 --> 01:32:53.210 align:middle line:84%
outside the other
system, all the

01:32:53.210 --> 01:32:55.140 align:middle line:84%
outside the entire
waveform universe and all

01:32:55.140 --> 01:32:57.860 align:middle line:84%
the dimensional levels,
outside all the entire

01:32:57.860 --> 01:33:02.782 align:middle line:84%
created infinite structure,
outside of all of it.

01:33:02.782 --> 01:33:04.240 align:middle line:84%
The guy watching
the TV when you're

01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:07.040 align:middle line:90%
watching that pattern up there.

01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:09.850 align:middle line:84%
Outside of that whole
thing, that aspect

01:33:09.850 --> 01:33:12.613 align:middle line:84%
appears to be what is
interfering directly.

01:33:12.613 --> 01:33:17.470 align:middle line:90%


01:33:17.470 --> 01:33:22.540 align:middle line:84%
It may be that we, before
we created this whole thing,

01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:26.400 align:middle line:84%
planted this little seed and
started the whole pattern.

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And then at the right
time, we on the other side

01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:34.254 align:middle line:84%
put in the two components of the
positive and negative aspects,

01:33:34.254 --> 01:33:35.670 align:middle line:84%
knowing that
eventually they would

01:33:35.670 --> 01:33:39.050 align:middle line:84%
come down and find this little
thing and do this little thing.

01:33:39.050 --> 01:33:40.882 align:middle line:84%
But what the intent
is beyond now

01:33:40.882 --> 01:33:44.410 align:middle line:84%
and on the other side, where
we sat before we came in,

01:33:44.410 --> 01:33:46.250 align:middle line:90%
I can't second guess that.

01:33:46.250 --> 01:33:47.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:33:47.050 --> 01:33:48.091 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I just work here.

01:33:48.091 --> 01:33:55.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any control
in those levels over there.

01:33:55.640 --> 01:33:59.720 align:middle line:84%
It is me from my point of view,
but I have surrendered that

01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:01.130 align:middle line:90%
to that aspect of me.

01:34:01.130 --> 01:34:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm here to
experience what it is

01:34:04.750 --> 01:34:06.150 align:middle line:90%
that I've placed myself into.

01:34:06.150 --> 01:34:10.260 align:middle line:90%


01:34:10.260 --> 01:34:12.990 align:middle line:90%
And we're all equal in this way.

01:34:12.990 --> 01:34:15.140 align:middle line:84%
I just happen to have
my memory at the moment,

01:34:15.140 --> 01:34:17.490 align:middle line:84%
but you're all going to have
your memory pretty soon too

01:34:17.490 --> 01:34:22.760 align:middle line:84%
if you don't already
getting it, at which point

01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:24.850 align:middle line:84%
we all go back to
one place back there.

01:34:24.850 --> 01:34:25.989 align:middle line:90%
We're all the same.

01:34:25.989 --> 01:34:27.530 align:middle line:84%
We're just reflections
of each other.

01:34:27.530 --> 01:34:30.140 align:middle line:90%
We're like mirrors.

01:34:30.140 --> 01:34:33.140 align:middle line:84%
>>Drunvalo, whatever
happened to the Merkaba that

01:34:33.140 --> 01:34:35.280 align:middle line:84%
went out of control
that they were trying

01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:37.205 align:middle line:90%
to get back and stabilize?

01:34:37.205 --> 01:34:38.205 align:middle line:90%
And where does it exist?

01:34:38.205 --> 01:34:40.685 align:middle line:84%
Is it just in another
space-time continuum?

01:34:40.685 --> 01:34:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And will what we're doing here
eventually neutralize that?

01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:49.812 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, they themselves,
according to the angels,

01:34:49.812 --> 01:34:50.812 align:middle line:90%
will heal the situation.

01:34:50.812 --> 01:34:53.630 align:middle line:90%


01:34:53.630 --> 01:34:55.679 align:middle line:84%
The Greys and the
secret government

01:34:55.679 --> 01:34:57.220 align:middle line:84%
and all those that
started that stuff

01:34:57.220 --> 01:34:58.636 align:middle line:84%
and the [? Martian ?]
[INAUDIBLE],

01:34:58.636 --> 01:35:02.640 align:middle line:84%
that whole complex, life always
wants whoever started something

01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:06.500 align:middle line:84%
to clean it up if at all
possible so that they can learn

01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:08.440 align:middle line:84%
the lesson from whatever
it was that did it

01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:10.050 align:middle line:90%
rather than someone else coming.

01:35:10.050 --> 01:35:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Non-interference has
always been the best wisdom

01:35:13.250 --> 01:35:14.990 align:middle line:90%
in all this stuff.

01:35:14.990 --> 01:35:17.710 align:middle line:84%
Like when I saw Duncan,
I saw exactly how

01:35:17.710 --> 01:35:18.690 align:middle line:90%
to solve this problem.

01:35:18.690 --> 01:35:21.340 align:middle line:84%
I could have probably done
it in maybe five minutes.

01:35:21.340 --> 01:35:24.010 align:middle line:90%
But they would let me touch it.

01:35:24.010 --> 01:35:25.900 align:middle line:90%
And then later, I asked why.

01:35:25.900 --> 01:35:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And they said, because they
will solve their own problem

01:35:28.670 --> 01:35:33.200 align:middle line:84%
right at the very, very
end of this whole thing.

01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:35.010 align:middle line:90%
They will figure it out.

01:35:35.010 --> 01:35:36.906 align:middle line:90%
And so I let it go.

01:35:36.906 --> 01:35:38.406 align:middle line:84%
This is the same
way in healing when

01:35:38.406 --> 01:35:40.820 align:middle line:90%
we start talking about healing.

01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:44.180 align:middle line:84%
You got to ask permission and
get permission from the person,

01:35:44.180 --> 01:35:47.040 align:middle line:84%
and then from my way of
looking, from their higher self,

01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:49.060 align:middle line:90%
in all these ways.

01:35:49.060 --> 01:35:54.580 align:middle line:84%
When I used to be involved in
healing, about maybe 40% or 50%

01:35:54.580 --> 01:35:58.210 align:middle line:84%
of the time, at least 50% of
the time, I would get a no.

01:35:58.210 --> 01:36:01.040 align:middle line:90%
Don't interfere.

01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:04.500 align:middle line:84%
But about 50% of the time,
I would get to go ahead.

01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:06.510 align:middle line:90%
It was OK.

01:36:06.510 --> 01:36:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And I've been noticing that as
we become more and more evolved

01:36:09.810 --> 01:36:13.450 align:middle line:84%
here, that I keep getting
permission less and less

01:36:13.450 --> 01:36:15.680 align:middle line:90%
and less and less and less.

01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And now I hardly
ever get permission.

01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:18.660 align:middle line:90%
Hardly ever.

01:36:18.660 --> 01:36:19.460 align:middle line:90%
I ask.

01:36:19.460 --> 01:36:19.790 align:middle line:90%
Nope.

01:36:19.790 --> 01:36:20.746 align:middle line:90%
Get out of the way.

01:36:20.746 --> 01:36:22.806 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

01:36:22.806 --> 01:36:23.690 align:middle line:90%


01:36:23.690 --> 01:36:26.195 align:middle line:84%
And I just got permission
recently from one person,

01:36:26.195 --> 01:36:30.350 align:middle line:84%
the first time in over a year,
from this about 75-year-old man

01:36:30.350 --> 01:36:31.260 align:middle line:90%
who has cataracts.

01:36:31.260 --> 01:36:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't believe that they
said I could have permission

01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:35.950 align:middle line:90%
to do anything like this.

01:36:35.950 --> 01:36:40.760 align:middle line:84%
But generally, I get an
absolute no on everything

01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:45.440 align:middle line:84%
because we all have
within us the ability,

01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:48.880 align:middle line:84%
really have the ability to
deal with the situation,

01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:52.070 align:middle line:90%
whatever it is.

01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And in the dealing
with that situation,

01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:58.480 align:middle line:90%
we gain our strength.

01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:06.880 align:middle line:84%
It's like I had a woman, a
friend of mine, who had a baby,

01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:09.700 align:middle line:84%
and the baby died
in her stomach.

01:37:09.700 --> 01:37:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And she got an infection that
went throughout her whole body.

01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:16.005 align:middle line:90%


01:37:16.005 --> 01:37:19.150 align:middle line:84%
They give her less
than 24 hours to live.

01:37:19.150 --> 01:37:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought she
was going to die.

01:37:22.170 --> 01:37:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And I went to her, and I
asked her if I could help.

01:37:25.980 --> 01:37:27.980 align:middle line:90%
And she said yes.

01:37:27.980 --> 01:37:32.527 align:middle line:84%
So I went back home to try so I
could be quiet where I did this

01:37:32.527 --> 01:37:34.360 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't
matter where you are when

01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:35.526 align:middle line:90%
you do these kind of things.

01:37:35.526 --> 01:37:38.070 align:middle line:90%


01:37:38.070 --> 01:37:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And I called her higher
self and her higher self

01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:44.440 align:middle line:84%
was very adamant for me to
stay out of the way and not

01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:46.110 align:middle line:90%
to help at all.

01:37:46.110 --> 01:37:47.990 align:middle line:84%
I never had a
higher self quite be

01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:52.705 align:middle line:84%
that aggressive and
[INAUDIBLE], but it made certain

01:37:52.705 --> 01:37:53.810 align:middle line:90%
that I did not do a thing.

01:37:53.810 --> 01:37:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I stepped
back, and I assumed

01:37:55.330 --> 01:37:56.413 align:middle line:90%
that she was going to die.

01:37:56.413 --> 01:38:00.570 align:middle line:90%


01:38:00.570 --> 01:38:01.636 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's OK to die.

01:38:01.636 --> 01:38:03.010 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
wrong with dying.

01:38:03.010 --> 01:38:05.180 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing wrong
with that at all.

01:38:05.180 --> 01:38:05.980 align:middle line:90%
There is no death.

01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:07.425 align:middle line:90%
There's just transformation.

01:38:07.425 --> 01:38:10.030 align:middle line:84%
It just means that person was
going to leave at that time,

01:38:10.030 --> 01:38:13.460 align:middle line:84%
and I thought that's
what was going to happen.

01:38:13.460 --> 01:38:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And everybody thought that's
what was going to happen.

01:38:15.930 --> 01:38:19.510 align:middle line:84%
But what did happen was
she did it all by herself.

01:38:19.510 --> 01:38:25.550 align:middle line:84%
She got right up to the place
where she was going to die.

01:38:25.550 --> 01:38:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And then it struck her
that her body was light,

01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:32.040 align:middle line:84%
and she just totally
reversed the situation

01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:37.410 align:middle line:84%
and in like three days,
walked out of the hospital

01:38:37.410 --> 01:38:40.450 align:middle line:84%
and was really a
different person.

01:38:40.450 --> 01:38:45.220 align:middle line:84%
She just was completely
changed from the experience.

01:38:45.220 --> 01:38:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw the wisdom in why
I wasn't supposed to interfere.

01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:52.300 align:middle line:90%
