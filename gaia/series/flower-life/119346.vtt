00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.944 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:01.944 --> 00:00:16.038 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.038 --> 00:00:18.420 align:middle line:10%
>>This is the symbol
for that school.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.170 align:middle line:10%
Though they wouldn't let
me draw the symbol exactly

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.380 align:middle line:10%
as it should be.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.510 align:middle line:10%
And to do it properly, the
area inside of this circle

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.010 align:middle line:10%
should be gold.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.260 align:middle line:10%
It's actually the
right Eye of Horus,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.810 align:middle line:10%
on the surface of its
solar disk, which was

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.140 align:middle line:10%
the symbol for their religion.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.010 align:middle line:90%
It begins in this way.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.620 align:middle line:84%
Both the Christian and
the Egyptian religions

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.610 align:middle line:84%
have certain things in
common, like I said.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.800 align:middle line:84%
They have another
thing in common,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.450 align:middle line:84%
having to do with
Creation itself.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.510 align:middle line:84%
Both of these religions
believe that everything

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.415 align:middle line:90%
came from nothing.

00:00:55.415 --> 00:00:58.320 align:middle line:90%


00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.831 align:middle line:90%
I'll read.

00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:04.090 align:middle line:84%
They believe that it came
from the void, the Great Void.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.410 align:middle line:84%
The Christians call it the
Great Void, or just the Void,

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.400 align:middle line:84%
whereas the Egyptians
called it the Duat.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take
my glasses off here.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.050 align:middle line:90%
Chapter one.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.010 align:middle line:90%
This is of Genesis.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:25.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to read the first
three numbers of chapter one.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And it says, "In
the beginning, God

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.060 align:middle line:90%
created the heaven and earth."

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.310 align:middle line:84%
So we don't know who
God is, but that's

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.920 align:middle line:84%
who created the
heaven and the earth.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Number two-- "And the Earth
was without form, and void,

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.930 align:middle line:84%
and darkness was upon
the face of the deep.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And the spirit of God moved
upon the face of the waters."

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And then immediately
after that, number three,

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.260 align:middle line:84%
it says, "And God said,
let there be light.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:02.117 align:middle line:90%
And there was light."

00:02:02.117 --> 00:02:03.200 align:middle line:90%
There's a statement in it.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.790 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you see
that in the beginning

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.410 align:middle line:84%
the earth was void
and without form.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.210 align:middle line:90%
It was nothing.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.750 align:middle line:90%
Voidness is nothing.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
thing that happened

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.110 align:middle line:84%
is the spirit of God moved
upon the face of the waters,

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.750 align:middle line:90%
or the deep.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And then this movement,
immediately after the movement,

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.259 align:middle line:90%
he said, let there be light.

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:26.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, from an Egyptian
point of view,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.420 align:middle line:84%
this is a very simplified
version of their belief.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And that there is something
missing in this belief.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.270 align:middle line:84%
Which from a physicist
point of view,

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.470 align:middle line:84%
would absolutely
have to be there.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.390 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise this could
not take place.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.360 align:middle line:84%
This is impossible,
absolutely impossible,

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.160 align:middle line:90%
from a physical point of view.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.850 align:middle line:84%
In the sense that
if you have again,

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.000 align:middle line:84%
there's 144 different
kinds of voidness.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.590 align:middle line:84%
But in 3D space, like
we're in, voidness simply

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.770 align:middle line:84%
means space with
nothing in it, no thing.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.440 align:middle line:84%
No molecules, no light,
no anything at all.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you were in 3D
space-- imagine yourself

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.490 align:middle line:90%
being in deep, deep space.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.280 align:middle line:90%
And OK, you've got a body.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.010 align:middle line:84%
You can keep that
much, but nothing else.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's infinite, below
you, above you, behind you,

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.340 align:middle line:84%
all the way around you, just
infinite, forever nothingness.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.200 align:middle line:90%
And then you decided to move.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.960 align:middle line:84%
The first thing he did, was God
moved on the face [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.760 align:middle line:90%
So you're going to move.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.880 align:middle line:90%
How can you move?

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.250 align:middle line:90%
How is that possible?

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.795 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to move
from here to over there,

00:03:41.795 --> 00:03:42.920 align:middle line:90%
how do you know you did it?

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.940 align:middle line:90%


00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.750 align:middle line:84%
Or if you turned around, how
do you know you turned around?

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.770 align:middle line:84%
In physics movement, kinetic
energy, requires two points.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.570 align:middle line:84%
It requires something
to move relative to.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.590 align:middle line:84%
There has to be something
else first, before movement's

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.390 align:middle line:90%
possible.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.765 align:middle line:84%
We've got to have
something here.

00:04:05.765 --> 00:04:07.920 align:middle line:84%
If we've got something
here, then you

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.220 align:middle line:90%
can move relative to it.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.070 align:middle line:90%
You can move around it.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.800 align:middle line:84%
You can rotate relative
to it, everything else.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.100 align:middle line:84%
But if there is only one point,
movement or kinetic energy,

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.000 align:middle line:90%
is impossible.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.230 align:middle line:84%
It has no meaning,
no definition.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.270 align:middle line:84%
There's no way for
it to be determined.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.370 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians, in
their understanding

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.985 align:middle line:84%
of the same thing,
say that there

00:04:33.985 --> 00:04:36.580 align:middle line:90%
is a step in between there.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And so they're training
is this-- they also

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.690 align:middle line:84%
believe that the Great
Void-- or the Duat--

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.600 align:middle line:90%
is the source of all things.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And that the only thing that
is required in the Great Void

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.550 align:middle line:90%
is spirit.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Just spirit and
nothingness, and that

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.060 align:middle line:90%
is the source of all things.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.980 align:middle line:90%


00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And they also believe that
is the movement of spirit

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.650 align:middle line:90%
that creates the worlds.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.040 align:middle line:90%


00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.220 align:middle line:84%
But they have a
step in the middle.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.620 align:middle line:90%
And this is what they do.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.670 align:middle line:84%
They believe that spirit
contains within spirit--

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.920 align:middle line:84%
not talking about body,
just spirit-- contains

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.940 align:middle line:84%
within itself--
or consciousness,

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.690 align:middle line:84%
however you want to look
at it-- contains within it

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.470 align:middle line:84%
the key to getting
out of or beginning

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.610 align:middle line:84%
the process of movement
from the Great Void.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:41.380 align:middle line:84%
And that key has to do
with the directions,

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.940 align:middle line:84%
the sacred directions
of the American Indians.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.640 align:middle line:84%
The east, west, south,
north, et cetera,

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.060 align:middle line:84%
or the sacred directions of
the Kabalah of the east, west,

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.440 align:middle line:90%
north, south, up and down.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.320 align:middle line:84%
Of the four angels-
Michael and Ariel,

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.810 align:middle line:84%
and Gabriel and
Raphael and Ariel,

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.010 align:middle line:84%
and Metatron, these directions,
these are very, very sacred,

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.960 align:middle line:90%
sacred directions.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.738 align:middle line:84%
And for many people you
might think, so what?

00:06:10.738 --> 00:06:13.550 align:middle line:90%


00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.302 align:middle line:84%
What are so important
about directions?

00:06:16.302 --> 00:06:18.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you're getting
in on the Great Void,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.060 align:middle line:90%
they're really important.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to walk
in, down this hallway,

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.990 align:middle line:84%
and the hallway was
dark, but just to say,

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.900 align:middle line:84%
real dimly, dimly lit, you
could barely see in there,

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.190 align:middle line:84%
and you came into this room,
which was absolutely black.

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.420 align:middle line:84%
You came up to the
double doors over there,

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.370 align:middle line:84%
and you can just barely
see the outline the door.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.000 align:middle line:84%
But you couldn't see
inside there at all.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.600 align:middle line:84%
You could walk up to
that doorway and step

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.850 align:middle line:90%
in just a little bit.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.396 align:middle line:84%
And now you're in
this total darkness.

00:06:54.396 --> 00:06:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And we all have
this innate ability

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.750 align:middle line:84%
to project a certain
distance into the darkness.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:06.660 align:middle line:90%


00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.570 align:middle line:84%
Without using our
hands or anything,

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.100 align:middle line:84%
we can just kind
of sense or feel

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.100 align:middle line:84%
if there's anything
directly in front of us

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.420 align:middle line:90%
for a certain distance.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.460 align:middle line:90%
It may only be an inch.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.020 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's two or three inches.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.410 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's a foot.

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.640 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it's
three feet or more.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.090 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's different.

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.060 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain
distance you can go,

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.990 align:middle line:84%
and you just know
nothing's there.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:29.790 align:middle line:90%
And you keep going.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
your knowing quits.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:34.470 align:middle line:90%
You're not sure anymore.

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:35.640 align:middle line:90%
You can't go any further.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:40.210 align:middle line:84%
You don't know if there's
anything there or not.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:42.675 align:middle line:84%
And so you've got this little
line, or this projection

00:07:42.675 --> 00:07:46.110 align:middle line:84%
line that will go out into
the void a certain distance.

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:50.920 align:middle line:84%
That is the essential
element of consciousness

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.880 align:middle line:84%
that begins the process
according to the Egyptians.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And we have that
in six directions.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.350 align:middle line:90%
We have it in front.

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:04.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same distance
in all six directions.

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.800 align:middle line:84%
Our ability to project
into the voidness

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.020 align:middle line:90%
is equal in all directions.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.200 align:middle line:84%
We can't go further to the
left than we can to the right.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And so we could project whatever
the projection in front of us.

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:18.030 align:middle line:84%
We'll find that we can do the
same distance to the sides,

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:21.420 align:middle line:84%
to the back and above
us and below us,

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:26.530 align:middle line:84%
if we're thinking of
ourselves as just a spirit.

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And if you want
to think of that,

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:29.846 align:middle line:84%
you could think of
yourself as a round sphere,

00:08:29.846 --> 00:08:33.700 align:middle line:84%
maybe, with your spirit,
though, you really have no form.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.039 align:middle line:84%
So you get these six
little beams that

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:38.064 align:middle line:90%
come out a certain distance.

00:08:38.064 --> 00:08:41.620 align:middle line:90%


00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:47.740 align:middle line:84%
Once the training in
Egypt was they would

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:51.170 align:middle line:84%
we get them used to
projecting these beams out.

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:52.766 align:middle line:84%
Once they projected
these beams--

00:08:52.766 --> 00:08:54.390 align:middle line:84%
and they would get
them to project them

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:55.460 align:middle line:90%
out a certain distance.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And the distance was
27.5 feet, approximately.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.500 align:middle line:84%
They chose that because that's
the outer rim of your energy

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.944 align:middle line:90%
fields.

00:09:03.944 --> 00:09:05.485 align:middle line:84%
And so they'd have
you project a beam

00:09:05.485 --> 00:09:08.500 align:middle line:90%
out 27.5 feet in each direction.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.210 align:middle line:84%
You'd learn until
you could do that.

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:11.315 align:middle line:90%
They could train you.

00:09:11.315 --> 00:09:15.250 align:middle line:84%
So you get these six
little beams going out.

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got
two going this way.

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:19.925 align:middle line:84%
And you've got two
going that way.

00:09:19.925 --> 00:09:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And you've got two
going this way.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.770 align:middle line:84%
You all got the
directions clear.

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:29.460 align:middle line:84%
So these form a square
around you, right?

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.245 align:middle line:84%
If you were to see them from
above, here's the person.

00:09:33.245 --> 00:09:35.890 align:middle line:90%


00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:38.140 align:middle line:84%
You have one going out this
way, one going that way,

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:40.660 align:middle line:84%
one going this way and
one going that way.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
one going this way.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.990 align:middle line:84%
So these are the four that
are around you this way.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.350 align:middle line:84%
They would then have the
person project those beams out,

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.310 align:middle line:90%
those 27.5 feet, approximately.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:59.974 align:middle line:84%
And then they would have
them connect them together

00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:06.290 align:middle line:84%
like this, forming this flat
square or diamond around them.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And then from
these four corners,

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.080 align:middle line:84%
they would run these
beams up to the top one

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:16.340 align:middle line:90%
and form a pyramid around them.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And then they would run the
beams down and form a pyramid

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.450 align:middle line:90%
facing down below them.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:23.720 align:middle line:84%
By the way, most of
the pyramids in Egypt

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.720 align:middle line:84%
have a pyramid
going in the earth

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.050 align:middle line:90%
as well as above the earth.

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:30.370 align:middle line:84%
Centered right on the earth
there, inside as well.

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:32.375 align:middle line:84%
Even the Great Pyramid
has a great pistol.

00:10:32.375 --> 00:10:33.520 align:middle line:90%
Uh, pistol?

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.320 align:middle line:90%
Crystal.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.836 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:35.836 --> 00:10:41.270 align:middle line:90%


00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:42.910 align:middle line:90%
Crystal.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:49.940 align:middle line:84%
See to form that pattern
going [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.900 align:middle line:84%
So they formed
these two pyramids,

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.580 align:middle line:84%
which is called an octahedron,
which looks like this.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:01.930 align:middle line:90%


00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:04.060 align:middle line:90%
You can So it.

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.630 align:middle line:84%
This is the square
of the flat plane.

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:06.820 align:middle line:90%
It'll be around this.

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.445 align:middle line:90%
So this is the front.

00:11:08.445 --> 00:11:10.060 align:middle line:90%
And this is the back.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:13.950 align:middle line:84%
This is the left, the right,
and the up, and the down.

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:19.060 align:middle line:84%
They form this shape around
their body, these two

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.690 align:middle line:90%
back-to-back pyramids.

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And so they go into
the Great Void.

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And they form these
two big pyramids.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:26.360 align:middle line:90%
They're 27.5 feet.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.880 align:middle line:90%
They're 55 feet across in there.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.460 align:middle line:84%
They form these
things around them.

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:36.570 align:middle line:84%
That's the first step they
do before they do anything.

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:39.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, once they've created
this, and it's mental patterns.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.230 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing, right?

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:43.980 align:middle line:90%
Just mental patterns.

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:49.590 align:middle line:84%
But once the form has been
created around the spirit,

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:52.280 align:middle line:84%
kinetic energy or
movement is now possible.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.680 align:middle line:84%
A little spirit
could come outside

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:59.150 align:middle line:84%
and rotate around this thing
and come down here and move over

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:00.040 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.520 align:middle line:90%
Or it could rotate inside of it.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.210 align:middle line:84%
Or it could sit still
and rotate this.

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:05.420 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of possibilities
that can be there.

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And these possibilities
were without it.

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:09.180 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:10.400 align:middle line:90%
There's no way to move.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Because there's no way to
know if motion's taking place.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:17.980 align:middle line:84%
But with it, motion's
completely possible.

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:20.270 align:middle line:90%
Does everybody understand that?

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:21.770 align:middle line:90%
Any problem with that?

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:22.570 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:29.415 align:middle line:90%


00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:33.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are other ways
that this could take place.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:36.130 align:middle line:84%
But this is the way that
this particular school

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:37.690 align:middle line:90%
gave the training.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:40.092 align:middle line:84%
They had to proceed
in one way or another.

00:12:40.092 --> 00:12:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
way they proceeded.

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:45.090 align:middle line:84%
So this isn't the only way
that one can proceed from here.

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:50.420 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there is some
other real interesting ways

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.420 align:middle line:90%
that this could be done.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.050 align:middle line:84%
But this is what
they were taught.

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:54.240 align:middle line:90%


00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Then, as they sat
still, they were then

00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:00.710 align:middle line:84%
taught to rotate the
entire thing like this.

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:03.510 align:middle line:90%


00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:07.410 align:middle line:84%
First, it didn't matter whether
they went forward or backwards.

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:10.730 align:middle line:90%
You're using this axis.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:13.440 align:middle line:84%
So you're rotating either
forward or back, like that.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.484 align:middle line:84%
Then you would switch
to the front/back axis

00:13:15.484 --> 00:13:17.400 align:middle line:84%
and rotate either to the
left or to the right.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.240 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And then go to the top axis
and rotate either to the left

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:24.840 align:middle line:84%
or to the right-- doesn't
matter-- from that way.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:28.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, what that does is it traces
the parameters of a sphere.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:32.440 align:middle line:90%


00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And you have a
perfect sphere if you

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:38.870 align:middle line:84%
rotate all these through
all the different patterns.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:45.700 align:middle line:84%
So you now have this
sphere around you.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And once they get the
sphere around them,

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:54.640 align:middle line:84%
they're then told
to drop this image.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.510 align:middle line:90%
So they drop this.

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And I wish I had one,
but I don't have one,

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.410 align:middle line:84%
they go to a perfect
little sphere.

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:05.590 align:middle line:90%
I do have a little one.

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:12.110 align:middle line:84%
It's very little So
they go to a sphere.

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:17.080 align:middle line:90%


00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:20.950 align:middle line:84%
The reason they switch
from the tetra octahedron--

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:26.100 align:middle line:84%
it's called an octahedron,
that form is-- to a sphere,

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:34.004 align:middle line:84%
is that the movements are
easier and less complicated.

00:14:34.004 --> 00:14:36.170 align:middle line:84%
The movements that they're
going to make afterwards,

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:37.086 align:middle line:90%
to create the reality.

00:14:37.086 --> 00:14:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Though the reality could
be created through angles,

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:43.790 align:middle line:84%
it's easier to do it
through a sphericalness.

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:47.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, another thing that
I need to just bring up

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:52.700 align:middle line:84%
here real quickly, a point,
is that there are two kinds

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.130 align:middle line:90%
of lines in sacred geometry.

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:58.582 align:middle line:84%
One is called male, and
the other is called female.

00:14:58.582 --> 00:15:02.765 align:middle line:84%
A male line is any
line that is straight.

00:15:02.765 --> 00:15:05.790 align:middle line:90%


00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:08.240 align:middle line:90%
That's a male line.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.416 align:middle line:84%
Any line that is not
straight is female.

00:15:12.416 --> 00:15:14.770 align:middle line:84%
No matter what it
is, if it's curved.

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:18.090 align:middle line:84%
In other words, this
is a female line.

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:19.510 align:middle line:90%
That's a female line.

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And the most female of all
female lines is a circle.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And the most female of all
female shapes is a sphere.

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And so also, in the belief
of the Christian Bible,

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:38.160 align:middle line:84%
is that first there
was Adam was created.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.070 align:middle line:90%
And then Eve.

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:43.430 align:middle line:90%
And Eve was created from Adam.

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:46.170 align:middle line:84%
Male came first, female
created from that.

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And Egyptian belief-- only in
terms of geometrical things--

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:51.300 align:middle line:84%
is that the male form
was created first.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.380 align:middle line:90%
It was purely straight lines.

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And then the female
form, created from it,

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:57.610 align:middle line:90%
was created second.

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:03.860 align:middle line:90%


00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:05.770 align:middle line:84%
So here's this
little spirit now,

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:07.680 align:middle line:84%
inside of this
big, round sphere.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And he's sitting right in
the center of it, he or she.

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.950 align:middle line:84%
Spirit's not really
male or female.

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:19.140 align:middle line:84%
So the spirit is sitting
inside of the sphere.

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, spirit could
sit there forever.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.260 align:middle line:84%
There's really no
time at this point.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:28.930 align:middle line:90%
Time doesn't exist.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:33.490 align:middle line:84%
Time didn't actually exist at
all until that was created,

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:34.890 align:middle line:90%
till the octahedron was created.

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:36.520 align:middle line:90%
You have to have something.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:40.760 align:middle line:84%
There has to be something
to have a continuum.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.260 align:middle line:90%
There's no such thing as time.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:47.480 align:middle line:90%
There's only continuum of space.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:52.010 align:middle line:84%
Time is a mental thing
that we've created up.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.560 align:middle line:84%
What are you going
to do with time?

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.100 align:middle line:90%
Where you going to get it?

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:54.700 align:middle line:90%
Where is it?

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:54.975 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:16:54.975 --> 00:16:55.775 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing.

00:16:55.775 --> 00:16:56.990 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't exist.

00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:58.198 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing there at all.

00:16:58.198 --> 00:17:00.440 align:middle line:84%
All there is, is the
continuum of an object

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.082 align:middle line:84%
continuing through
time, what we call.

00:17:03.082 --> 00:17:04.040 align:middle line:90%
But time doesn't exist.

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:07.880 align:middle line:84%
It's just the continuum
of space, is all there is.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.800 align:middle line:90%


00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:15.089 align:middle line:84%
So once the object was created,
then time-- as our mind

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:20.260 align:middle line:84%
thinks of it-- was also
simultaneously created.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.760 align:middle line:84%
So the little person could
sit inside this big sphere

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:27.950 align:middle line:84%
for a long, long, long time
until, finally, he or she says,

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:30.390 align:middle line:90%
I think I'll do something.

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And there is one very specific
thing that could be done,

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.164 align:middle line:90%
that would be unique.

00:17:37.164 --> 00:17:39.330 align:middle line:84%
I guess there's a lot of
unique things you could do.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:41.660 align:middle line:90%
But let's put it this way.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:45.540 align:middle line:84%
The training is that once
you create the sphere,

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.677 align:middle line:84%
you go to that which
was newly created.

00:17:48.677 --> 00:17:49.760 align:middle line:90%
That was the instructions.

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.490 align:middle line:84%
That's always the
instructions, is

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:55.100 align:middle line:84%
to go to the new thing
that was created.

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:58.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, what is it that
was new that was created?

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:01.730 align:middle line:90%


00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:03.330 align:middle line:90%
The membrane.

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.480 align:middle line:84%
There's now an inside
and an outside.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
membrane of the sphere

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:11.840 align:middle line:90%
that separates those two.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And that is different
than anything else

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.390 align:middle line:90%
that's in the entire universe.

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And so where you're instructed
to go to is to the membrane,

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:22.670 align:middle line:90%
to the surface of the sphere.

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:23.880 align:middle line:90%
You can't make a mistake.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.662 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make any difference
where you go in the sphere.

00:18:26.662 --> 00:18:27.496 align:middle line:90%
You can go down, up.

00:18:27.496 --> 00:18:29.703 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't make any
difference how you get there.

00:18:29.703 --> 00:18:31.940 align:middle line:84%
You can curve over there,
make a straight line,

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:34.680 align:middle line:84%
or meander sideways
or whatever you want.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.930 align:middle line:90%
But you get there.

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And when you get to the
surface, you're now in position.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, you only
know how to do one thing.

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:51.337 align:middle line:84%
That's the limit of your
memory at this point.

00:18:51.337 --> 00:18:53.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know how to do
two things, an octahedron

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:54.370 align:middle line:90%
or a sphere.

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:56.510 align:middle line:84%
But you're switched
to sphericalness now.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And so you move up to the
surface of the sphere,

00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:59.800 align:middle line:90%
somewhere on it.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:03.440 align:middle line:84%
At which point, you
make another sphere.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And you only know how to
make one sized sphere.

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:06.520 align:middle line:84%
You don't even know
how to make two sizes.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.230 align:middle line:84%
You only know how
to make one size.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:11.300 align:middle line:84%
So you make another sphere
exactly the same as this one.

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:14.400 align:middle line:90%


00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.752 align:middle line:84%
And let's say, that you
moved up here, to the top.

00:19:17.752 --> 00:19:20.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to choose that spot
because it's more convenient.

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:21.418 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't really matter.

00:19:21.418 --> 00:19:22.810 align:middle line:90%
You move to right here.

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:24.051 align:middle line:90%
And you make another sphere.

00:19:24.051 --> 00:19:25.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, the other sphere
is going to be such

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:31.330 align:middle line:84%
that this is going to
be the center of it.

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And so it creates a very
sacred form in sacred geometry.

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And it is probably the most
sacred of the sacred forms

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:40.450 align:middle line:90%
there are, just about.

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:42.075 align:middle line:90%
This little math shape in here.

00:19:42.075 --> 00:19:45.050 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
here's where you were.

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:46.200 align:middle line:90%
And here's the surface.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.324 align:middle line:84%
And when you moved up to
here, you created a sphere

00:19:48.324 --> 00:19:51.240 align:middle line:84%
the same size, which causes
the surface of that one

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.600 align:middle line:90%
to pass through where you were.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.400 align:middle line:84%
So these two surfaces
passed through the centers

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.000 align:middle line:90%
of these two circles.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.960 align:middle line:10%
And this shape in here is
called a Vesica Piscis.

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:07.670 align:middle line:10%
And it is the creation pattern
of things like the Golden Mean

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:10.030 align:middle line:10%
Ratio and these kinds of things.

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:11.930 align:middle line:90%
That's what creates that.

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about
it in a little bit.

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:17.330 align:middle line:84%
But this image that
you see right here

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:20.550 align:middle line:84%
has a hidden image
underneath, which

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:25.310 align:middle line:84%
you will see later to be
the image of light itself.

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:30.310 align:middle line:84%
It is the morphogenic structure
of that which created light.

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Just the stuff that we've
got falling in the room

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.784 align:middle line:90%
here right now.

00:20:33.784 --> 00:20:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And what was the very
next thing that God said

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.390 align:middle line:90%
after he made the first motion?

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:39.960 align:middle line:90%
He made the very first motion.

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And immediately, he
said, let there be light.

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:48.500 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't have done it the
other way around, and said,

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:52.700 align:middle line:84%
let there be light so I
can see where I'm moving.

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:57.000 align:middle line:84%
He had to make this motion
first to create this pattern.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.286 align:middle line:84%
And once this
pattern was created,

00:20:59.286 --> 00:21:00.660 align:middle line:84%
he could say, let
there be light.

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:03.490 align:middle line:84%
Because it was through the
pattern that light was created.

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'll be able to really show
you this on a real hardcore

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:12.050 align:middle line:90%
science level in a little bit.

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Though at this point,
it's too simple.

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:19.770 align:middle line:84%
You won't be able to get it from
here, because it's too simple.

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:23.510 align:middle line:90%
It's too obvious, too easy.

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:26.260 align:middle line:90%


00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.081 align:middle line:90%
But remember this.

00:21:27.081 --> 00:21:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Because we'll wait about
two days down the line.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.038 align:middle line:90%
I'll come back to this.

00:21:30.038 --> 00:21:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'll be able to show
you what I'm talking about

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:34.430 align:middle line:90%
after we make it more complex.

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:37.310 align:middle line:90%


00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And now, at this point, now that
he's made the circle up here--

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.270 align:middle line:84%
and I'll show you this
on the slides here.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:49.350 align:middle line:84%
Let me come to the slides--
that's the Great Void.

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:50.740 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:51.540 align:middle line:90%


00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:52.935 align:middle line:84%
It was really the
hardest drawing

00:21:52.935 --> 00:21:57.630 align:middle line:84%
I ever did because I
couldn't find a clean card.

00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:59.360 align:middle line:90%
And that's a Great Void.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And then inside of
Great Void is the spirit

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:05.250 align:middle line:84%
of God, which we
will use the symbol

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:07.430 align:middle line:90%
of the right Eye of Horus.

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:10.445 align:middle line:84%
And then these, I did
them all at once here.

00:22:10.445 --> 00:22:13.670 align:middle line:84%
These are the six
little beams coming out.

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:16.315 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't show the step
of the octahedron forming,

00:22:16.315 --> 00:22:18.040 align:middle line:90%
or the spinning of it.

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:23.520 align:middle line:90%
But just that it forms a sphere.

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And then from that, the
little right Eye of Horus,

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:32.150 align:middle line:84%
this spirit of
God, ends up inside

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:34.800 align:middle line:84%
of this circle or
this sphere, which

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.860 align:middle line:90%
is the symbol for the school.

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:41.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is where the spirit
then makes a move from here

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.660 align:middle line:90%
to somewhere on the surface.

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:45.260 align:middle line:90%
Again, you can't make an error.

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:46.485 align:middle line:90%
But we will go to that spot.

00:22:46.485 --> 00:22:49.910 align:middle line:90%
And it goes to there.

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And when it gets there, it
only knows how to do one thing.

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:55.160 align:middle line:90%
And that is to make spheres.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.270 align:middle line:90%
And so it makes another sphere.

00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And you see the Vesica
Piscis is formed.

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And the gold one is the
first circle that was formed.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.430 align:middle line:90%
And this is the second one.

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:10.860 align:middle line:90%
Now, what does it do next?

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, it goes to that which
what was newly created.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And there was only one thing
that's new and different

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:20.520 align:middle line:90%
in the universe now.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And that is the place
where the two circles meet.

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:27.190 align:middle line:84%
If you think of two
soap bubbles together,

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:29.650 align:middle line:90%
there's a circle around there.

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:34.890 align:middle line:84%
Not a sphere, a circle, where
the two bubbles come together--

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:37.247 align:middle line:90%
which is that green line.

00:23:37.247 --> 00:23:38.830 align:middle line:84%
So that green line
is not just a line.

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:42.590 align:middle line:84%
If you were to look at it
from above, looking down,

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:43.450 align:middle line:90%
you would see this.

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:46.170 align:middle line:90%


00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:49.870 align:middle line:84%
The gold and the black
circle, of course,

00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:51.430 align:middle line:90%
coincide with each other.

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:53.630 align:middle line:84%
But the place that
they meet would

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:57.250 align:middle line:90%
look like an inner circle.

00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:59.840 align:middle line:90%
Does everybody get that?

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.488 align:middle line:90%
Anybody not get it?

00:24:02.488 --> 00:24:03.890 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:05.910 align:middle line:90%
So this is the side view of it.

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:09.400 align:middle line:90%
This is the top view of it.

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.100 align:middle line:90%
Now, in the side view.

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:15.280 align:middle line:84%
The spirit then goes
down to that green ring.

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.030 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't make any
difference where it goes.

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:17.904 align:middle line:90%
Can't make a mistake.

00:24:17.904 --> 00:24:20.310 align:middle line:84%
Just goes somewhere
under the green ring.

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:22.640 align:middle line:84%
However, for our
purposes, I'm going

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.080 align:middle line:90%
to choose this spot right here.

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:26.560 align:middle line:84%
No matter where
you move, I could

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:29.560 align:middle line:84%
rotate that object so it
looks like it's right there.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.410 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:31.701 align:middle line:90%
Depends on the angle you're at.

00:24:31.701 --> 00:24:33.610 align:middle line:84%
So it goes down
to the green ring.

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And once it gets to
that spot, it only

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:37.240 align:middle line:90%
knows how to do one thing.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And that makes a sphere
of a certain size.

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.130 align:middle line:90%
And it does it.

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:44.230 align:middle line:90%
And it gets this.

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:48.570 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
geometrical informations

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:50.095 align:middle line:90%
that are now present.

00:24:50.095 --> 00:24:54.080 align:middle line:84%
An equilateral triangle
is there, for example.

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.170 align:middle line:84%
There are two
equilateral triangles,

00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:59.100 align:middle line:84%
which is the basis of the
Golden Mean rectangle.

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.620 align:middle line:84%
The logarithmic
spiral is present.

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:04.580 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds of
very primary laws that

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:06.700 align:middle line:90%
are unfolding at this moment.

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:07.910 align:middle line:90%
This is on the second day.

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:10.340 align:middle line:90%
I didn't mention this to you.

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:11.355 align:middle line:90%
Do this if you want to.

00:25:11.355 --> 00:25:13.855 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to leave this up
to you to do it, if you want.

00:25:13.855 --> 00:25:17.480 align:middle line:84%
But if you will look at what
I'm about to tell you right now,

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:21.560 align:middle line:84%
and then read the
Bible again, it

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:24.870 align:middle line:84%
will take on a whole new
viewpoint you probably never,

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:26.640 align:middle line:90%
ever thought about before.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.880 align:middle line:84%
But there are six
days to Genesis,

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.990 align:middle line:90%
seven days of Genesis total.

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:34.710 align:middle line:84%
Each day has new things
that are created each time.

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see some
interesting things.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:40.870 align:middle line:84%
This is the first motion,
from here to here.

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:44.790 align:middle line:84%
The first motion creates
this black circle.

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's the first
day of Genesis, up here,

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.264 align:middle line:90%
at the first motion.

00:25:50.264 --> 00:25:53.570 align:middle line:84%
The second day of Genesis
comes over to here.

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:55.970 align:middle line:84%
Here's the first
motion, first circle.

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:57.540 align:middle line:90%
Second motion, second circle.

00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:59.430 align:middle line:84%
This is the second
day of Genesis.

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:00.960 align:middle line:90%
The first motion created light.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.010 align:middle line:84%
The second motion
creates various things.

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to correspond
all these various attributes

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:10.430 align:middle line:84%
that are created each
time, it will all

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:12.570 align:middle line:84%
begin to make sense in
a whole 'nother way.

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:17.480 align:middle line:84%
You'll see the geometrical
nature of this.

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think at this point,
I want to do something.

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:20.863 align:middle line:90%
I think I want to do this.

00:26:20.863 --> 00:26:24.420 align:middle line:90%


00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:27.390 align:middle line:84%
Let me explain it
very carefully.

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:29.180 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a
point I want to make.

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think I can explain
this point to you.

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:34.770 align:middle line:84%
Normally what I do is have
you go out into deep space,

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:39.200 align:middle line:84%
and go through this motion
where you create the big sphere.

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:44.057 align:middle line:84%
And then you literally move
in space over to the surface.

00:26:44.057 --> 00:26:45.640 align:middle line:84%
Not just words or
something like that,

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.260 align:middle line:84%
but you do it in
your meditation.

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:48.760 align:middle line:90%
You move over the place.

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.190 align:middle line:90%
You feel yourself moving.

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:51.540 align:middle line:90%
And you come up to the place.

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And then you create
another sphere.

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And then you look down and
you see this ring below you.

00:26:56.770 --> 00:27:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And then you move
down to the ring.

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:02.735 align:middle line:84%
And then you create
another sphere.

00:27:02.735 --> 00:27:03.610 align:middle line:90%
And take it that far.

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:05.410 align:middle line:90%
It's only that far.

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:07.955 align:middle line:84%
At which point-- when you're
out there in that meditation,

00:27:07.955 --> 00:27:11.320 align:middle line:84%
you're in deep space, and the
room's gone and everything--

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:12.950 align:middle line:90%
I tell you something.

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:15.520 align:middle line:84%
The reason why I have
you go through all that,

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:23.850 align:middle line:84%
which is that from
here on out, you're

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:27.090 align:middle line:84%
going to start seeing a
lot of geometrical forms.

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to get more
and more and more complex.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And as they do,
you may forget what

00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:39.110 align:middle line:84%
the source of all these forms
were, which was coming out

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:40.360 align:middle line:90%
of the Great Void.

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And that it was spirit
that was making these forms

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:45.470 align:middle line:90%
through its motions.

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:48.077 align:middle line:84%
And if you really,
really, really

00:27:48.077 --> 00:27:50.285 align:middle line:84%
want to understand what this
is all about, especially

00:27:50.285 --> 00:27:52.610 align:middle line:84%
if you study sacred
geometry later,

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:56.100 align:middle line:84%
you must always remember
that it's not just

00:27:56.100 --> 00:28:00.300 align:middle line:84%
lines on a page, or circles
or squares, or tetrahedrons,

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:01.920 align:middle line:90%
or dodecahedrons or whatever.

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:06.070 align:middle line:84%
It's not just lines or
three-dimensional forms.

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:09.120 align:middle line:90%
But they're always maps.

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:12.850 align:middle line:84%
They're movements how spirit
moves in a Great Void.

00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:16.020 align:middle line:90%


00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:19.620 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I mean
by the chromosomes are

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:23.060 align:middle line:84%
geometrical images
because they're really

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:26.800 align:middle line:84%
maps of how spirit has
moved in the Great Void

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.570 align:middle line:84%
to create the world
in a particular way.

00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And each one creates a
different consciousness.

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:33.622 align:middle line:84%
And consciousness
simply, is just

00:28:33.622 --> 00:28:36.530 align:middle line:84%
a different interpretation,
how you interpret it.

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:39.525 align:middle line:84%
It's like a lens that you
look through at one object

00:28:39.525 --> 00:28:41.220 align:middle line:90%
and interpret it.

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:42.290 align:middle line:90%
There's only one reality.

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:43.870 align:middle line:90%
Reality doesn't change.

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:45.430 align:middle line:84%
But there's different
interpretations

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:49.790 align:middle line:84%
of the reality, how you
perceive the reality

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:52.470 align:middle line:90%
and yourself within it.

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And so this is
what I really want

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:59.825 align:middle line:84%
to emphasize at this point,
is that it's all motion.

00:28:59.825 --> 00:29:00.625 align:middle line:90%
It's movements.

00:29:00.625 --> 00:29:01.490 align:middle line:90%
It's maps.

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:03.130 align:middle line:90%
It's not just lines and circles.

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:05.810 align:middle line:84%
As long as you
can get that, then

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:09.220 align:middle line:84%
you'll have a much deeper
understanding of what

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:12.270 align:middle line:90%
we're about to lead into.

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, the next thing
is that no matter how

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:18.639 align:middle line:84%
the first two motions
were made, like I said,

00:29:18.639 --> 00:29:19.680 align:middle line:90%
you can't make a mistake.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:22.625 align:middle line:84%
No matter where you go under
the circle, under the sphere,

00:29:22.625 --> 00:29:26.530 align:middle line:84%
no matter where you go under the
surface of this little sphere,

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:28.780 align:middle line:84%
no matter where you go
on to that circle that

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:33.180 align:middle line:84%
joins the first two spheres
together, the two bubbles,

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:37.700 align:middle line:84%
you happen to be
making a perfect line

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:38.525 align:middle line:90%
around the equator.

00:29:38.525 --> 00:29:41.810 align:middle line:90%


00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:47.260 align:middle line:90%
You found an equator on there.

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:49.040 align:middle line:84%
There's an infinite
number of them.

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.220 align:middle line:90%
You located one of them.

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:53.935 align:middle line:84%
And you began to make
a motion perfectly

00:29:53.935 --> 00:29:57.090 align:middle line:90%
around a perfect equator.

00:29:57.090 --> 00:29:59.330 align:middle line:84%
Not at an angle or off
to one point or anything

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:03.750 align:middle line:84%
else like that, but at
precisely around the equator.

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:08.220 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a vortex motion
that began starting from here.

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:11.500 align:middle line:84%
And you started making that
motion exactly on the equator.

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And once the motions began,
then from then on in,

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:17.110 align:middle line:84%
you just follow
your heart, kind of.

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:20.630 align:middle line:84%
You just keep making the
motion to the equator.

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:23.140 align:middle line:84%
So you come from here and
you automatically move down

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:26.840 align:middle line:90%
to here, following the equator.

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:29.160 align:middle line:84%
First two motions are
a little different.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:32.090 align:middle line:84%
The third motions
are from then on out,

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:34.920 align:middle line:84%
you only have to
do this same motion

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.490 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:42.630 align:middle line:84%
The third day of Genesis,
comes down to here like this.

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:45.360 align:middle line:84%
On the fourth day of Genesis,
you come to this spot here.

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:48.160 align:middle line:90%


00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:54.875 align:middle line:84%
There are over 900 bibles
in the world-- 900 bibles.

00:30:54.875 --> 00:30:58.110 align:middle line:90%


00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:01.440 align:middle line:84%
In about 50% of
them or so, it says

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.910 align:middle line:84%
that on the fourth
day of Genesis,

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:09.620 align:middle line:84%
that exactly one half
of Creation was created.

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:11.260 align:middle line:84%
You can actually see
it geometrically.

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:15.430 align:middle line:84%
Because on the one, two,
three, fourth day of Genesis,

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:18.750 align:middle line:84%
half of the original
circle was transverse.

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:20.330 align:middle line:90%
Half of Creation was completed.

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:22.980 align:middle line:90%


00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:26.880 align:middle line:84%
It then goes to the fifth day
of Genesis here, fifth motion.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And finally, to the sixth
motion-- one, two, three, four,

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:32.060 align:middle line:90%
five, six motions.

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And on the sixth motion,
this pattern is formed.

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:39.530 align:middle line:84%
And also, sort of a geometrical
miracle takes place.

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And geometrically, what
happens is this sixth circle

00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:48.480 align:middle line:84%
comes back and completes
exactly to the starting point

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:53.410 align:middle line:90%
with nothing left over at all.

00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:56.190 align:middle line:90%
It is just perfect.

00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And so on the sixth
day of Genesis,

00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:03.650 align:middle line:84%
they all say-- all the bibles
say-- that Creation was

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:08.680 align:middle line:90%
completed on the sixth motion.

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And then it says, on the
seventh motion, that he rested.

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:17.630 align:middle line:84%
He says, on the seventh day,
the seventh motion, he rested.

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:19.660 align:middle line:84%
Because on the sixth
day, it was done.

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:21.975 align:middle line:84%
But they're saying that
there's really seven circles.

00:32:21.975 --> 00:32:24.730 align:middle line:90%


00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:29.620 align:middle line:84%
So the seventh motion,
back into the center again,

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:32.485 align:middle line:84%
there's no creation that
takes place in that motion.

00:32:32.485 --> 00:32:36.480 align:middle line:84%
It was finished, really,
on the sixth one.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:40.270 align:middle line:84%
And so this pattern, we're going
to call the Genesis Pattern.

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:45.690 align:middle line:10%
And it is the
pattern through which

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:47.700 align:middle line:10%
the entire reality was created.

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:51.150 align:middle line:10%
And I hope to make that
clear to your logical mind,

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:54.120 align:middle line:10%
your left brain side of
you, that this is true.

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:58.930 align:middle line:90%


00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:00.810 align:middle line:84%
What you're going to
find now is that there

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:02.200 align:middle line:90%
are going to be vortex motions.

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.370 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be a
continually rotating

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:09.740 align:middle line:84%
motion of spirit as it
extends out of this pattern.

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And each time that spirit
makes one complete vortex,

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:19.340 align:middle line:84%
a three-dimensional
shape-- for our world

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:22.570 align:middle line:84%
anyway-- that you
can hold in your hand

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:25.600 align:middle line:90%
is created and formed.

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And these
three-dimensional shapes

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:32.910 align:middle line:84%
are the keys or the building
blocks of the reality.

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And you're now looking
at the first one.

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:38.180 align:middle line:84%
The very, very first
three-dimensional shape

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:43.210 align:middle line:84%
is before your eyes
in a very unusual way.

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:48.050 align:middle line:84%
In mathematics, this one
circle with six around it

00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:50.790 align:middle line:84%
is the minimum amount
of lines that you

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:55.390 align:middle line:84%
could make to create what
is called a Tube Torus.

00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:58.560 align:middle line:10%
If you simply rotated
that right now,

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:02.610 align:middle line:10%
you would get what is this.

00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:04.835 align:middle line:10%
This is called a Tube Torus.

00:34:04.835 --> 00:34:05.710 align:middle line:90%
It's like a doughnut.

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:09.010 align:middle line:90%


00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:09.810 align:middle line:90%
Nothing special.

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:12.210 align:middle line:90%
We all know doughnuts.

00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:15.000 align:middle line:84%
But it is a totally
unique shape.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.600 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing else in
the universe like this.

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Nothing that has
the capabilities

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:25.139 align:middle line:90%
of what a Tube Torus has.

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:28.679 align:middle line:84%
If you could have a Tube Torus,
this creates a Tube Torus.

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:31.199 align:middle line:84%
You can also have a Torus,
which is a sphere that

00:34:31.199 --> 00:34:33.665 align:middle line:84%
comes in like that, which
is like the Earth, which

00:34:33.665 --> 00:34:37.530 align:middle line:84%
has a magnetic field that
comes into it, torical one.

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:41.870 align:middle line:84%
But this pattern, of
six spheres around one,

00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:45.389 align:middle line:90%
creates a Tube Torus pattern.

00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:47.205 align:middle line:84%
So these are
spheres around here,

00:34:47.205 --> 00:34:48.719 align:middle line:90%
with one sphere in the middle.

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:51.300 align:middle line:84%
However, the size of
the hole in the middle,

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:56.505 align:middle line:84%
theoretically, is infinitely
small in this pattern.

00:34:56.505 --> 00:34:58.630 align:middle line:84%
So everybody see how if
you spun those six spheres,

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:01.352 align:middle line:90%
you'd get one of these?

00:35:01.352 --> 00:35:03.800 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:04.810 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:06.490 align:middle line:90%
So what is this?

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:11.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, I didn't know what
the heck it was either,

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:12.910 align:middle line:90%
when I first got it.

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:15.640 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know what I had.

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:17.980 align:middle line:84%
This is through the work
of the angels at this time,

00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:19.490 align:middle line:90%
not through Metatron.

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:22.550 align:middle line:84%
This is where this part here,
right now, is coming out.

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:26.410 align:middle line:84%
This is 20-something years
ago that I started doing this.

00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And I studied this
and studied this.

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And after a while, when I
started teaching these things

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:39.050 align:middle line:84%
about 7-and-a-half years ago,
I still didn't really know,

00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:42.650 align:middle line:90%
at that point, what this was.

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And then one day, very soon
after I started teaching this,

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:53.880 align:middle line:84%
I got a group of
people from Hollywood

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:58.740 align:middle line:84%
that came to my doorstep
that were interested in what

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:04.732 align:middle line:84%
I was doing because they were
doing some work in Finland that

00:36:04.732 --> 00:36:06.440 align:middle line:84%
seemed to be related
to what I was doing.

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And they were trying to
figure out some things.

00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
man named Ior Bock.

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:15.960 align:middle line:90%
Has anybody heard of Ior Bock?

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:16.900 align:middle line:90%
You have?

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:18.808 align:middle line:90%
Anybody else heard of Ior Bock?

00:36:18.808 --> 00:36:23.810 align:middle line:90%


00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:27.990 align:middle line:84%
According to the story,
there were 12 Bock brothers.

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:29.740 align:middle line:90%
They were from Finland.

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And that this family
of these 12 males,

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:35.986 align:middle line:84%
that Hitler did everything
in his power to kill them.

00:36:35.986 --> 00:36:38.247 align:middle line:84%
There was this whole
story around how

00:36:38.247 --> 00:36:40.830 align:middle line:84%
he had this hit squad that went
around, just looking and doing

00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:43.290 align:middle line:84%
everything they could
to kill these 12 men.

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:45.210 align:middle line:90%
And they got 11 of them.

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:46.255 align:middle line:90%
They killed 11 of them.

00:36:46.255 --> 00:36:48.520 align:middle line:90%
They didn't get Ior.

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And according to their family
history, he wouldn't get Ior.

00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And when Ior became
the last one,

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.900 align:middle line:84%
that the female
aspect of their family

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:01.700 align:middle line:84%
was to come to them,
to come to Ior,

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:05.860 align:middle line:84%
and tell him some things
that he didn't know.

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:08.300 align:middle line:84%
Primarily which was the
history of the Earth,

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:10.450 align:middle line:84%
going back the same
number of years

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:12.510 align:middle line:84%
that that Thoth
says we went back,

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:16.180 align:middle line:84%
500 million years, saying
that's when we all began,

00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:18.720 align:middle line:90%
was 500 years ago.

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:19.572 align:middle line:90%
Not us.

00:37:19.572 --> 00:37:21.530 align:middle line:84%
We started a couple
hundred thousand years ago.

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:23.613 align:middle line:84%
I mean other civilizations,
other consciousnesses.

00:37:23.613 --> 00:37:27.530 align:middle line:90%


00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:30.160 align:middle line:84%
And the method that
these two women--

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:32.280 align:middle line:84%
they were only two, his
grandmother and someone

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:36.650 align:middle line:84%
else-- the method that
they were to remember what

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:39.350 align:middle line:84%
the history of
the Earth was, was

00:37:39.350 --> 00:37:42.160 align:middle line:84%
through a geometrical
pattern, which was this.

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:45.260 align:middle line:90%


00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And what they did
with this pattern,

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:49.640 align:middle line:90%
was they ratcheted the pattern.

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:52.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, in sacred geometry,
ratcheting means

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:54.410 align:middle line:84%
imagine if there was two of
those patterns, superimposed

00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:56.044 align:middle line:90%
over each other right now.

00:37:56.044 --> 00:37:57.710 align:middle line:84%
One right over the
top of the other one.

00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:59.120 align:middle line:90%
And one of them you fixed.

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And the other one
you could turn.

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:03.540 align:middle line:90%
You know, like, a ratchet.

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:07.110 align:middle line:84%
So you move something a certain
number of degrees or so?

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:12.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're going to move this,
the second circle from here

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:16.090 align:middle line:90%
over to here.

00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And when you do, you'd have 12
circles moving around there.

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:22.910 align:middle line:90%
So everybody see that?

00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:25.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you had six
here, and they're fixed,

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:27.390 align:middle line:84%
and you've got
another set of these,

00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:30.780 align:middle line:84%
and you took another set and
superimposed over top this one

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:35.909 align:middle line:84%
but where the center of
this one would be here,

00:38:35.909 --> 00:38:38.450 align:middle line:84%
then you'd have another circle
here, and another circle here.

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And you'd have 12
circles moving around it.

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:43.120 align:middle line:90%
It would look like this.

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:47.060 align:middle line:84%
And so here, there's 12 of these
circles, moving around here.

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, what these two
women did is they

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:54.260 align:middle line:84%
connected all
possible lines that

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:55.610 align:middle line:90%
come out of these 12 circles.

00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:59.150 align:middle line:84%
You can see how this main line,
these radial lines coming in

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:01.250 align:middle line:84%
that they drew, they
drew those all over.

00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And then they connected all
possible lines together,

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:06.760 align:middle line:84%
creating this intricate pattern
in the center between there,

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:09.170 align:middle line:84%
between the Creation,
the Genesis Pattern.

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:11.340 align:middle line:90%
It had been ratcheted.

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:15.430 align:middle line:84%
They say, that all languages
are contained in those lines.

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:18.470 align:middle line:84%
The actual letters
of all languages.

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:19.532 align:middle line:90%
This is what they said.

00:39:19.532 --> 00:39:21.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, I just sat there,
listening to this stuff.

00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:22.620 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know.

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:25.060 align:middle line:84%
I had about 30
people in my room.

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And they had TV cameras
and stuff going on.

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know what
they were talking about,

00:39:30.210 --> 00:39:32.110 align:middle line:90%
really, at the first part.

00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:34.470 align:middle line:84%
He said that they then
ratcheted one more time,

00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:36.062 align:middle line:90%
so they got 24 circles.

00:39:36.062 --> 00:39:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And when you do, you get
this super-intricate pattern

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:41.380 align:middle line:90%
inside the middle, like this.

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And that inside here were all
the languages, written in here.

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And he tried to make
a simple pattern,

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:48.360 align:middle line:84%
to show me what I was
talking about, like this.

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:49.450 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:50.670 align:middle line:90%
He made this.

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:51.610 align:middle line:90%
They brought this in.

00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:54.590 align:middle line:84%
They had been creating it on
the airplane and everything,

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:56.500 align:middle line:90%
as they were coming over.

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:58.130 align:middle line:90%
And this is English in here.

00:39:58.130 --> 00:40:03.084 align:middle line:84%
You see the letter A, and W, and
V, and all the various letters

00:40:03.084 --> 00:40:04.750 align:middle line:84%
in the English alphabet,
he was starting

00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:06.780 align:middle line:90%
to put in there, around there.

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:08.720 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at this.

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.737 align:middle line:84%
In my mind, I'm
going, oh, come on.

00:40:10.737 --> 00:40:12.320 align:middle line:84%
You can put any old
language in there.

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:15.440 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's so
many lines in there,

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:17.650 align:middle line:84%
it'd be easy to draw
anything in there.

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:23.022 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sitting there, real
straight, going yeah, OK.

00:40:23.022 --> 00:40:25.230 align:middle line:84%
But he was doing it with
this more intricate pattern,

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:26.030 align:middle line:90%
like this one.

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:31.307 align:middle line:90%


00:40:31.307 --> 00:40:33.140 align:middle line:84%
Again, they're just
repeating what they saw.

00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:35.014 align:middle line:84%
And you'll understand
why they got so excited

00:40:35.014 --> 00:40:35.860 align:middle line:90%
in just a moment.

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:45.550 align:middle line:84%
According to Ior, the lines that
were arranged in here, once you

00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:47.995 align:middle line:84%
put the letters in there,
the line that would come off

00:40:47.995 --> 00:40:49.620 align:middle line:84%
of one of them would
form what's called

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:51.710 align:middle line:90%
a transcendental pattern.

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:54.850 align:middle line:84%
A transcendental
number in mathematics

00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:58.881 align:middle line:90%
is a number that has no end.

00:40:58.881 --> 00:41:00.548 align:middle line:84%
A good example of
that is the Phi ratio.

00:41:00.548 --> 00:41:02.672 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk be
talking about the Phi ratio.

00:41:02.672 --> 00:41:03.990 align:middle line:90%
So I'll use that one.

00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:08.890 align:middle line:84%
Phi is a Greek symbol, Phi,
which is spelled P-H-I.

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's a number
that is 1.6180339.

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:20.100 align:middle line:90%
And it goes to infinity.

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:21.750 align:middle line:90%
And there is end.

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:23.790 align:middle line:84%
If you put a computer
in it, the computer

00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:27.764 align:middle line:84%
can't find an end, no matter
how long the computer runs

00:41:27.764 --> 00:41:29.680 align:middle line:84%
or how many computer
chips there are in there.

00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And they've done
it on this number.

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:33.950 align:middle line:90%
And I'll never repeat itself.

00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:37.580 align:middle line:84%
You never know what the
next number is going to be.

00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:40.010 align:middle line:90%
It could be anything.

00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:42.150 align:middle line:84%
You never have any
idea whatsoever.

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:43.060 align:middle line:90%
There's no pattern.

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:46.190 align:middle line:84%
There's no way to determine
what the next number was

00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:47.270 align:middle line:90%
going to be.

00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:50.840 align:middle line:84%
It's a number from
another divisional level.

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:53.170 align:middle line:84%
It probably is a
whole number up there.

00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:55.020 align:middle line:90%
But in here, it won't work.

00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:58.390 align:middle line:84%
It just simply doesn't
fit into this world.

00:41:58.390 --> 00:42:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And so this is called a
transcendental pattern,

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:04.070 align:middle line:84%
once you come off of a
line off of one letter,

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:06.554 align:middle line:84%
it'll come down
to another letter.

00:42:06.554 --> 00:42:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And then the
reflection from there

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:09.200 align:middle line:90%
will go up to another letter.

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:11.790 align:middle line:84%
But you never know where the
reflection's going to go.

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And what they said, is
that you start with A.

00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And it'll start letting
this letters, which

00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:20.820 align:middle line:84%
will form words, which will form
sentences, which will tell you

00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:24.140 align:middle line:84%
the history of the Earth,
starting from the beginning,

00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:27.224 align:middle line:84%
500 million years ago, step
by step by step by step,

00:42:27.224 --> 00:42:29.140 align:middle line:84%
all the way through,
everything that happened,

00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:32.332 align:middle line:84%
all the different cultures
for 500 million years.

00:42:32.332 --> 00:42:33.530 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty outrageous.

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:34.988 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it
was true or not.

00:42:34.988 --> 00:42:36.600 align:middle line:90%
But that's what they told me.

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And in this story,
as it unfolded,

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:42.566 align:middle line:84%
toward the end-- which I assumed
that when they started talking

00:42:42.566 --> 00:42:44.690 align:middle line:84%
about what Lemuria and
Atlantis, they were probably

00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:48.240 align:middle line:84%
in the last couple-- it
took 20 years for these.

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:51.020 align:middle line:84%
Two hours a day for 20
years, for these two women

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:53.710 align:middle line:84%
to tell you the whole story,
to read the whole thing

00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:55.450 align:middle line:90%
and tell the whole story.

00:42:55.450 --> 00:42:58.271 align:middle line:84%
So if it took 20 years, and
you're going 500 million years,

00:42:58.271 --> 00:43:00.270 align:middle line:84%
then it probably was the
last week or something,

00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:02.910 align:middle line:84%
that they talked about
Lemuria and Atlantis.

00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And it would have been toward
the very, very end of all this.

00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:11.860 align:middle line:90%


00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:14.700 align:middle line:84%
But in the story, after they
got done with the history,

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:19.190 align:middle line:84%
then the story started
talking about Ior himself.

00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Because he was supposedly
a King of the earth,

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:23.990 align:middle line:90%
according to this thing.

00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:27.245 align:middle line:84%
And that his fathers and
fathers and fathers went back

00:43:27.245 --> 00:43:29.890 align:middle line:84%
for kings that have
gone back all the way,

00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:31.060 align:middle line:90%
since the very beginning.

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And they were hidden kings in
the earth, according to him.

00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:37.710 align:middle line:84%
That they had a
temple in Finland.

00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:40.752 align:middle line:90%


00:43:40.752 --> 00:43:42.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this sounds
like science fiction.

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:43.890 align:middle line:90%
Except that I saw it on video.

00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:46.146 align:middle line:90%
I watched the whole thing.

00:43:46.146 --> 00:43:47.770 align:middle line:84%
If they hadn't have
brought the videos,

00:43:47.770 --> 00:43:49.810 align:middle line:84%
I think I'd have
kicked them out.

00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:50.970 align:middle line:90%
According to the story.

00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:54.300 align:middle line:84%
He was to go to this
particular mountain.

00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And to dig in this
particular spot.

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And before he ever
did, they went and got

00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:00.531 align:middle line:84%
a permit to do this,
archaeological permit

00:44:00.531 --> 00:44:01.780 align:middle line:90%
and everything else like that.

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:03.410 align:middle line:84%
Did the whole thing
legally through it.

00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:05.350 align:middle line:90%
They got the whole stuff.

00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And they went to the spot,
and they started digging.

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And they got the
TV cameras on it.

00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And I sat there
for six hours, man,

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:16.270 align:middle line:84%
watching just about
every shovelful.

00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:17.480 align:middle line:90%
It was 30 days.

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:20.540 align:middle line:84%
But they condensed 30
days into six hours.

00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:22.885 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like it
was about two months.

00:44:22.885 --> 00:44:24.010 align:middle line:90%
Because I mean, they were--

00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:25.760 align:middle line:84%
[IMITATING SHOVELS DIGGING IN
 ROCKY SOIL]

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:26.560 align:middle line:90%


00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:28.820 align:middle line:84%
There was about 30 or 40
of them doing this digging.

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And what they told them was
is that they would dig down

00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:32.650 align:middle line:90%
a certain number of feet.

00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And they would find
a granite slab.

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:40.920 align:middle line:84%
The granite slab would
weigh 200 or 300 tons, would

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:46.860 align:middle line:84%
be approximately from here to
the wall in length, about six

00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:49.780 align:middle line:84%
or seven feet wide and
about this deep, polished

00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:54.210 align:middle line:84%
like a mirror, they would find
this granite slab in there.

00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And underneath that
granite slab would be

00:44:56.350 --> 00:44:58.490 align:middle line:90%
about six inches of red clay.

00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And the people from
Hollywood analyzed the clay.

00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:04.770 align:middle line:84%
The clay doesn't even
exist in Finland.

00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And then underneath
that, there would

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.740 align:middle line:90%
be this granite slab like this.

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:11.860 align:middle line:90%
And then this red clay.

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:14.600 align:middle line:90%
I should use red.

00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:16.472 align:middle line:90%
And then another granite slab.

00:45:16.472 --> 00:45:19.130 align:middle line:90%


00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:23.390 align:middle line:90%
And then this red clay in here.

00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:26.030 align:middle line:90%


00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And then another granite slab,
these huge, enormous slabs.

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And then another
thing of red clay.

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:41.420 align:middle line:90%
And then another granite slab.

00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:44.790 align:middle line:90%
And then more granite clay.

00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:49.850 align:middle line:90%
And then another granite slab.

00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:52.020 align:middle line:90%
And then more red clay.

00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:52.820 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And then another granite
slab, six of them.

00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:59.590 align:middle line:84%
It's like, the
creative thing of the I

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:03.320 align:middle line:90%
Ching, six straight lines.

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And this was about six or
seven feet under the Earth.

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:10.230 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't that far.

00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:13.282 align:middle line:84%
And so these guys dig
down, say, here it is.

00:46:13.282 --> 00:46:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And they clear the
whole thing out.

00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:15.855 align:middle line:90%
And you can see it.

00:46:15.855 --> 00:46:19.670 align:middle line:84%
It's this big, huge,
piece of granite.

00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:25.870 align:middle line:84%
Only these guys are
all Finnish hippies.

00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:26.995 align:middle line:90%
They're not archaeologists.

00:46:26.995 --> 00:46:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And they're going,
well, how are we

00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:29.930 align:middle line:90%
going to get this out of here?

00:46:29.930 --> 00:46:30.890 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:32.330 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:32.330 --> 00:46:33.960 align:middle line:90%
They could lift it.

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:36.035 align:middle line:90%
You couldn't, even a crane.

00:46:36.035 --> 00:46:38.820 align:middle line:84%
How you going to
lift 200 or 300 tons?

00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:41.387 align:middle line:84%
And so they decided
to blow it up.

00:46:41.387 --> 00:46:42.479 align:middle line:90%
[GASPS]

00:46:42.479 --> 00:46:43.520 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they did.

00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:44.470 align:middle line:90%
I watched them on the thing.

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:45.460 align:middle line:84%
They stuck dynamite
on this thing.

00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:46.668 align:middle line:90%
And they blew it all to bits.

00:46:46.668 --> 00:46:48.591 align:middle line:90%
And they carried the pieces out.

00:46:48.591 --> 00:46:49.840 align:middle line:90%
And they blew the next one up.

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.130 align:middle line:90%
And they blew the next one up.

00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:52.379 align:middle line:90%
And they blew the next one up.

00:46:52.379 --> 00:46:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And they just blew their
way, blasted their way

00:46:54.370 --> 00:46:55.195 align:middle line:90%
through this thing.

00:46:55.195 --> 00:46:57.740 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't believe
they were doing this.

00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And then, according
to the story,

00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:05.490 align:middle line:84%
after they got
through this, then

00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:08.592 align:middle line:84%
the mountain would be carved
out by hand underneath there.

00:47:08.592 --> 00:47:10.800 align:middle line:84%
Because they were right at
the base of this mountain.

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:12.174 align:middle line:84%
And there would
be a carving out,

00:47:12.174 --> 00:47:14.805 align:middle line:84%
and it would go into
a wedge like this.

00:47:14.805 --> 00:47:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And you could see, they
cleared out all this stuff,

00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:17.888 align:middle line:90%
going all the way down.

00:47:17.888 --> 00:47:20.400 align:middle line:84%
It was, like, 40, 50 feet,
going down into this mountain.

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:24.370 align:middle line:84%
And here was this perfect wedge
with all this sacred geometry

00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:25.560 align:middle line:90%
etched into the walls.

00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:27.803 align:middle line:84%
That's the part I was--
wow, look at this stuff.

00:47:27.803 --> 00:47:28.610 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:47:28.610 --> 00:47:29.930 align:middle line:90%
And going all the way down.

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And at the bottom, they
would come to this door.

00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:34.750 align:middle line:84%
They told me in advance before
they even started digging,

00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:38.000 align:middle line:90%
this is what the story was.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.430 align:middle line:90%
And they got down to the bottom.

00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:41.572 align:middle line:84%
And here was this
false door that

00:47:41.572 --> 00:47:43.740 align:middle line:84%
had been carved into the
side of the mountain.

00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:44.540 align:middle line:90%
Looked like a door.

00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:46.790 align:middle line:84%
But it was just a false
door, carved into it.

00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:49.190 align:middle line:84%
They were then told that in
the other side it was hollow.

00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:50.570 align:middle line:90%
And there was a passageway.

00:47:50.570 --> 00:47:52.840 align:middle line:90%
The passageway would go down.

00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:54.400 align:middle line:90%
And then it would curve up.

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:56.780 align:middle line:90%
And then curve to the left.

00:47:56.780 --> 00:48:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And then begin a vortex, going
like this, deep into the Earth.

00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:06.040 align:middle line:84%
I believe what they said,
10 miles into the Earth,

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:09.345 align:middle line:84%
with 15 million rooms
off of this hallway.

00:48:09.345 --> 00:48:12.180 align:middle line:90%


00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:14.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
pretty outrageous,

00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:16.800 align:middle line:90%
no matter how you look at it.

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:18.800 align:middle line:90%
But that's what they said.

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And that the first 200
or 300 of these rooms

00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:26.860 align:middle line:84%
would have a gold, full-size
life statue of the kings

00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:29.820 align:middle line:90%
that Bock represented.

00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:32.650 align:middle line:84%
His father's father's father's
father's father's father,

00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:34.170 align:middle line:90%
going all the way down there.

00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And in there were
all these treasures

00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:38.630 align:middle line:84%
associated with each one
of these different kings.

00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And then underneath
that were rooms

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:42.105 align:middle line:84%
that were associated
for other people.

00:48:42.105 --> 00:48:45.560 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what this all was.

00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:48.390 align:middle line:90%
And so I watched all this stuff.

00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:50.020 align:middle line:90%
And they got down to the room.

00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:51.900 align:middle line:90%
And he's drilling.

00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:54.003 align:middle line:84%
You see him with one of
these jackhammers, going--

00:48:54.003 --> 00:48:54.376 align:middle line:90%
[IMITATING JACKHAMMER]

00:48:54.376 --> 00:48:55.530 align:middle line:90%
--like this on this door.

00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's supposed to be
hollow on the other side.

00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:57.330 align:middle line:90%
And he's going--

00:48:57.330 --> 00:48:57.620 align:middle line:90%
[IMITATING JACKHAMMER]

00:48:57.620 --> 00:48:57.910 align:middle line:90%
--like this.

00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:58.370 align:middle line:90%
And he goes--

00:48:58.370 --> 00:48:58.795 align:middle line:90%
[POP]

00:48:58.795 --> 00:49:00.010 align:middle line:90%
--pops through like this.

00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:04.050 align:middle line:84%
The guy almost falls over like
this, and pulls the thing out.

00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
what do we do now?

00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment,
according to the story,

00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:13.930 align:middle line:84%
as soon as they popped
through and made the hole

00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:15.720 align:middle line:84%
to see that it was
hollow, then Ior

00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:18.950 align:middle line:84%
was to go to India,
for six months,

00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:21.540 align:middle line:90%
and to study with somebody.

00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I had got them after
they just popped through.

00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:26.380 align:middle line:90%
Ior was still in India.

00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:27.855 align:middle line:84%
And they're in my
room, showing me

00:49:27.855 --> 00:49:29.915 align:middle line:90%
these videos about this thing.

00:49:29.915 --> 00:49:31.924 align:middle line:90%


00:49:31.924 --> 00:49:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And so they're going,
well, what do you think?

00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:35.530 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:36.330 align:middle line:90%


00:49:36.330 --> 00:49:39.320 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:43.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all I could say, was
that this was a sacred pattern.

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:45.040 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't know.

00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:45.960 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know.

00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:48.850 align:middle line:84%
So they promised me that as
soon as Ior went in there,

00:49:48.850 --> 00:49:51.266 align:middle line:84%
they were going to go over
there and film the whole thing.

00:49:51.266 --> 00:49:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And they would let me
know what happened.

00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:58.140 align:middle line:84%
Six months went
by, and not a word.

00:49:58.140 --> 00:49:59.320 align:middle line:90%
A long time went by.

00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And I finally called
one of these guys up.

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And I said, whatever
happened on that?

00:50:04.050 --> 00:50:06.780 align:middle line:90%
He goes, we don't know.

00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:08.520 align:middle line:90%
Ior went in.

00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:11.780 align:middle line:90%
And then dead silence.

00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:13.040 align:middle line:90%
Wouldn't let anybody film it.

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:14.700 align:middle line:90%
Wouldn't let anybody come over.

00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't let anybody
see anything.

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:18.430 align:middle line:84%
They won't talk
about it any more.

00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:21.300 align:middle line:90%
Nothing, that's it.

00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:23.320 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know what's
happened on that.

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:29.720 align:middle line:84%
So I took this, and I have
this big file of weird things.

00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:32.620 align:middle line:84%
I put it in my weird thing
file and filed it in there

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:34.770 align:middle line:84%
with all this stuff
that somehow is

00:50:34.770 --> 00:50:36.020 align:middle line:90%
attracted to me all the time.

00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:37.650 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how I get it.

00:50:37.650 --> 00:50:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And put it in and i figured,
well, someday it'll make sense.

00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:42.550 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know.

00:50:42.550 --> 00:50:45.510 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of
language being in there,

00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:48.440 align:middle line:84%
that was the first time I'd
ever heard that language

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:50.510 align:middle line:90%
was associated with this.

00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:51.720 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't believe it.

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know what
to think about it.

00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:57.760 align:middle line:84%
Then, sometime later,
a couple years went by.

00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And a man named Dan
Winter came to my house.

00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And we sat down and a good
time talking about Sacred.

00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:06.800 align:middle line:84%
He's another guy involved
in sacred geometry,

00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:08.340 align:middle line:90%
up in New York.

00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And he's done a lot of
real interesting things

00:51:10.350 --> 00:51:13.300 align:middle line:84%
with sacred geometry that
are really pretty good.

00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:15.050 align:middle line:90%
And he's a good guy.

00:51:15.050 --> 00:51:19.510 align:middle line:84%
He's really trying to solve a
lot of the world's problems.

00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:23.920 align:middle line:84%
>>The universe is comprised of
a single, contiguous, folded

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:25.800 align:middle line:90%
surface.

00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And when a disturbance
or perturbation

00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:35.210 align:middle line:84%
strikes that medium, there
is a natural tendency

00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:37.820 align:middle line:84%
for toroidal
doughnut-like shapes

00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:41.310 align:middle line:90%
to occur folded in that space.

00:51:41.310 --> 00:51:44.750 align:middle line:84%
Torus doughnut is
self-standing because it

00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:49.330 align:middle line:84%
folds as wave and stores
inertia in three kinds of spin

00:51:49.330 --> 00:51:54.050 align:middle line:90%
at once-- X, Y, and Z-axis spin.

00:51:54.050 --> 00:51:58.860 align:middle line:84%
So this way of self-conserving
inertia in toroidal doughnut

00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:04.108 align:middle line:84%
forms is the way the beginning
of the universe occurred.

00:52:04.108 --> 00:52:08.940 align:middle line:84%
So we can we attempt to record
and describe mathematically

00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:15.450 align:middle line:84%
what happens when a drop
touches a folded surface.

00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:18.850 align:middle line:84%
This is actually a
3D map of a sine wave

00:52:18.850 --> 00:52:20.970 align:middle line:90%
animated mathematically.

00:52:20.970 --> 00:52:25.380 align:middle line:84%
But we can see that this
folded surface is constantly

00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:29.190 align:middle line:84%
recording the shape
of the wave that's

00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:31.610 align:middle line:90%
being permitted to stand on it.

00:52:31.610 --> 00:52:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And note how you
get this dimpling

00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:36.850 align:middle line:84%
doughnut, spiral
kind of foldedness

00:52:36.850 --> 00:52:40.320 align:middle line:90%
that constantly records shape.

00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And if the universe
is a unified field

00:52:42.190 --> 00:52:46.510 align:middle line:84%
and a compressible medium,
shape is really the only thing

00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:48.850 align:middle line:90%
that we have to remember.

00:52:48.850 --> 00:52:52.450 align:middle line:84%
Shape has to record all
the forms we call matter.

00:52:52.450 --> 00:52:56.520 align:middle line:90%


00:52:56.520 --> 00:53:01.215 align:middle line:84%
These toroidal doughnut-shaped
domains or fields or field

00:53:01.215 --> 00:53:06.890 align:middle line:84%
effects, as they're called, nest
concentrically, even fractally.

00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And the way they embed
one inside each other

00:53:11.530 --> 00:53:17.030 align:middle line:84%
is a clue for how the beginning
of things that we call atoms

00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:21.080 align:middle line:84%
occurred from the long wave and
the shapes of pressure eddies

00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:24.760 align:middle line:90%
that spans galaxies wide.

00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:27.650 align:middle line:84%
These waves use the
universal language

00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:30.880 align:middle line:84%
of pressure storing
inertia and momentum

00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:33.830 align:middle line:90%
to remember language of shape.

00:53:33.830 --> 00:53:36.106 align:middle line:84%
And shape is everything
we have to remember.

00:53:36.106 --> 00:53:42.495 align:middle line:84%
Because in a unified field, only
shape is stored to remember.

00:53:42.495 --> 00:53:44.860 align:middle line:84%
Later we'll look at
how the heart muscle

00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:49.180 align:middle line:84%
itself is layered according
to these viewpoints of spin

00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:54.270 align:middle line:84%
symmetry and how emotion
and events in the body

00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:57.920 align:middle line:84%
are following the
same wavelength.

00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:01.030 align:middle line:84%
But first, we'll look
at the actual creation

00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:03.833 align:middle line:84%
of the Atomic Table from the
wave shape of these domain

00:54:03.833 --> 00:54:04.633 align:middle line:90%
doughnuts.

00:54:04.633 --> 00:54:11.260 align:middle line:90%


00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:16.290 align:middle line:84%
This is three doughnuts,
spinning at 90 degrees

00:54:16.290 --> 00:54:20.430 align:middle line:84%
to each other, nesting into
what we'll eventually see

00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:24.660 align:middle line:84%
is actually the creation of
the shape of a cube, which

00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:27.740 align:middle line:84%
is three
perpendicular-- we might

00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:29.952 align:middle line:90%
think of them as orbitals.

00:54:29.952 --> 00:54:32.066 align:middle line:84%
So we'll have a
chemical meaning later,

00:54:32.066 --> 00:54:33.368 align:middle line:90%
when we think of pi suborbital.

00:54:33.368 --> 00:54:34.929 align:middle line:84%
Here we're going
to actually begin

00:54:34.929 --> 00:54:36.784 align:middle line:90%
to create the shape of the cube.

00:54:36.784 --> 00:54:40.220 align:middle line:90%


00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:45.602 align:middle line:84%
Here's another view those three
vortex light cone domains.

00:54:45.602 --> 00:54:48.450 align:middle line:90%


00:54:48.450 --> 00:54:51.720 align:middle line:84%
As they tilt into
the cubic array,

00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:54.505 align:middle line:84%
three perpendicular
domains can phase lock.

00:54:54.505 --> 00:54:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And this symmetry
among domains is later

00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:59.900 align:middle line:84%
what we're going to
call quantum theory.

00:54:59.900 --> 00:55:03.610 align:middle line:84%
It's important to remember that
what our cookbook to chemistry

00:55:03.610 --> 00:55:06.500 align:middle line:84%
is the memory of how to tilt
these nifty little doughnut

00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:07.428 align:middle line:90%
domain doohickeys.

00:55:07.428 --> 00:55:10.680 align:middle line:90%


00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:12.670 align:middle line:84%
The simplest
possible arrangement

00:55:12.670 --> 00:55:16.130 align:middle line:84%
of faces to make
a platonic solid

00:55:16.130 --> 00:55:17.880 align:middle line:90%
is called the tetrahedron.

00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:21.170 align:middle line:84%
It's called this because
it has four faces.

00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:24.980 align:middle line:84%
If we see that the simplest
possible arrangement

00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:29.895 align:middle line:84%
of light cones here is four
vortex faces converging

00:55:29.895 --> 00:55:33.430 align:middle line:84%
to make tetrahedron,
so four pairs of them

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:36.140 align:middle line:84%
will make the next view,
which is the octahedron.

00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:38.983 align:middle line:84%
Four individual light
cones make the tetrahedron.

00:55:38.983 --> 00:55:42.770 align:middle line:90%


00:55:42.770 --> 00:55:45.820 align:middle line:84%
We'll later see that the
viewpoints of the tetrahedron

00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:47.680 align:middle line:84%
have more symmetry
or more mirror

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:52.270 align:middle line:84%
spin axes than any of the
other platonic solids.

00:55:52.270 --> 00:55:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And later, we'll
be able to build

00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:58.620 align:middle line:84%
more beautiful and complex
platonic symmetry arrays.

00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:02.240 align:middle line:84%
This is based on
the dodecahedron.

00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:05.610 align:middle line:84%
This is six pair--
or 12 light cones--

00:56:05.610 --> 00:56:08.454 align:middle line:84%
nested in the arrangement
of the dodecahedron.

00:56:08.454 --> 00:56:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the beautiful,
pentagonal flowering symmetry

00:56:11.730 --> 00:56:12.530 align:middle line:90%
shape.

00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:19.730 align:middle line:90%


00:56:19.730 --> 00:56:24.551 align:middle line:84%
So again, let's remember
the simple shape

00:56:24.551 --> 00:56:29.300 align:middle line:84%
of two of these doughnuts,
nested together, spinning.

00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:33.270 align:middle line:90%


00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:35.010 align:middle line:84%
Notice the geometry
in the center

00:56:35.010 --> 00:56:39.990 align:middle line:84%
there, created because the
two of them are spinning.

00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:41.852 align:middle line:90%
And they're phased lock.

00:56:41.852 --> 00:56:43.120 align:middle line:90%
They're nested.

00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:44.620 align:middle line:84%
See the outline of
the square there?

00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:46.530 align:middle line:90%
The cube is implied.

00:56:46.530 --> 00:56:49.900 align:middle line:90%
We'll see another view of that.

00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:51.870 align:middle line:90%
And this is the same form.

00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:55.580 align:middle line:84%
We've just added
the third doughnut.

00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:58.960 align:middle line:84%
So now it's spinning on
the z-axis, the x-axis,

00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:01.401 align:middle line:90%
and the y-axis.

00:57:01.401 --> 00:57:05.248 align:middle line:84%
There's a beautiful
cube in there,

00:57:05.248 --> 00:57:06.709 align:middle line:90%
three spinning doughnuts.

00:57:06.709 --> 00:57:18.900 align:middle line:90%


00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:25.460 align:middle line:84%
Note how the simple sine
wave, when we spin it around,

00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:28.100 align:middle line:90%
actually makes the doughnut.

00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:31.630 align:middle line:84%
So actually, the cross section
of the symbol for the Tao

00:57:31.630 --> 00:57:33.218 align:middle line:84%
was really built
on the sine wave.

00:57:33.218 --> 00:57:39.790 align:middle line:90%


00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:43.873 align:middle line:84%
And then we can take the
same embedded nesting

00:57:43.873 --> 00:57:50.090 align:middle line:84%
of the long wave on the
short wave of sine waves

00:57:50.090 --> 00:57:54.320 align:middle line:84%
to make electron
shells and orbitals

00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:57.790 align:middle line:84%
and eventually braid
them into the 3D forms

00:57:57.790 --> 00:58:03.470 align:middle line:84%
that we know of as
membranes, objects.

00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:09.954 align:middle line:84%
We braid those nested, embedded
waveforms into symmetry space.

00:58:09.954 --> 00:58:10.995 align:middle line:90%
And we can make a sphere.

00:58:10.995 --> 00:58:14.097 align:middle line:90%


00:58:14.097 --> 00:58:15.680 align:middle line:84%
It's really necessary
for the universe

00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:19.480 align:middle line:84%
to invent ways for
sine waves to nest

00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:23.935 align:middle line:84%
before she can create 3D
balloons and membranes

00:58:23.935 --> 00:58:27.846 align:middle line:84%
and bubbles, things
that have surface.

00:58:27.846 --> 00:58:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And remember, all
of this was done

00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:32.830 align:middle line:84%
by simply remembering
how to spin

00:58:32.830 --> 00:58:37.750 align:middle line:84%
a doughnut in three dimensions,
or three axes of spin.

00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:39.710 align:middle line:84%
So this, prepare
the field, the field

00:58:39.710 --> 00:58:44.200 align:middle line:84%
affect the domain that we
have to do with our attention,

00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:45.970 align:middle line:84%
boils down to this
issue of remembering

00:58:45.970 --> 00:58:47.449 align:middle line:90%
how to spin the doughnuts.

00:58:47.449 --> 00:58:52.390 align:middle line:90%


00:58:52.390 --> 00:58:55.900 align:middle line:84%
So the number of dimensions
is the number of spins

00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:57.642 align:middle line:90%
that are superposed.

00:58:57.642 --> 00:59:01.514 align:middle line:84%
The only sense in which
dimension has any meaning

00:59:01.514 --> 00:59:04.430 align:middle line:84%
is this superposition
or concentricity

00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:08.350 align:middle line:90%
of axes of spin or rotation.

00:59:08.350 --> 00:59:10.470 align:middle line:84%
So what we've been
calling dimension

00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:15.400 align:middle line:84%
has really been the ability
of wave doughnut vortex fields

00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:17.730 align:middle line:90%
to be superposed.

00:59:17.730 --> 00:59:18.530 align:middle line:90%
This is important.

00:59:18.530 --> 00:59:20.779 align:middle line:84%
Because now we're going to
get the sense of if we want

00:59:20.779 --> 00:59:22.760 align:middle line:84%
to live in more
than one dimension

00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:25.610 align:middle line:84%
at once, with respect to
our attention or awareness

00:59:25.610 --> 00:59:28.865 align:middle line:84%
or consciousness, we must
be able to focus or phase

00:59:28.865 --> 00:59:31.149 align:middle line:84%
lock or cohere with
these field effects.

00:59:31.149 --> 00:59:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
happens with emotion

00:59:32.690 --> 00:59:37.680 align:middle line:84%
in the body, which we'll look
more at in a little while.

00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:40.960 align:middle line:84%
Concentric lines
of force even apply

00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:44.560 align:middle line:84%
to the way in which the planet
maintains its electrical

00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:48.320 align:middle line:84%
and its phase lock to
its gravitational fields.

00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:52.110 align:middle line:84%
So the way in which populations
interact with these field

00:59:52.110 --> 00:59:54.390 align:middle line:84%
effects help determine
whether the planet

00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:56.292 align:middle line:90%
is stable, even tectonically.

00:59:56.292 --> 01:00:00.630 align:middle line:90%


01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:08.490 align:middle line:84%
By tracing the path
down two light cones,

01:00:08.490 --> 01:00:16.760 align:middle line:84%
we've actually put 10 spirals of
Golden Mean on that light cone,

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:26.309 align:middle line:84%
and traced a beautiful
series of overlays,

01:00:26.309 --> 01:00:32.220 align:middle line:84%
suggesting how organic
shapes occur when these field

01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:37.171 align:middle line:90%
effects occur in light cones.

01:00:37.171 --> 01:00:41.163 align:middle line:90%
It's fun to play with.

01:00:41.163 --> 01:00:42.660 align:middle line:90%
And then they reach center.

01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:46.660 align:middle line:90%


01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:49.350 align:middle line:84%
This is another animation
similar to the one that we

01:00:49.350 --> 01:00:53.430 align:middle line:84%
started with, showing
the relationships of four

01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:58.038 align:middle line:84%
light cones, nested
and spinning.

01:00:58.038 --> 01:01:04.320 align:middle line:90%


01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:06.890 align:middle line:84%
The spiral of Golden
Mean, if we see it from

01:01:06.890 --> 01:01:13.050 align:middle line:84%
above, going down at cone, and
then rotate it to the side,

01:01:13.050 --> 01:01:16.483 align:middle line:84%
it begins to look like the
tongue of the serpent there,

01:01:16.483 --> 01:01:21.040 align:middle line:90%
hence the term, serpent power.

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And later, we're going
to revolve this form

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.360 align:middle line:84%
into something we
call the grail cup.

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:28.360 align:middle line:90%


01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:30.370 align:middle line:84%
This is reminiscent
of how it is that we

01:01:30.370 --> 01:01:32.765 align:middle line:84%
get this recursion
from the large world

01:01:32.765 --> 01:01:36.210 align:middle line:84%
into the small, idealized by
the scope within the spiral.

01:01:36.210 --> 01:01:38.000 align:middle line:90%
So we can take this spiral now.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.980 align:middle line:84%
This is one spiral,
seen from four views.

01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:43.644 align:middle line:90%
The top left is the a top view.

01:01:43.644 --> 01:01:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And then to the right,
we have a side view.

01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:48.920 align:middle line:84%
The bottom left is
another side view.

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And bottom right
is an oblique view.

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And then we begin to
revolve this spiral.

01:01:57.300 --> 01:01:59.810 align:middle line:90%
And we get a cup shape.

01:01:59.810 --> 01:02:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And this cup is
infinitely recursive.

01:02:02.530 --> 01:02:05.930 align:middle line:90%
You can zoom into it.

01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:07.580 align:middle line:90%
First, let's turn it around.

01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:09.579 align:middle line:84%
We can see the different
view points in the cup.

01:02:09.579 --> 01:02:14.800 align:middle line:90%


01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:21.310 align:middle line:84%
There are seven regions that
will map onto perfectly, just

01:02:21.310 --> 01:02:24.815 align:middle line:84%
as there is seven spheres
that will fit together

01:02:24.815 --> 01:02:27.490 align:middle line:84%
into that thing, there
are seven regions

01:02:27.490 --> 01:02:29.810 align:middle line:90%
that map perfectly onto this.

01:02:29.810 --> 01:02:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And they just gave them
seven different colors.

01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:37.520 align:middle line:84%
So this is called a seven-color
map that was on there.

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.480 align:middle line:84%
If you really want
to understand that,

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:41.230 align:middle line:84%
I suggest you get a
mathematical book,

01:02:41.230 --> 01:02:42.610 align:middle line:90%
and read all the thesis of it.

01:02:42.610 --> 01:02:45.660 align:middle line:84%
It's from Arthur
Young, is who it is.

01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:48.891 align:middle line:84%
They've mapped other
maps onto these now.

01:02:48.891 --> 01:02:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And these seven regions are
associated with the heart.

01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:56.660 align:middle line:84%
The heart has seven
regions and seven muscles.

01:02:56.660 --> 01:02:58.460 align:middle line:90%
And they move according to this.

01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:00.750 align:middle line:84%
There's a direct
association with the seven

01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:03.550 align:middle line:84%
regions of the two torus and
the heart, the human heart.

01:03:03.550 --> 01:03:07.110 align:middle line:90%


01:03:07.110 --> 01:03:08.290 align:middle line:90%
Yes, Dan Winters?

01:03:08.290 --> 01:03:09.290 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I'll get you next.

01:03:09.290 --> 01:03:12.680 align:middle line:90%
>>A question about our origins.

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:14.182 align:middle line:90%
It's not directly about this.

01:03:14.182 --> 01:03:15.640 align:middle line:84%
But it is something
that we covered

01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:18.090 align:middle line:84%
that I feel would be
useful to have explained

01:03:18.090 --> 01:03:19.990 align:middle line:90%
just a little bit further.

01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And that is, that I understand
that the Anunnakis created

01:03:23.010 --> 01:03:23.890 align:middle line:90%
the slave race.

01:03:23.890 --> 01:03:26.120 align:middle line:84%
We had the Hebrews and
we had the Martians

01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:27.400 align:middle line:90%
come to this Earth.

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Was there such a thing
as original Earthlings?

01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And where are they in the
scheme of things today?

01:03:35.070 --> 01:03:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>>The image that
Thoth gave to me

01:03:36.730 --> 01:03:41.090 align:middle line:84%
was that the Earth
has been like a womb

01:03:41.090 --> 01:03:45.485 align:middle line:84%
for many, many, many
different races,

01:03:45.485 --> 01:03:48.330 align:middle line:84%
unconsciousness of beings
that have come here,

01:03:48.330 --> 01:03:52.580 align:middle line:84%
different kinds, lots of
different, real different kinds

01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:56.110 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, going
back 500 million years.

01:03:56.110 --> 01:03:58.567 align:middle line:84%
And these races go
through these five stages.

01:03:58.567 --> 01:03:59.400 align:middle line:90%
And then they leave.

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:01.400 align:middle line:84%
They completely leave
the whole octave.

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:04.040 align:middle line:84%
They go do something
totally different

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:06.610 align:middle line:84%
than be with their planets
and this kind of being-ness.

01:04:06.610 --> 01:04:10.800 align:middle line:90%


01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:12.296 align:middle line:90%
>>They leave through ascension?

01:04:12.296 --> 01:04:16.270 align:middle line:90%


01:04:16.270 --> 01:04:21.380 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, ascension as
we know ascension,

01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:23.980 align:middle line:84%
is going from one
level to another level.

01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:27.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, the final phase
is beyond ascension.

01:04:27.770 --> 01:04:32.020 align:middle line:84%
It's actually going onto
another way of being.

01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:34.430 align:middle line:84%
When you reach
the 55-foot level,

01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:36.480 align:middle line:90%
and you become that perfection,

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:39.070 align:middle line:84%
Then at that point,
there is something

01:04:39.070 --> 01:04:41.460 align:middle line:84%
that we are capable of
doing that we can't really

01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:42.690 align:middle line:90%
talk about at this level.

01:04:42.690 --> 01:04:44.690 align:middle line:84%
It's something
beyond all of this.

01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:45.880 align:middle line:90%
We go beyond it.

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:49.100 align:middle line:84%
So the Earth becomes,
like, a breeding ground

01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:53.260 align:middle line:84%
to create these races that
go on to this other place.

01:04:53.260 --> 01:05:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And the slave race,
we maybe initially

01:05:00.690 --> 01:05:02.070 align:middle line:90%
were started that way.

01:05:02.070 --> 01:05:06.340 align:middle line:84%
But we came out of that
when Adam and Eve broke away

01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:08.740 align:middle line:90%
from that, they set us aside.

01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:11.280 align:middle line:90%
The slavery race kept going.

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And they set us aside
to grow on our own.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And at one point, they
just stopped all of that.

01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:18.810 align:middle line:90%
And they all died.

01:05:18.810 --> 01:05:20.810 align:middle line:90%
Because they couldn't procreate.

01:05:20.810 --> 01:05:23.200 align:middle line:84%
So the slave race,
basically, died out.

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And that this new aspect with
Adam and Eve is what we are.

01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:29.420 align:middle line:90%
That's where we came from.

01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:30.950 align:middle line:90%
>>And the original Earthlings?

01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:32.695 align:middle line:84%
Are they separate
from, or intermingled?

01:05:32.695 --> 01:05:36.110 align:middle line:90%


01:05:36.110 --> 01:05:38.760 align:middle line:84%
>>You mean the original ones,
meaning from the Adam and Eve?

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:41.830 align:middle line:84%
>>No, no, before that, when
the Annunaki came here,

01:05:41.830 --> 01:05:44.130 align:middle line:84%
were there inhabitants
upon this Earth

01:05:44.130 --> 01:05:46.670 align:middle line:84%
that we might consider to
be original Earthlings?

01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:50.710 align:middle line:84%
I know you said your
first wife was from Earth.

01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:52.130 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know what--

01:05:52.130 --> 01:05:55.510 align:middle line:90%


01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:57.450 align:middle line:84%
When I say, someone
is from Earth,

01:05:57.450 --> 01:06:02.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean they have been in
this evolutionary cycle

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:03.880 align:middle line:90%
for a long time.

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:07.600 align:middle line:84%
But this evolutionary cycle
only goes back 200,000 years,

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:09.850 align:middle line:90%
a little longer than that.

01:06:09.850 --> 01:06:12.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you want to stretch
it back to what Sumerians say,

01:06:12.590 --> 01:06:14.225 align:middle line:90%
250,000 years.

01:06:14.225 --> 01:06:15.600 align:middle line:84%
But no matter how
you look at it,

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:20.520 align:middle line:90%
it's 200,000, 250,000 years.

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:29.280 align:middle line:84%
So I don't see there
being any such thing

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:31.720 align:middle line:90%
as an original Earthling.

01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:34.910 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has come
from somewhere else.

01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:38.725 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, we all came
from outside of the system.

01:06:38.725 --> 01:06:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, we were
just one being, one spirit.

01:06:45.030 --> 01:06:45.830 align:middle line:90%
There was just one.

01:06:45.830 --> 01:06:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And we came in and
diffracted into this place.

01:06:48.910 --> 01:06:51.172 align:middle line:84%
And we've diffracted,
and we've diffracted,

01:06:51.172 --> 01:06:54.050 align:middle line:84%
and we've diffracted, and we've
diffracted further and further,

01:06:54.050 --> 01:06:55.970 align:middle line:90%
further down.

01:06:55.970 --> 01:07:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is about as far down as
you can go in the diffraction.

01:07:00.770 --> 01:07:04.620 align:middle line:90%


01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:09.540 align:middle line:84%
But if you were to look
at these diffractions

01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:13.370 align:middle line:84%
where they came from, we've
all come from different places.

01:07:13.370 --> 01:07:15.010 align:middle line:84%
If you want to say,
where we came from.

01:07:15.010 --> 01:07:16.430 align:middle line:84%
But even when you get
to that place, you say,

01:07:16.430 --> 01:07:17.556 align:middle line:90%
well, I came from Sirius.

01:07:17.556 --> 01:07:19.555 align:middle line:84%
When you get to Sirius,
you find the diffraction

01:07:19.555 --> 01:07:23.357 align:middle line:84%
that you aren't really from
Sirius because you track it

01:07:23.357 --> 01:07:24.940 align:middle line:84%
further enough down
from there, you've

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:26.050 align:middle line:90%
come from somewhere else.

01:07:26.050 --> 01:07:28.341 align:middle line:84%
And if you keep following
that back, you'll keep going.

01:07:28.341 --> 01:07:31.354 align:middle line:84%
And if you go back
the diffraction rate,

01:07:31.354 --> 01:07:33.520 align:middle line:84%
you'll keep coming back
until you come to this place

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:38.490 align:middle line:84%
where you go outside of
it, outside of the system.

01:07:38.490 --> 01:07:40.710 align:middle line:84%
This whole waveform
universe is something

01:07:40.710 --> 01:07:45.420 align:middle line:84%
that was created from a sphere
by one person, one spirit,

01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:46.730 align:middle line:90%
whose name was Metatron.

01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:48.330 align:middle line:90%
This is my belief.

01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And he sat in this circle
with these particular beings

01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:57.170 align:middle line:84%
and conceived of
the idea of a sphere

01:07:57.170 --> 01:07:59.880 align:middle line:84%
from which everything
else was created through.

01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:01.200 align:middle line:90%
And this is an experiment.

01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:03.150 align:middle line:90%
We live in an experiment.

01:08:03.150 --> 01:08:07.850 align:middle line:84%
It's just a test case,
see how it would work.

01:08:07.850 --> 01:08:09.140 align:middle line:90%
And it's not complete.

01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:12.880 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
the end result is yet.

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:14.300 align:middle line:84%
We're not all the
way through it.

01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:16.364 align:middle line:84%
We're like a rose that
is just a little bud that

01:08:16.364 --> 01:08:17.510 align:middle line:90%
is still opening.

01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And it hasn't actually
formed a rose.

01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:23.105 align:middle line:84%
And we're not sure what it's
really going to look like.

01:08:23.105 --> 01:08:26.939 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are
places, there are ways

01:08:26.939 --> 01:08:29.125 align:middle line:84%
of being that
spirit can inhabit,

01:08:29.125 --> 01:08:31.620 align:middle line:84%
that are completely
different than this.

01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:33.319 align:middle line:90%
There's no words.

01:08:33.319 --> 01:08:34.490 align:middle line:90%
There's no images.

01:08:34.490 --> 01:08:37.287 align:middle line:84%
There's no nothing that
could transmit that.

01:08:37.287 --> 01:08:38.745 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing in
this system that

01:08:38.745 --> 01:08:41.134 align:middle line:84%
could transmit the
kinds of things that

01:08:41.134 --> 01:08:42.300 align:middle line:90%
would be outside the system.

01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:45.620 align:middle line:90%


01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:47.479 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we
would eventually get to.

01:08:47.479 --> 01:08:50.140 align:middle line:90%
We come out as one spirit.

01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:51.859 align:middle line:90%
We come into this whole thing.

01:08:51.859 --> 01:08:53.200 align:middle line:90%
We come down, and we live it.

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the only way
you can find out what it is.

01:08:55.630 --> 01:08:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And then, once we
get down in here,

01:08:57.130 --> 01:08:59.060 align:middle line:84%
and we mingle all
that in here, then

01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:02.680 align:middle line:84%
we start returning back,
coming back through all this.

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:05.720 align:middle line:84%
Which it's a joining
process, rather than that.

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:08.450 align:middle line:84%
You keep coming back up to
higher and higher levels

01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:11.770 align:middle line:84%
with larger bodies of
single consciousness,

01:09:11.770 --> 01:09:13.450 align:middle line:84%
until you find you
come to these planes

01:09:13.450 --> 01:09:18.260 align:middle line:84%
where there's only this
single consciousness that's

01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:19.529 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

01:09:19.529 --> 01:09:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And then the decision
is made whether or not

01:09:22.870 --> 01:09:24.029 align:middle line:90%
you remain there.

01:09:24.029 --> 01:09:26.170 align:middle line:84%
Or if you go back
outside the system

01:09:26.170 --> 01:09:30.180 align:middle line:84%
again, and return into
the original source.

01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:36.796 align:middle line:84%
This is the image that I have
held for a pretty long time,

01:09:36.796 --> 01:09:40.224 align:middle line:90%
about 10 billion years.

01:09:40.224 --> 01:09:44.100 align:middle line:90%
And that's how I've seen it.

01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Though if you've got a
better way, I'll look at it.

01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:58.131 align:middle line:84%
But I guess that's about
all I can say on it.

01:09:58.131 --> 01:10:00.095 align:middle line:90%
You know?

01:10:00.095 --> 01:10:03.210 align:middle line:90%
But nobody's form anywhere.

01:10:03.210 --> 01:10:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And even these different
places are just illusion.

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:10.030 align:middle line:90%
There's no-- all this stuff.

01:10:10.030 --> 01:10:12.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I say illusion,
I mean, it doesn't exist.

01:10:12.530 --> 01:10:13.330 align:middle line:90%
This?

01:10:13.330 --> 01:10:14.160 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't.

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:15.250 align:middle line:90%
There's no solidness here.

01:10:15.250 --> 01:10:17.340 align:middle line:90%
There's no table here.

01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:18.310 align:middle line:90%
It's just space.

01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:20.180 align:middle line:90%
And it's just movement.

01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:23.630 align:middle line:90%
It's all based on just movement.

01:10:23.630 --> 01:10:28.100 align:middle line:84%
We can break it down to
our mind gives us solidity.

01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:30.150 align:middle line:84%
Our mind gives the
temperature of things.

01:10:30.150 --> 01:10:33.720 align:middle line:84%
What we're sensing is all
of our sensing devices.

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:34.730 align:middle line:90%
But it's not real.

01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:38.326 align:middle line:84%
>>And yet, it's important
to know where we came from

01:10:38.326 --> 01:10:40.857 align:middle line:84%
in order to combine
with where we are,

01:10:40.857 --> 01:10:42.080 align:middle line:90%
to know where we're going.

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:46.140 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, we're talking about
in a contracted, small amount

01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:47.250 align:middle line:90%
of time and space.

01:10:47.250 --> 01:10:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is important
for us here and now,

01:10:50.910 --> 01:10:55.900 align:middle line:84%
under these conditions,
for us to do this.

01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:58.690 align:middle line:84%
That may not be true under
different conditions.

01:10:58.690 --> 01:11:02.790 align:middle line:84%
In polarity consciousness,
where our consciousness

01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:07.087 align:middle line:84%
is broken into threeness,
that's necessary.

01:11:07.087 --> 01:11:08.545 align:middle line:84%
A little bit further
down the line,

01:11:08.545 --> 01:11:10.498 align:middle line:90%
that would not even make sense.

01:11:10.498 --> 01:11:13.414 align:middle line:90%


01:11:13.414 --> 01:11:15.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:16.820 align:middle line:84%
>>Getting back to
the Tube Torus--

01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:17.620 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you.

>>Where does the name come from?

01:11:22.534 --> 01:11:23.700 align:middle line:90%
Why is it called Tube Torus?

01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:25.395 align:middle line:90%
>>Tube, is like an inner tube.

01:11:25.395 --> 01:11:26.195 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

01:11:26.195 --> 01:11:29.720 align:middle line:84%
>>And a torus is the
particular mathematical shape

01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:31.730 align:middle line:90%
that does this.

01:11:31.730 --> 01:11:33.773 align:middle line:84%
There is no other
shape that will fold in

01:11:33.773 --> 01:11:34.926 align:middle line:90%
on itself like this.

01:11:34.926 --> 01:11:36.350 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, that's the torus.

01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:39.340 align:middle line:84%
>>The magnetic field that
comes back through and comes

01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:42.800 align:middle line:84%
like that, that whole thing,
like the apple-type shape,

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:43.600 align:middle line:90%
that's a torus.

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:46.372 align:middle line:84%
And a Tube Torus is one
that's in the shape of a tube.

01:11:46.372 --> 01:11:49.542 align:middle line:90%


01:11:49.542 --> 01:11:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Is there any more shapes
about the alphabet and this?

01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:52.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:53.280 align:middle line:90%
And more shapes?

01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:54.162 align:middle line:90%
Any more questions?

01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:02.520 align:middle line:84%
isn't it the exact
shape of the Tube Torus?

01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:03.350 align:middle line:90%
>>Not exactly.

01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:05.140 align:middle line:90%
But it is a torus.

01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:06.700 align:middle line:84%
We have a north
and a south pole.

01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:09.205 align:middle line:84%
And we have a field that wraps
around and comes back right

01:12:09.205 --> 01:12:11.380 align:middle line:90%
through the center like this.

01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:12.380 align:middle line:90%
So we are a torus.

01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:15.900 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you'll see this on
the screen in a little while.

01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:18.730 align:middle line:90%
Now, here is the next rotation.

01:12:18.730 --> 01:12:22.320 align:middle line:84%
With the first rotation, we
saw this little guy pop out.

01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:27.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, the next one is that you
go to the innermost places.

01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:30.320 align:middle line:84%
So the gold one is the
six days of Genesis.

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
innermost places.

01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And so the rotation rotates on
those spots and centers there,

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:40.600 align:middle line:90%
and creates this pattern.

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:44.860 align:middle line:84%
So this is the second rotational
pattern going around like that.

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that,
you're now looking

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:50.090 align:middle line:84%
at another
three-dimensional shape

01:12:50.090 --> 01:12:52.220 align:middle line:90%
that you can hold in your hand.

01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's a really
super important one.

01:12:53.970 --> 01:12:56.990 align:middle line:84%
It's the second
shape of Genesis.

01:12:56.990 --> 01:13:01.290 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, I remember
when the angels told me

01:13:01.290 --> 01:13:02.625 align:middle line:90%
exactly what I just told you.

01:13:02.625 --> 01:13:05.120 align:middle line:90%
And I was going, really?

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:06.570 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what is it?

01:13:06.570 --> 01:13:07.880 align:middle line:90%
And they just said, look at it.

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:09.830 align:middle line:90%
They wouldn't tell me.

01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:10.890 align:middle line:90%
And I had to sit there.

01:13:10.890 --> 01:13:11.723 align:middle line:90%
They always do that.

01:13:11.723 --> 01:13:15.870 align:middle line:90%
They make me work all the time.

01:13:15.870 --> 01:13:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And I sat there, I
mean, for two days.

01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:20.997 align:middle line:90%
Just, there's a shape in there?

01:13:20.997 --> 01:13:23.080 align:middle line:84%
Looking at it and looking
at it and looking at it.

01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And finally, all of a
sudden, it just went boing!

01:13:25.610 --> 01:13:26.780 align:middle line:90%
It just popped out at me.

01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:28.640 align:middle line:90%
You know, wow.

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:31.490 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:36.260 align:middle line:84%
If you were to erase all
the lines in the center one,

01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:38.210 align:middle line:90%
and erase certain other lines.

01:13:38.210 --> 01:13:41.640 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we erase
all these black lines

01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:48.370 align:middle line:84%
and also all the ones in the
center, what pops out is this.

01:13:48.370 --> 01:13:53.460 align:middle line:84%
Which is an actual
three-dimensional shape,

01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:59.020 align:middle line:84%
that I'll go back one more time
so you can see where they are.

01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:03.060 align:middle line:90%


01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And that is a
three-dimensional view.

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:09.000 align:middle line:84%
I'll draw lines
through it in here,

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:14.130 align:middle line:84%
of a cube with a
sphere on each corner.

01:14:14.130 --> 01:14:16.704 align:middle line:90%


01:14:16.704 --> 01:14:18.370 align:middle line:84%
You can't see the
eighth one, of course.

01:14:18.370 --> 01:14:21.290 align:middle line:84%
Because that's on
the other side.

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And so this funny little
thing of either little spheres

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:29.150 align:middle line:84%
comes popping off the page
on the second time around.

01:14:29.150 --> 01:14:31.980 align:middle line:84%
This had a name, according
to the ancients, also.

01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And they called it
the Egg of Life.

01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:36.130 align:middle line:90%


01:14:36.130 --> 01:14:39.770 align:middle line:10%
I didn't understand that term
when they first gave it to me.

01:14:39.770 --> 01:14:41.340 align:middle line:10%
It took me awhile.

01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:43.210 align:middle line:10%
Now it makes perfect sense.

01:14:43.210 --> 01:14:50.870 align:middle line:10%
Because it is the morphogenic
structure of biology.

01:14:50.870 --> 01:14:53.430 align:middle line:84%
It creates all the
living life forms.

01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:55.672 align:middle line:90%
It creates you.

01:14:55.672 --> 01:14:58.130 align:middle line:84%
Right down the very shape of
your eyes and everything else.

01:14:58.130 --> 01:15:02.200 align:middle line:84%
It's the structure
that forms bodies.

01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And it is also the one that
has to do with sound and light.

01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:10.680 align:middle line:90%
It is interrelated with that.

01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:13.590 align:middle line:84%
As we will clearly be able
to show in organic structure,

01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:15.410 align:middle line:84%
that sound and light
are interrelated.

01:15:15.410 --> 01:15:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is the shape that
ties them all together.

01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:23.515 align:middle line:84%
And so for right
now, I'm just going

01:15:23.515 --> 01:15:28.250 align:middle line:84%
to introduce it, that it's here,
give a name and put it down.

01:15:28.250 --> 01:15:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And in a little bit,
we'll come back.

01:15:31.210 --> 01:15:34.535 align:middle line:84%
And I'll be able to show you
what I mean by what this is.

01:15:34.535 --> 01:15:39.720 align:middle line:84%
There's then another vortex,
what you go, one more

01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:42.010 align:middle line:90%
time you rotate around.

01:15:42.010 --> 01:15:45.230 align:middle line:84%
This is the third rotation
around the central Genesis

01:15:45.230 --> 01:15:46.710 align:middle line:90%
Pattern.

01:15:46.710 --> 01:15:49.730 align:middle line:84%
There's also another pattern
here, of seven spheres.

01:15:49.730 --> 01:15:51.385 align:middle line:90%
You see this one in the middle.

01:15:51.385 --> 01:15:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And you see this one
here, and this one here.

01:15:54.930 --> 01:15:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And there's seven spheres that
are just touching each other.

01:15:58.730 --> 01:16:01.805 align:middle line:84%
These just touch each
other all the way around.

01:16:01.805 --> 01:16:03.526 align:middle line:90%
Does everybody see that?

01:16:03.526 --> 01:16:05.474 align:middle line:90%
Anybody not see it?

01:16:05.474 --> 01:16:06.890 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:16:06.890 --> 01:16:08.870 align:middle line:90%
That pattern is real special.

01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:17.410 align:middle line:84%
But it requires something else
in there for it to be clear.

01:16:17.410 --> 01:16:21.410 align:middle line:84%
It took life a long time to
understand this part of it.

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And when they did, life
decided that the pattern

01:16:26.170 --> 01:16:29.015 align:middle line:84%
that I'm about to show you was
so sacred that they hid it.

01:16:29.015 --> 01:16:31.920 align:middle line:90%


01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:33.040 align:middle line:90%
It's never shown.

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even know where it
ever is shown, except for here.

01:16:36.670 --> 01:16:38.920 align:middle line:90%
It usually isn't shown.

01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:41.351 align:middle line:84%
The flower of life up here,
this is the outer limits

01:16:41.351 --> 01:16:42.267 align:middle line:90%
of the flower of life.

01:16:42.267 --> 01:16:44.470 align:middle line:84%
What they do right now,
all over the world,

01:16:44.470 --> 01:16:48.520 align:middle line:84%
is they encircle this with
two circles, completed

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:52.170 align:middle line:90%
to this image.

01:16:52.170 --> 01:16:53.910 align:middle line:84%
So if you notice,
there's 7 circles

01:16:53.910 --> 01:16:56.321 align:middle line:84%
in this one that just
fit around there.

01:16:56.321 --> 01:16:57.320 align:middle line:90%
Does everybody see that?

01:16:57.320 --> 01:16:59.860 align:middle line:90%


01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:02.350 align:middle line:90%
Does anybody not see it?

01:17:02.350 --> 01:17:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Except in this one, they
completed the whole pattern,

01:17:06.670 --> 01:17:09.090 align:middle line:90%
all the way through it.

01:17:09.090 --> 01:17:12.274 align:middle line:84%
And then they put this on
the walls all over the world.

01:17:12.274 --> 01:17:17.700 align:middle line:84%
In fact, It's all over the
universe, not just here.

01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:21.900 align:middle line:84%
Why did they stop right
here and not go on?

01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:25.170 align:middle line:84%
In all the world,
there's these 19 circles.

01:17:25.170 --> 01:17:26.970 align:middle line:84%
Because this could be
an infinite pattern.

01:17:26.970 --> 01:17:31.020 align:middle line:84%
What was it about this thing
that they were trying to hide?

01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:32.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, the reason they
put it right here

01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:36.957 align:middle line:84%
and stopped at this place was
because of this sacred form

01:17:36.957 --> 01:17:39.290 align:middle line:84%
that I'm talking about, but
they didn't want you to see.

01:17:39.290 --> 01:17:42.110 align:middle line:84%
But they wanted you
to know it was there.

01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:44.426 align:middle line:90%
And so this was the secret.

01:17:44.426 --> 01:17:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And the secret is to
get to the sacred form

01:17:48.740 --> 01:17:50.460 align:middle line:90%
is you complete the circles.

01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:53.890 align:middle line:84%
You see how there's
a piece of one here.

01:17:53.890 --> 01:17:55.520 align:middle line:90%
And here's another bigger piece.

01:17:55.520 --> 01:18:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And there's three little
tiny pieces of circles.

01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:03.000 align:middle line:84%
You put your compass so
that one would go, whoosh,

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.530 align:middle line:90%
around like that.

01:18:04.530 --> 01:18:07.360 align:middle line:84%
There's another piece
of a circle completed.

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:12.370 align:middle line:84%
Complete all the circles that
are shown on this pattern.

01:18:12.370 --> 01:18:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And look to see what
the next vortex is.

01:18:15.450 --> 01:18:20.640 align:middle line:84%
The very, very
next vortex, here's

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:22.475 align:middle line:90%
the Flower of Life image.

01:18:22.475 --> 01:18:24.650 align:middle line:84%
This is the seven
circles, this touching.

01:18:24.650 --> 01:18:27.470 align:middle line:90%
And this is the limit.

01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:30.172 align:middle line:84%
Here in pencil, you'll
see all those circles

01:18:30.172 --> 01:18:31.005 align:middle line:90%
that were completed.

01:18:31.005 --> 01:18:34.580 align:middle line:90%


01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:37.800 align:middle line:84%
The next rotational pattern
is the innermost points,

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:42.030 align:middle line:84%
which are there, there,
there, there, and there.

01:18:42.030 --> 01:18:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And so I drew the
circles on there.

01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And so if you just complete
the circles of here,

01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:52.310 align:middle line:84%
make the very next
rotation, and what you get

01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:54.045 align:middle line:90%
is this pattern of 13 circles.

01:18:54.045 --> 01:18:55.576 align:middle line:90%
It looks like this.

01:18:55.576 --> 01:19:00.230 align:middle line:84%
So if you extract that
out, you get this.

01:19:00.230 --> 01:19:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's another one of
those so-what kind of things.

01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:05.380 align:middle line:90%
You know?

01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:06.710 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's so simple.

01:19:06.710 --> 01:19:07.510 align:middle line:90%
Who cares?

01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:08.310 align:middle line:90%
You know?

01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:10.120 align:middle line:90%
What difference does it make?

01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:16.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, to the ancients, this was,
like, blinding light almost.

01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:18.682 align:middle line:84%
There was so much
knowledge there

01:19:18.682 --> 01:19:22.930 align:middle line:84%
that it was just
hard to imagine,

01:19:22.930 --> 01:19:25.574 align:middle line:84%
that one form could
hold so much knowledge.

01:19:25.574 --> 01:19:28.280 align:middle line:90%


01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:31.760 align:middle line:10%
It was given the name
of the Fruit of Life.

01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:34.090 align:middle line:10%
Remember, we had the Flower
and the Seed, and the tree.

01:19:34.090 --> 01:19:35.995 align:middle line:10%
And I never talked
about the fruit.

01:19:35.995 --> 01:19:40.800 align:middle line:10%
The fruit is what the
whole tree is for, right?

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:42.580 align:middle line:10%
To create the fruit, in a way.

01:19:42.580 --> 01:19:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's the part that
gives nourishment.

01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:48.080 align:middle line:84%
It's the part that
is the completion

01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:50.380 align:middle line:90%
of the reason for everything.

01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, hidden in
this image, there

01:19:52.990 --> 01:20:00.190 align:middle line:84%
are 13 systems of knowledge
that delineate very carefully

01:20:00.190 --> 01:20:02.340 align:middle line:84%
all the fine points
of the entire reality.

01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:05.310 align:middle line:90%


01:20:05.310 --> 01:20:10.980 align:middle line:84%
Really, real, real good in
every little tiny detail,

01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:13.980 align:middle line:90%
all the details.

01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:17.495 align:middle line:84%
And I'm only going
to show you four

01:20:17.495 --> 01:20:21.266 align:middle line:84%
of the systems, though
there are nine more.

01:20:21.266 --> 01:20:23.140 align:middle line:84%
But by the time I get
done with four of them,

01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:26.180 align:middle line:84%
I think you'll be
able to see the point.

01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And all it is-- this is
all-female energy on the page

01:20:29.970 --> 01:20:34.230 align:middle line:84%
here-- there are 13 way that
male energy can be superimposed

01:20:34.230 --> 01:20:35.146 align:middle line:90%
over this.

01:20:35.146 --> 01:20:38.360 align:middle line:90%


01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Each one of them, produces
this vast, huge massive library

01:20:42.940 --> 01:20:43.740 align:middle line:90%
of information.

01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:47.190 align:middle line:90%


01:20:47.190 --> 01:20:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going
to begin by showing

01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:54.380 align:middle line:84%
the first system, the
simplest one, the easiest one.

01:20:54.380 --> 01:20:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And the one that I screwed up
on, I just realized, recently.

01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:01.510 align:middle line:84%
But the simplest one is to
simply connect the centers.

01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:04.740 align:middle line:84%
Like, this center could be
connected by three lines,

01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:05.970 align:middle line:90%
connect them all.

01:21:05.970 --> 01:21:08.950 align:middle line:84%
This one over here,
it takes seven lines.

01:21:08.950 --> 01:21:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And this one out
here, I think it's 10.

01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:12.136 align:middle line:84%
No, this one takes
10 and this one

01:21:12.136 --> 01:21:15.850 align:middle line:84%
takes 7, to connect
to all the other ones.

01:21:15.850 --> 01:21:19.100 align:middle line:90%
This is what I mean.

01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:21.710 align:middle line:84%
So that you connect
this center to that one.

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:23.450 align:middle line:90%
And this center to that one.

01:21:23.450 --> 01:21:25.080 align:middle line:10%
And this center to
this one, et cetera,

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:26.810 align:middle line:10%
all the way through here.

01:21:26.810 --> 01:21:28.690 align:middle line:10%
So you connect
them all together.

01:21:28.690 --> 01:21:33.940 align:middle line:10%
And this is called, throughout
the universe, Metatron's Cube.

01:21:33.940 --> 01:21:37.570 align:middle line:10%
It's one of the initial steps
of Creation, the whole image.

01:21:37.570 --> 01:21:40.020 align:middle line:10%
The whole thing is
called Metatron's Cube.

01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:41.803 align:middle line:90%
