[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.982 --> 00:00:17.420 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.913 align:middle line:90%
>> This doorway here--

00:00:18.913 --> 00:00:20.580 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about
these two doorways.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.400 align:middle line:10%
This doorway here between
the third and the fourth one,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.250 align:middle line:10%
that one can be opened in
many, many different ways.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.790 align:middle line:10%
But in everyday experience
here in the United States,

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.020 align:middle line:10%
probably the way that a lot
of people have been opened up

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.060 align:middle line:10%
is in a near-death experience.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.190 align:middle line:10%
A near-death experience will
show you where that doorway is,

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.950 align:middle line:10%
and you find yourself
up in the higher realms.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.220 align:middle line:90%
And you're never the same.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.830 align:middle line:84%
If you don't make it-- if you
don't die and you come back

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:49.980 align:middle line:90%
through--

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.440 align:middle line:84%
you know that there
is more to the reality

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.860 align:middle line:90%
than what you've been told.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And so then you will
be completely changed,

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.520 align:middle line:84%
and you will start
seeking for that.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.775 align:middle line:90%
It's just an automatic thing.

00:01:03.775 --> 00:01:04.575 align:middle line:90%
You can't help it.

00:01:04.575 --> 00:01:06.210 align:middle line:84%
Because you know
that there's more.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Once you know, no one can
ever take it away from you.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.900 align:middle line:90%
There's other ways.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.450 align:middle line:84%
The Hindus have
learned a long time ago

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.260 align:middle line:84%
how to do that
through meditation.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And so there's things
like Vipassana meditation,

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.290 align:middle line:84%
where you sit for 18
hours in a meditation.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And in that kind of
stillness and letting

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.650 align:middle line:84%
go of all of this world, you can
find the opening wave like this.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And there's other
kinds of meditation

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:39.860 align:middle line:84%
that can find this opening
into the higher centers.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.800 align:middle line:84%
Many of the natural
peoples around the world

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.470 align:middle line:84%
have used things
like psychedelics--

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.080 align:middle line:84%
for example, the American
Indian chiefs, peyote.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.240 align:middle line:84%
And the psychedelics will
also open that doorway.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:00.545 align:middle line:84%
And the Americans in the 1960s
came across one that changed

00:02:00.545 --> 00:02:02.420 align:middle line:84%
the United States forever
and ever and ever--

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.837 align:middle line:84%
will never be the
same after that.

00:02:03.837 --> 00:02:05.720 align:middle line:90%
And that was LSD 25.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And that one, 20 million
Americans tried that thing

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.550 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly found
out a lot of--

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.750 align:middle line:84%
there was a lot of people who
were wiped out from it also

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.080 align:middle line:84%
because there was no training,
there was no initiation,

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.270 align:middle line:90%
there was no nothing.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.210 align:middle line:84%
But they found out about these
higher dimensional levels.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, almost all of
those people turned right around

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.500 align:middle line:90%
and became very spiritual.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.380 align:middle line:84%
If you go through all the
ranks and files of all the--

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.540 align:middle line:84%
like Yogi Bhajan and the
Sikhs and blah, blah, blah

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.580 align:middle line:84%
and all these things, people
who are not involved in drugs

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.790 align:middle line:90%
or anything else at all--

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.370 align:middle line:84%
but if you sit them down and
say, how did it all begin?

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.170 align:middle line:90%
Because I did.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.170 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to lots and
lots and lots of people.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And they go, well, I
went to this party.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.194 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:52.194 --> 00:02:55.550 align:middle line:90%


00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.370 align:middle line:90%
There is a vast difference in--

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.120 align:middle line:84%
there's different
kinds-- just like if you

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.495 align:middle line:84%
go into a drug store, there
are different kinds of drugs.

00:03:04.495 --> 00:03:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And all the drugs, like cocaine,
which we were talking about,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.600 align:middle line:90%
is one of the--

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.080 align:middle line:84%
Gurdjieff used to
talk about that.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.370 align:middle line:84%
He felt, in terms
of spiritual growth,

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.620 align:middle line:84%
it was probably the worst
thing you could possibly do.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:23.960 align:middle line:84%
Because it enhances the sense of
individualism and ego and, it's

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.010 align:middle line:90%
also addicting.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.240 align:middle line:90%
And all of your pleasure drugs--

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.030 align:middle line:84%
your opiums and your heroins
and all these kinds of things--

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.870 align:middle line:84%
to do these is like
committing spiritual suicide.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.600 align:middle line:84%
It's really hard to
get back out of that.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And some of them, like crack,
is just about impossible.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.370 align:middle line:90%
>> I can relate to that.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Pretty hard.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.800 align:middle line:84%
But the psychedelics, on the
other hand, are not addicting.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And they have been used
all around the world

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.300 align:middle line:84%
by almost every natural
person there are.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.960 align:middle line:90%
The Incas used San Pedro cactus.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.960 align:middle line:90%
The Egyptians, by the way--

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.860 align:middle line:84%
though I never talk about it,
though it's all over the walls.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And papers have been
written about it--

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.660 align:middle line:84%
they used a really
powerful one, a mushroom

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.269 align:middle line:90%
called amanita muscaria.

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And you see it all
over the walls.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.919 align:middle line:90%
And so when they put you--

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.660 align:middle line:84%
in the final phase, they put
you in the casket in there,

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.930 align:middle line:84%
they also gave you this
mushroom to find this door.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.570 align:middle line:84%
They were looking for you to
get out to the top doorway.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.650 align:middle line:84%
We don't need these
things with this.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.520 align:middle line:84%
With what we're
showing here, you

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.090 align:middle line:84%
won't need any drugs
or anything at all.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.670 align:middle line:84%
This is powerful
enough all by itself.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.460 align:middle line:84%
You will be able to
experience the things directly

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.160 align:middle line:84%
without anything at
all, absolutely clean.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.960 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what--

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.300 align:middle line:84%
>> But we have to explain what
the rest of the world is--

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.840 align:middle line:84%
can't just totally close
your eyes and all this stuff.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Just to comment on
the Reiki attunements--

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.180 align:middle line:84%
seemed to have done that for--
there are many, many people.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.640 align:middle line:84%
It was that consciousness shift,
and it opened their worlds.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.810 align:middle line:84%
and secondly, I work with
cocaine-addicted women.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And I teach them to
meditate from their hearts

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:19.890 align:middle line:90%
to their babies.

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And I have found that that has
been the key to helping them

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.660 align:middle line:84%
with their addictions, is
being in that heart space

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.430 align:middle line:84%
and empowering them
in that heart space.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's totally gotten them
off of the cocaine and substance

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.630 align:middle line:90%
abuse, which is a doorway.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Cocaine is-- you can
get off of that one.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.090 align:middle line:90%
And it's possible.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.720 align:middle line:84%
Certain ones, though,
are really hard.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.780 align:middle line:90%
Heroin is really hard.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.530 align:middle line:84%
I've never tried
any of those things,

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.940 align:middle line:90%
but I've seen so many people.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's really hard for
them to get out of there.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.070 align:middle line:90%
But it's not a spiritual--

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.800 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to find
your way to the higher worlds

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.960 align:middle line:90%
through those things, for sure.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.540 align:middle line:90%
You're just not going to do it.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.680 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, as Gurdjieff
would say, there

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.030 align:middle line:84%
has to be some kind
of outside source.

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.250 align:middle line:84%
This is what he means by
a near-death experience,

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:22.160 align:middle line:84%
or a meditation, or a
psychedelic, or something that

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.280 align:middle line:84%
shows you the way up
into these higher--

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.600 align:middle line:84%
finds this doorway,
this opening.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.060 align:middle line:90%
It's an opening in you.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:30.870 align:middle line:90%
It gets up there.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And then once you get up
there, there's another one.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is what the
Merkaba is all about,

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.320 align:middle line:84%
to show you this
doorway right here.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.050 align:middle line:84%
It's a meditation
that will show you how

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.160 align:middle line:90%
to get up into the next levels.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.820 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to do that.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:52.550 align:middle line:84%
We believe, as a planet, we
have kind of chosen a way--

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.120 align:middle line:90%
though there are other ways.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.180 align:middle line:90%
And that way has to do--

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.113 align:middle line:84%
the different worlds are
all separated by 90 degrees.

00:06:59.113 --> 00:07:02.030 align:middle line:90%


00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:06.830 align:middle line:84%
>> I wonder if you could make
comments about individuals that

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm aware of-- and I'm sure
many in the room are aware of--

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:15.720 align:middle line:84%
who are not necessarily
going up from the base on up

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.770 align:middle line:84%
but have come in
fully into their heart

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:20.542 align:middle line:90%
with their heart fully open--

00:07:20.542 --> 00:07:21.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you mean born that way?

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:22.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Born that way.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And they have to deal with
maintaining their consciousness

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.630 align:middle line:84%
in staying connected
with the Earth

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.340 align:middle line:84%
and have to deal
with actual leaving.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:41.060 align:middle line:84%
I cannot tell you how many
people crossed my path who are

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.150 align:middle line:90%
in that space--

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:43.410 align:middle line:90%
so fully in their heart.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And they have to learn to
be connected with the Earth

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.910 align:middle line:84%
and then bring in
the information

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:51.170 align:middle line:90%
and integrate it with it here.

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:52.920 align:middle line:90%
They're already open.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And so if you could
comment on that, please.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.920 align:middle line:90%
>> It's just called wisdom.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.400 align:middle line:90%
It takes time.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't really know.

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:04.310 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's hard.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:06.110 align:middle line:90%
Because we live in a world--

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:09.005 align:middle line:84%
from Wilhelm Reich, if you're
familiar with his work--

00:08:09.005 --> 00:08:11.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:15.075 align:middle line:84%
>> He pretty much saw
that there was a disease.

00:08:15.075 --> 00:08:16.700 align:middle line:84%
His way of looking
at it was that there

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.900 align:middle line:84%
was a disease that
swept the world

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.230 align:middle line:84%
and that we're not
in a normal state.

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens
in a normal state

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:27.390 align:middle line:84%
is where we come
into this world,

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:29.210 align:middle line:90%
and we have an open heart.

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.220 align:middle line:84%
When we first come in,
we're just children.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.240 align:middle line:90%
We're babies.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.539 align:middle line:90%
We just want to love each other.

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:37.980 align:middle line:84%
But the world's already
sick, from his point of view.

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:41.240 align:middle line:84%
So this innocent little baby
walks up to another little kid

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.580 align:middle line:90%
and says, hi.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.000 align:middle line:90%
And the little kid goes, wham.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.670 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And the little innocent
one goes, whoa.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is,
there's a constriction

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:56.720 align:middle line:90%
of your nervous system.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.762 align:middle line:84%
And the pain that you felt from
that while your heart was open--

00:08:59.762 --> 00:09:01.970 align:middle line:84%
because it's very painful
to have something like that

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:02.770 align:middle line:90%
happen--

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:05.970 align:middle line:84%
you hide it in your
muscles somewhere.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:08.490 align:middle line:84%
You stick it down in some
muscle down in there.

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:11.580 align:middle line:84%
It tightens up so you
don't have to feel it.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And also, there's this
constriction here.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:19.740 align:middle line:84%
There's also an area in your
aura that gets toughened,

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:20.580 align:middle line:90%
you might say.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And there's an aura in
your crystalline structure

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:26.760 align:middle line:84%
out here, out in the
furthest realms of here,

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.390 align:middle line:90%
that gets a distortion in it.

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And the distortion can be
a hole or a little bump

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.040 align:middle line:84%
or a plane or something
else like that,

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.250 align:middle line:84%
which we were actually able
to pick up with the computers.

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And so this just
keeps happening,

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.320 align:middle line:84%
until finally, we
end up with what

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.260 align:middle line:90%
Reich calls an armor around us.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.900 align:middle line:84%
We get this toughened-up
shell around us

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.940 align:middle line:90%
so you can do anything, man.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.940 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't hurt you anymore
because your heart's closed up,

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.410 align:middle line:90%
and you're closed off.

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And so much of Reich's
work was how to live--

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:05.270 align:middle line:90%
exactly the thing.

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:09.680 align:middle line:84%
How do you live in this world
with all this stuff that's

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.440 align:middle line:84%
coming at you all the
time that's not nice

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.070 align:middle line:90%
and still keep an open heart?

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:22.320 align:middle line:90%
And that's kind of the question.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.190 align:middle line:90%
How do you do this?

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:28.670 align:middle line:84%
The Merkaba will-- if you
can get into the Merkaba

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:33.530 align:middle line:84%
and know it, then you can
insulate yourself in such a way

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:35.090 align:middle line:84%
that you can keep
your heart open

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:37.070 align:middle line:90%
and the things won't bother you.

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:40.200 align:middle line:84%
But if the person
doesn't know that, then--

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:44.120 align:middle line:84%
well, Reich did figure
out a system of--

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.990 align:middle line:84%
at least, from someone who
was already armored up--

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:50.120 align:middle line:84%
figured out a system
called orgonomy.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's the finest
system that I've ever seen

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.380 align:middle line:90%
of healing that I've ever seen.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:58.380 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I experimented
with it a long time ago.

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.740 align:middle line:84%
I went with it for about a year
and a half to see what it was.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.950 align:middle line:90%
And it was extraordinary.

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And Reich didn't know
about the chakra system,

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.470 align:middle line:84%
except that he had developed
mirrors that would reflect life

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:15.348 align:middle line:84%
force energy and was able to
calculate it and measure it

00:11:15.348 --> 00:11:16.890 align:middle line:84%
in instruments that
could measure it.

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:18.973 align:middle line:84%
And so he discovered that
there were these centers

00:11:18.973 --> 00:11:20.390 align:middle line:90%
in the body that--

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:21.690 align:middle line:90%
he gave them other names.

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:22.490 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember.

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.960 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know about the
Eastern philosophy beliefs.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And in the beginning, he figured
out how to open these things.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Because they found them
all constricted and closed.

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And he figured out
how to open them,

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.070 align:middle line:84%
and he could [AUDIO OUT]
how to open the bottom one.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:36.690 align:middle line:84%
But when he got
to the second one,

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:38.360 align:middle line:84%
which was the
sexual energy, which

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.090 align:middle line:84%
allowed the Kundalini--
all this energy to rise.

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:43.300 align:middle line:84%
Then when he opened
that one up, I

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:46.360 align:middle line:84%
think it was--
several people died.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.430 align:middle line:90%
And they died of an orgasm--

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:49.700 align:middle line:90%
great way to go, I guess.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.850 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Because it was so much energy
that it [IMITATES EXPLOSION]

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:56.510 align:middle line:90%
blew everything out.

00:11:56.510 --> 00:12:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And so he started by framing
it, well, I'll go to the top.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.110 align:middle line:90%
He didn't even realize--

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:04.840 align:middle line:84%
a lot of it was in--
he went to the eyes.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And he learned how
to unlock the eyes.

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Because our eyes
are locked also.

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.830 align:middle line:90%
Our eyes can't move very well.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:14.830 align:middle line:84%
Our eye energy, because
of this stuff that's

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:17.690 align:middle line:84%
been going on from the
time we were conceived of--

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:19.863 align:middle line:84%
and even when you're
in the womb, all

00:12:19.863 --> 00:12:22.030 align:middle line:84%
the way out-- especially
all the way up-- to anytime

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:23.840 align:middle line:84%
you're conceived up
to about 12 years old.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.950 align:middle line:90%
That's when most of it happens.

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:30.200 align:middle line:84%
Your eyes get locked, and
you can't really move them.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And they'll have you
spin your eyes like this.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:33.980 align:middle line:90%
Or you can spin them around.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And you can get them this
way and back the other way

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:40.455 align:middle line:84%
and get them loosened
up and working around.

00:12:40.455 --> 00:12:43.240 align:middle line:90%


00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And they open up this
chakra down here.

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:47.260 align:middle line:90%
And then they start coming down.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:48.590 align:middle line:90%
They open up all the centers.

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And then they open up the
sexual center and found out it

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.430 align:middle line:84%
didn't kill people, that
they could handle the energy.

00:12:54.430 --> 00:13:00.160 align:middle line:84%
But then after they did that,
then they found that once

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.395 align:middle line:84%
they got the central column
opened up and everything,

00:13:02.395 --> 00:13:05.020 align:middle line:84%
you could handle
the kind of flows.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:09.700 align:middle line:84%
Then they try to deal with
the actual armor itself.

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And the experience
is remarkable.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:16.750 align:middle line:84%
I went through with a
group of about 30 people,

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.300 align:middle line:84%
and we all had we all
real similar expenses.

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.890 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:21.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Plus everything--

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:24.370 align:middle line:90%
>> It was expensive--

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:25.180 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know--

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:29.146 align:middle line:84%
>> --about $120-an-hour
experiences.

00:13:29.146 --> 00:13:31.990 align:middle line:90%


00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:34.870 align:middle line:84%
You lay on this table
in a soundproof room.

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And this-- my
doctor was a woman.

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:39.170 align:middle line:90%
You lay there.

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:41.530 align:middle line:90%
You take your clothes off.

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:43.280 align:middle line:84%
But she wasn't really
looking at the body.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.980 align:middle line:84%
She was looking at
the aura and the way

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:48.400 align:middle line:84%
the energy fields would
come out of the body.

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And you'd just be
sitting there and just

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.020 align:middle line:90%
laying there on this thing.

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:55.018 align:middle line:90%
Doo, doo, doo, doo.

00:13:55.018 --> 00:13:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And she'd just be
sitting over there,

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.720 align:middle line:84%
and she'd look at you for
about 10 or 15 minutes.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And she'd watch, watch,
watch, watch, watch.

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And then she'd just go over
somewhere near your body

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:05.650 align:middle line:90%
and go--

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:07.751 align:middle line:90%
and that was it.

00:14:07.751 --> 00:14:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And, really, that's all
she would do, just make

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:12.188 align:middle line:84%
a little circle like that--
and usually a little, tiny one,

00:14:12.188 --> 00:14:13.000 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.125 align:middle line:90%
And you'd be sitting there.

00:14:14.125 --> 00:14:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
this wave would come up.

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And within a few seconds,
whatever it was that she just

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:24.320 align:middle line:84%
released-- whatever that pain
was that you felt that happened,

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.780 align:middle line:90%
that you tried to hide before--

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:27.370 align:middle line:90%
comes up.

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:29.240 align:middle line:90%
And you can't stop it.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.070 align:middle line:90%
And it's uncontrollable.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:33.980 align:middle line:90%
And it just starts coming out.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's just, like,
in waves that are--

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure that these
waves are every bit as

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:41.470 align:middle line:90%
strong as childbirth.

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:43.040 align:middle line:90%
It's so powerful.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.887 align:middle line:84%
And they come up,
and they come up.

00:14:44.887 --> 00:14:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And they'll keep coming
up for about an hour

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.600 align:middle line:84%
to an hour and a half
to sometimes two hours,

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.380 align:middle line:84%
until they finally
start receding.

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And you feel the incredible
pain that you felt

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:57.460 align:middle line:90%
when you were a little baby.

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And when it's all over, you
feel like you're floating.

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:07.850 align:middle line:84%
I always wanted to see if I was
actually off the table or not.

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:11.830 align:middle line:84%
But I couldn't move
anything, so I couldn't tell.

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:17.090 align:middle line:84%
But I was sure I was floating,
because I felt so good.

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:18.970 align:middle line:90%
It felt so good to get that out.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:22.595 align:middle line:84%
And they would do
that every week.

00:15:22.595 --> 00:15:24.220 align:middle line:84%
I remember, I used
to ride motorcycles.

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:26.710 align:middle line:90%
And I'd drive to this thing.

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:29.320 align:middle line:84%
But when I came home,
it was like flying.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And so just every
turn, you would

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:35.050 align:middle line:90%
be so sensitive to everything.

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:38.030 align:middle line:84%
But then just within one
week, just in that one week,

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:41.830 align:middle line:84%
you would start to
desensitize again.

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And they'd have to go through
it all over again until they

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:47.920 align:middle line:84%
finally break down all
these energy things,

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.300 align:middle line:90%
and you get to begin to breathe.

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:53.380 align:middle line:90%
And so the only thing I know--

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:57.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't really know
what to tell you,

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:00.730 align:middle line:84%
except that the connection
with the higher self--

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:05.560 align:middle line:84%
if they can make that connection
and you can get in trust,

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:09.600 align:middle line:84%
then you know that you're beyond
this, that you're immortal.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.480 align:middle line:84%
You know that you're
not going to die,

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.940 align:middle line:84%
that you can survive
all this stuff.

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And you know that you're more
powerful than the disease--

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.785 align:middle line:84%
then you can keep
your heart open.

00:16:19.785 --> 00:16:22.960 align:middle line:90%


00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Let's just have three
people sitting on a hilltop,

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:29.930 align:middle line:84%
and a UFO flies
right up to them.

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:33.760 align:middle line:84%
A real one comes
right up to him.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And one person
says, look at this.

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:37.310 align:middle line:90%
Holy cow.

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:39.010 align:middle line:90%
It's only 10 feet away.

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:43.143 align:middle line:84%
And the other two go,
I don't see anything.

00:16:43.143 --> 00:16:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And you could say to yourself,
how can that possibly

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:48.850 align:middle line:84%
be, that a real object
can be sitting there

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:53.290 align:middle line:84%
and they look right through
it, as though it's not there?

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:57.320 align:middle line:84%
We've had an actual recorded
incident in history--

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:01.960 align:middle line:84%
recorded in history-- of this
exact thing, very similar.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.300 align:middle line:90%
And what's it called?

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:12.520 align:middle line:84%
The Magellan,
circumnavigator terra--

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.539 align:middle line:90%
>> Cannon ships.

00:17:14.539 --> 00:17:15.339 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:17.619 align:middle line:84%
He landed somewhere
in South America

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:20.470 align:middle line:90%
with all these big sail ships.

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:22.140 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:22.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:25.869 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's a real, real
important story to realize--

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:29.710 align:middle line:84%
that there's even one person
here who hasn't heard it.

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:33.040 align:middle line:84%
These big sail ships
landed out in--

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.560 align:middle line:84%
the big ones for the huge
ships and all this stuff--

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.350 align:middle line:84%
came in as close as they could
to the shore to somewhere

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:39.290 align:middle line:90%
in South America.

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:40.640 align:middle line:84%
I think it was around
Chile, actually.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And they got in these
rowboats and came ashore.

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And when they did, they were
met by all these Indians,

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:48.860 align:middle line:90%
this whole tribe of Indians.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And they're all standing
there on the shore,

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:54.340 align:middle line:90%
trying to communicate, probably.

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:55.510 align:middle line:90%
So how did you get here?

00:17:55.510 --> 00:18:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And Magellan was
trying to tell them

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:03.220 align:middle line:84%
they came s these
big ships, which

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.320 align:middle line:90%
are just, like, right there.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.940 align:middle line:90%
You can see them right there.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:08.602 align:middle line:84%
The Indians couldn't
see those ships.

00:18:08.602 --> 00:18:10.310 align:middle line:84%
They could see the
boats they came in on,

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:13.060 align:middle line:84%
but they could
not see the ships.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:15.580 align:middle line:90%
They saw right through them.

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:20.050 align:middle line:84%
They weren't visible to them,
except for two or three of them.

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And those were the
medicine men who

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:27.430 align:middle line:84%
were used to working in
fourth-dimensional level.

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And those guys
could see the ships.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:35.260 align:middle line:84%
But the ordinary people, there
wasn't anything in that water.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Because it was beyond
their imagination.

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:41.730 align:middle line:84%
It was simply beyond
their imagination.

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:43.480 align:middle line:84%
they can see the boats
that came in-- that

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.990 align:middle line:84%
wasn't really beyond their
imagination-- but not the ships.

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's exactly the same
thing today in the people--

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.910 align:middle line:90%
with UFOs.

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:55.870 align:middle line:84%
If it's beyond your
ability to accept

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:59.060 align:middle line:84%
or beyond your imagination,
you won't see it.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:01.555 align:middle line:90%
Your mind will just erase it.

00:19:01.555 --> 00:19:03.680 align:middle line:84%
It's the same way with
sounds and things like that.

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.730 align:middle line:84%
We've got all kinds of sounds
moving through this building--

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:09.920 align:middle line:84%
high-pitched,
squeak, real loud--

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.940 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of sounds.

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:12.538 align:middle line:90%
We just erase all that stuff.

00:19:12.538 --> 00:19:13.580 align:middle line:90%
We don't want to hear it.

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:15.950 align:middle line:84%
This is another way that
we can block things out.

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:18.040 align:middle line:90%
We don't want to see something.

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:21.910 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of
your angelic realms

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:25.610 align:middle line:84%
and the ETs and UFOs and all
these kinds of stuff like that,

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:28.930 align:middle line:84%
it's whether or not you can
accept it, if your belief

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:30.830 align:middle line:90%
patterns will allow it in.

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And then, even if
you can allow it in,

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.900 align:middle line:90%
is it beyond your imagination?

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:38.740 align:middle line:84%
Can you perceive
of something that's

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.660 align:middle line:84%
so far outside of
your imagination

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:42.760 align:middle line:84%
that you can't even
conceive of it?

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:43.645 align:middle line:90%
Then you just--

00:19:43.645 --> 00:19:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Area 39, it doesn't know
how to function with that.

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:48.760 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't turn on.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:49.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.780 align:middle line:84%
>> I have a question about the
heart chakra and the importance

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:56.500 align:middle line:84%
of it, when we do the exercise,
and how important it is--

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.700 align:middle line:84%
that you said-- to
have an open heart.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:02.515 align:middle line:84%
Now, for people who have the
problem with that because of--

00:20:02.515 --> 00:20:06.850 align:middle line:84%
since childhood, they may
have had closed their heart.

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:09.410 align:middle line:84%
What type-- is there
any exercises besides--

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:12.250 align:middle line:84%
OK, looking at the
two dots, you said--

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, those kind--

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:15.950 align:middle line:90%
that's not going to be enough.

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:21.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you've got real
problems with your emotional

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:24.565 align:middle line:84%
body, then to
really work with it,

00:20:24.565 --> 00:20:27.190 align:middle line:84%
that's going to be an area that
you may have to go out and seek

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:31.300 align:middle line:84%
help or something to
start working with.

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:32.870 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
things out there.

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Again, orgonomy is one
of the finest ones.

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:38.240 align:middle line:90%
Well, waveform will help you.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.880 align:middle line:84%
But if you've got
emotional blocks--

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.420 align:middle line:84%
if you've got physical,
emotional blocks and things

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:46.990 align:middle line:84%
out there-- you need to somehow
work through this stuff.

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to bring
my nephew in here

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.930 align:middle line:90%
tonight for about 15 minutes.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:55.190 align:middle line:90%
I'll let him talk to you.

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:56.950 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:56.950 --> 00:21:00.590 align:middle line:84%
He's not the only one that
does these kinds of things.

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:03.550 align:middle line:84%
Let me just put out
a little bit here.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:05.330 align:middle line:84%
There are various ways
to work with this.

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:06.705 align:middle line:84%
So you could go
through something

00:21:06.705 --> 00:21:07.960 align:middle line:90%
like what I did with orgonomy.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:11.380 align:middle line:90%
Or there's Rolfing.

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:14.950 align:middle line:84%
See, the Rolfing, for
example, what they discovered

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:18.080 align:middle line:84%
was that you got the blocks
out here and in here,

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.940 align:middle line:90%
but they're also in the muscles.

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And so Ida Rolf decided, well,
let's just go inside there

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:25.970 align:middle line:84%
and go directly to it-- which
is a little more painful,

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:30.430 align:middle line:84%
but that's another way that
you could approach getting rid

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:32.060 align:middle line:90%
of some of these things.

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:34.640 align:middle line:84%
There are other ways too,
and there's lots of them.

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And there's one that's been
developed in the last few years,

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:39.670 align:middle line:90%
which is called hypnotherapy.

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:44.840 align:middle line:84%
that is reaching its kind
of maturity right about now.

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:47.350 align:middle line:84%
For a while, they were kinds
of learning what all of this

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:48.370 align:middle line:90%
was about.

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the problems
that a lot of people

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:57.880 align:middle line:84%
have-- first of all, I'll
just explain real quickly what

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.640 align:middle line:90%
Ken does, or people like Ken.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.370 align:middle line:84%
The first thing they do--
like, what Ken does is,

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:07.330 align:middle line:84%
he lays you down, he touches
you, and you go into a trance--

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:09.730 align:middle line:84%
just like that, only it's
a different kind of trance

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:11.980 align:middle line:84%
than that you would
normally think of.

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And you communicate usually
through your fingers,

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.620 align:middle line:84%
because that's about
all you can move.

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And the very first
thing that he'll do

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:25.240 align:middle line:84%
is go in and make direct contact
with all these entities that

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.310 align:middle line:90%
are in there, if you have any.

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:29.260 align:middle line:90%
And almost everybody does.

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And that is a
remarkable experience,

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:35.540 align:middle line:84%
to have them talk through while
you're sitting there listening.

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And these things are
snarling up your face

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:39.890 align:middle line:84%
and growling at him and
all this other stuff.

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:43.130 align:middle line:84%
You can't believe this is coming
out of you or someone else.

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And he'll go right in
there and get them all.

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:48.140 align:middle line:84%
They'll come out and
give their names.

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:48.940 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:50.360 align:middle line:84%
You ask how long
they've been in there.

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.940 align:middle line:84%
I've watched him
do about 40 people,

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:53.480 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't believe this.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:56.200 align:middle line:84%
It makes the whole hair
on the back of your neck

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.900 align:middle line:90%
stand up there.

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And he'll come in
there and get--

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:05.020 align:middle line:84%
they'll come in, and
they'll talk through,

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:06.437 align:middle line:84%
and they'll find
out who they are.

00:23:06.437 --> 00:23:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll ask how
long they've been in there.

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And you'll hear these things
of 8,000 years, 10,000, 500--

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:19.240 align:middle line:84%
long periods of time they've
been connected with that person.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And just to explain it,
that's what he does.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.123 align:middle line:90%
He takes the-- he actually--

00:23:25.123 --> 00:23:26.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
he does anymore.

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.130 align:middle line:84%
He used to make
this golden pyramid.

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:32.170 align:middle line:84%
We actually saw this
happen when he first

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:33.920 align:middle line:90%
began this years and years ago.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.750 align:middle line:84%
He would get the
energy to come out,

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:37.435 align:middle line:84%
but someone else would be on the
end of the room, watching him.

00:23:37.435 --> 00:23:38.313 align:middle line:90%
They'd go--

00:23:38.313 --> 00:23:40.630 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And the entity start
talking out through person.

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:43.940 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And then he'd have to run
over there and get that one.

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:51.070 align:middle line:90%


00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:54.160 align:middle line:84%
So they learned to make
this golden octahedron.

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And then he brings the
angelic realms down.

00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:57.130 align:middle line:90%
He used to.

00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:58.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
he does anymore.

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And that would bring the entity
and lift it out of the body

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.310 align:middle line:84%
and take it into the
proper dimensional level.

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And you would see a total
change in the person's face.

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:11.050 align:middle line:84%
It's just like you're in
there by yourself now.

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:12.800 align:middle line:90%
But sometimes it's not just one.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:16.360 align:middle line:84%
I remember one lady
he had down there.

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.490 align:middle line:90%
This is a sweet little lady.

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:21.580 align:middle line:84%
She said, I don't know if I
really believe in this stuff

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:24.940 align:middle line:90%
and laid down and--

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:25.845 align:middle line:90%
holy cow.

00:24:25.845 --> 00:24:27.730 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:30.070 align:middle line:90%


00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:31.770 align:middle line:84%
These things just
kept coming out

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:33.020 align:middle line:90%
and coming out and coming out.

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:34.930 align:middle line:84%
It's, like, 30 or 40
of them, just kept

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:37.730 align:middle line:84%
coming out, coming out--
totally different voice,

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:40.010 align:middle line:84%
totally different
expression, different names.

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And he just kept
pulling them out.

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:44.410 align:middle line:84%
If you've had a lot
of certain drugs--

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:46.360 align:middle line:84%
especially like heroin,
things like this-- you

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.040 align:middle line:84%
can have hundreds
or more in there

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.990 align:middle line:84%
because you really
lay yourself open

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:51.410 align:middle line:90%
for certain things like this.

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:52.963 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, that's
the first level.

00:24:52.963 --> 00:24:54.880 align:middle line:84%
He'll go through and get
all those things out,

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.080 align:middle line:90%
if you have any.

00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:01.090 align:middle line:10%
And then the next thing is, if
you have very definite blocks

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:04.250 align:middle line:10%
from past lifetimes, things
that have happened to you

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:08.020 align:middle line:10%
that you still hold, the
real traumatic things--

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:11.170 align:middle line:10%
like, you got your head
cut off or your hands

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:13.240 align:middle line:10%
cut off or stabbed
or shot or blown up

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.010 align:middle line:10%
or these kinds of things--

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:18.580 align:middle line:10%
you'll usually hold those
energies in yourself,

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:19.390 align:middle line:10%
around you.

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And Ken can just go
over and feel them.

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.910 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't lead you
there or say anything.

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:25.550 align:middle line:84%
He'll just feel them and
just say, what's here?

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:28.940 align:middle line:84%
You'll immediately go back
to the time and be there.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And he will work through those
things and get rid of them, one

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:32.450 align:middle line:90%
by one.

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:34.240 align:middle line:84%
So once he gets all
those things out of you

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.448 align:middle line:84%
and then works through all
the past life stuff, which

00:25:36.448 --> 00:25:38.920 align:middle line:84%
takes a while, then
you're in a position

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:43.510 align:middle line:84%
where you can start working
with the emotional stuff that

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:45.950 align:middle line:90%
has occurred in this lifetime.

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And then once you went through
all that karmic stuff, then

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:51.610 align:middle line:84%
usually, what's been
happening lately

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:54.040 align:middle line:90%
is something real incredible.

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to
tell you what it is.

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:58.350 align:middle line:90%


00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:00.510 align:middle line:84%
We'll maybe let him see
what he says about it.

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:01.310 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:03.740 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't bring it up unless--

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:05.990 align:middle line:84%
it's something you wouldn't
really think was exciting.

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:08.073 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to be happening
with hypnotherapists.

00:26:08.073 --> 00:26:11.890 align:middle line:84%
It's all over the place,
not just him-- lots of them.

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:14.470 align:middle line:90%
What should we ask him?

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:18.650 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you, this is
not my expertise or my area.

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:20.847 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I don't even like
to be in the same room

00:26:20.847 --> 00:26:21.930 align:middle line:90%
when this guy is working--

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:24.970 align:middle line:90%


00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:28.030 align:middle line:84%
or in the same city,
if I can help it.

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:34.520 align:middle line:90%
But somebody's got to do it.

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:38.950 align:middle line:90%
And he loves it.

00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:40.360 align:middle line:90%
How he does it.

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:43.190 align:middle line:84%
He loves to get in there and
do battle and do these things.

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:44.630 align:middle line:90%
And so I don't know.

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:46.420 align:middle line:84%
You could talk to him
when he gets here.

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like it's going
to be more than 15 minutes.

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:52.060 align:middle line:90%
This group sounds like--

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:53.660 align:middle line:90%
I may lose the group here to--

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:55.990 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:59.630 align:middle line:84%
But it is in a real important
part of all of this.

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very,
very deep subject.

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.560 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot to it.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:09.745 align:middle line:84%
We've just slightly
covered the whole subject.

00:27:09.745 --> 00:27:11.410 align:middle line:90%
And this all started with--

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:14.140 align:middle line:84%
Elizabeth was talking about
how to keep your heart open.

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:17.050 align:middle line:90%


00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:18.710 align:middle line:90%
And it is a real--

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:19.760 align:middle line:90%
it is the whole thing.

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.550 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're totally
healed, and you

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:22.970 align:middle line:84%
got it all there--
there you are,

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:24.580 align:middle line:84%
totally healed and
everything-- you've

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:27.520 align:middle line:84%
got to figure out how to be
able to move through this world

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.540 align:middle line:90%
and not let it happen again.

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:31.893 align:middle line:84%
And the Merkaba will do
a great deal of this.

00:27:31.893 --> 00:27:34.060 align:middle line:84%
Once you can get to the
level where you can actually

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:39.010 align:middle line:84%
create the Merkaba and a living
Merkaba field around you,

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:40.540 align:middle line:90%
you'll be OK after that.

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.290 align:middle line:84%
You can move right
through anything.

00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:44.060 align:middle line:84%
You can go right in through
the middle of anything.

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:45.643 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make any
difference at all.

00:27:45.643 --> 00:27:46.970 align:middle line:90%
And it won't affect you.

00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:49.423 align:middle line:84%
No spirits can come into
you, none of these things.

00:27:49.423 --> 00:27:50.840 align:middle line:84%
Nobody can direct
thoughts at you.

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.730 align:middle line:90%
Nobody can do anything.

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And they can't harm you in
any of those kinds of ways.

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.877 align:middle line:90%
But we got to get there.

00:27:57.877 --> 00:27:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's the part,
is this last little bit

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:03.530 align:middle line:84%
of how to get that
field truly created

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:07.240 align:middle line:90%
around every single person.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Once you've
created the Merkaba,

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:12.460 align:middle line:84%
if you haven't gone through any
of these processes to release

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:16.360 align:middle line:84%
these entities, would the
lightning and the energy be

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:20.170 align:middle line:84%
so great that they would simply
be driven off at that point?

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:24.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if you haven't cleared
yourself of all these things

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:27.400 align:middle line:84%
and you've got entities and
you're doing the Merkaba work,

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.500 align:middle line:90%
you're going to be real limited.

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:32.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the
Merkaba will be--

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:34.330 align:middle line:84%
it'll never get
to the place where

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:38.800 align:middle line:90%
it's a living field on its own.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.868 align:middle line:84%
And whether or not you have
really created that thing,

00:28:41.868 --> 00:28:44.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you're going to
be able to do that until you're

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:46.490 align:middle line:84%
clear on all those
kinds of levels.

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:48.710 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to work
through all that stuff.

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:52.330 align:middle line:84%
This is an extraordinary
state we are in here.

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:53.270 align:middle line:90%
This is not normal.

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:54.320 align:middle line:90%
It's not natural.

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.270 align:middle line:84%
This doesn't normally
happen in nature.

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:58.030 align:middle line:84%
Normally, we're
like little babies

00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:00.720 align:middle line:84%
that get to grow up nice
and clean and easy and all

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.520 align:middle line:90%
the way through.

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the
Merkaba all the way through

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:04.280 align:middle line:90%
from the beginning.

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have
all these kinds

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:10.900 align:middle line:84%
of incredible negative
distortions and things that are

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:12.910 align:middle line:90%
being flown at us all the time.

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:14.530 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Couldn't a person kind of
bootstrap themselves and just

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.570 align:middle line:84%
make such a solid connection
with their higher self and go

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:24.280 align:middle line:84%
through such a solid series of
affirmations and whatever that

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:27.920 align:middle line:84%
they could just drive those
things away and reclaim their--

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>> You can do--

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>> --sovereignty?

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>> --you have the ability
to do anything at all,

00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:36.375 align:middle line:90%
if you believe it.

00:29:36.375 --> 00:29:38.320 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And if you really trust and
feel the power of yourself, yes,

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:46.070 align:middle line:90%
you can do anything at all.

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:47.360 align:middle line:90%
You can heal anything.

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.520 align:middle line:84%
You can solve any
problems at all.

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.690 align:middle line:90%
But if you don't think you can--

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:55.370 align:middle line:84%
and maybe all your
life, you haven't--

00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:58.610 align:middle line:84%
when you do make a contact
with higher self, higher self--

00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:00.880 align:middle line:90%
realizing you're kind of stuck--

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:05.200 align:middle line:84%
may say, Why don't you go
talk to this guy over here?

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.830 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:10.792 align:middle line:90%
But the truth is, you always--

00:30:10.792 --> 00:30:13.600 align:middle line:90%
you have God within you.

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.970 align:middle line:84%
The creator that created
everything in existence,

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:20.170 align:middle line:84%
including the demons and
everything else, is within you--

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:23.360 align:middle line:84%
is you, really, on
the deepest level.

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.700 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing
that you cannot do--

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:28.270 align:middle line:84%
but only if you can
get to that place

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:30.100 align:middle line:84%
where you can truly
believe in yourself

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:34.270 align:middle line:90%
and who you are and take action.

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:36.640 align:middle line:90%
>> By yourself--

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:37.570 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And even the reality itself--
higher self can actually

00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:43.450 align:middle line:84%
work for the very reality
itself in all kinds of ways

00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:47.065 align:middle line:84%
that you might not
even imagine right now.

00:30:47.065 --> 00:30:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
lead into a point

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.320 align:middle line:84%
where we're going to talk about
the ankh and their concepts

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:56.440 align:middle line:84%
and ideas, a little bit on
that and what they meant by,

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.960 align:middle line:90%
it was the key to life.

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.990 align:middle line:84%
I can't go into this
in great detail.

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:03.634 align:middle line:90%


00:31:03.634 --> 00:31:06.210 align:middle line:84%
But, again, I'm just laying
out little keys and pieces

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:07.010 align:middle line:90%
and things here.

00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to have to
go deeper within your own self

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:14.980 align:middle line:90%
to find the full opening.

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:18.910 align:middle line:84%
Almost all these subjects, you
can sit here and talk for days.

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And all I can do is just
kind of cross over them.

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:27.940 align:middle line:84%
So this chakra
system is pretty much

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:31.750 align:middle line:84%
what you see in most books
and things like that.

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:34.220 align:middle line:84%
But in music, it's
not just an octave.

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:38.870 align:middle line:84%
There are the five
black keys on a piano.

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:41.590 align:middle line:90%
And so there's really 13 notes.

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And what we found
purely from science

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:46.280 align:middle line:84%
when we were checking
the chakra system

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:50.200 align:middle line:84%
is that there are 13
chakras running up the body

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:54.310 align:middle line:84%
and that the chakras
are topographically,

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:58.720 align:middle line:84%
on the body, 7.23
centimeters apart.

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And from the tip of your nose
to the tip of your chin--

00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:07.550 align:middle line:84%
or across your eyes, if
you want to jab them out--

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:08.360 align:middle line:90%
this one's easier.

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.360 align:middle line:84%
Take the tip of the nose
to the tip of your chin

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:11.487 align:middle line:90%
and get that distance.

00:32:11.487 --> 00:32:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And you got to lay down on a
bed or something like this.

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:14.620 align:middle line:90%
You can try this.

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And you put one
finger at the perineum

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:19.553 align:middle line:90%
and just come up around.

00:32:19.553 --> 00:32:21.970 align:middle line:84%
Then where that hits on the
body, if you went straight in,

00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:26.190 align:middle line:84%
is where the second
chakra is going to be.

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And then when you come up that
same distance from that point

00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:29.470 align:middle line:90%
again--

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:31.345 align:middle line:84%
and you can try this--
when you come back up,

00:32:31.345 --> 00:32:35.440 align:middle line:84%
your thumb is going to go
right inside your navel, which

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.120 align:middle line:90%
is where the third one is.

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
come up again to here,

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:42.400 align:middle line:84%
it's going to come up
to the solar plexus.

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:45.690 align:middle line:84%
It'll hit right in the mouth
of the solar plexus, which

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:46.490 align:middle line:90%
is the fourth.

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:47.540 align:middle line:90%
You come up again.

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is the sternum
chakra, the number five.

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And, again, you'll
come to the heart.

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And when you do it
again, you'll come

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:57.880 align:middle line:84%
right to the Adam's
Apple, which is number--

00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.150 align:middle line:90%
5, 6, 7.

00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And then from the Adam's Apple,
it will come to the chin.

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:05.170 align:middle line:90%
The chin is a chakra.

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:06.552 align:middle line:90%
The Hindus talk about it.

00:33:06.552 --> 00:33:08.260 align:middle line:84%
The only one that's
really gets into it--

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:11.950 align:middle line:84%
the one who thinks it's very,
very important-- is Yogi Bhajan.

00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:14.583 align:middle line:84%
He talks about the importance
of the chin chakra.

00:33:14.583 --> 00:33:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And from there,
it goes to the tip

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.340 align:middle line:84%
of the nose, which is another
chakra, which is-- this is 8, 9.

00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And from here, it will
go to the third eye,

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:26.300 align:middle line:84%
which we're familiar
with, which is number 10.

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And from 10, it goes to what
we call a 45-degree chakra.

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:31.673 align:middle line:90%
It's at an angle.

00:33:31.673 --> 00:33:33.340 align:middle line:84%
It comes down in here,
which is actually

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:36.697 align:middle line:84%
connected to the pineal
gland also, which is 11.

00:33:36.697 --> 00:33:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And then from there to the top
of the head, which is sometimes

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.140 align:middle line:84%
called the crown
chakra-- number 12.

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And number 13 is at
the top of the head.

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:47.110 align:middle line:84%
There's also a mini
chakra from the top

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:51.130 align:middle line:84%
of the chin to the top of
the head, another one which

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:52.030 align:middle line:90%
you saw on him.

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:53.450 align:middle line:90%
They're closer together.

00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:56.560 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you that
one in just a moment.

00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And according to the Egyptians,
there's not one chakra there,

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:05.050 align:middle line:90%
but there's five in a row.

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:07.510 align:middle line:84%
There's five total
different channels.

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:12.699 align:middle line:84%
And the five rotate up
from one chakra to the next

00:34:12.699 --> 00:34:14.189 align:middle line:90%
by 90 degrees.

00:34:14.189 --> 00:34:14.989 align:middle line:90%
They ratchet.

00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:17.163 align:middle line:84%
They go-- first one's
this way and this way.

00:34:17.163 --> 00:34:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And if I can move
my hand around--

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:21.589 align:middle line:84%
and this way and this way,
you know, [CLICKING TONGUE],

00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:22.389 align:middle line:90%
just like--

00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:26.409 align:middle line:90%
remember the drawing of light?

00:34:26.409 --> 00:34:30.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, that drawing of light
happens to be exactly--

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:31.140 align:middle line:90%
that's this one.

00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:36.969 align:middle line:90%


00:34:36.969 --> 00:34:38.420 align:middle line:90%
My button's moved it around.

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:43.060 align:middle line:90%
Here it is, this one here.

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:45.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't have it on
the screen right now.

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:48.770 align:middle line:90%
But this one is an area--

00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:52.630 align:middle line:84%
if you were to look at a
human being from above,

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:59.140 align:middle line:84%
that happens to be one of the
complex patterns of the body.

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And the chakras move
according to light,

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:04.520 align:middle line:84%
exactly the way light
moves, moving up there,

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:09.220 align:middle line:84%
each one being 90 degrees
away from the next one, 17.2

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:11.830 align:middle line:90%
centimeters apart.

00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And so there's five
channels, and I'm

00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:16.550 align:middle line:90%
going to describe what they are.

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
very lightly show you

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:22.960 align:middle line:84%
how the body conforms to
these rotating patterns

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:23.900 align:middle line:90%
as it moves up.

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:26.510 align:middle line:84%
You'll intuitively
see what I'm saying.

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:30.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could sit down and
very carefully work it all out

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:33.260 align:middle line:90%
and see a lot more than that.

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:34.820 align:middle line:84%
But this will be
enough, I think,

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:37.485 align:middle line:84%
to get an idea of
what the body does.

00:35:37.485 --> 00:35:40.030 align:middle line:90%


00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:45.310 align:middle line:84%
The first channel is
at the perineum itself.

00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And it goes straight
up the body,

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:53.290 align:middle line:90%
absolutely straight as an arrow.

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:55.580 align:middle line:90%
It is this big around.

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:57.310 align:middle line:84%
If you take your
thumb and middle--

00:35:57.310 --> 00:36:00.150 align:middle line:84%
the longest finger--
and connect it together,

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:01.870 align:middle line:90%
the size of that opening--

00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:05.980 align:middle line:84%
if you had some object that you
can just lightly put around,

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:10.020 align:middle line:84%
that's how big around
that is, the tube.

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And it is as straight
as a fluorescent tube.

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:16.410 align:middle line:84%
It stretches all the
way up into the top

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:18.510 align:middle line:84%
of the crystalline
structure above your head

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:21.000 align:middle line:90%
and below your feet.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.790 align:middle line:84%
It runs all the way up
through the whole body.

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And so you just have
this straight shot

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:32.740 align:middle line:90%
from top to bottom.

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:35.460 align:middle line:84%
This is the base
of the spine here.

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:41.940 align:middle line:84%
But that one keeps on going, all
the way down to below the feet.

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:43.540 align:middle line:90%
Now, I have no choice here.

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:46.710 align:middle line:84%
I have to be a little graphic in
order to describe these things.

00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:50.250 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking from
underneath a person,

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:53.860 align:middle line:84%
whether it's male or female,
there's the central tube.

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:55.420 align:middle line:90%
And these tubes are overlapping.

00:36:55.420 --> 00:37:00.160 align:middle line:90%
They're large energy of tubes.

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And they're overlapping,
like Vesica Pisces, OK?

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:06.360 align:middle line:84%
So it'd be like
there's five circles,

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.360 align:middle line:90%
but they're overlapping.

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.840 align:middle line:84%
They're bigger, that they
overlap over top of each other.

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:13.090 align:middle line:84%
You go back from the
perineum, back to the anus,

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:18.510 align:middle line:90%
and it's another channel.

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And it moves up the spine
not in a straight line,

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:22.670 align:middle line:90%
but it moves like this.

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:31.950 align:middle line:90%


00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And then directly behind the
anus, you go back to the coccyx.

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:40.660 align:middle line:84%
You have the spinal
column coming down.

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And you have the sacrum,
which is a triangle.

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And now the sacrum
is this little tube

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:48.480 align:middle line:84%
that comes down, which comes
down and meets on the same plane

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:51.980 align:middle line:90%
as the anus and the perineum.

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:54.540 align:middle line:90%


00:37:54.540 --> 00:38:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And your entire spinal column
is focused at that point.

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:02.068 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
whole thing, which

00:38:02.068 --> 00:38:04.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I'm going
to get into a whole lot

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:05.140 align:middle line:90%
right now, but--

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:07.800 align:middle line:90%


00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:10.880 align:middle line:90%
let me see if I've got it here--

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:11.680 align:middle line:90%
this one here.

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:15.360 align:middle line:90%


00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:21.550 align:middle line:84%
An angle creates a natural,
measurable frequency,

00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:24.820 align:middle line:84%
so megahertz, which
you can measure.

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:31.500 align:middle line:90%
So does a rod, like this.

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:37.170 align:middle line:84%
If you have a rod, there is a
wavelength, standing wavelength,

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:39.480 align:middle line:90%
that will come from tip to tip.

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And you can measure the
frequency coming off of it.

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.860 align:middle line:84%
If you shorten it,
you're going to get

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:50.900 align:middle line:84%
a higher wavelength-- shorter
wavelength but higher frequency

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:51.700 align:middle line:90%
off of that.

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And you can measure
coming off of both tips.

00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:55.870 align:middle line:90%
People have done that.

00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:57.600 align:middle line:90%
This is DJ Nelson's work.

00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.100 align:middle line:90%
And they have all--

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:01.450 align:middle line:84%
I'll only put one
more thing here.

00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:05.980 align:middle line:84%
So with every rod length,
there is an angle.

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:10.230 align:middle line:84%
So anything that has a sharp
point on it, like that,

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:13.750 align:middle line:84%
has a frequency that
you can measure.

00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:18.060 align:middle line:84%
It comes off of it,
just by its shape.

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And so from 0 to 360 degrees,
there is a different frequency.

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And these are all listed on
here, these pages and pages

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:33.090 align:middle line:84%
of this, of all the
different frequencies that

00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:34.390 align:middle line:90%
come off of there.

00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And with every angle, there is
a rod length associated with it.

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.700 align:middle line:84%
So you can either
use a rod or an angle

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:44.460 align:middle line:90%
to produce these things.

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:45.750 align:middle line:90%
And if you look--

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:49.380 align:middle line:84%
what the Egyptians used,
though, was primarily rods.

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:50.777 align:middle line:90%
And they did everything.

00:39:50.777 --> 00:39:52.860 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian philosophy
could do anything and just

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:57.090 align:middle line:84%
about everything you can
imagine with just a stick.

00:39:57.090 --> 00:39:59.230 align:middle line:90%
They were just made out of wood.

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:01.870 align:middle line:84%
We've looked at over 200 of
these and took photographs.

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:03.692 align:middle line:84%
They're usually just
made out of wood.

00:40:03.692 --> 00:40:05.900 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make any difference
what it's made out of.

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:07.900 align:middle line:90%
You remember-- who was it--

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:10.715 align:middle line:84%
Moses took his thing down
and turned it into a snake?

00:40:10.715 --> 00:40:13.380 align:middle line:90%


00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, thy rod and
thy staff will comfort thee.

00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:25.590 align:middle line:84%
It was an ancient science
that we've long forgotten.

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:27.970 align:middle line:90%
But we were studying this.

00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And they would put,
again, these tuning forks

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:34.800 align:middle line:84%
in it, which is another thing,
and these various things that

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:35.710 align:middle line:90%
can go on the top.

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:37.270 align:middle line:90%
One of them was an ankh.

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:38.800 align:middle line:90%
One of them was the 45 degree.

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.770 align:middle line:84%
One of these various
things would go on there.

00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:43.810 align:middle line:84%
They put an ankh on there, by
the way, and you strike the rod.

00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:46.410 align:middle line:84%
What happens is, it
just keeps increasing

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:50.700 align:middle line:84%
as it circulates the energy
back into the rod again,

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:54.840 align:middle line:84%
which is one of the keys about
which we're about to talk about.

00:40:54.840 --> 00:41:00.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, anyway, the
spine comes down.

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And then here's this angle, this
triangle coming off of there.

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:11.390 align:middle line:84%
I tried to find someone
who could figure out

00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:12.190 align:middle line:90%
what that angle is.

00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:14.310 align:middle line:84%
I figured somebody
must have measured--

00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:16.195 align:middle line:90%
some doctor somewhere.

00:41:16.195 --> 00:41:18.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't think anybody's ever
thought about it, because we

00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:20.550 align:middle line:84%
couldn't find it anywhere--
went through all kinds of stuff

00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:21.425 align:middle line:90%
and couldn't find it.

00:41:21.425 --> 00:41:24.450 align:middle line:84%
We finally had to go get
a couple of skeletons,

00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:26.140 align:middle line:90%
these real ones that they use.

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And we got one male and one
female and looked at them.

00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And just thus, we could try
to measure what it was at.

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:35.460 align:middle line:90%
And it was right at 52 degrees.

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know for sure,
just measuring two of them,

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:41.230 align:middle line:84%
but it was real
close to 52 degrees.

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And we were thinking,
it's probably--

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:45.790 align:middle line:84%
just because it
is so close to it.

00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:47.980 align:middle line:84%
That's the angle the
Great Pyramid is--

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:48.840 align:middle line:90%
51, 51.

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:51.180 align:middle line:90%
It's almost 52 degrees.

00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:52.770 align:middle line:90%
It may be related to that.

00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:55.680 align:middle line:84%
Because we do have the
actual entire shape

00:41:55.680 --> 00:42:00.690 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid around
our body in its perfection.

00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:05.100 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, the whole spinal
column comes down here

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:06.910 align:middle line:90%
and focuses on this point.

00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And it has a flow of energy of
the chakra, not up the spine,

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:14.130 align:middle line:84%
but up the chakra
system that swings wide.

00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:23.620 align:middle line:90%
It goes like this, like that.

00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:26.640 align:middle line:90%


00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:28.420 align:middle line:84%
That's whether you're
male or female.

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:35.250 align:middle line:84%
If you're female, then the one
in front of that is the vagina.

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And the one in front of
that is the clitoris.

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:41.530 align:middle line:84%
If you're male,
instead of the vagina,

00:42:41.530 --> 00:42:43.950 align:middle line:84%
it's the opening
inside the scrotum.

00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And instead of the
clitoris, it's the penis.

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:52.850 align:middle line:84%
But the first one, the vagina
opening, comes like this.

00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:58.110 align:middle line:90%


00:42:58.110 --> 00:43:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And the clitoris or
penis is a wider swing--

00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:11.340 align:middle line:84%
comes out like
this to go on to--

00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:15.190 align:middle line:84%
now you have to turn each
one of these by 90 degrees.

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:16.510 align:middle line:90%
So this one's facing that way.

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:17.680 align:middle line:90%
This one's facing out.

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:18.925 align:middle line:90%
This one's facing back.

00:43:18.925 --> 00:43:20.050 align:middle line:90%
This one's facing that way.

00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:22.620 align:middle line:84%
You understand what
I-- does everybody

00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:23.910 align:middle line:90%
understand what I mean?

00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:27.450 align:middle line:84%
You turn each one-- so you make
this pattern going up like that.

00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:32.200 align:middle line:84%
Now I'll just show
you what I mean by--

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:35.730 align:middle line:84%
they have these
angular directions.

00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:38.190 align:middle line:84%
Everything at the
base of the spine

00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:42.330 align:middle line:84%
is all flowing in this
direction and out that way

00:43:42.330 --> 00:43:44.490 align:middle line:90%
toward the front.

00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:48.180 align:middle line:84%
You have a full direction going
out that way and in this line.

00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:50.970 align:middle line:84%
You've got the
coccyx coming down

00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:55.150 align:middle line:84%
near the anus and the
perineum, the vagina.

00:43:55.150 --> 00:44:00.150 align:middle line:84%
The vagina is a Vesica Pisces,
and it's flowing that way also.

00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:03.040 align:middle line:84%
You have the penis, which
also moves that way.

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:05.340 align:middle line:84%
And the opening of the penis
is also a Vesica Pisces,

00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:06.280 align:middle line:90%
moving that way.

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:09.630 align:middle line:84%
Everything is in line,
facing out that direction.

00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And then this whole thing comes
up, 7.23 centimeters, rotates.

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And if it's male, it
would go this way.

00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:19.350 align:middle line:84%
If it's female, it
would rotate that way.

00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:21.870 align:middle line:84%
Or it goes over this
way, at which point--

00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:23.880 align:middle line:90%
we'll just pick one thing.

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Right at that
level in there, you

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:28.140 align:middle line:84%
see the ovaries
come out like this--

00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:29.100 align:middle line:90%
over here.

00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:30.910 align:middle line:84%
The next one comes up
and rotates this way.

00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:33.400 align:middle line:84%
Now you have a directional
going this way at the navel.

00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:37.350 align:middle line:84%
You can see the umbilical cord
coming out that way again.

00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:42.730 align:middle line:84%
It'll come up again one more
time to the solar plexus.

00:44:42.730 --> 00:44:45.630 align:middle line:84%
The solar plexus
is a Vesica Pisces

00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:49.680 align:middle line:90%
facing this way, like that.

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:52.560 align:middle line:84%
It's just like a little
mouth, only it's facing out

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:54.840 align:middle line:90%
in this direction here.

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:58.265 align:middle line:84%
And then it rotates one
more time to right here.

00:44:58.265 --> 00:45:00.840 align:middle line:90%


00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:02.860 align:middle line:90%
This is a very special place.

00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that
it's very special place

00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:08.026 align:middle line:84%
is because it's the
place of completion.

00:45:08.026 --> 00:45:12.270 align:middle line:90%


00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:15.610 align:middle line:84%
The first one was
pointing this way.

00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:16.920 align:middle line:90%
That's the front of it.

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:18.640 align:middle line:84%
The next one pointed
over this way.

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:20.640 align:middle line:90%
That's the second chakra.

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:23.260 align:middle line:84%
The third chakra, the
navel, pointed this way.

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:26.020 align:middle line:84%
The fourth one, the solar
plexus, pointed this way.

00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And the fifth one
here points back.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.570 align:middle line:90%
It comes full circle.

00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the first time
that this one here has the--

00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:40.080 align:middle line:90%
it has both.

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:42.790 align:middle line:84%
It has the awareness
of all planes now.

00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And so this place is real
special, the fifth one.

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:50.220 align:middle line:90%
It's the first musical octave.

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:54.720 align:middle line:84%
It's five notes, the
pentatonic scale also.

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:56.610 align:middle line:90%
And so it hits right here.

00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:58.270 align:middle line:90%
And this one has both.

00:45:58.270 --> 00:46:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And so, you see, the breaths
are separated this way.

00:46:02.410 --> 00:46:05.790 align:middle line:84%
But they also go that
way at the same time.

00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:10.500 align:middle line:84%
Right here, just that spot
that we're talking about--

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:14.040 align:middle line:84%
right in the center,
that place right there,

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:17.040 align:middle line:84%
which is the place of
Christ consciousness.

00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And in that spot, if you
drew the line coming down

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:22.990 align:middle line:84%
the center, which I don't
have on this one here,

00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:27.210 align:middle line:84%
you would see what appears
to be like a Christian cross.

00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:28.740 align:middle line:90%
You see it?

00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Top in this line here, and
imagine a line coming straight

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:33.330 align:middle line:90%
down the middle--

00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:35.970 align:middle line:90%
be the cross.

00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:38.740 align:middle line:84%
That's an actual energy
field line that's there.

00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:42.120 align:middle line:84%
But the cross is not-- like, a
Christian cross you think of it

00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:45.230 align:middle line:90%
going like this, just--

00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:54.490 align:middle line:90%


00:46:54.490 --> 00:46:55.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:57.930 align:middle line:84%
You think of this
like that, which

00:46:57.930 --> 00:46:59.680 align:middle line:90%
is the energy field of that.

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:03.550 align:middle line:84%
But because of what we
just talked about, of this,

00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:08.860 align:middle line:84%
it also has a line
coming out from there.

00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:11.610 align:middle line:84%
So there is an arm of
energy that comes out

00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:15.000 align:middle line:84%
in the tetrahedral field, goes
out this way and out the back,

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.880 align:middle line:90%
as well as out that way.

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And so if you were to look at
it from above, looking down,

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:30.180 align:middle line:90%
what you would see is- this.

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:32.160 align:middle line:90%
Everybody get that?

00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:35.940 align:middle line:84%
Both of these are
symbols for Christ.

00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:39.140 align:middle line:84%
They're both different views
marking the same place.

00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:42.330 align:middle line:90%


00:47:42.330 --> 00:47:45.970 align:middle line:84%
What it took the Egyptians
a long time to realize--

00:47:45.970 --> 00:47:50.400 align:middle line:84%
and was one of the primary
keys to their unfoldment--

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:52.300 align:middle line:84%
as they studied these
energy fields very,

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:57.450 align:middle line:84%
very carefully was that if
you look at the human body

00:47:57.450 --> 00:48:00.760 align:middle line:84%
from the front, at
that particular chakra,

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:02.200 align:middle line:90%
this is what you see.

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:04.630 align:middle line:84%
If you look at it from the
top, that's what you see.

00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:06.730 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at
it from the side--

00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:09.720 align:middle line:84%
if you come over here
and look at that--

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:13.470 align:middle line:84%
then you would see an
arm coming out into space

00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:15.100 align:middle line:90%
and going into the back.

00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:22.350 align:middle line:84%
So the bottom part of
it would look like this.

00:48:22.350 --> 00:48:24.880 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you
wouldn't see this arm.

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:26.440 align:middle line:90%
This arm would become a dot.

00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:29.470 align:middle line:84%
The arm that comes out into
space would look like that.

00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:31.290 align:middle line:90%
Does everybody see that so far?

00:48:31.290 --> 00:48:37.350 align:middle line:84%
But this top arm here has
another component to it.

00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And it was not known
for a long time.

00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:44.530 align:middle line:84%
But the component is a
curve that passes through.

00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:48.460 align:middle line:84%
It goes from here through the
13th chakra and back again.

00:48:48.460 --> 00:49:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And that curve looks like
this, which is called the ankh.

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:09.870 align:middle line:90%


00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:14.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you were to rotate the
ankh in its full 3D and turn it

00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:17.940 align:middle line:90%
again, it would look like this.

00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:20.823 align:middle line:84%
And this view-- and these
two are exactly the same.

00:49:20.823 --> 00:49:22.240 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
this one this way--

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:25.830 align:middle line:84%
but that ankh, which is a curve,
actually becomes a straight line

00:49:25.830 --> 00:49:27.390 align:middle line:90%
when seen from the side.

00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is a line running
through the middle of this,

00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:33.150 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to show
you one more symbol now,

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:44.040 align:middle line:84%
which you'll realize is
another symbol for Christ.

00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And it will probably tie
all these things together.

00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:48.545 align:middle line:90%
You've probably seen this one.

00:49:48.545 --> 00:50:00.630 align:middle line:90%


00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:02.620 align:middle line:90%
You've seen this one?

00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:03.420 align:middle line:90%
Who hasn't?

00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:06.030 align:middle line:90%
Who's never seen that?

00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:07.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a very Catholic
symbol, right.

00:50:07.830 --> 00:50:10.740 align:middle line:84%
It's about as Christian
as you can get.

00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:13.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you think--
well, I retract that.

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:15.270 align:middle line:90%
It depends on who you are.

00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:18.480 align:middle line:90%
But it goes way back there.

00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's showing the cross, the
three-dimensionality of that

00:50:22.290 --> 00:50:24.580 align:middle line:84%
point, the line
running up the middle,

00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:27.030 align:middle line:84%
and the piece of the
ankh that is on there,

00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:28.510 align:middle line:90%
showing all the various--

00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:33.750 align:middle line:84%
all three of these things
combined into one image.

00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:37.330 align:middle line:84%
So if you asked ask a Christian
priest what that meant,

00:50:37.330 --> 00:50:41.040 align:middle line:84%
I really doubt if
they could tell you.

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:43.985 align:middle line:84%
All they'd know is that it's
a symbol, an old symbol.

00:50:43.985 --> 00:50:45.540 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:49.955 align:middle line:84%
And here's another thing
I want to read to you.

00:50:49.955 --> 00:50:53.490 align:middle line:90%


00:50:53.490 --> 00:50:59.200 align:middle line:84%
This is from Richard
Noone's book, May 5, 2000,

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:01.742 align:middle line:90%
whatever it is.

00:51:01.742 --> 00:51:08.040 align:middle line:84%
In the ancient Greek alphabet,
the letter P symbolically

00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:12.670 align:middle line:84%
represented a man,
number one, who,

00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:15.910 align:middle line:84%
having overcome his lowest
nature, his sexual center,

00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:18.840 align:middle line:84%
joined his emotional
nature, his heart center,

00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:24.210 align:middle line:84%
with his intellectual
center in his physical body.

00:51:24.210 --> 00:51:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And P thus represented a man
in control of his physical,

00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:33.150 align:middle line:90%
emotional, and mental nature--

00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:35.970 align:middle line:90%
thus, the letter P itself.

00:51:35.970 --> 00:51:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And so many of the Greek
people who understood this

00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:51.270 align:middle line:84%
changed their names to
start with the letter

00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:55.620 align:middle line:84%
P, such as Pythagoras and
Plato and Pliny and Prometheus

00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:57.300 align:middle line:90%
and many, many others.

00:51:57.300 --> 00:52:01.260 align:middle line:84%
They all changed the name to
begin with that letter P because

00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:04.200 align:middle line:84%
of the relationship of
what it meant to what

00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:06.810 align:middle line:90%
we're about to talk about.

00:52:06.810 --> 00:52:10.115 align:middle line:84%
OK, what I'm about to tell you
is what it is really all about.

00:52:10.115 --> 00:52:14.220 align:middle line:90%


00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And I studied for two years
with TSOTH and his wife on this

00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:20.140 align:middle line:90%
and studying tantra.

00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:21.360 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not going to--

00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:23.860 align:middle line:84%
this is not my job here
to go deeply into it.

00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:26.290 align:middle line:84%
I just want to remind
you of something,

00:52:26.290 --> 00:52:29.070 align:middle line:90%
and you can remember it later.

00:52:29.070 --> 00:52:34.230 align:middle line:84%
But many of the
Hindu systems feel

00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:38.640 align:middle line:84%
that if the male ejaculates,
that they have just

00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:40.020 align:middle line:90%
died a little bit.

00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And so there is this
whole thing where

00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:43.540 align:middle line:90%
he's not supposed to do that.

00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And they have either
invented-- if they

00:52:45.210 --> 00:52:48.720 align:middle line:84%
are true or not-- these
particular tubes that

00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:52.410 align:middle line:84%
are supposed to take this
up and bring it up around.

00:52:52.410 --> 00:52:53.760 align:middle line:90%
No one's ever found these tubes.

00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:56.564 align:middle line:84%
And whether it's even
true, I don't know.

00:52:56.564 --> 00:53:00.300 align:middle line:84%
But according to
Egyptian philosophy,

00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:03.480 align:middle line:84%
they don't feel that
that is necessary at all.

00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:06.640 align:middle line:84%
The problem, in terms
of pure electronics,

00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:11.680 align:middle line:84%
is that at the moment the
male or the female has orgasm,

00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:14.950 align:middle line:84%
the energy will either
be sent up or down.

00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:16.950 align:middle line:84%
Some people send it
down, believe it or not.

00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:21.270 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is, it goes
to one of the poles, either

00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:23.190 align:middle line:90%
the North or the South Pole.

00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you do that, you
do die a little bit.

00:53:27.550 --> 00:53:31.530 align:middle line:84%
You ground out that energy,
and you just lost it.

00:53:31.530 --> 00:53:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And to continue that process,
from an Egyptian point of view,

00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:36.420 align:middle line:90%
leads to death.

00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:40.490 align:middle line:84%
However, there is a way that it
can be done where it does not

00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:41.290 align:middle line:90%
lead to death.

00:53:41.290 --> 00:53:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, it does
just the exact opposite.

00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:46.920 align:middle line:84%
Instead of losing
energy, it causes

00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:51.840 align:middle line:84%
you to gain energy and
increase your strength

00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:54.065 align:middle line:90%
and your spiritual nature.

00:53:54.065 --> 00:53:58.035 align:middle line:90%


00:53:58.035 --> 00:54:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And without going into the
complexity of this whole thing--

00:54:01.210 --> 00:54:03.182 align:middle line:84%
because they made you
learn how to do it

00:54:03.182 --> 00:54:04.890 align:middle line:84%
through all these
systems-- just thinking

00:54:04.890 --> 00:54:09.660 align:middle line:84%
of a central tube
running up the middle.

00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:12.940 align:middle line:84%
They would train in such a way
that, at the moment of orgasm,

00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:15.870 align:middle line:84%
you would control
the energy coming up

00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:17.970 align:middle line:84%
until it got to
this chakra right

00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:22.200 align:middle line:84%
here, which happens to be
right where the ankh is.

00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And then you would
send the energy

00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:27.570 align:middle line:84%
out the back, which
is the meaning of,

00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:30.600 align:middle line:84%
you must receive the
ankh from behind.

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:32.260 align:middle line:84%
It won't work going
out the front.

00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:34.720 align:middle line:84%
The polarity is such
that it doesn't work.

00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:37.980 align:middle line:90%
And so it goes out the back.

00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:39.130 align:middle line:90%
It comes around.

00:54:39.130 --> 00:54:41.880 align:middle line:84%
It goes through this
point, which is where--

00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:43.050 align:middle line:90%
the top of the head--

00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:44.470 align:middle line:90%
and curves down.

00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And the energy comes right
back to the same place

00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:52.890 align:middle line:84%
again and puts the energy
right back into your system

00:54:52.890 --> 00:54:58.080 align:middle line:84%
and actually strengthens
rather than weakens.

00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And there's all
kinds of thoughts--

00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:05.580 align:middle line:90%
even in Egyptian thought--

00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:10.590 align:middle line:84%
of exactly how to do this,
in terms of controlling

00:55:10.590 --> 00:55:12.700 align:middle line:90%
and these kinds of things.

00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to
get into all of that.

00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:18.070 align:middle line:84%
But I do want you
to be aware of it.

00:55:18.070 --> 00:55:20.010 align:middle line:90%
And you can begin to--

00:55:20.010 --> 00:55:22.440 align:middle line:84%
if you start
experimenting, you probably

00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:24.990 align:middle line:84%
will remember very
quickly something.

00:55:24.990 --> 00:55:27.940 align:middle line:90%
Because it's ancient.

00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:29.460 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very ancient.

00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:34.710 align:middle line:90%
But that was the real--

00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:38.290 align:middle line:84%
this hidden Egyptian meaning
behind what that is about.

00:55:38.290 --> 00:55:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Just to go on this
a little bit more,

00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:42.900 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptian idea
of tantra, which

00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:45.720 align:middle line:84%
I started talking about
before, is so complex,

00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:47.440 align:middle line:90%
it's hardly imaginable.

00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:50.650 align:middle line:84%
No wonder it took them 12 years
to even begin to get through it.

00:55:50.650 --> 00:55:53.928 align:middle line:84%
They saw that there was eight
different personalities--

00:55:53.928 --> 00:55:55.470 align:middle line:84%
and we might have
talked about that--

00:55:55.470 --> 00:56:02.970 align:middle line:84%
didn't I-- associated with
the eight original cells

00:56:02.970 --> 00:56:05.650 align:middle line:84%
that are associated with the
eight electrical circuits.

00:56:05.650 --> 00:56:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And their idea of
reincarnation is that, OK,

00:56:10.330 --> 00:56:11.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm focused in here right now.

00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:15.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, that means that
I've got my grid arranged

00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:18.300 align:middle line:84%
around my body in
such a way that I

00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:21.780 align:middle line:84%
have one of the
personalities that is opened.

00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:24.210 align:middle line:84%
But they would teach them
how to rotate this grid

00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:27.120 align:middle line:84%
or spin this grid spin
around to other ones.

00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And a totally, completely
different person steps forward.

00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:33.750 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting,
and we've done experiments

00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:35.670 align:middle line:90%
with several people on this.

00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:39.060 align:middle line:84%
And it is very, very
interesting, I'll tell you.

00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And each one of you has four
females and four males in you.

00:56:44.370 --> 00:56:49.358 align:middle line:84%
And in each case, you'll have
an older male, a little bit

00:56:49.358 --> 00:56:51.150 align:middle line:84%
younger, a little bit
younger, and usually,

00:56:51.150 --> 00:56:54.820 align:middle line:84%
one that most people would
find was about a teenager.

00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll have an
older female and et cetera,

00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:58.590 align:middle line:90%
all the way down to teenager.

00:56:58.590 --> 00:57:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is,
the first time you ever

00:57:02.490 --> 00:57:06.940 align:middle line:84%
come to Earth, you have to first
go around and hit all eight.

00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:09.220 align:middle line:84%
You'll tend to rotate
to all eight places.

00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:12.790 align:middle line:84%
I've only been here twice,
only one other lifetime.

00:57:12.790 --> 00:57:13.870 align:middle line:90%
I just got here.

00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And so I've only got two places
on my cube that are activated.

00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:22.650 align:middle line:84%
But you'll first go
through all eight places.

00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:25.920 align:middle line:84%
And then you might
come to one, and you

00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:29.830 align:middle line:84%
may run down that one for a
certain number of lifetimes

00:57:29.830 --> 00:57:31.680 align:middle line:84%
and then switch to
another one and do

00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:33.300 align:middle line:84%
another certain
number of lifetimes,

00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:34.592 align:middle line:90%
and then switch to another one.

00:57:34.592 --> 00:57:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And so you're trying to complete
yourself in all these eight

00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:40.440 align:middle line:90%
different possible ways.

00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And the Egyptians have you
work with the sexual energy--

00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:47.350 align:middle line:84%
we're just talking about
sexual energy flow in this one.

00:57:47.350 --> 00:57:51.600 align:middle line:84%
But they have you work
not only with the flow

00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:55.110 align:middle line:84%
but with the polarities
within yourself,

00:57:55.110 --> 00:57:57.480 align:middle line:84%
the male-female eight
personality and flows

00:57:57.480 --> 00:58:02.340 align:middle line:84%
within your own self, and
simultaneously with the five

00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:04.500 align:middle line:84%
different flows that
are moving up here,

00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:06.280 align:middle line:84%
associated with
each one of those.

00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And then all of the possible
sexual polarities-- and there's

00:58:12.090 --> 00:58:15.480 align:middle line:84%
64 of them, according
to the Egyptians, which

00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:17.880 align:middle line:84%
the Yijing happens
to be an exact mirror

00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:19.848 align:middle line:90%
of their philosophy.

00:58:19.848 --> 00:58:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And if you notice
the Yijing, it goes

00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:24.000 align:middle line:84%
from male to female, male
to female, male to female,

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.080 align:middle line:90%
each one of them.

00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And they're all
associated in there.

00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:30.210 align:middle line:90%
And it's a very complex system.

00:58:30.210 --> 00:58:31.442 align:middle line:90%
It takes them a long time.

00:58:31.442 --> 00:58:33.900 align:middle line:84%
When they finally get to the
very end of this whole thing--

00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:38.060 align:middle line:84%
at the very end of the
school, after 12 years--

00:58:38.060 --> 00:58:39.410 align:middle line:90%
they bring them in there.

00:58:39.410 --> 00:58:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And whoever's in their body,
whichever personality is out

00:58:43.850 --> 00:58:45.890 align:middle line:84%
there, by this
time, they know how

00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:48.140 align:middle line:90%
to move and rotate this thing.

00:58:48.140 --> 00:58:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And that takes real skill
in learning how to do that.

00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And they will have
them then bring

00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:59.420 align:middle line:84%
forth in very rapid
succession all

00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:01.320 align:middle line:84%
eight of the beings
of themselves,

00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:04.250 align:middle line:84%
all the eight
components at once.

00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:08.310 align:middle line:84%
They have a conference,
at which point,

00:59:08.310 --> 00:59:12.080 align:middle line:84%
they compare within themselves
or within yourself what

00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:13.260 align:middle line:90%
you've learned in this way.

00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:16.010 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, you
have eight different things

00:59:16.010 --> 00:59:19.820 align:middle line:84%
coming out here, each
one being a lifeline.

00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:26.370 align:middle line:84%
So, in other words, if you were
to go back into your past lives,

00:59:26.370 --> 00:59:31.340 align:middle line:84%
you're almost certainly going
only back into one of them.

00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:34.310 align:middle line:84%
You've got seven other lines
going out there that you may not

00:59:34.310 --> 00:59:35.850 align:middle line:90%
even know are even there.

00:59:35.850 --> 00:59:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And as long as you keep that
this thing fixed at one place,

00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:41.000 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to
know they're there,

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.375 align:middle line:84%
no matter how much hypnotherapy
or anything else you got.

00:59:43.375 --> 00:59:47.090 align:middle line:84%
It's not accessible
through hypnotherapy.

00:59:47.090 --> 00:59:49.070 align:middle line:90%
The whole circuit has to change.

00:59:49.070 --> 00:59:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And so they will bring
them all in at once.

00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll all kind
of compare their experiences

00:59:58.490 --> 01:00:01.350 align:middle line:84%
and what needs to be worked on
and everything else like this,

01:00:01.350 --> 01:00:05.908 align:middle line:84%
to find this balance in
the cube in this aspect.

01:00:05.908 --> 01:00:07.200 align:middle line:90%
That was the emotional balance.

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:08.117 align:middle line:90%
This is what they did.

01:00:08.117 --> 01:00:11.298 align:middle line:84%
It was very, very,
very complex work.

01:00:11.298 --> 01:00:12.590 align:middle line:90%
I worked with it for two years.

01:00:12.590 --> 01:00:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And it was so complex,
I couldn't believe it.

01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:17.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>> And would be the multiple
personality created by some

01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:21.450 align:middle line:90%
people?

01:00:21.450 --> 01:00:25.190 align:middle line:84%
>> It is, in most cases, unless
you're possessed and this kind

01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:26.750 align:middle line:90%
of thing, if you've got to--

01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:29.540 align:middle line:84%
assuming you're clean and you
don't have anybody in there,

01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:32.790 align:middle line:84%
then all you got to do is--
you can be sitting here.

01:00:32.790 --> 01:00:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you know how, just
turn your thing, your field,

01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:38.030 align:middle line:90%
just rotate it.

01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:39.680 align:middle line:90%
You could be sitting in there.

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And all you got to do is, if
you were looking out there,

01:00:43.170 --> 01:00:45.420 align:middle line:84%
just rotate your
field, like that.

01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:47.360 align:middle line:90%
Do another one over here.

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And you won't believe
what'll happen.

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:52.700 align:middle line:84%
A whole different person
will step forth out

01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:54.380 align:middle line:84%
of your body, which
is really you.

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:56.100 align:middle line:90%
It's not a different person.

01:00:56.100 --> 01:01:01.410 align:middle line:84%
It's a different aspect of your
spirit, a different reflection,

01:01:01.410 --> 01:01:04.220 align:middle line:84%
a different series
of experiences

01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:09.380 align:middle line:90%
that that part has experienced.

01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:11.150 align:middle line:84%
There are those hands
going up, everybody.

01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:13.820 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:16.240 align:middle line:90%


01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.040 align:middle line:90%
He's got it.

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.310 align:middle line:90%
I can--

01:01:19.310 --> 01:01:22.640 align:middle line:84%
>> The other question was
about raising the sexual energy

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:23.520 align:middle line:90%
and ankhing it.

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:26.470 align:middle line:84%
Is that something that's done
during the entire time of making

01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:27.270 align:middle line:90%
love?

01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:30.390 align:middle line:84%
Or is that something that's
done at the time of orgasm?

01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:32.590 align:middle line:84%
>> It's only done at
the moment of orgasm.

01:01:32.590 --> 01:01:40.172 align:middle line:90%


01:01:40.172 --> 01:01:42.160 align:middle line:90%
>> If you take the--

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:44.620 align:middle line:84%
if I show you your ankh,
I can explain to you

01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:46.370 align:middle line:84%
better what the question
is that I've got.

01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:47.170 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:01:47.170 --> 01:01:48.360 align:middle line:90%
I can show you mine.

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:51.140 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:51.940 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my ankh.

01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:52.740 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK.

01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:53.582 align:middle line:90%
>> Ankh.

01:01:53.582 --> 01:01:57.910 align:middle line:90%


01:01:57.910 --> 01:01:58.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:01:58.710 --> 01:02:02.180 align:middle line:84%
So here, this thing
goes this way, right?

01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:04.045 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it's sitting like that.

01:02:04.045 --> 01:02:05.300 align:middle line:90%
>> This way.

01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:09.170 align:middle line:84%
I thought that was
supposed to be the arms.

01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you mean when it shows
it with the little arms doing,

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:14.320 align:middle line:90%
like, this thing?

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:17.060 align:middle line:84%
>> But I thought that was
supposed to represent the arms

01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:18.975 align:middle line:90%
of a person.

01:02:18.975 --> 01:02:20.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Not from this
way of thinking.

01:02:20.350 --> 01:02:24.806 align:middle line:90%


01:02:24.806 --> 01:02:26.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't know who
came up with that.

01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:29.960 align:middle line:84%
But there is one
on the walls that

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:31.905 align:middle line:84%
shows the ankh and
these two things

01:02:31.905 --> 01:02:34.280 align:middle line:84%
being these two arms that came
out from there, like that.

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:43.640 align:middle line:84%
>> But according to TSOTH, this
could only be seen from the side

01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:44.845 align:middle line:90%
and not from the front.

01:02:44.845 --> 01:02:49.640 align:middle line:90%


01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>> When you're bringing
up the sexual energies

01:02:52.370 --> 01:02:53.880 align:middle line:84%
and you're feeling
these lines up,

01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:57.860 align:middle line:84%
are you creating a sphere
in there before the moment?

01:02:57.860 --> 01:02:58.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Where, here?

01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:02:59.750 --> 01:03:01.860 align:middle line:84%
You're creating
a sphere of area?

01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:04.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could feel the
energies coming out and--

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:05.240 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:06.900 align:middle line:90%
>> --a different direction.

01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:11.190 align:middle line:84%
>> If you are, I know it's just
up, and then you just direct it.

01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:13.220 align:middle line:84%
It'll go automatically
once you--

01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:15.090 align:middle line:84%
if you don't do anything,
it'll just go up.

01:03:15.090 --> 01:03:17.610 align:middle line:84%
But if you direct
it at that moment,

01:03:17.610 --> 01:03:19.850 align:middle line:90%
it will very easily move.

01:03:19.850 --> 01:03:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find
that it will just--

01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:25.590 align:middle line:84%
there's an actual energy
tube running around there.

01:03:25.590 --> 01:03:29.220 align:middle line:84%
So once you turn one channel
off and open the other one up,

01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:31.867 align:middle line:84%
it will just sort of
automatically do this thing.

01:03:31.867 --> 01:03:33.450 align:middle line:84%
You don't even hardly
have to do much.

01:03:33.450 --> 01:03:37.340 align:middle line:84%
It'll just automatically come
back around this other channel.

01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm feeling, at
times, it'll come out from

01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:43.540 align:middle line:84%
the shoulders first, and then
it'll start coming in a full

01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:44.340 align:middle line:90%
sphere.

01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:46.780 align:middle line:84%
But I haven't yet experienced
coming out and coming back

01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:47.580 align:middle line:90%
around.

01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what I teach relative
to the Merkaba is that it comes

01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:53.690 align:middle line:90%
back around one time.

01:03:53.690 --> 01:03:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as it hits,
then you immediately

01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:59.630 align:middle line:84%
send the energy from the
two ends down to this place

01:03:59.630 --> 01:04:01.240 align:middle line:84%
and radiate out
into a big sphere.

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:05.270 align:middle line:90%


01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:06.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:08.730 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:08.730 --> 01:04:11.180 align:middle line:90%


01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:12.046 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:04:12.046 --> 01:04:17.300 align:middle line:90%


01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:20.030 align:middle line:84%
>> When you were speaking
about the tie-in,

01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:25.380 align:middle line:84%
saving their whole civilization
by teaching tantra,

01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:28.070 align:middle line:84%
is it because they're teaching
all the different aspects

01:04:28.070 --> 01:04:30.200 align:middle line:84%
and how to accept
all the aspects,

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.340 align:middle line:90%
as well as creating the Merkaba?

01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:35.130 align:middle line:84%
Is that what
stabilized everything?

01:04:35.130 --> 01:04:38.030 align:middle line:90%


01:04:38.030 --> 01:04:42.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, they didn't teach just
energy flows and these kind

01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:44.880 align:middle line:90%
of things.

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:51.170 align:middle line:84%
Whatever they did changed them
so much that they taught that

01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:53.970 align:middle line:84%
and how it relates to
everything, not just to--

01:04:53.970 --> 01:04:54.930 align:middle line:90%
is that what you mean?

01:04:54.930 --> 01:04:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, does that
system still exist?

01:04:57.710 --> 01:05:02.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, to the degree that--

01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:09.290 align:middle line:84%
well, they were the founders
of the Mitel ministry school.

01:05:09.290 --> 01:05:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is Mitel ministry
school information.

01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:14.030 align:middle line:90%
This is what they were teaching.

01:05:14.030 --> 01:05:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>> When you were saying that
you studied this for a few years

01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:21.800 align:middle line:84%
and how complex it is, is that
the system that the Kainai used

01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:23.400 align:middle line:90%
to save their civilization?

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:24.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I think so.

01:05:24.990 --> 01:05:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And there is a way
that, from this system,

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:31.340 align:middle line:84%
that you can meet
interdimensionally

01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:33.260 align:middle line:90%
and all these other things.

01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:36.800 align:middle line:84%
But I only got a
little ways to--

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:40.940 align:middle line:84%
and I only studied for two
years, and then they left.

01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:43.980 align:middle line:90%
And so I didn't get it all.

01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:48.480 align:middle line:84%
I only got a certain
amount of the information.

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Though, I know I
have the rest of it.

01:05:51.590 --> 01:05:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still studying
what all of that is.

01:05:59.510 --> 01:06:00.960 align:middle line:90%
They left me with all the keys.

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:04.020 align:middle line:84%
I know where it all is and
where all the information is.

01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:08.035 align:middle line:90%
But it's a long process.

01:06:08.035 --> 01:06:09.410 align:middle line:84%
So it isn't
something that can be

01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:11.550 align:middle line:90%
done in a short period of time.

01:06:11.550 --> 01:06:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Is the Merkaba, the creation
of the Merkaba, part of it?

01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:17.480 align:middle line:90%


01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:31.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it is, except that I'm
not real sure if they fully

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:37.340 align:middle line:84%
understood the Merkaba
in all of its--

01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:41.270 align:middle line:84%
and this was the area that--
when you go back to 52,000 years

01:06:41.270 --> 01:06:46.850 align:middle line:84%
ago, much of the processes
that they were using were real

01:06:46.850 --> 01:06:48.710 align:middle line:90%
primitive.

01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:54.762 align:middle line:84%
And to what's being
taught here, I

01:06:54.762 --> 01:06:56.720 align:middle line:84%
don't think they understood
all the things that

01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:57.390 align:middle line:90%
were understood here.

01:06:57.390 --> 01:06:59.140 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the
first things that TSOTH

01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:00.600 align:middle line:90%
did when I came in here--

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:01.950 align:middle line:90%
I was directed to go to him.

01:07:01.950 --> 01:07:03.492 align:middle line:84%
And there's parts
of the story that--

01:07:03.492 --> 01:07:04.770 align:middle line:90%
I don't say everything.

01:07:04.770 --> 01:07:05.900 align:middle line:90%
I can't say everything.

01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:09.000 align:middle line:84%
One of the very first
things that happened was--

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.100 align:middle line:84%
the reason that I
was directed to him

01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:13.290 align:middle line:90%
was, I had to get his memories.

01:07:13.290 --> 01:07:16.150 align:middle line:84%
Because I haven't been
here but for a short--

01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:17.680 align:middle line:90%
I only got here in 1819.

01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:19.660 align:middle line:84%
So I haven't been
here for very long.

01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:21.310 align:middle line:90%
I don't have those memories.

01:07:21.310 --> 01:07:22.500 align:middle line:90%
So I needed his memories.

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And he needed the
information of the Merkaba.

01:07:25.290 --> 01:07:27.150 align:middle line:90%
So we exchanged.

01:07:27.150 --> 01:07:28.690 align:middle line:90%
And I gave him--

01:07:28.690 --> 01:07:31.380 align:middle line:84%
that was the first thing
he wanted before even we

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:34.350 align:middle line:90%
started getting into anything.

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:37.955 align:middle line:84%
He wanted the information
on the Merkaba,

01:07:37.955 --> 01:07:39.580 align:middle line:90%
which they were lacking.

01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:41.340 align:middle line:84%
They had developed
certain degrees of it

01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:43.710 align:middle line:90%
and certain aspects of it.

01:07:43.710 --> 01:07:49.680 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't know
all of everything

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:55.140 align:middle line:84%
that we have brought back
from a much higher level.

01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:59.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So who taught you
the Merkaba then?

01:07:59.370 --> 01:08:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>> I've known it for a
long, long, long, long time.

01:08:02.350 --> 01:08:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And nobody really
had to teach me that.

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:10.130 align:middle line:90%
I brought it down here.

01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:11.690 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't belong to me.

01:08:11.690 --> 01:08:12.690 align:middle line:90%
It belongs to all of us.

01:08:12.690 --> 01:08:13.490 align:middle line:90%
We all know it.

01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:16.861 align:middle line:90%
But I brought that with me.

01:08:16.861 --> 01:08:18.569 align:middle line:84%
That was the one thing
I brought with me.

01:08:18.569 --> 01:08:22.520 align:middle line:90%


01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:28.520 align:middle line:84%
But it was what I would call my
great-great-great-grandfather,

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Machiventa Melchizedek, who was
the one that re-instructed me

01:08:33.770 --> 01:08:37.609 align:middle line:84%
on the use of it as
soon as I got here.

01:08:37.609 --> 01:08:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And so I guess, if I had
to say where it came from,

01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:43.200 align:middle line:90%
that's where it came from.

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And he's the one
that has been here.

01:08:45.810 --> 01:08:51.080 align:middle line:84%
He's been here for a
little over 200,000 years,

01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:56.750 align:middle line:84%
watching over this experiment
that's been taking place here

01:08:56.750 --> 01:09:00.170 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness,
making sure that,

01:09:00.170 --> 01:09:03.730 align:middle line:84%
to the best of its ability,
nothing goes too crazy.

01:09:03.730 --> 01:09:05.000 align:middle line:90%
