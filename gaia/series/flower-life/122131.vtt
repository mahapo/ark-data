00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.000 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:16.146 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.146 --> 00:00:19.286 align:middle line:84%
>>This next little one, you're
going to have fun with this.

00:00:19.286 --> 00:00:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And in the three areas
that the Atlanteans went,

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.800 align:middle line:84%
which was Egypt and Peru,
Yucatan, and Tibet, that area,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.610 align:middle line:84%
up in there, there
was-- each one

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.820 align:middle line:84%
of these religious
groups that are now

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.820 align:middle line:84%
seemingly different
have a sect to them,

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.390 align:middle line:84%
a separate little area, that is
different than everyone else.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And that is this little
group that are set aside

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.030 align:middle line:90%
are cross-eyed.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.374 align:middle line:90%
They're like this all the time.

00:01:05.374 --> 00:01:07.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if they
were born that way,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.550 align:middle line:84%
but they go around all day
like this all the time.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.934 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
cross-eyed at random.

00:01:14.934 --> 00:01:16.725 align:middle line:84%
This is what we're
beginning to understand.

00:01:16.725 --> 00:01:19.500 align:middle line:90%


00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.520 align:middle line:90%
They were seeing differently.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.110 align:middle line:84%
We look at the
surface of things,

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.580 align:middle line:84%
and they were looking at
a space in front of you

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.990 align:middle line:84%
or in front of whatever
they looked at.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.104 align:middle line:84%
They looked at a particular
place in front of it.

00:01:35.104 --> 00:01:37.020 align:middle line:84%
If they were going to
look at this thing here,

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.145 align:middle line:90%
they wouldn't look at that.

00:01:38.145 --> 00:01:40.600 align:middle line:84%
They would look at a
place here in front,

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.650 align:middle line:84%
and they would see something
different than what

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.060 align:middle line:90%
everyone else would see.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And they were also artists,
and they did a lot of artwork

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.850 align:middle line:84%
on the walls that we didn't even
understand what the heck it was

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.870 align:middle line:90%
until more or less recently.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.480 align:middle line:84%
This artwork would usually be
two somewhat symmetrical things

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.530 align:middle line:84%
that would look
kind of like they

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.360 align:middle line:90%
were turned toward each other.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:15.781 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to look
at this artwork that

00:02:15.781 --> 00:02:17.280 align:middle line:84%
was on-- if you
were to just go look

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.630 align:middle line:84%
at the artwork like a tourist,
you'd look at it, and you'd go,

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.012 align:middle line:90%
what the heck is that?

00:02:22.012 --> 00:02:23.970 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't make a lot
of sense, and you'd just

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.761 align:middle line:84%
walk away from it and
think it was just one

00:02:25.761 --> 00:02:27.826 align:middle line:90%
of those weird things they did.

00:02:27.826 --> 00:02:31.440 align:middle line:84%
But if you were trained,
and you looked at it,

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.876 align:middle line:84%
the object would come
together in this pattern,

00:02:35.876 --> 00:02:42.160 align:middle line:84%
pop out into space three
dimensional, just as real as 3D

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.270 align:middle line:90%
as this room is.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And I mean where you
can put your hand

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.720 align:middle line:90%
behind it, this kind of thing.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.352 align:middle line:84%
It would be a three
dimensional object in space.

00:02:51.352 --> 00:02:55.640 align:middle line:84%
That's still valid
even today in 1993.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.680 align:middle line:90%


00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.030 align:middle line:90%
And it'd still be valid.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.001 align:middle line:90%
You can still do it.

00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:09.480 align:middle line:84%
But no one-- and we just
became aware of this,

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.290 align:middle line:84%
because it actually
started, as I understand it,

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.600 align:middle line:84%
with nurses and doctors who
were looking at x-ray photos.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And they found this technique of
looking at x-ray photos in such

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.010 align:middle line:84%
a way that they could
make the x-ray photo three

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.790 align:middle line:84%
dimensional by looking
at it in this funny way.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.002 align:middle line:84%
And then they could see
into an x-ray photo of 3D

00:03:32.002 --> 00:03:34.460 align:middle line:84%
and see where things were, even
though it was a flat photo.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And later, this became known
as a ster-- and from that,

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.590 align:middle line:84%
they were able to turn it into
something called stereogram,

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.930 align:middle line:84%
and there's other
names for this,

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.610 align:middle line:84%
but that's kind of
the one that stuck.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And so there is what I call
stereogrammic vision that

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.800 align:middle line:90%
is possible.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.410 align:middle line:84%
It's a different way
that human beings

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.450 align:middle line:90%
can see than they normally see.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.950 align:middle line:90%


00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.194 align:middle line:90%
Holograms-- these are holograms.

00:04:07.194 --> 00:04:08.815 align:middle line:90%
Can you see these things?

00:04:08.815 --> 00:04:10.150 align:middle line:90%
I can aim one at one body.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.320 align:middle line:90%
Like she can see it now.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.120 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.290 align:middle line:90%
Like little mirrors.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.178 align:middle line:90%
You can see it now.

00:04:16.178 --> 00:04:18.350 align:middle line:90%
Can you see that?

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.991 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:20.991 --> 00:04:22.106 align:middle line:90%


00:04:22.106 --> 00:04:25.792 align:middle line:90%
I can blind people.

00:04:25.792 --> 00:04:29.610 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, these are
ones we made up.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.880 align:middle line:84%
If you get them in the light,
they're really beautiful.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.350 align:middle line:84%
Our lady of Guadalupe--
but this is a hologram.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:41.394 align:middle line:84%
When you do look at a hologram,
it does do one of the things

00:04:41.394 --> 00:04:42.810 align:middle line:84%
that we're wanting
to do, which is

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.525 align:middle line:84%
it turns both sides of your
brain on simultaneously.

00:04:45.525 --> 00:04:47.650 align:middle line:84%
You can't see a hologram,
unless you can flip

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.356 align:middle line:90%
both sides on at the same time.

00:04:49.356 --> 00:04:52.330 align:middle line:90%


00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.920 align:middle line:84%
But there's another way,
there's another form

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.490 align:middle line:84%
of three dimensional art--
the stereogram, which

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:08.590 align:middle line:84%
is based on a slightly different
principle that will also turn

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.031 align:middle line:90%
both sides of the brain on.

00:05:11.031 --> 00:05:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And so this is one
of the reasons why

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.880 align:middle line:84%
I want to do this
is that it gives you

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.885 align:middle line:84%
the experience of having
both sides of your brain on,

00:05:18.885 --> 00:05:24.610 align:middle line:84%
which is something that
we don't get too much.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.680 align:middle line:84%
When you're listening
to music with words,

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.664 align:middle line:84%
you've got both sides
of your brain on.

00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:33.468 align:middle line:84%
If you hear someone
singing, it's

00:05:33.468 --> 00:05:38.280 align:middle line:84%
got to be with the rhythm
of the music and singing.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.130 align:middle line:90%
That does it.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.050 align:middle line:90%
But this is unique.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.800 align:middle line:84%
stereogram is unique, because
there's an area of your brain.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.144 align:middle line:84%
It's called area
39, I think it is.

00:05:49.144 --> 00:05:50.790 align:middle line:90%
I believe it's 39.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.032 align:middle line:90%
It's behind your right eye.

00:05:53.032 --> 00:05:53.855 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's 37.

00:05:53.855 --> 00:05:57.170 align:middle line:90%
I think it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.680 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, it's one of those.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.730 align:middle line:90%
And it's back here.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.930 align:middle line:84%
It's a little tiny
area back there,

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.391 align:middle line:84%
which is where your
imagination takes place.

00:06:07.391 --> 00:06:10.850 align:middle line:84%
And so you're going to look at
something here in a little bit.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:11.675 align:middle line:90%
It looks like this.

00:06:11.675 --> 00:06:13.120 align:middle line:90%
This looks like nothing, right?

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.174 align:middle line:84%
This looks like a bunch
of dots on a page,

00:06:15.174 --> 00:06:19.180 align:middle line:84%
but it isn't, because
there's actually something

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.670 align:middle line:90%
out here in space.

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.560 align:middle line:84%
There's some words out here
that you can't see right now,

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.950 align:middle line:84%
but you can imagine
them to be there.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.606 align:middle line:84%
When your imagination takes
over in a certain way, when

00:06:32.606 --> 00:06:34.230 align:middle line:84%
you learn how to see
stereogrammically,

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.180 align:middle line:90%
your imagination takes over.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:41.230 align:middle line:84%
This area 39 gets stimulated,
and bingo-- these words

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.820 align:middle line:84%
will pop off into space
out in front of you,

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.720 align:middle line:84%
and you'll start seeing
stereogrammically.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.850 align:middle line:90%


00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.600 align:middle line:84%
There's another reason--
the other thing that happens

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.450 align:middle line:84%
is the corpus callosum
links together somehow,

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:59.810 align:middle line:84%
and the pituitary
gland gets stimulated,

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.500 align:middle line:84%
and this chemical that
was in-- you go into theta

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.700 align:middle line:90%
is the other thing very quickly.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And this chemical starts
being emitted from here

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:12.680 align:middle line:84%
very slowly, same one that
was in the King's Chamber.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And at first, it feels-- you
can't believe the feeling

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.040 align:middle line:90%
if you haven't felt it before.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And then it starts feeling
really, really good.

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:24.660 align:middle line:84%
If you stay in it
a real long time,

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.800 align:middle line:90%
you don't want to get back out.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.600 align:middle line:84%
When we first started
experiment with this,

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.566 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't want
to get out of it.

00:07:32.566 --> 00:07:36.985 align:middle line:90%


00:07:36.985 --> 00:07:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And I have to make a little
kind of a disclaimer.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.660 align:middle line:90%
No, that's not a good word.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.330 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it is.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.470 align:middle line:84%
So far, I've never had a class
where every single person could

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:50.830 align:middle line:90%
do it.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:54.000 align:middle line:84%
If you have a
difference in your eyes,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.330 align:middle line:84%
where one eye is near-sighted
and one eye is far-sighted,

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:02.135 align:middle line:84%
for example, you may
not be able to do this.

00:08:02.135 --> 00:08:06.190 align:middle line:84%
If you have too much
astigmatism in one eye,

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:07.870 align:middle line:84%
and it's not balanced
in the other,

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.650 align:middle line:84%
if there's too much
differences between your eyes,

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:13.620 align:middle line:90%
you may not be able to do this.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:14.620 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:15.420 align:middle line:90%
>>What?

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:16.852 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:08:16.852 --> 00:08:18.310 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, you can do
it with glasses,

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.480 align:middle line:90%
and you can do it with contacts.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.180 align:middle line:84%
The way you want to
learn how to do this

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.470 align:middle line:90%
is whatever way you read.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:26.730 align:middle line:84%
However you read, if you
take your glasses off to read

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:29.202 align:middle line:84%
or you put different ones
on to read or whatever,

00:08:29.202 --> 00:08:31.040 align:middle line:84%
be prepared to read for
this, because you're

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.039 align:middle line:84%
going to have this up
close like you're reading.

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:38.010 align:middle line:90%


00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:40.700 align:middle line:84%
So there may be
some of you in here

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.044 align:middle line:90%
that won't be able to do this.

00:08:42.044 --> 00:08:45.310 align:middle line:90%
If you can't do it, it's OK.

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:51.198 align:middle line:84%
You didn't flunk, and
it's just the way it goes.

00:08:51.198 --> 00:08:52.614 align:middle line:90%
It's all right.

00:08:52.614 --> 00:08:55.918 align:middle line:84%
I want to get as many as
I can of this if I can,

00:08:55.918 --> 00:09:02.280 align:middle line:84%
but really, it doesn't mean
a thing if you can't get it.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.755 align:middle line:84%
There is another reason why I
want to get-- there's about one

00:09:05.755 --> 00:09:11.270 align:middle line:84%
out of every 200 or 300 people
that this will have a greater

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:16.765 align:middle line:84%
meaning to than what I
can truly express to you,

00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:21.174 align:middle line:84%
because in the priesthood,
there was only a very, very few

00:09:21.174 --> 00:09:23.580 align:middle line:84%
who were able to understand
what this really meant.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And they were able
to look into a room

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:28.808 align:middle line:90%
and see stereogrammically.

00:09:28.808 --> 00:09:32.685 align:middle line:84%
And they could see something
different in the room.

00:09:32.685 --> 00:09:37.580 align:middle line:84%
But even if only get one
out of every 200 or 300

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.810 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it
is, it's worth it.

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:43.860 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless, we'll
just do the best we can.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.712 align:middle line:90%
So if you don't get it, it's OK.

00:09:45.712 --> 00:09:52.698 align:middle line:84%
Really, I mean
don't cry or poison.

00:09:52.698 --> 00:09:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And also, usually I
only get about 60%

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:00.915 align:middle line:84%
of the room,
something like that.

00:10:00.915 --> 00:10:04.180 align:middle line:84%
What I've also found
is about 1/2 to 2/3

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:08.490 align:middle line:84%
of the people who don't get
it here, when they go home,

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:12.520 align:middle line:84%
and they're relaxed--
because this has a lot

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.090 align:middle line:90%
to do with being able to relax.

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:17.020 align:middle line:90%


00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:18.100 align:middle line:90%
It's like meditation.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:22.670 align:middle line:84%
You can't go into a meditation
and say, I'm going to meditate.

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:27.280 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain
relaxation you've got to do,

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.236 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of times, when
people are trying to do this,

00:10:30.236 --> 00:10:31.860 align:middle line:84%
they start getting
more and more tense,

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:32.730 align:middle line:90%
because they're not doing it.

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:34.563 align:middle line:84%
And so they start getting
tenser and tenser,

00:10:34.563 --> 00:10:37.450 align:middle line:90%
and that makes it harder.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of times when you
go home, and no one's around,

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.880 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have to
prove anything to anybody,

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.022 align:middle line:84%
you can relax,
and you'll see it.

00:10:46.022 --> 00:10:47.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give
you one of these.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.750 align:middle line:84%
It'll be in the booklet
that's handed out,

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:52.980 align:middle line:84%
so you can take
it home with you.

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And I also have this one that
we're going to hand out to you,

00:10:57.830 --> 00:10:59.420 align:middle line:84%
and then after
that one, I'm going

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.270 align:middle line:90%
to go through the whole thing.

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:03.050 align:middle line:90%
This is one that Mackie made up.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:07.360 align:middle line:84%
It's based on a very
sophisticated arrangement

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.690 align:middle line:84%
of colors relative
to the human brain.

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:12.610 align:middle line:84%
They're not just at
a random on there.

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:16.400 align:middle line:84%
There's a very special
pattern that's on here.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And this one, if you
can't do this one,

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.450 align:middle line:84%
then you might be
able to do this one.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:26.810 align:middle line:90%
This one's easier.

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:28.419 align:middle line:84%
So we'll try the
harder one first,

00:11:28.419 --> 00:11:30.210 align:middle line:84%
and for those of you
who can't do this one,

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:32.080 align:middle line:90%
we'll try this one.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And then I've got
since then, people

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.410 align:middle line:84%
have been getting
more and more excited

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:45.900 align:middle line:84%
about this, because what it's
doing to this area of the brain

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:51.830 align:middle line:84%
up here, which is your
imagination part of the brain.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:55.855 align:middle line:84%
When they did an
autopsy on Einstein,

00:11:55.855 --> 00:12:00.331 align:middle line:84%
they took this area of his brain
out, and he had a huge one.

00:12:00.331 --> 00:12:02.650 align:middle line:84%
And by doing this
meditation for about five

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:05.100 align:middle line:84%
or 10 minutes every day,
you're stimulating that area,

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.830 align:middle line:84%
and you'll increase--
it's like doing exercises.

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:13.389 align:middle line:84%
And it really helps in
psychic work and all kinds

00:12:13.389 --> 00:12:14.430 align:middle line:90%
of these kinds of things.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:17.104 align:middle line:90%


00:12:17.104 --> 00:12:20.380 align:middle line:84%
This just looks like a bunch
of dots, but what you see

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.970 align:middle line:90%
is not always what you get.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And just to be an
example of that,

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.520 align:middle line:84%
you see all these
spirals going in here?

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.992 align:middle line:90%
Anybody see that?

00:12:28.992 --> 00:12:31.230 align:middle line:90%
No, you don't.

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:34.678 align:middle line:84%
There's no spirals
there at all, not any.

00:12:34.678 --> 00:12:36.400 align:middle line:90%
Not a one.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.510 align:middle line:84%
What's there is
concentric circles.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And I can prove it to you by
putting this on this one right

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:45.940 align:middle line:84%
here, and I will
move very slowly.

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:48.965 align:middle line:90%
I won't get off of it.

00:12:48.965 --> 00:12:51.215 align:middle line:84%
I won't leave it, and
I won't trick you.

00:12:51.215 --> 00:12:53.090 align:middle line:84%
I'll come right back,
and it comes right back

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:54.270 align:middle line:90%
to the same place.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:55.540 align:middle line:90%
It's a circle.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:56.400 align:middle line:90%
Come up one more.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:02.412 align:middle line:90%


00:13:02.412 --> 00:13:04.980 align:middle line:84%
It comes right back
to the same place.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:05.780 align:middle line:90%
It's a circle.

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.140 align:middle line:84%
They're all just
concentric circles.

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:13.621 align:middle line:84%
It's the background that makes
you think that it's spirals.

00:13:13.621 --> 00:13:15.900 align:middle line:90%
Your eyes just do this thing.

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:17.090 align:middle line:90%
Same way up here.

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:20.090 align:middle line:84%
You see these little
bowed out lines

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:21.380 align:middle line:90%
that kind of go like that?

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:22.380 align:middle line:90%
Does everybody see that?

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:23.940 align:middle line:90%
They're straight as an arrow.

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:28.940 align:middle line:90%


00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:32.002 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I can--
how can I do this?

00:13:32.002 --> 00:13:46.205 align:middle line:90%


00:13:46.205 --> 00:13:49.758 align:middle line:84%
Can you see how that runs right
along the edge of the page?

00:13:49.758 --> 00:13:50.700 align:middle line:90%
They come over here?

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:54.766 align:middle line:90%


00:13:54.766 --> 00:13:55.890 align:middle line:90%
Straight as an arrow lines.

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:59.098 align:middle line:84%
It's the background that
makes it look like that.

00:13:59.098 --> 00:14:01.850 align:middle line:90%


00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:06.400 align:middle line:84%
So this is the one
we're now going

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.920 align:middle line:84%
to look at, preferably
with somewhat

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:14.240 align:middle line:84%
of a sharp point or a
pen with a point on it.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.862 align:middle line:90%


00:14:16.862 --> 00:14:18.370 align:middle line:90%
Does everybody have a pen?

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:21.775 align:middle line:90%


00:14:21.775 --> 00:14:22.575 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:22.575 --> 00:14:24.740 align:middle line:84%
You see these two--
you want to arrange

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:27.128 align:middle line:84%
the page so it's like this,
and you see these two dots

00:14:27.128 --> 00:14:27.928 align:middle line:90%
right here?

00:14:27.928 --> 00:14:30.800 align:middle line:90%


00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.430 align:middle line:84%
Arrange the page so the dots are
in that position on the page.

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:36.670 align:middle line:90%
Don't look at the little one.

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.120 align:middle line:84%
If you've got the-- let
me see this just a second.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.952 align:middle line:90%
This big one has a backside.

00:14:40.952 --> 00:14:42.160 align:middle line:90%
Some of them have a backside.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.130 align:middle line:90%
Don't look at that.

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:44.420 align:middle line:90%
Look at this big one.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.292 align:middle line:90%
It's much easier.

00:14:45.292 --> 00:14:48.190 align:middle line:90%


00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Now you want to get the
page at the distance

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:53.730 align:middle line:84%
that you would normally
read something.

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:58.450 align:middle line:84%
So if you read a book like
that, then put it out there.

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:01.450 align:middle line:84%
However you read, put it
approximately where you read.

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:04.150 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is
trying to get it flat--

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:06.800 align:middle line:84%
don't have it curving or
bending or anything like that.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:07.680 align:middle line:90%
It'll make it harder.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.070 align:middle line:90%
Not that it's impossible.

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:11.040 align:middle line:90%
It's just harder.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:16.090 align:middle line:84%
The second thing
is put on whatever

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:18.440 align:middle line:84%
glasses you use to read,
or take them off whatever

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.000 align:middle line:90%
you're trying to do.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.546 align:middle line:84%
Now the next thing is you've
got a pencil or a pen.

00:15:25.546 --> 00:15:26.980 align:middle line:90%
Everybody have one?

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:27.780 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:31.520 align:middle line:84%
Take the pointed
part up like this,

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:36.250 align:middle line:84%
and if this was the-- you can
look at me here like this now.

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Here's the thing
I've got holding on.

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:44.610 align:middle line:84%
You want to put the pen
approximately at the phi ratio.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:45.590 align:middle line:90%
You don't want it here.

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:47.190 align:middle line:90%
You don't want it down here.

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:52.580 align:middle line:84%
Approximately this far
away from the page.

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:53.770 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And then while you've
got it held there,

00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:59.330 align:middle line:84%
put the point so the
point is approximately

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:05.250 align:middle line:84%
in the middle between these
two dots only out here.

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:07.860 align:middle line:84%
Just the tip of it, so it's
lined up approximately even

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:08.700 align:middle line:90%
with those two dots.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:13.370 align:middle line:90%
Now look at the two dots.

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:14.650 align:middle line:90%
Look at the page.

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:17.552 align:middle line:90%
Don't look at the pencil.

00:16:17.552 --> 00:16:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to notice
that your eyes, while you're

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:25.530 align:middle line:84%
looking at the two dots,
you should see two pencils.

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:26.940 align:middle line:90%
Does everybody see that?

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:27.820 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.445 align:middle line:84%
>>Does anybody not
see the two pencils?

00:16:29.445 --> 00:16:31.880 align:middle line:90%


00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.687 align:middle line:84%
Do you know what I
mean by-- it's OK.

00:16:33.687 --> 00:16:34.520 align:middle line:90%
Do you not see them?

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:35.504 align:middle line:90%
You see them?

00:16:35.504 --> 00:16:36.304 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:36.304 --> 00:16:37.740 align:middle line:90%
You see two pencils, right?

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:38.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:44.770 align:middle line:84%
Now take the two pencils-- move
your pencil while you're still

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:46.430 align:middle line:90%
looking at the page.

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:49.370 align:middle line:84%

the tip of the two

pencils, the point
of the pencil lines

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.425 align:middle line:90%

OK?

00:17:11.432 --> 00:17:14.359 align:middle line:84%
Now once you get
the pencil lined up,

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:17.140 align:middle line:84%
so those two dots are there,
hold your pencil carefully.

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:21.190 align:middle line:84%
Don't move it away or anything,
because that's the focal point.

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:26.450 align:middle line:84%
Now switch your vision from the
paper to the tip of the pencil.

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:30.847 align:middle line:84%
In other words, look at
the tip of the pencil.

00:17:30.847 --> 00:17:32.930 align:middle line:84%
Now that you've switched
to the tip of the pencil,

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:36.090 align:middle line:84%
you should see three
dots below you.

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:38.975 align:middle line:90%
Does everybody see that?

00:17:38.975 --> 00:17:40.412 align:middle line:90%
No.

not focusing properly.

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:47.280 align:middle line:90%

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:51.030 align:middle line:84%
Get the pencils
lined up properly.

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:51.830 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:54.156 align:middle line:84%
So has everybody
got the three dots?

00:17:54.156 --> 00:17:56.020 align:middle line:90%

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:58.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm going to go-- people
who haven't got the three dots,

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:00.906 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go on with
the rest of the group,

00:18:00.906 --> 00:18:02.944 align:middle line:84%
and then I'll come back
to you and work on it.

00:18:02.944 --> 00:18:04.568 align:middle line:84%
If you can't get the
three dots, you're

00:18:04.568 --> 00:18:05.984 align:middle line:84%
going to have to
start over again.

00:18:05.984 --> 00:18:10.120 align:middle line:84%

have three dots, just relax,

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:14.696 align:middle line:84%

For those of you who
have the three dots,

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:30.140 align:middle line:84%
just relax, and you're going
to see the letter T coming off

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:32.050 align:middle line:90%
the tip of your pencil in space.

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:35.780 align:middle line:90%
It's going to come like this.

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:38.670 align:middle line:90%
Here's your pencil.

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:42.220 align:middle line:84%
You're going to see
three dots like this,

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:46.820 align:middle line:84%
and then in space, right
where your pencil is in space,

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:53.010 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see the letter
T kind of stenciled out.

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And then if you notice
over here-- actually,

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:56.520 align:middle line:84%
I have to look at
this real quickly.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.390 align:middle line:90%

OK.

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:12.426 align:middle line:84%
It's an H that looks like
this, and then you're

00:19:12.426 --> 00:19:14.910 align:middle line:90%
going to see the word "the."

the T looks like either.

going to see the word "the."

going to see the word,

the three dots, you

can also remove the
pencil, because you just

how you stop your breathing

He would train you so that you
wouldn't stop your breathing.

00:23:25.659 --> 00:23:27.950 align:middle line:84%
That was the whole key, which
when you start a learning

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:30.209 align:middle line:84%
process or anything, you
kept your breathing going

if you can do that,

you can learn at a
much faster rate.

I watched this with my eyes,

where you're jumping
on this trampoline.

up here like this,

are different colors,

And you're on top of
this trampoline looking

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:51.166 align:middle line:84%
at this thing, and
you start jumping.

00:24:51.166 --> 00:24:52.790 align:middle line:84%

you can completely

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to start
moving your hands like this

00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:59.690 align:middle line:84%
so that you're-- you've got to
get your physical body going.

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:02.210 align:middle line:84%
So you're jumping up and down,
and you're moving your hands

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:03.640 align:middle line:84%
to the jump so that
every time you come down,

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:04.681 align:middle line:90%
your hands are like this.

00:25:04.681 --> 00:25:06.600 align:middle line:84%
You've got to get
a rhythm going.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And then he tells
you just to read--

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:10.770 align:middle line:84%
tell you to say the direction
the arrows are going.

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:13.480 align:middle line:84%
So every time you come
down, you have to respond.

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:14.495 align:middle line:90%
You can't wait.

00:25:14.495 --> 00:25:20.650 align:middle line:84%
So you go up, right, down,
left, up, up, left, up, up,

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:22.130 align:middle line:90%
right like that.

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And then after you go
through the whole thing,

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:29.500 align:middle line:84%
he says, OK, now say which one
is up, but on every other one,

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:30.671 align:middle line:90%
say the color.

00:25:30.671 --> 00:25:36.290 align:middle line:84%
So you'd go up, blue, red,
green, up, up, black, up, red,

00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:37.736 align:middle line:90%
green like that.

00:25:37.736 --> 00:25:38.890 align:middle line:90%
You do that one.

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:41.470 align:middle line:84%
Then he'd say, OK,
now ever other one,

00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:42.890 align:middle line:90%
you-- he'd keep adding to it.

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:46.180 align:middle line:84%
Say, OK, now you keep saying
the color, the one color,

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:50.212 align:middle line:84%
but every third one, rotate it a
quarter turn, and say that one.

00:25:50.212 --> 00:25:53.340 align:middle line:90%
You go, oh, OK.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:56.342 align:middle line:84%
And you do that, and
it just comes out.

00:25:56.342 --> 00:25:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And you're jumping and
doing this whole thing.

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And then he just keeps making
it more and more and more

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.890 align:middle line:84%
and more complex, and
some of the complexities,

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:05.990 align:middle line:90%
you can't believe it.

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And the person's remembering his
breathing and doing his thing,

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:12.360 align:middle line:84%
and it just keeps getting
more and more complex.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:16.620 align:middle line:84%
He had one, where finally,
he hits you with this poem.

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:18.880 align:middle line:84%
It's "Mary Had a Little
Lamb," something like this.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And he has you doing this thing
with this poem, where you're

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.690 align:middle line:84%
saying different words, and
you're putting words in here,

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:24.750 align:middle line:84%
and you're moving
the words around,

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:26.083 align:middle line:90%
and you're doing all this stuff.

00:26:26.083 --> 00:26:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's so complex,
I don't think

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:30.420 align:middle line:84%
anybody can even remember it
long enough to even write down

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:31.645 align:middle line:90%
what all the stuff was.

00:26:31.645 --> 00:26:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And I watched this one guy,
and this guy was going,

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:34.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing it.

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:37.170 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe I'm
doing this [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:38.010 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:41.856 align:middle line:84%
And he did this entire thing,
this whole complex thing.

00:26:41.856 --> 00:26:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And he says, OK,
you're doing it.

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:43.700 align:middle line:90%
You got it.

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.366 align:middle line:84%
Now turn around, and
look the other way,

00:26:45.366 --> 00:26:47.740 align:middle line:90%
and repeat it backwards.

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:49.200 align:middle line:90%
He says, don't think.

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.000 align:middle line:90%
Just do it.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.150 align:middle line:90%
He says, OK.

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:52.437 align:middle line:90%
And he did it.

00:26:52.437 --> 00:26:54.520 align:middle line:84%
He repeated something that
took about five minutes

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.400 align:middle line:90%
of super complex stuff.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:00.050 align:middle line:90%
He repeated it backwards.

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:02.500 align:middle line:84%
He just walked off
the thing going.

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:03.790 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:05.602 align:middle line:90%
Did I do that?

00:27:05.602 --> 00:27:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And he had everybody in
the room doing this stuff.

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:11.372 align:middle line:90%
It was really amazing.

00:27:11.372 --> 00:27:13.564 align:middle line:84%
And so the same--
just one second.

00:27:13.564 --> 00:27:17.220 align:middle line:84%
He says when you're doing any
sports or skiing or anything

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.902 align:middle line:84%
else like this, a
lot of is you've

00:27:19.902 --> 00:27:21.360 align:middle line:84%
got to get the mind
out of the way,

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.725 align:middle line:90%
so the limitations are gone.

00:27:22.725 --> 00:27:26.815 align:middle line:84%
And you can't-- immediately, if
someone was just to be thrown

00:27:26.815 --> 00:27:28.565 align:middle line:84%
up here and say, do
that, you'd say, well,

00:27:28.565 --> 00:27:31.148 align:middle line:84%
I can't-- if you gave them the
whole thing, they'd said, well,

00:27:31.148 --> 00:27:32.736 align:middle line:90%
I can't do that.

00:27:32.736 --> 00:27:36.110 align:middle line:90%
And then you can't do that.

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:38.020 align:middle line:84%
But he would just
get you so the place

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:41.120 align:middle line:84%
that where you just
could do it, and you can.

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.850 align:middle line:84%
So when he would train
the Olympic teams,

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:44.980 align:middle line:84%
he'd get them--
the eye movements.

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.920 align:middle line:84%
He's an ophthalmologist,
and he has

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:49.370 align:middle line:90%
a PhD enlightened in some way.

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:51.543 align:middle line:90%
He works with Martin Lillywhite.

00:27:51.543 --> 00:27:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And the eye movements are
real important, your eyes

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:58.960 align:middle line:84%
and how you work with
them and your breathing.

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.460 align:middle line:90%
And he's pretty good.

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:03.720 align:middle line:84%
He's really good, and he gives
workshops on all of this stuff.

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:04.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:07.155 align:middle line:90%


00:28:07.155 --> 00:28:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Those Gurdjieffian movements
are-- the sacred dances

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.560 align:middle line:90%
are really extraordinary.

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:17.064 align:middle line:84%
Has anybody ever
seen this take place?

00:28:17.064 --> 00:28:20.235 align:middle line:84%
There's a movie called
"Meetings with Remarkable Men."

00:28:20.235 --> 00:28:22.216 align:middle line:84%
Has anybody ever
seen that movie?

00:28:22.216 --> 00:28:24.610 align:middle line:90%
Just a few?

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:28.080 align:middle line:84%
I really recommend
you try to dig it up.

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.780 align:middle line:84%
It only came out
for a little while,

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:32.012 align:middle line:84%
and it was too esoteric
for most people,

00:28:32.012 --> 00:28:34.912 align:middle line:84%
and it never made very much
money or anything like that.

00:28:34.912 --> 00:28:38.198 align:middle line:84%
But the movie is
very, very, very good,

00:28:38.198 --> 00:28:44.893 align:middle line:84%
and you'll see a side of Sufism
that's pretty remarkable.

00:28:44.893 --> 00:28:46.892 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:28:46.892 --> 00:28:49.350 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, it is on video, and
you can get it in video stores,

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:51.960 align:middle line:84%
but you'd have to go
to a big one, because--

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:52.760 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:58.620 align:middle line:90%


00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>>If you notice,
for you, who knows,

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:02.834 align:middle line:84%
that they never show
the enneagram on there.

00:29:02.834 --> 00:29:05.110 align:middle line:84%
They show the wings
of the enneagram,

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:10.820 align:middle line:84%
and they secretly put three
men sitting at the points

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:13.560 align:middle line:90%
to complete the enneagram.

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.430 align:middle line:84%
They never actually--
never at any time

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:18.730 align:middle line:84%
did they ever actually show the
enneagram on that [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:22.084 align:middle line:84%
But they did this one dance,
where they-- but again, it

00:29:22.084 --> 00:29:23.750 align:middle line:84%
was just three people
that were actually

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:26.500 align:middle line:90%
completing the pattern.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.712 align:middle line:90%


00:29:29.712 --> 00:29:30.512 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:29:30.512 --> 00:29:32.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, the whole thing
is a meditation,

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:36.765 align:middle line:90%
and it puts you into a state.

00:29:36.765 --> 00:29:39.010 align:middle line:84%
This is what I would call
an open-eyed meditation.

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:41.130 align:middle line:84%
It's where you're not
going out, but you're

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:43.960 align:middle line:90%
being here to make movement.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.767 align:middle line:90%
