[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.964 --> 00:00:16.320 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>>We have two last areas to
cover that I can think of.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And the first one has
to do with healing.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.160 align:middle line:84%
And the last one has to do
with the actual transition

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.180 align:middle line:84%
across to the other dimensional
levels and some aspects

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.281 align:middle line:84%
that you need to
know about that.

00:00:36.281 --> 00:00:37.780 align:middle line:84%
There are some very
important things

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.544 align:middle line:84%
you need to know about
that transition over

00:00:40.544 --> 00:00:41.960 align:middle line:84%
into the other
dimensional levels.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.556 align:middle line:90%


00:00:44.556 --> 00:00:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And we've got about
an hour-and-a-half.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.540 align:middle line:90%
So we're going to go for it.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.530 align:middle line:90%
That should do it.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.620 align:middle line:90%


00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.066 align:middle line:84%
OK, the first
subject of healing.

00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:58.350 align:middle line:90%


00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.110 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned already
what my feelings were

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:08.100 align:middle line:84%
as far as technique goes,
that we use technique,

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.770 align:middle line:84%
I think, more as a
vehicle of communication

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.500 align:middle line:84%
between each other
to communicate,

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:23.310 align:middle line:84%
but that the healing
has to do with love,

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.145 align:middle line:84%
and that if you're
healing yourself

00:01:27.145 --> 00:01:31.220 align:middle line:84%
that it's a matter of
being centered and being

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.020 align:middle line:90%
in love with yourself.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you are to
assist in someone else

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.720 align:middle line:84%
healing themselves,
that it's love

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.250 align:middle line:84%
that you're giving
to that person

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.020 align:middle line:84%
that they're feeling
that's allowing

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.090 align:middle line:90%
them to heal themselves.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And any technique that we use
is really secondary and of very

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.800 align:middle line:84%
little importance
other than that.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.310 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing I'm
saying about the workshop.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.840 align:middle line:84%
You can talk about
technique, which

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.300 align:middle line:84%
is the Merkaba, which is perhaps
important for what we're doing.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.729 align:middle line:84%
But the Merkaba won't
work without the love.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's a similar kind
of thing with my healing.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.736 align:middle line:84%
These are my
concepts on healing.

00:02:12.736 --> 00:02:13.535 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:02:13.535 --> 00:02:15.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying this
is the end final word

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.560 align:middle line:90%
on healing in the universe.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm just giving you
my ideas that I've

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.470 align:middle line:90%
learned over a long time.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.006 align:middle line:84%
So with that in mind, I'll tell
you how it all started for me.

00:02:27.006 --> 00:02:30.590 align:middle line:90%


00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:37.960 align:middle line:84%
Way, way back, 20-something
years ago, my wife and I,

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.870 align:middle line:84%
before the angels had
come in or anything else,

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.250 align:middle line:84%
we were trying to
understand ourselves

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.740 align:middle line:84%
and what the whole
thing was all about.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And we were using the technique
of hypnosis to do this with.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And we were learning
a lot of things.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my wife was
learning how to lift--

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.525 align:middle line:84%
we were lifting
out of our bodies

00:02:56.525 --> 00:02:58.950 align:middle line:84%
and flying around the rooms
and having a good old time

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.908 align:middle line:84%
and thinking, this is
the most incredible thing

00:03:00.908 --> 00:03:02.190 align:middle line:90%
we'd ever learned.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, we found out she
could go down to the library

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.720 align:middle line:84%
and go in and read
books and come back,

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.100 align:middle line:84%
and those kinds of things,
astral protection type stuff.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And we started
learning about some

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.480 align:middle line:84%
of the other dimensional
levels by actually

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.210 align:middle line:84%
going there and looking
around, this kind of thing.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:30.320 align:middle line:84%
One day, I left a pan, a cast
iron pan, sitting on the stove.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.320 align:middle line:90%
I didn't leave it there.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.092 align:middle line:90%
I purposely put it there.

00:03:33.092 --> 00:03:35.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've ever
cooked in cast iron pans.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.716 align:middle line:84%
Not too many people
do these days.

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:37.960 align:middle line:90%
But I do.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And you are dry them off so they
don't rust by heating them up.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.607 align:middle line:90%
And the thing is, I did it.

00:03:44.607 --> 00:03:45.690 align:middle line:90%
And I forgot it was there.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.150 align:middle line:90%
And I went outside.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And it probably went through the
smoking one and everything else

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.120 align:middle line:84%
like that, because it was like
an hour later I came back.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, I was over
at one end of the room.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And my wife came in and
went over and just picked up

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.860 align:middle line:84%
this pan, which was orange, and
picked it up in her left hand,

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.420 align:middle line:84%
and moved it about
that far before she

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.160 align:middle line:84%
realized, that it
registered that the pan was

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.090 align:middle line:90%
melting your hand.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.440 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.355 align:middle line:90%
She just, ah!

00:04:15.355 --> 00:04:16.222 align:middle line:90%
Dropped this thing.

00:04:16.222 --> 00:04:17.180 align:middle line:90%
And I went over to her.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.310 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at her hand.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And it was just rapidly
going through-- I mean,

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.100 align:middle line:84%
she had really done something
pretty intense to her hand.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.440 align:middle line:90%
And I remember sitting there.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.410 align:middle line:90%
At first, I felt helpless.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And then, I remembered this
connection, this new opening

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.130 align:middle line:90%
that we'd had with hypnosis.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And this was all taking place in
about 30 seconds or something.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting there
going-- like that. .

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.740 align:middle line:90%
And just something took over.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.020 align:middle line:90%
And I just knew.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.534 align:middle line:84%
And I put her into a
trance, which we had already

00:04:53.534 --> 00:04:54.450 align:middle line:90%
worked that stuff out.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:55.740 align:middle line:90%
So it was just like that.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.950 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have to
go through a lot.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And I just told her-- though
I don't know if I really

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.710 align:middle line:84%
believed it at the
moment because I

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:04.930 align:middle line:90%
don't think I really did.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.960 align:middle line:84%
But the words that came
out of my mouth to her

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.550 align:middle line:84%
were, your hand
is healing itself.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to go right
back to normal right now.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.350 align:middle line:90%
And she had her eyes closed.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.440 align:middle line:90%
So she didn't even see this.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting
here looking at it.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And I watched her
hand, before my eyes,

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:29.060 align:middle line:84%
go back to normal in about
maybe a minute or less,

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:35.250 align:middle line:84%
just totally back to normal like
nothing had happened at all.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And I was changed
forever in that moment.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.490 align:middle line:84%
I suddenly got
something very deep

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.430 align:middle line:84%
that the body is just
light and that there's

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.220 align:middle line:84%
some kind of connection
between what you think

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.930 align:middle line:90%
and what you feel.

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And I experimented on that
with her a whole lot later.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And time and time
and time again,

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.690 align:middle line:84%
I was verified that
it was really true,

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.570 align:middle line:84%
that when the mind
believes something,

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:09.350 align:middle line:84%
the reality followed right
behind, when the mind really

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.150 align:middle line:90%
believed it.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And in hypnosis, you can get
into really believing things

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.910 align:middle line:90%
at a very deep level.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.330 align:middle line:90%
And it was amazing.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:19.418 align:middle line:90%
It really worked.

00:06:19.418 --> 00:06:29.820 align:middle line:90%


00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:36.870 align:middle line:84%
There was another time when
my little daughter-- her name

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.794 align:middle line:90%
was Ilya Eisha.

00:06:38.794 --> 00:06:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And she fell 14 feet
onto a concrete slab

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.411 align:middle line:90%
and cracked her head open.

00:06:45.411 --> 00:06:49.870 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you what that feels
like from the adult point, let

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.050 align:middle line:90%
alone the baby point.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:58.448 align:middle line:84%
And I had a store
called Material Plane.

00:06:58.448 --> 00:07:00.940 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.447 align:middle line:84%
And when this happened, my wife
went running up to the store.

00:07:04.447 --> 00:07:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And I just kicked
everybody out of the store

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.250 align:middle line:84%
and closed the door and
went into one of the rooms

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.110 align:middle line:84%
and sat down and focused and
started doing the breathing.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.340 align:middle line:84%
By now, I knew how
to do the Merkaba.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.010 align:middle line:90%
And I got into it.

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.390 align:middle line:90%
And I started breathing.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And I just visualized
the little baby there.

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And I had talked on the
phone with the babysitter

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:26.030 align:middle line:90%
who had seen it.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.580 align:middle line:90%
And it was a big crack.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And there was blood
and the whole thing.

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And I just kept visualizing
that it was healing.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:36.560 align:middle line:90%
It was healing.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.810 align:middle line:84%
That was my technique
to myself at that time.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:42.350 align:middle line:84%
I just saw it going back to
normal in the same kind of way

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:46.130 align:middle line:84%
that I saw that hand
go back to normal.

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:50.610 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, my wife
met the babysitter down

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:54.140 align:middle line:90%
at the hospital.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:57.662 align:middle line:90%


00:07:57.662 --> 00:07:58.916 align:middle line:90%
I'll try it anyway.

00:07:58.916 --> 00:08:07.550 align:middle line:90%


00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And the baby was on a
table when she got there.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor was sitting there
and had been looking to it.

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:15.910 align:middle line:90%
And there was blood all over.

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:17.372 align:middle line:90%
And it was starting to swell.

00:08:17.372 --> 00:08:20.722 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
very definite crack.

00:08:20.722 --> 00:08:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And I believe the baby was
probably unconscious also.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:32.096 align:middle line:84%
And that the doctor
looked at it,

00:08:32.096 --> 00:08:33.929 align:middle line:84%
examined it, all this
other stuff like that,

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:35.900 align:middle line:90%
and went in to have it x-rayed.

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.710 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't going to do a
thing until it was x-rayed.

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:40.873 align:middle line:84%
Went in there to
have an x-ray done.

00:08:40.873 --> 00:08:43.039 align:middle line:84%
They set the baby in there,
lined up all the things.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:44.510 align:middle line:90%
They turned on the machine.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:47.470 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't come on.

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:49.220 align:middle line:84%
They did everything
they could to fix it.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.540 align:middle line:90%
The machine was just dead.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.770 align:middle line:90%
And they went to another.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:57.736 align:middle line:84%
They had to bring some kind of
technician in to work on it.

00:08:57.736 --> 00:09:01.222 align:middle line:84%

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:22.380 align:middle line:90%
It's funny.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.325 align:middle line:84%
So it's just placed
out in space out here.

00:09:24.325 --> 00:09:28.290 align:middle line:90%


00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.475 align:middle line:90%
So they tried to fix it.

00:09:30.475 --> 00:09:31.350 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't fix it.

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:32.550 align:middle line:90%
They kept going through it.

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:34.130 align:middle line:90%
They still couldn't fix it.

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:36.247 align:middle line:84%
It took them over
an hour to fix it.

00:09:36.247 --> 00:09:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And they wouldn't
do anything with her

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:39.240 align:middle line:90%
until they took an x-ray.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.740 align:middle line:90%
Just wouldn't do anything.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:44.310 align:middle line:90%
And finally, got the x-ray done.

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.900 align:middle line:90%
Finally, the machine came on.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.560 align:middle line:90%
And then they took the x-ray.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.240 align:middle line:84%
Immediately, the doctor
comes and looks at it,

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.790 align:middle line:84%
holds the x-ray up,
and there's no crack.

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:55.867 align:middle line:90%
He looks at the x-ray.

00:09:55.867 --> 00:09:57.200 align:middle line:90%
This is my wife that's in there.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.920 align:middle line:84%
He went over to the
baby, looks at the baby.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:00.720 align:middle line:90%
There's no crack.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:05.050 align:middle line:84%
It's not there, none,
like it didn't happen.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't know how
to even talk about it.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:16.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she said he just
was kind of dumbfounded.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:20.810 align:middle line:90%
And so he told her anyway.

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:25.440 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, I don't
know exactly what happened.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.080 align:middle line:84%
I thought that I saw this,
but I guess I didn't.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And he said, but anyway,
she has a concussion.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
bad concussion.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And she will probably
have a problem

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:42.400 align:middle line:90%
when she comes out of this.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.160 align:middle line:84%
She probably won't be able to
talk right or something else.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.805 align:middle line:84%
And he was trying to prepare
her in case there was

00:10:48.805 --> 00:10:50.130 align:middle line:90%
some kind of traumatic thing.

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And he was telling
her all these things.

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:55.660 align:middle line:84%
Something might be
wrong here after this

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:59.030 align:middle line:90%
because this is pretty bad.

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And by the next day, I think it
was, her head was swelled up,

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:05.120 align:middle line:90%
like twice the size.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.710 align:middle line:84%
It was huge, huge,
huge, swollen up.

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:10.520 align:middle line:90%
It was really sad.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.791 align:middle line:84%
And he then told
us that it would

00:11:12.791 --> 00:11:15.290 align:middle line:84%
be-- I think you said about a
month before the healing would

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:20.560 align:middle line:84%
go down and before anything
would get fixed in all of this.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, day and
night, I just kept focusing

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:26.500 align:middle line:90%
and just kept focusing on this.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.880 align:middle line:90%
And so did my wife.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And in three days,
all the healing

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:37.260 align:middle line:84%
went down-- all of the
swelling went down to normal.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.250 align:middle line:90%
She looked absolutely normal.

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And we managed to get
her out of the hospital.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:47.310 align:middle line:84%
The doctor, he just said
that was extraordinary.

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:50.034 align:middle line:84%
He kept going, oh, it was really
amazing that she could do this.

00:11:50.034 --> 00:11:52.075 align:middle line:84%
But he just kept saying
it was very extraordinary

00:11:52.075 --> 00:11:54.890 align:middle line:84%
that that would happen so
quick and all that stuff.

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:56.570 align:middle line:90%
But it went down.

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And then he kept saying,
but she'll probably

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:01.600 align:middle line:84%
have problems, and all these
kinds of things like that.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.300 align:middle line:84%
The angel said that
she was, at this point,

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.880 align:middle line:84%
completely healed,
except emotionally,

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.740 align:middle line:84%
that she was physically
and mentally healed,

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:14.370 align:middle line:84%
but her emotional body was
still attached to the pain

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:18.000 align:middle line:84%
and that we had to heal the
pain and that it was love.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And so we just loved her
like crazy for a long time,

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.760 align:middle line:84%
like a lot more than
you normally would.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.500 align:middle line:84%
We really loved her
until finally, they

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:32.070 align:middle line:84%
said that it was done, it was
over, that she was 100% healed.

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.620 align:middle line:90%


00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:40.672 align:middle line:84%
And so this baby grew up to
be-- instead of being retarded,

00:12:40.672 --> 00:12:43.650 align:middle line:84%
if the bump did
anything, it seemed

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:45.326 align:middle line:84%
to have gone the
other way around.

00:12:45.326 --> 00:12:47.580 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:52.790 align:middle line:84%
Because this happened when
she was 18 months old.

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And when she was about maybe
four years old, or still really

00:12:58.730 --> 00:12:59.830 align:middle line:90%
little, we bought a piano.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:02.370 align:middle line:90%
My wife played the piano.

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:06.190 align:middle line:90%
And so what if I come out here.

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:07.030 align:middle line:90%
[STATIC]

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:09.784 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:09.784 --> 00:13:11.161 align:middle line:90%


00:13:11.161 --> 00:13:12.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm tied up here.

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:13.822 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:13.822 --> 00:13:15.880 align:middle line:84%
She remembers playing
the piano one day.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.770 align:middle line:90%
I bought this brand new piano.

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And my wife sat down and
started playing the piano.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:22.990 align:middle line:90%
And Ilya was just watching her.

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And I was sitting
there watching.

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And Ilya said she wanted
to play the piano.

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:30.600 align:middle line:84%
So we let Ilya go up there
and sit and play the piano.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.400 align:middle line:90%
And Ilya sat down.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:35.716 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, dunk, dunk, dink,
dunk, donk, dink, donk, donk.

00:13:35.716 --> 00:13:39.120 align:middle line:90%
Do, do, do.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.140 align:middle line:84%
In about 30 seconds,
this incredible music

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:44.120 align:middle line:90%
is coming out of this piano.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I realized
this is no ordinary kid here.

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And by the time she had
finished first grade, which

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.137 align:middle line:90%
is what-- you're six years old?

00:13:57.137 --> 00:13:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>>Five?

00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:58.960 align:middle line:90%
>>Five?

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>>No, it's six.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.970 align:middle line:90%
>>She started at five, I think.

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:05.830 align:middle line:84%
I believe she was six when this
was completed, if I remember.

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:09.070 align:middle line:84%
By the time she
was six years old,

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:12.550 align:middle line:84%
she had read all the books
through the sixth grade

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:14.650 align:middle line:84%
and passed the
courses, according

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:17.940 align:middle line:84%
to Colorado State, all the
way through the sixth grade,

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.027 align:middle line:84%
the whole thing,
the whole package.

00:14:20.027 --> 00:14:22.610 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think she's going to
have a problem with her speech

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:23.930 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:27.380 align:middle line:90%


00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And I had many, many things
like this occur in my life, one

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.890 align:middle line:84%
after another, with
lots and lots of people.

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that healing is a
matter of opening your heart

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:43.835 align:middle line:90%
and allowing it to be.

00:14:43.835 --> 00:14:45.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's
another thing I need

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:49.250 align:middle line:84%
to say about it, which is
very, very, very important.

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:51.710 align:middle line:84%
You have the right
to heal yourself.

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And we have the right
to heal our children.

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:56.910 align:middle line:90%


00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:00.920 align:middle line:84%
But we don't have the
right to heal someone else.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.350 align:middle line:90%
We don't have any right.

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:03.740 align:middle line:90%
It's illegal.

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:05.270 align:middle line:90%
It's against the law.

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:07.240 align:middle line:90%
You can't do it.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:11.190 align:middle line:84%
In order to heal someone else,
you have to get permission.

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that means
I have to get permission

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:17.930 align:middle line:90%
from the person, number one.

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And then once they say
yes, then what I do

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:28.560 align:middle line:84%
is I bring in their
higher self, which

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.350 align:middle line:84%
is easy to do once
you know that process.

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And I get permission from their
higher self to make sure that

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:43.090 align:middle line:84%
this is for the greater good of
that person because you cannot

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:47.370 align:middle line:84%
determine that the healing of
that person at this time is

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:50.860 align:middle line:84%
in the greatest
good of that person.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.410 align:middle line:84%
Maybe two weeks from
now it might be.

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.170 align:middle line:84%
But at this moment,
it might not be.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:57.190 align:middle line:84%
There's no way to determine
that from where we sit.

00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And so you gotta get permission
to shoot a beam of light

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:04.980 align:middle line:84%
across the room to heal
someone or do something

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:06.388 align:middle line:90%
of this kind of psychic nature.

00:16:06.388 --> 00:16:09.200 align:middle line:90%


00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.030 align:middle line:90%
It's a no-no.

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:12.490 align:middle line:84%
You can't do this
even though it may

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:17.480 align:middle line:84%
seem like it's a good thing
because you just don't know

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.020 align:middle line:90%
what is needed for that person.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:24.560 align:middle line:90%


00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:29.450 align:middle line:84%
If I did get permission
to heal that person,

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:31.530 align:middle line:84%
what I de-- and
maybe has nothing

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:37.702 align:middle line:84%
to do with what you do-- I get
their prana flow moving first.

00:16:37.702 --> 00:16:39.410 align:middle line:84%
I know it will only
go for a couple days.

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:42.840 align:middle line:84%
But you can initiate someone
else's flow moving just

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:46.180 align:middle line:84%
by seeing their
field and breathing

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.960 align:middle line:84%
and timing your
breathing to their fields

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.460 align:middle line:84%
and getting their
pranic flow going.

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:54.840 align:middle line:84%
In many cases, in
many things, that

00:16:54.840 --> 00:17:01.060 align:middle line:84%
will solve the problem, at
least, a lot of certain things,

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:04.430 align:middle line:84%
unless they're real,
real deep things.

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:06.119 align:middle line:90%
But I always do that first.

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And then I did bring in
their higher self again.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And I say, OK, what do
you want me to do now?

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:12.760 align:middle line:90%
And I just listen.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.420 align:middle line:90%
I don't think.

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:17.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't go thinking
in terms of a doctor,

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.560 align:middle line:84%
in terms of all the
things I know about what

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:22.069 align:middle line:84%
is best for those
conditions or stuff,

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:25.130 align:middle line:84%
though I may be put
in that position.

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:29.180 align:middle line:84%
But I just simply ask what it
is that would help this person.

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And I've discovered that
the higher selves of people

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:36.730 align:middle line:84%
sometimes give very
unusual things, things

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:39.200 align:middle line:84%
that you wouldn't
consider healing per se.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And many times, it is things
like herbs or crystals

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:47.380 align:middle line:84%
or something of this
nature, some physical thing.

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:50.145 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of times, it's
other kinds of things.

00:17:50.145 --> 00:17:53.730 align:middle line:90%


00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:55.970 align:middle line:84%
For example, which I'm
not going to have time

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:58.890 align:middle line:84%
to talk about this one,
but I sometimes do.

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's one where
it was a dream that

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.289 align:middle line:84%
actually was the healing
process for this person.

00:18:03.289 --> 00:18:04.705 align:middle line:84%
I had this dream
about this person

00:18:04.705 --> 00:18:08.210 align:middle line:84%
and my giving the
dream to the person,

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:11.190 align:middle line:90%
which was the healing thing.

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:14.510 align:middle line:84%
It solved the problem
with the person.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, it just
may be things associated

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:25.600 align:middle line:84%
with color and things like
this, where you give them

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.645 align:middle line:90%
a certain color to wear.

00:18:26.645 --> 00:18:31.300 align:middle line:90%


00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:32.100 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:33.600 align:middle line:90%
Could be anything.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.190 align:middle line:84%
Could be things that you may not
normally attribute to healing.

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:40.420 align:middle line:84%
But if you just listen
real carefully, just

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.750 align:middle line:84%
listen, just get out
of the way and listen,

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:46.821 align:middle line:84%
their higher self knows
exactly what they need.

00:18:46.821 --> 00:18:49.320 align:middle line:90%
And just do it.

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And you can see amazing
results sometimes

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:54.020 align:middle line:90%
with very little things.

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's just
handing them a book.

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.832 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:18:56.832 --> 00:18:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, I
can't really tell.

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:02.930 align:middle line:84%
But you gotta just follow
your heart on that.

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:05.430 align:middle line:84%
There are techniques
I have learned.

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:08.330 align:middle line:90%


00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:09.720 align:middle line:84%
If the higher self
says that they

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.270 align:middle line:84%
need energy in one
way or another,

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.560 align:middle line:84%
besides getting
their own flow going,

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:20.890 align:middle line:84%
I may give them my own energy
and project through my hands

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:23.390 align:middle line:84%
by putting my hands on
them and projecting--

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:27.247 align:middle line:84%
what I do is I get my flow
going and bring my flow.

00:19:27.247 --> 00:19:28.580 align:middle line:90%
You have this inner sphere here.

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.080 align:middle line:90%
And you have that outer one.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.730 align:middle line:84%
The inner one is where your
super concentrated energy,

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:33.810 align:middle line:90%
the prana, is.

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:38.006 align:middle line:84%
And so I may bring prana
out from there on down.

00:19:38.006 --> 00:19:43.510 align:middle line:84%
I've learned things like you
don't bring things through you.

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:44.948 align:middle line:90%
I learned that one the hard way.

00:19:44.948 --> 00:19:47.750 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:49.730 align:middle line:84%
I got real good in
these prana flows.

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:51.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't even let
them back up into me

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:54.672 align:middle line:84%
anymore, to make sure that
it's only a one way flow.

00:19:54.672 --> 00:19:55.940 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:55.940 --> 00:20:01.450 align:middle line:84%
I remember one time,
my wife had hay fever.

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:04.970 align:middle line:84%
She had it about 20 years,
since she was a kid.

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:08.429 align:middle line:84%
And when we were learning
in all this stuff-- it

00:20:08.429 --> 00:20:10.220 align:middle line:84%
was toward the beginning
stages-- she said,

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.510 align:middle line:84%
hey, let's get rid
of this hay fever.

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:13.310 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:15.810 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:19.130 align:middle line:90%
And I got a hold of it.

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:20.210 align:middle line:90%
I felt where it was.

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:22.935 align:middle line:84%
And I pulled it into my
hand and up through here

00:20:22.935 --> 00:20:24.060 align:middle line:90%
and out the top of my head.

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:25.684 align:middle line:84%
That seemed like the
right thing to do.

00:20:25.684 --> 00:20:26.810 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:28.816 align:middle line:90%
It's not the right thing to do.

00:20:28.816 --> 00:20:30.280 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:35.560 align:middle line:84%
Because 15 minutes later, my
wife was completely healed.

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:40.270 align:middle line:84%
And she's never had it since,
nothing, totally, not a drop,

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:41.340 align:middle line:90%
nothing.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.340 align:middle line:90%
15 minutes later, I got it.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd never had hay
fever in my whole life.

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:48.940 align:middle line:90%
And my eyes starting running.

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:49.990 align:middle line:90%
My nose starting running.

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:51.350 align:middle line:90%
My son's going, what is this?

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.960 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:54.930 align:middle line:90%
And I just got it.

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:56.101 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I got it bad.

00:20:56.101 --> 00:20:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And I had it so bad, I was
going through two and three

00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:00.750 align:middle line:90%
boxes of Kleenex a day.

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
how to get rid of it.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.282 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this was
a new experience.

00:21:06.282 --> 00:21:07.740 align:middle line:84%
I pulled something
in that I didn't

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.172 align:middle line:90%
know how to get out of now.

00:21:09.172 --> 00:21:13.785 align:middle line:84%
And so I remember, there was one
point it went for six months,

00:21:13.785 --> 00:21:16.180 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't figure
out how to get rid of it.

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:20.100 align:middle line:90%
And my life was ruined.

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:21.726 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:21.726 --> 00:21:23.180 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't even work.

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:26.120 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't do anything other
than crying and other stuff

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.890 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:29.514 align:middle line:84%
And so I finally
went to the angels.

00:21:29.514 --> 00:21:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you've got
to help me on this one.

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:32.940 align:middle line:90%
I can't figure it out.

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:34.310 align:middle line:90%
And they said, OK.

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And they gave me a herbal
cure, which really works.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's worked on
lots of other people.

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:48.600 align:middle line:84%
I know how to knock out
hay fever now, or most

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.030 align:middle line:90%
other allergies.

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:52.120 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty easy, actually.

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:52.965 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:21:52.965 --> 00:21:56.670 align:middle line:90%
>>So will you share?

00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:58.060 align:middle line:90%
>>All right.

00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:04.729 align:middle line:84%
All you do is you take three
days of your life aside.

00:22:04.729 --> 00:22:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And you kick everybody
out because nobody's

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:09.725 align:middle line:84%
going to want to be near
you because this is a blood

00:22:09.725 --> 00:22:10.525 align:middle line:90%
purifier.

00:22:10.525 --> 00:22:13.790 align:middle line:84%
And all the heavy metals and
all the toxins and everything

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:17.600 align:middle line:84%
come out of your body in every
conceivable way, from your skin

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.950 align:middle line:90%
to your mouth to your eyes.

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:22.107 align:middle line:84%
Everything is all
going to come out.

00:22:22.107 --> 00:22:23.440 align:middle line:90%
And it's going to come out fast.

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.670 align:middle line:90%
So you'll get very weak.

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:28.740 align:middle line:84%
I've learned since then that
this is a Navajo cure, which

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:32.110 align:middle line:90%
they say will cure anything.

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And I did watch a
woman afterwards,

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:39.000 align:middle line:84%
who had also got the cure
from someone else, who

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.040 align:middle line:90%
had cancer throughout her body.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.970 align:middle line:84%
They gave her less
than 30 days to live.

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:46.892 align:middle line:84%
And she completely knocked
the cancer out of her body.

00:22:46.892 --> 00:22:48.350 align:middle line:84%
And that was about
seven years ago.

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:50.690 align:middle line:90%
She's fine now.

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:52.520 align:middle line:90%
And she had it in her blood.

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:53.895 align:middle line:84%
And it was throughout
everything.

00:22:53.895 --> 00:22:55.430 align:middle line:90%
She was really going.

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:57.590 align:middle line:84%
What it is is something
called chaparral.

00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:01.740 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE GROANING]

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And there's a technique where
you take six cups of water.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And you take a heaping
tablespoon of cut licorice

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:17.150 align:middle line:84%
and put it into the water cold
and bring the water to a simmer

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:26.790 align:middle line:84%
and simmer it for I'd say
about 20 minutes or so,

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:29.220 align:middle line:84%
maybe even longer--
20, 25 minutes.

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:32.010 align:middle line:90%
And then turn it off.

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And then you take a half
a cup of chaparral leaf.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is about chaparral
is that chaparral is an oil.

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:39.100 align:middle line:90%
And it's in there.

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:42.809 align:middle line:84%
And it gets very, very weak
after about six months.

00:23:42.809 --> 00:23:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And almost all the
chaparral that you

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:49.760 align:middle line:84%
buy from your health food
stores, most of those herbs

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.780 align:middle line:90%
are about a year old.

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And they're all
weak, just about.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And the best, very best,
best, best way you can do this

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:58.654 align:middle line:90%
is to go pick it fresh.

00:23:58.654 --> 00:24:00.570 align:middle line:84%
It only grows in a couple
places in the world.

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:05.385 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is in southern
New Mexico, southern Arizona.

>>Are you familiar
with Jason Winters tea?

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:08.930 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:12.310 align:middle line:90%
>>It's blood cleansing tea.

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And the government recently
took it off the market

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:20.930 align:middle line:84%
so they could take the chaparral
out of it because supposedly

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:23.900 align:middle line:90%
one person got toxic reactions.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:24.700 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, sure.

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:27.930 align:middle line:84%
You could die from
taking chaparral.

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:29.240 align:middle line:90%
It's not the chaparral.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.542 align:middle line:90%
It's the release of the toxins.

00:24:31.542 --> 00:24:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And so it is the absolute
most powerful toxin remover

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:39.300 align:middle line:90%
in the planet just about.

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.135 align:middle line:84%
So you gotta know what
you're doing with it.

00:24:41.135 --> 00:24:42.700 align:middle line:90%
I have to admit this.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:46.550 align:middle line:84%
But chaparral is a very,
very powerful thing.

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:48.290 align:middle line:84%
So you can't buy
chaparral anymore?

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:50.030 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, the entire southern
half of the State of New Mexico

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:57.450 align:middle line:84%
is covered with it, as
far as the eye could see.

00:24:57.450 --> 00:24:59.911 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:59.911 --> 00:25:01.410 align:middle line:84%
So I want to see
them cut that down.

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:02.330 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:04.540 align:middle line:90%


00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:05.360 align:middle line:90%
So anyway--

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:06.710 align:middle line:90%
>>It's a half a cup?

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>>You put half a
cup of chaparral.

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:09.780 align:middle line:90%
You turn the fire off.

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And you put a half a cup
of chaparral in there

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:16.070 align:middle line:84%
and let it steep, just
like you would tea.

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:18.890 align:middle line:84%
But you let it sit
for 45 minutes.

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And then you start drinking
this tea, those six

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:24.580 align:middle line:90%
cups over the entire day.

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:26.970 align:middle line:84%
You just keep drinking
and drinking and drinking.

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And you fast during
the whole time.

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:34.440 align:middle line:84%
What happens is
you get very weak.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And all these toxins just
start pouring out of you.

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:41.032 align:middle line:84%
If you are really
toxined out or you

00:25:41.032 --> 00:25:43.240 align:middle line:84%
have something really heavy--
this was just hay fever

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:44.627 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting rid of.

00:25:44.627 --> 00:25:46.210 align:middle line:84%
If you've got something
really strong,

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:48.630 align:middle line:84%
then you probably would
have to ask your higher

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:52.090 align:middle line:84%
self about exactly if that
amount should be changed

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:52.890 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:54.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm not really sure of that.

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:57.680 align:middle line:90%


00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And then the next morning,
you make another one.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.790 align:middle line:84%
You can have all
the water you want.

00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:04.470 align:middle line:90%
You drink lots of water.

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And you can also
take lots of baths

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.660 align:middle line:84%
to open your pores up and keep
letting the stuff come out.

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And also with sea
salt in the bath,

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:23.670 align:middle line:84%
lots of sea salt, like in a
bath, maybe three cups at least

00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:28.000 align:middle line:84%
or more of sea salt. You
couldn't put too much

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.210 align:middle line:90%
because it will get saturated.

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And take maybe three,
four relatively warm baths

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:38.527 align:middle line:84%
to really open up the pores
to pull all that stuff out.

00:26:38.527 --> 00:26:40.985 align:middle line:84%
And you'll just get weaker and
weaker and weaker and weaker

00:26:40.985 --> 00:26:42.040 align:middle line:90%
and weaker and weaker.

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.730 align:middle line:84%
By the end of the third day,
you can hardly get out of bed.

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:45.530 align:middle line:90%
But it'll just keep coming out.

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
go back again, you

00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:55.520 align:middle line:84%
feel like somebody just lifted
a giant veil off of your head.

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.330 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even realize
how many veils

00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:00.400 align:middle line:84%
had been-- because the
toxins act like veils.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.540 align:middle line:90%
They deaden your senses.

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:04.150 align:middle line:90%
And it's very powerful.

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:06.087 align:middle line:90%
That's what they told me to do.

00:27:06.087 --> 00:27:07.920 align:middle line:84%
I never even heard of
chaparral before that.

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.900 align:middle line:84%
>>Was it fresh chaparral
you used or dry?

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:12.385 align:middle line:84%
>>I went and got
fresh chaparral.

00:27:12.385 --> 00:27:14.010 align:middle line:84%
They told me to go
get fresh chaparral.

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:16.757 align:middle line:90%


00:27:16.757 --> 00:27:18.590 align:middle line:84%
If you can't buy it,
that's the way it goes.

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:23.060 align:middle line:84%
But chaparral is only
good-- from all the people

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:25.600 align:middle line:84%
ever since that I've
studied a little bit,

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:28.210 align:middle line:84%
it's only good for
about six months.

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And what chaparral is
also called creosote.

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:35.760 align:middle line:84%
It's the creosote
they put on bushes.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:41.550 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a form of poison,
so you have to be careful.

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:45.930 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't want to put
too much of that in there.

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:49.082 align:middle line:84%
>>Do you just drink chaparral
the first day of the fast?

00:27:49.082 --> 00:27:50.790 align:middle line:84%
Do you drink it the
second and third day?

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:52.220 align:middle line:84%
>>You just drink
it all day long.

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:53.230 align:middle line:90%
>>Every day?

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:54.372 align:middle line:90%
>>Every day for three days.

00:27:54.372 --> 00:27:59.150 align:middle line:90%


00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:01.990 align:middle line:84%
After that, I found this
other woman, who I talked to.

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh, that's
how I cured myself.

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
what did you do?

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And she drank large
amounts of it for a month.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:15.576 align:middle line:90%


00:28:15.576 --> 00:28:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>>So when you said
a half a cup--

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.060 align:middle line:84%
>>Measure the leaf,
half a cup of leaf.

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:23.070 align:middle line:90%
>>Press the leaf?

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>>Just put in there pretty
loosely and measure.

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:27.801 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:27.801 --> 00:28:28.601 align:middle line:90%
Huh?

00:28:28.601 --> 00:28:31.490 align:middle line:84%
>>Do you put any
cayenne with this?

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:33.290 align:middle line:90%
>>What?

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:34.480 align:middle line:90%
>>Pepper, cayenne pepper.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.410 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, cayenne.

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:38.150 align:middle line:90%
No, not for this.

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:39.464 align:middle line:90%
[STATIC]

00:28:39.464 --> 00:28:44.517 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:44.517 --> 00:28:46.225 align:middle line:84%
If you're told to do
something like that.

00:28:46.225 --> 00:28:50.450 align:middle line:84%
This was one that was designed
for what I was trying to do.

00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:53.515 align:middle line:84%
And why the licorice was
in there, I'm not sure.

00:28:53.515 --> 00:28:56.000 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:02.575 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, licorice will
cleanse half of your adrenal.

00:29:02.575 --> 00:29:04.994 align:middle line:90%
It won't affect the other part.

00:29:04.994 --> 00:29:06.902 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:06.902 --> 00:29:08.810 align:middle line:90%
>>Is it OK to use drops?

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:10.241 align:middle line:90%
Or is it good [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:10.241 --> 00:29:13.960 align:middle line:90%


00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.281 align:middle line:90%
>>You can't find cut licorice?

00:29:15.281 --> 00:29:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>>Oh, you can get that
in any health food store.

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:18.280 align:middle line:90%
>>Any health food store.

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:19.280 align:middle line:90%
>>It's licorice root.

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:20.488 align:middle line:90%
>>It's chopped licorice root.

00:29:20.488 --> 00:29:22.590 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:25.040 align:middle line:84%
>>It doesn't matter
really, as long

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:28.447 align:middle line:84%
as it's approximately
a heaping tablespoon.

00:29:28.447 --> 00:29:29.530 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's get off of that.

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:32.490 align:middle line:90%
That's too long.

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so after you've
listened to their higher self,

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:42.330 align:middle line:90%
you'll find out.

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:44.163 align:middle line:84%
And you can do the same
thing with yourself.

00:29:44.163 --> 00:29:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, if you'll
just go in and listen

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:49.020 align:middle line:84%
to what it is that your
higher self will tell you,

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:52.270 align:middle line:90%
it will give you the cure.

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:55.620 align:middle line:84%
The one thing that
my higher aspect

00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:59.700 align:middle line:84%
told me a long time
ago was that if we only

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:02.020 align:middle line:84%
knew the nature
of the reality, we

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:06.510 align:middle line:84%
would realize that we are
never without, that we always

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:12.840 align:middle line:84%
have within reach
everything we need, always,

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:16.660 align:middle line:84%
either within for knowledge
or without, physically,

00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:18.975 align:middle line:84%
that you could be
sick and sitting

00:30:18.975 --> 00:30:21.350 align:middle line:84%
right next to a plant that
may be the very thing that you

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:24.430 align:middle line:84%
need, if you just open
your eyes and listen.

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And I remember right after I got
that lesson, my wife was going,

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:31.460 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:35.600 align:middle line:84%
She was one of these ones that
were always challenging things

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:36.974 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:30:36.974 --> 00:30:37.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:40.440 align:middle line:84%
She says, we need a
gas can right now.

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:41.790 align:middle line:90%
And we don't have a gas can.

00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:43.456 align:middle line:84%
She's was going like
this, staring at me

00:30:43.456 --> 00:30:48.480 align:middle line:84%
like that, because we needed
this gas can for this car.

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.530 align:middle line:84%
So as she was saying
this, we were walking down

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:53.580 align:middle line:90%
to this beach.

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:54.560 align:middle line:90%
We lived on this lake.

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:55.690 align:middle line:90%
It was two miles around.

00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And there was nobody for--
well, the nearest neighbor

00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.911 align:middle line:90%
was two miles away.

00:30:59.911 --> 00:31:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And the next neighbor was
about four miles from there.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.110 align:middle line:84%
So we were all by ourselves out
in the middle of the forest.

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:08.203 align:middle line:84%
And we were walking down to
this lake as we were talking.

00:31:08.203 --> 00:31:10.080 align:middle line:90%
She says, I need a gas can.

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.070 align:middle line:90%
And there's no gas can.

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:14.010 align:middle line:84%
She goes, some things
you don't have like that.

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:14.880 align:middle line:90%
And we walked in.

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.757 align:middle line:84%
And we sat down this
rock, I remember.

00:31:16.757 --> 00:31:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And we were just sitting
there for a moment.

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
I looked over.

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And over on this rock,
about 20 feet away from me,

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:28.340 align:middle line:84%
was the most incredible gas
can I'd ever seen in my life.

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:29.150 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:32.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this thing was-- I
couldn't believe this thing.

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:34.150 align:middle line:90%
It was brass.

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:36.270 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was incredible.

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:39.200 align:middle line:84%
It must have been a $100
gas can or something.

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.655 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:40.655 --> 00:31:43.294 align:middle line:90%
And I said, there's one.

00:31:43.294 --> 00:31:46.682 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:46.682 --> 00:31:49.210 align:middle line:90%


00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:50.520 align:middle line:90%
It worked for about two days.

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:51.320 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:53.070 align:middle line:90%
She was right back again.

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:54.680 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:55.640 align:middle line:90%


00:31:55.640 --> 00:32:01.630 align:middle line:84%
I remember the angels
told us never to work,

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:03.760 align:middle line:84%
that they would provide
all the money for us.

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:07.027 align:middle line:84%
All we had to do was just to
continue following our heart

00:32:07.027 --> 00:32:08.485 align:middle line:84%
and doing what
we're supposed to do

00:32:08.485 --> 00:32:10.270 align:middle line:84%
and everything would
be taken care of.

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:13.400 align:middle line:90%


00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And so I had some money
when I left there,

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.570 align:middle line:90%
so that was really easy to do.

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And we went and lived in
this place out in the woods.

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.520 align:middle line:84%
We lived there
for several months

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:24.457 align:middle line:84%
while I was living
on this money.

00:32:24.457 --> 00:32:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And then the money
started to run out.

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:27.623 align:middle line:84%
And as it started
running out, my wife

00:32:27.623 --> 00:32:31.590 align:middle line:84%
started getting more and
more antsy all the time.

00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And it got to the
place where she

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:37.686 align:middle line:84%
was starting to get downright
belligerent toward me.

00:32:37.686 --> 00:32:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And I said, but we said
we're not supposed to work.

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:41.520 align:middle line:90%
I don't care.

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:42.700 align:middle line:90%
We need money.

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And we got down
to $12 to my name.

00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And the next day, we had to
make a car payment or something

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:52.880 align:middle line:90%
or we'd lose the car.

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:53.680 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember.

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:55.980 align:middle line:84%
It was $180 I
needed the next day.

00:32:55.980 --> 00:33:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And she was just going nuts all
day long and all night long.

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.560 align:middle line:90%
And we went to bed that night.

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And she was just pissed
off at me and everything.

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And I was going-- how
can I-- because I didn't

00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:11.860 align:middle line:90%
care what happened to me.

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:15.920 align:middle line:84%
That was the problem
because I wanted

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:19.987 align:middle line:84%
to follow this thing to the
end, wherever the end was,

00:33:19.987 --> 00:33:21.820 align:middle line:84%
or where it starts a
beginning or something.

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:24.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, but I wanted
to keep going with it.

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And so we went to bed
that night all pissed off.

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And about midnight--
and you got to realize,

00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:35.440 align:middle line:90%
I am in the middle of nowhere.

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:36.820 align:middle line:90%
So I went to bed.

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And that night about midnight,
there's a knock on the door.

00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:43.476 align:middle line:84%
And I get up and
I walk in there.

00:33:43.476 --> 00:33:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And here's this old friend I
hadn't seen for a long time.

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And he'd been trying to get
to me for about three days.

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:50.860 align:middle line:84%
He didn't even
know where I lived.

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:51.660 align:middle line:90%
So it was hard.

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And he finally found
me about midnight.

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.070 align:middle line:90%
And he came in.

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:56.100 align:middle line:90%
And I wake up my wife.

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:56.960 align:middle line:90%
And we go in the kitchen.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:57.760 align:middle line:90%
And we sit down.

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And he says, remember
that money you gave me,

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:04.370 align:middle line:84%
like three years ago
or something like that?

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:06.880 align:middle line:90%
I go, uh, no.

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:07.866 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:07.866 --> 00:34:11.284 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, well, I
just wanted to tell you,

00:34:11.284 --> 00:34:13.300 align:middle line:84%
it saved my life and
all this kind of stuff.

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:17.409 align:middle line:84%
And he takes about $3,000
and goes-- on the table,

00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:18.620 align:middle line:90%
and says, thank you.

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:21.000 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.889 align:middle line:84%
And my wife is
sitting there going--

00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:27.130 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:28.420 align:middle line:90%
Then he stays the night.

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:30.739 align:middle line:90%
And he leaves the next morning.

00:34:30.739 --> 00:34:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And $3,000 was a
fair amount for us

00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:34.620 align:middle line:84%
because we were living
on just a couple hundred

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:37.139 align:middle line:84%
a month or something,
if it was that much.

00:34:37.139 --> 00:34:40.800 align:middle line:84%
So we live high on
the hog for a while.

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:44.489 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:44.489 --> 00:34:45.650 align:middle line:90%
And everything was fine.

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:49.219 align:middle line:84%
Boy, she didn't say a
word for a long time.

00:34:49.219 --> 00:34:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And then we started
running out of money again.

00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:57.139 align:middle line:84%
And we started going through
the same thing all over again.

00:34:57.139 --> 00:35:00.319 align:middle line:84%
And we got down
to $16 this time.

00:35:00.319 --> 00:35:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing, the
whole night-- [MUTTERING]

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.490 align:middle line:90%
can we get a job?

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:05.955 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:05.955 --> 00:35:07.346 align:middle line:90%


00:35:07.346 --> 00:35:10.366 align:middle line:84%
And we go to bed all
pissed off all over again.

00:35:10.366 --> 00:35:14.020 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.530 align:middle line:84%
I actually was
laughing afterwards

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:21.470 align:middle line:84%
because it was almost
the same minute.

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:23.910 align:middle line:84%
It was about midnight,
about the same time

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:26.601 align:middle line:84%
came the knock on
the door again.

00:35:26.601 --> 00:35:27.720 align:middle line:90%
I open the door.

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:29.280 align:middle line:90%
And this is somebody different.

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:33.940 align:middle line:84%
This goes all the way back to
Berkeley, like a long time ago.

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:35.820 align:middle line:90%
I didn't even see this person.

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And he says, wow, I
finally found you.

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:39.360 align:middle line:90%
I've been trying to find you.

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.068 align:middle line:84%
You remember that
money that you gave me?

00:35:41.068 --> 00:35:43.176 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:43.176 --> 00:35:44.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:46.710 align:middle line:90%
I guess.

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:48.270 align:middle line:84%
I was very generous
a lot of times.

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:50.300 align:middle line:84%
I used to give away
cars and everything else

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:52.220 align:middle line:90%
because it always came back.

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:54.449 align:middle line:84%
I discovered that part
of the-- in other words,

00:35:54.449 --> 00:35:55.490 align:middle line:90%
I heard about that karma.

00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:56.650 align:middle line:90%
And I tested it out.

00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:57.869 align:middle line:90%
And it really works.

00:35:57.869 --> 00:35:59.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
know this or not,

00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:01.900 align:middle line:84%
but when you give
things away, you better

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:03.990 align:middle line:84%
get a big bucket because
it's going to come back

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:06.380 align:middle line:90%
at you more than you give.

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:07.180 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:08.810 align:middle line:90%
It just really is true.

00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And so anyway, it
wasn't quite $3,000.

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:14.370 align:middle line:90%
But it was about $1,800.

00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:15.690 align:middle line:90%
Big cash pile.

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:18.870 align:middle line:90%
Thanks a lot.

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, when that money
ran out, she left me.

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:24.350 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:51.292 align:middle line:90%


00:36:51.292 --> 00:36:52.092 align:middle line:90%
Anyway.

00:36:52.092 --> 00:37:00.520 align:middle line:90%


00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:03.780 align:middle line:90%
So that's kind of how it is.

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And I've just been
following all along.

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:08.130 align:middle line:84%
I've always had problems
with almost anybody

00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:09.860 align:middle line:90%
that's tried to live with me.

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:12.210 align:middle line:84%
It's hard because
I've just refused

00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:13.670 align:middle line:90%
to go play by the rules.

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:15.854 align:middle line:90%
But they usually are.

00:37:15.854 --> 00:37:18.000 align:middle line:90%
And I've always been fine.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Everything's been just
fine, more than fine.

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:23.330 align:middle line:90%


00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:26.336 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I give
another example of this.

00:37:26.336 --> 00:37:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And then I think we have
to go the other one.

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:29.010 align:middle line:90%
We do.

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:31.470 align:middle line:90%


00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:35.090 align:middle line:84%
The last example is the name of
this person I put on that list.

00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:38.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying this one because
she wants to help other people.

00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:42.940 align:middle line:90%
And this was a pretty good one.

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:46.370 align:middle line:90%


00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:49.630 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I'll say a
real quickie one before.

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:52.420 align:middle line:84%
There's this lady
named Diana Gazes,

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:58.570 align:middle line:84%
who used to have a TV show
in New York City called Gazes

00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:06.725 align:middle line:90%
into the Future on cable.

00:38:06.725 --> 00:38:09.280 align:middle line:84%
It went out to a
couple million people.

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And we're good friends
for a long time.

00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:14.500 align:middle line:90%
And she quit for a while.

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:18.650 align:middle line:84%
She's now in England setting
up the same thing over here.

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:24.400 align:middle line:84%
But while she was in New
York, one of the last things

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.920 align:middle line:84%
that she was filming
right before she quit

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:30.365 align:middle line:84%
was this young boy who
was-- and this is all

00:38:30.365 --> 00:38:38.029 align:middle line:84%
on video-- this young
boy, when he was a kid,

00:38:38.029 --> 00:38:39.070 align:middle line:90%
he collected salamanders.

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And he had jars and
jars of salamanders.

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:43.013 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if you
know what a salamander is.

00:38:43.013 --> 00:38:45.810 align:middle line:84%
But a salamander is weird
because if you pull a tail off

00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:47.350 align:middle line:84%
or you pull a leg
off or something,

00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:48.130 align:middle line:90%
it just grows another one.

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:49.470 align:middle line:90%
They don't know how it does it.

00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:49.760 align:middle line:90%
But it does.

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.300 align:middle line:90%
It just grows another one.

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And so when he was
about 11 years old,

00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:00.610 align:middle line:84%
he lost his leg from
somewhere between his hip

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:02.050 align:middle line:90%
and somewhere up from here.

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:05.100 align:middle line:84%
He lost one of his
legs completely.

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And what I attribute it
to is that the parents

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:14.040 align:middle line:84%
forgot to tell him that that was
only for salamanders because he

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.467 align:middle line:90%
grew another leg.

00:39:16.467 --> 00:39:17.300 align:middle line:90%
He grew another one.

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:18.910 align:middle line:90%
And they videoed.

00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Once it started growing, they
actually started recording it.

00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And he grew this whole
leg all the way down,

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:24.780 align:middle line:90%
all the way down there.

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Right at the end of the video,
he's growing the toes on.

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's supposed
to be impossible,

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:33.697 align:middle line:90%
but yeah, it's done.

00:39:33.697 --> 00:39:34.780 align:middle line:90%
It's all what you believe.

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:36.738 align:middle line:84%
It's your belief patterns
is what the thing is.

00:39:36.738 --> 00:39:39.495 align:middle line:84%
This is where the real,
real key comes into.

00:39:39.495 --> 00:39:41.880 align:middle line:84%
It's what you believe
can be possible,

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:44.310 align:middle line:90%
what you believe is true.

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:47.746 align:middle line:84%
And it's the limits that
you put on yourself.

00:39:47.746 --> 00:39:52.566 align:middle line:84%
>>Maybe the salamander taught
him and he believed in it

00:39:52.566 --> 00:39:57.390 align:middle line:90%
so much, that kind of magic.

00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:59.300 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, possibly,
but more than likely,

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:03.680 align:middle line:84%
I think he saw the
salamander do it.

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And when I said
that, people laughed.

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:10.640 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think anybody--
he never was told.

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:14.140 align:middle line:84%
He never got the programming
that that wasn't possible.

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:17.396 align:middle line:84%
>>I spoke to Diana
because I was going

00:40:17.396 --> 00:40:19.062 align:middle line:84%
to work with somebody
with regeneration.

00:40:19.062 --> 00:40:20.445 align:middle line:90%
And she said he was retarded.

00:40:20.445 --> 00:40:22.290 align:middle line:90%
He was mildly retarded.

00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>>He was?

00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's what did it.

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:27.898 align:middle line:90%
He was mildly retarded.

00:40:27.898 --> 00:40:31.300 align:middle line:90%


00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:33.293 align:middle line:84%
So did she ever
give you the video?

00:40:33.293 --> 00:40:36.437 align:middle line:84%
>>No, she said the
kid's in France.

00:40:36.437 --> 00:40:37.237 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh.

00:40:37.237 --> 00:40:40.688 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:40:40.688 --> 00:40:43.646 align:middle line:90%


00:40:43.646 --> 00:40:45.618 align:middle line:90%
>>And they're documenting it.

00:40:45.618 --> 00:40:48.576 align:middle line:84%
And they're trying to study how
he's doing it and everything.

00:40:48.576 --> 00:40:51.041 align:middle line:90%
And he was in France.

00:40:51.041 --> 00:40:53.294 align:middle line:90%
>>Ah, thanks for that.

00:40:53.294 --> 00:40:54.460 align:middle line:90%
I was going to get in touch.

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:56.126 align:middle line:84%
Do you know where she
is in England now?

00:40:56.126 --> 00:40:57.240 align:middle line:90%
>>I have her number.

00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:59.784 align:middle line:84%
>>I would like that if
you could give it to me.

00:40:59.784 --> 00:41:02.540 align:middle line:90%


00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:05.229 align:middle line:90%
Just a real quick on Diana.

00:41:05.229 --> 00:41:07.270 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I said
this is the last workshop.

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:09.060 align:middle line:84%
But I'll say it in
this one anyway.

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:10.030 align:middle line:90%
We were doing that.

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:10.830 align:middle line:90%
She's a psychic.

00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:14.450 align:middle line:90%
She teaches metal bending.

00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:18.270 align:middle line:84%
Take metal and you melt it and
all this stuff with your mind.

00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And she goes to executives
and teaches them

00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:23.604 align:middle line:84%
how to do this so that they
can see this and apply it

00:41:23.604 --> 00:41:24.770 align:middle line:90%
into their business somehow.

00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:30.840 align:middle line:90%


00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:32.210 align:middle line:90%
And so she was in Hawaii.

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:34.260 align:middle line:90%
And I was in New Mexico.

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And we were doing
experiments back and forth

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:39.190 align:middle line:90%
psychically on healing.

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:41.752 align:middle line:84%
And we set up this one
pattern of healing where we

00:41:41.752 --> 00:41:43.690 align:middle line:90%
were going to do for 10 days.

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And I was going to do this
particular thing every night

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:48.950 align:middle line:90%
for 10 days.

00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And then I was
supposed to call her.

00:41:50.830 --> 00:41:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And we were going to compare
notes of what happened.

00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And on the third
day, I decided not

00:41:57.650 --> 00:42:01.590 align:middle line:90%
to do it without telling her.

00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And when I went to call
her, she wasn't there.

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:06.570 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't get her.

00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:08.500 align:middle line:90%
So I remember I went in.

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:13.537 align:middle line:84%
And I said to the
angels, she's not there,

00:42:13.537 --> 00:42:15.870 align:middle line:84%
because I was doing this in
conjunction with the angels.

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:18.210 align:middle line:90%
I said, she's not there.

00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:19.045 align:middle line:90%
What do I do?

00:42:19.045 --> 00:42:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And so they gave me
the phone number.

00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:22.875 align:middle line:90%
They said, call this number.

00:42:22.875 --> 00:42:24.500 align:middle line:84%
So I call this number,
this 808 number.

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:25.860 align:middle line:90%
Didn't know what it was.

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:26.660 align:middle line:90%
Call it up.

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:28.720 align:middle line:90%
And Diana answers the phone.

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:30.800 align:middle line:90%
And I said, oh, hi, Diana.

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:33.430 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, Drunvalo?

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:34.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.650 align:middle line:90%
How you doin?

00:42:34.650 --> 00:42:35.770 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, Drunvalo?

00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:38.059 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:38.059 --> 00:42:39.100 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what's wrong?

00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:42.890 align:middle line:84%
She says, Drunvalo, I was just
walking by this phone booth.

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:45.800 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:55.110 align:middle line:90%


00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:57.230 align:middle line:84%
She said it started
ringing and she just

00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:58.532 align:middle line:90%
felt pulled over to it.

00:42:58.532 --> 00:43:01.196 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:01.196 --> 00:43:07.290 align:middle line:90%


00:43:07.290 --> 00:43:09.475 align:middle line:84%
She still kids me
about it all the time.

00:43:09.475 --> 00:43:12.300 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:14.230 align:middle line:90%


00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:19.340 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, this lady
Doris Davidson,

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:21.080 align:middle line:90%
she was a woman in California.

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:22.520 align:middle line:90%
And she was in her 50s.

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And she had been
wheelchair for 12 years.

00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:30.730 align:middle line:90%


00:43:30.730 --> 00:43:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And she had polio,
I think it was.

00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And her legs were like
little toothpicks.

00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:37.790 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't even hardly
move or anything.

00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:41.220 align:middle line:84%
The doctors told her she would
never walk ever again, which

00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:46.930 align:middle line:90%
I believe is like execution.

00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:49.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you should never say
that because it takes away

00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:52.341 align:middle line:90%
all hope, all possibility.

00:43:52.341 --> 00:43:54.590 align:middle line:84%
This is why I think it's so
difficult to heal the AIDS

00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:56.423 align:middle line:84%
patients because they
all believe that there

00:43:56.423 --> 00:43:58.770 align:middle line:90%
is no cure and no possibility.

00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And so they all are going
around with this thing saying,

00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:02.750 align:middle line:90%
there's no hope.

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:03.550 align:middle line:90%
There's no hope.

00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:06.100 align:middle line:90%


00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:08.060 align:middle line:90%
It really reinforces it.

00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:09.834 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to break
a pattern when

00:44:09.834 --> 00:44:11.810 align:middle line:90%
you've got that feeling going.

00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:16.010 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, she picked up
one of Katrina's books.

00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:21.030 align:middle line:84%
It was Crystal Enlightenment,
I think it was.

00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:23.370 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the first one,
Crystal Enlightenment.

00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:24.912 align:middle line:90%
And it said something in there.

00:44:24.912 --> 00:44:26.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what it was
that it said in there.

00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:28.460 align:middle line:90%
But it triggered her.

00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And she started thinking that
maybe crystals would help her.

00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And she got a hold of Katrina
at the Crystal Academy in Taos.

00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:39.980 align:middle line:90%
And they started talking.

00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And in the course
of the conversation,

00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Katrina found out that
this woman was a walk-in

00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:49.150 align:middle line:84%
and decided that
it might be better

00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:51.940 align:middle line:84%
if I talked to her than
her for some reason.

00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:53.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why she
came to that conclusion.

00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:58.770 align:middle line:84%
So this woman calls
me up and says

00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:01.020 align:middle line:84%
that she wanted to know
if I could help her.

00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:03.230 align:middle line:90%
So I got permission.

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:05.180 align:middle line:84%
Got permission for
her higher self.

00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:08.650 align:middle line:84%
I asked her higher self,
what do you want me to do?

00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And all it said was, talk
to her on the telephone.

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:16.230 align:middle line:84%
Talk to her about her beliefs,
about her belief patterns.

00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:18.657 align:middle line:90%
Break her belief patterns.

00:45:18.657 --> 00:45:20.240 align:middle line:84%
That's all the higher
self said to do.

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:23.040 align:middle line:84%
It didn't say to
send any medicines

00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:24.240 align:middle line:90%
or anything like this.

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:30.140 align:middle line:90%
So I talked to her on the phone.

00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:33.340 align:middle line:84%
We talked for an hour
once a week or so.

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:35.899 align:middle line:84%
And I just kept talking to her
kind of like about the things

00:45:35.899 --> 00:45:37.940 align:middle line:84%
that I'm talking about
now to try to convince her

00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:42.280 align:middle line:84%
that what you believe is
true, and just because you're

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:44.540 align:middle line:84%
in a situation that
is supposedly helpless

00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:46.280 align:middle line:90%
doesn't mean a thing.

00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:51.940 align:middle line:84%
You can change it if you
truly believe that you can.

00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:57.270 align:middle line:84%
Remember what happened to the
woman who touched Jesus' robe.

00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:58.149 align:middle line:90%
She was healed.

00:45:58.149 --> 00:45:59.190 align:middle line:90%
What was it that she had?

00:45:59.190 --> 00:45:59.690 align:middle line:90%
You remember?

00:45:59.690 --> 00:46:00.660 align:middle line:90%
Does anybody remember?

00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:01.770 align:middle line:90%
>>A bleeding disorder.

00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:02.570 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:46:02.570 --> 00:46:04.260 align:middle line:90%
>>She'd been bleeding for years.

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:05.620 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, for years.

00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>>And she was
healed immediately.

00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:08.500 align:middle line:90%
And he felt it.

00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And he turned around
and he said to her,

00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:14.075 align:middle line:90%
"You faith has healed thee."

00:46:14.075 --> 00:46:16.990 align:middle line:90%
>>She was [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:19.996 align:middle line:84%
>>Right, well, you can be healed
as fast as you can accept.

00:46:19.996 --> 00:46:21.647 align:middle line:90%
That's what it really is.

00:46:21.647 --> 00:46:23.980 align:middle line:84%
You want to be healed slow,
then you can be healed slow.

00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:24.800 align:middle line:84%
If you want to be
healed instantly,

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:26.070 align:middle line:90%
you can be healed instantly.

00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:28.660 align:middle line:84%
It's all your faith and
what your belief is.

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:34.359 align:middle line:84%
And so we talked
for a long while.

00:46:34.359 --> 00:46:36.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember all the
exact dates and all this stuff

00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:36.990 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:38.490 align:middle line:84%
But I talked to her
for a long time.

00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I got
her to the place

00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:44.660 align:middle line:84%
where she said, OK,
I'm going to do it.

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And she had this
deep conviction.

00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:47.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do it.

00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:50.210 align:middle line:90%
I am going to heal myself.

00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:51.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do it.

00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:52.700 align:middle line:90%
I don't care what they say.

00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:54.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do it.

00:46:54.070 --> 00:46:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And so she went out and
got rid of her wheelchair

00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:03.130 align:middle line:84%
and got these special braces
made all the way up her legs

00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:07.510 align:middle line:84%
and hips and got one of these
four poster things like this

00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:09.570 align:middle line:84%
and started walking
around her house like this

00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:13.440 align:middle line:84%
with great difficulty and walked
all around her house that way

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:16.140 align:middle line:84%
for a long time, still
talking on the phone.

00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And she had her son
that was helping her,

00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:20.690 align:middle line:90%
who was in his 20s, I think.

00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:23.900 align:middle line:90%


00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And she did that for
a couple months or so.

00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And then her legs got
a little stronger.

00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:32.774 align:middle line:90%
And this is the what I remember.

00:47:32.774 --> 00:47:33.940 align:middle line:90%
It may not be exactly right.

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:35.690 align:middle line:84%
This is how I
remember what it was.

00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:37.790 align:middle line:84%
She then switched from
there to regular crutches

00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:40.600 align:middle line:84%
and learned how to walk
on regular crutches.

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:42.080 align:middle line:90%
Did that for a while.

00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And then she got
different kinds of braces

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:48.870 align:middle line:84%
that didn't go all
the way up to her hips

00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:52.014 align:middle line:84%
but went down further,
like here on down.

00:47:52.014 --> 00:47:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And she walked around on that
for another couple of months

00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:55.262 align:middle line:90%
or so.

00:47:55.262 --> 00:47:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And then she got
these other braces

00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:59.015 align:middle line:84%
that just went from the
bottom down to here.

00:47:59.015 --> 00:48:01.140 align:middle line:84%
Then she walked around for
another couple of months

00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:02.150 align:middle line:90%
doing that.

00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And then she got
rid of the crutches

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:06.940 align:middle line:84%
and was able to walk around
with these special braces,

00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:11.210 align:middle line:84%
but very slowly,
with difficulty.

00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:13.190 align:middle line:90%
Her son saw that and he left.

00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:16.760 align:middle line:84%
He figured, she's
OK now, and took off

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:20.350 align:middle line:84%
and went into the
Navy, I think it was,

00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:22.510 align:middle line:90%
one of the military things.

00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:25.930 align:middle line:84%
She was left alone now,
barely able to walk,

00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:26.730 align:middle line:90%
but walking around.

00:48:26.730 --> 00:48:28.940 align:middle line:84%
She did this for a
little while longer

00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:30.990 align:middle line:90%
till she got pretty good.

00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And she went down to
the motor vehicles

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:39.930 align:middle line:90%
and got a driver's license.

00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And then she went back
and sold her house.

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:48.360 align:middle line:84%
She went down and then
bought a brand new RV.

00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And she drove out to
New Mexico and walked

00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:54.047 align:middle line:90%
into one of my workshops.

00:48:54.047 --> 00:48:55.160 align:middle line:90%
>>Wow.

00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>And we had stairs in this
thing, about four of them.

00:48:57.410 --> 00:48:59.164 align:middle line:84%
And she walked up
and down the stairs.

00:48:59.164 --> 00:49:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And nobody helped
her or anything.

00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And she got back
down all on her own.

00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:05.360 align:middle line:84%
She didn't want
anybody to help her.

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And then she went to work
for Katrina as her secretary.

00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:12.670 align:middle line:84%
I then didn't see her for about
eight or nine more months.

00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:13.800 align:middle line:90%
She just disappeared.

00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:14.685 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see her.

00:49:14.685 --> 00:49:17.060 align:middle line:84%
One day, I'm walking down the
street of Taos, New Mexico,

00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:21.190 align:middle line:84%
and here comes this woman,
skipping down the street.

00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:22.060 align:middle line:90%
She walks up to me.

00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:22.593 align:middle line:90%
And I'm looking at her.

00:49:22.593 --> 00:49:23.393 align:middle line:90%
I say, Doris.

00:49:23.393 --> 00:49:25.280 align:middle line:90%
She says, look at me!

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:28.660 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:32.830 align:middle line:84%
She says, I am 100%
healed, totally normal.

00:49:32.830 --> 00:49:35.210 align:middle line:84%
You would have never
guessed, totally normal legs,

00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:36.010 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:38.710 align:middle line:90%
She says, I'm 100% healed.

00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And she skipped around a
little bit, did a little jig,

00:49:41.730 --> 00:49:43.320 align:middle line:90%
and gave me a big hug.

00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And she's just been a
good friend ever since.

00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:48.816 align:middle line:90%
She moved back East.

00:49:48.816 --> 00:49:50.410 align:middle line:90%
And I don't see her anymore.

00:49:50.410 --> 00:49:52.850 align:middle line:84%
She sends me a
postcard all the time.

00:49:52.850 --> 00:49:55.420 align:middle line:84%
She says me a Christmas
card every year.

00:49:55.420 --> 00:50:00.116 align:middle line:84%
But totally healed,
100%, of something

00:50:00.116 --> 00:50:03.440 align:middle line:84%
that was supposedly impossible,
all from just one thing,

00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:04.454 align:middle line:90%
your belief patterns.

00:50:04.454 --> 00:50:05.360 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else.

00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:12.260 align:middle line:90%


00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:14.162 align:middle line:84%
So are there any
questions on this?

00:50:14.162 --> 00:50:15.620 align:middle line:84%
I could keep going
for a long time.

00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:17.568 align:middle line:90%
But we've only got 45 minutes.

00:50:17.568 --> 00:50:18.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:21.517 align:middle line:84%
>>Why do you not need
to ask permission

00:50:21.517 --> 00:50:22.600 align:middle line:90%
for healing your children?

00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:26.990 align:middle line:84%
Aren't they souls of
their own free will

00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:29.870 align:middle line:84%
that may have their own
ways of working things out

00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:31.620 align:middle line:90%
that could be violated?

00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, if you feel that
way, you should probably ask.

00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:38.000 align:middle line:90%


00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.110 align:middle line:84%
For me, my feeling is
that they're in my care.

00:50:41.110 --> 00:50:42.860 align:middle line:84%
While they're in
my care, then it's

00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:47.200 align:middle line:84%
for me to take care of them
and that I have that right.

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:50.010 align:middle line:84%
But if you feel in
that way, then you

00:50:50.010 --> 00:50:52.550 align:middle line:90%
should ask permission first.

00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:54.687 align:middle line:84%
But I would only
feel that way toward

00:50:54.687 --> 00:50:56.770 align:middle line:84%
my own immediate children
that I'm taking care of.

00:50:56.770 --> 00:50:58.970 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't feel that way
if they were even older.

00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:01.280 align:middle line:84%
But when they're just a
little baby like that,

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:04.510 align:middle line:90%
I feel like it's-- I don't know.

00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:07.900 align:middle line:84%
I would ask the higher
self what to do.

00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:12.710 align:middle line:84%
But for me, I just felt
like I had that permission.

00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:15.540 align:middle line:84%
But I understand
what you're saying.

00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:16.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:17.680 align:middle line:90%
Do we have that?

00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:25.080 align:middle line:90%


00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:28.220 align:middle line:84%
>>When you ask the
question, do you

00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:31.090 align:middle line:90%
do it verbally or nonverbally?

00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:32.680 align:middle line:90%
>>What question?

00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>>If you're in a healing session
with someone and you're asking

00:51:36.090 --> 00:51:36.890 align:middle line:90%
if--

00:51:36.890 --> 00:51:38.365 align:middle line:90%
>>You ask the person verbally.

00:51:38.365 --> 00:51:41.380 align:middle line:84%
You ask their higher
self nonverbally.

00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:43.540 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:46.009 align:middle line:90%
What if their comatose?

00:51:46.009 --> 00:51:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>>That's a different situation.

00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And if they are, a
technique has been

00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:54.860 align:middle line:90%
given to me for that situation.

00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:56.920 align:middle line:90%
I'll give it to you.

00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
they told me to do.

00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And I have had a few
experience in this one.

00:52:02.570 --> 00:52:06.004 align:middle line:84%
If someone is-- you go along the
road and their unconsciousness,

00:52:06.004 --> 00:52:07.670 align:middle line:84%
they've just been in
an accident and you

00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:12.400 align:middle line:84%
can't ask their permission,
then you assume you've got it.

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And you ask their
higher self to come in.

00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And then you ask their higher
self, can I help this person.

00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:21.380 align:middle line:84%
If they get permission
from their higher self,

00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:22.180 align:middle line:90%
then proceed.

00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:24.150 align:middle line:84%
If you don't, then
just help them

00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:25.990 align:middle line:84%
to be comfortable and
take care of them,

00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:28.510 align:middle line:84%
but don't work on
any other level.

00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:30.563 align:middle line:84%
Even if it means letting
them die, it's OK.

00:52:30.563 --> 00:52:32.790 align:middle line:84%
It means it's what
they're supposed to do.

00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:35.980 align:middle line:84%
There is a technique, though,
that if you do get permission,

00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:38.050 align:middle line:84%
I know how you can
keep a person that

00:52:38.050 --> 00:52:40.910 align:middle line:84%
is unconscious
alive indefinitely

00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:44.630 align:middle line:84%
without any machines
or anything.

00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:47.970 align:middle line:84%
All you do is you see
their crystalline field.

00:52:47.970 --> 00:52:55.230 align:middle line:84%
You see, death is nothing
you but moving out of balance

00:52:55.230 --> 00:52:57.840 align:middle line:84%
toward either the North
or the South Pole.

00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:00.840 align:middle line:84%
If you move completely into
either one of the poles,

00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:02.556 align:middle line:90%
you die.

00:53:02.556 --> 00:53:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And unconscious means
that they're very

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:05.870 align:middle line:90%
close to one of those poles.

00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:07.990 align:middle line:90%
They're way out of balance.

00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:09.830 align:middle line:90%
It's a balance issue.

00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And so if you see their
tetrahedronal field,

00:53:15.130 --> 00:53:18.150 align:middle line:84%
and you then begin the
breathing with my own field,

00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:20.110 align:middle line:84%
but I time it to theirs
so that my breathing is

00:53:20.110 --> 00:53:21.840 align:middle line:90%
timed to their field.

00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And you begin doing the
first six breaths, which

00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:29.500 align:middle line:90%
is the polarity balancing.

00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And you just go one, two,
three, four, five, six,

00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:36.370 align:middle line:84%
come back to one,
and repeat it again.

00:53:36.370 --> 00:53:38.320 align:middle line:90%
And you keep doing that to them.

00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:41.750 align:middle line:84%
You keep that in there, with
their permission, their higher

00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:42.980 align:middle line:90%
self permission.

00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Then what happens is
that person cannot die.

00:53:45.550 --> 00:53:46.929 align:middle line:90%
They can't.

00:53:46.929 --> 00:53:48.220 align:middle line:90%
You're keeping them from dying.

00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:51.356 align:middle line:90%


00:53:51.356 --> 00:53:53.230 align:middle line:84%
But the only thing is,
you have to keep doing

00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:56.320 align:middle line:90%
that until they go conscious.

00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And then once they go
conscious, then you

00:53:58.570 --> 00:54:01.310 align:middle line:84%
switch to coming down with a
tube and get their flow going.

00:54:01.310 --> 00:54:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's usually
all you have to do.

00:54:05.110 --> 00:54:09.050 align:middle line:84%
However, it may not be more
than just a few minutes or days.

00:54:09.050 --> 00:54:10.514 align:middle line:90%
It may be more than one day.

00:54:10.514 --> 00:54:12.430 align:middle line:84%
And when I was approaching
with that situation

00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:16.380 align:middle line:84%
once, at the end of the
day, I was still doing it.

00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:17.816 align:middle line:90%
And I had to get some sleep.

00:54:17.816 --> 00:54:19.190 align:middle line:84%
My higher self
just set a program

00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:21.540 align:middle line:84%
that I was going to continue
doing it, and go to sleep,

00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:23.040 align:middle line:84%
and then pick it
up to this morning.

00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:24.220 align:middle line:90%
And it works.

00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And I put someone through
three days that way.

00:54:27.830 --> 00:54:29.353 align:middle line:90%
We were in a French hospital.

00:54:29.353 --> 00:54:32.150 align:middle line:84%
And they thought they were dead,
so much they put in a body bag

00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:34.830 align:middle line:90%
and put them over in the corner.

00:54:34.830 --> 00:54:39.422 align:middle line:84%
And we managed to bring him
back and get him back out just

00:54:39.422 --> 00:54:45.660 align:middle line:84%
by doing that for three
days long, But it works.

00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:50.400 align:middle line:90%
