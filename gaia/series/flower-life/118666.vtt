00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.500 align:middle line:84%
>>Hello, my name is
Drunvalo Melchizedek.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.390 align:middle line:84%
I'll be your guide during
this video presentation.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.430 align:middle line:84%
What you're about to see
is the journey of my life

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.010 align:middle line:84%
through this reality
of how I learned

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.092 align:middle line:84%
about God and the
relationships that we

00:00:46.092 --> 00:00:50.020 align:middle line:90%
have with all life, everywhere.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.885 align:middle line:84%
Through all of this,
I realized that Christ

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:55.290 align:middle line:84%
is in the eyes of every
person that stands before me,

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.960 align:middle line:84%
and Christ is in
your eyes, also.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.000 align:middle line:90%


00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.150 align:middle line:90%
This information is ancient.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.319 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very old.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:05.340 align:middle line:90%
It may seem new.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.343 align:middle line:84%
It may seem like something
you've never heard before,

00:01:09.343 --> 00:01:10.305 align:middle line:90%
but it isn't.

00:01:10.305 --> 00:01:12.950 align:middle line:84%
It's really old,
and then the truth

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.615 align:middle line:84%
is that you have it
all within you already.

00:01:15.615 --> 00:01:18.230 align:middle line:90%


00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.630 align:middle line:84%
Really, you remember things
that are so deep inside of you,

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.050 align:middle line:84%
or can remember these
things, and this

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.600 align:middle line:84%
is what this video is all
about-- to trigger these things

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.705 align:middle line:84%
so that you remember who you
are and why you came here

00:01:31.705 --> 00:01:34.590 align:middle line:84%
and what it's all about,
why you're on this Earth.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.020 align:middle line:90%


00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.138 align:middle line:84%
It is my prayer that this
be a blessing in your life

00:01:42.138 --> 00:01:46.780 align:middle line:84%
and that it open unto you
a whole new way of seeing

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.860 align:middle line:84%
the world, something brand
new and something very old.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:52.660 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.720 align:middle line:90%
I love you very much.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.590 align:middle line:84%
What you're about to see
is a video of information

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.730 align:middle line:84%
that has come from many, many,
many different directions

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.589 align:middle line:84%
within my own being,
and many people

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:22.130 align:middle line:84%
have asked me exactly
who it is or where

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.100 align:middle line:84%
did this information
come from, because it's

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.440 align:middle line:90%
a varied set of parameters.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And yet it comes together
into one big picture.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.130 align:middle line:84%
So just for the record,
and just for everyone

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.500 align:middle line:84%
to know who and
where this came from,

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.700 align:middle line:84%
and to give these
people credit, I

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:46.190 align:middle line:84%
would like to talk about
who my teachers were

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.194 align:middle line:90%
and where all of this came from.

00:04:49.194 --> 00:04:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And in order to
do this, I'm going

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.193 align:middle line:84%
to have to go all
the way back to when

00:04:52.193 --> 00:04:53.730 align:middle line:90%
I was a little, tiny kid.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And when I was really
little, I was Catholic,

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.850 align:middle line:84%
and I went through all the
Catholic schools, all the way

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.400 align:middle line:90%
up almost to the very end.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.536 align:middle line:84%
And through high
school, I didn't quite

00:05:05.536 --> 00:05:07.410 align:middle line:84%
make it through high
school, but I got almost

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.970 align:middle line:90%
through high school.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, Jesus
was the first person

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.960 align:middle line:84%
that has ever influenced
my life and through what

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.310 align:middle line:84%
is being transmitted
to you through here.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.560 align:middle line:84%
But as time went
on, in my early 20s,

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.780 align:middle line:84%
I began to see that
there was more,

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.640 align:middle line:84%
not that what Jesus had
to say was incomplete,

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.150 align:middle line:84%
only that I had a
longing for a larger

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.790 align:middle line:90%
picture of what was being said.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.460 align:middle line:90%
And I made a big switch.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:48.300 align:middle line:84%
I actually became Jewish, and
I began to study the Kabbalah

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.850 align:middle line:84%
and to see what that had
to say relative to what

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.100 align:middle line:90%
Jesus had to say.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And this went on
for a few years,

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.960 align:middle line:84%
until something
that began to happen

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.959 align:middle line:90%
in my life in the early '70s.

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:07.500 align:middle line:84%
First of all, probably the most
important thing that happened

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:13.630 align:middle line:84%
was I literally died
on April 10th of 1972,

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:19.560 align:middle line:84%
and in a single breath, part
of who I was, you could say,

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.900 align:middle line:90%
left here.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And in another breath,
when I breathed back in,

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.120 align:middle line:84%
the person who's
talking to you now

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.370 align:middle line:84%
began to breathe
through this body.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And that, of course, had a
big, big influence on my life.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:41.250 align:middle line:90%


00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.740 align:middle line:84%
At the same time
that that happened,

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.670 align:middle line:84%
there were these two angels
that appeared in my life.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.990 align:middle line:90%
They have no names.

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.050 align:middle line:84%
They were both
about 10 feet tall.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.920 align:middle line:84%
One of them was purple in color,
kind of an ultraviolet color,

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.740 align:middle line:90%
and the other was green.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And over the next few months, as
they would appear into the room

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.470 align:middle line:84%
and begin to talk
to me, they led me

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.042 align:middle line:84%
to many, many, many different
teachers around the world.

00:07:06.042 --> 00:07:07.750 align:middle line:84%
Some of them I physically
connected with.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.045 align:middle line:84%
Some of them I psychically
connected with,

00:07:10.045 --> 00:07:12.120 align:middle line:84%
and in various
ways, I communicated

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.910 align:middle line:84%
with many people, which
was probably about 70,

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:17.850 align:middle line:90%
though that's a guess.

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:20.530 align:middle line:90%


00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly enough,
they would actually

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.780 align:middle line:84%
give me the name, address,
and telephone number

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.119 align:middle line:84%
of who I was to connect with,
of whom my next teacher was.

00:07:30.119 --> 00:07:31.410 align:middle line:90%
It was kind of a funny feeling.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.457 align:middle line:84%
I remember in the beginning,
they would say, OK.

00:07:33.457 --> 00:07:34.790 align:middle line:90%
You're going to see this person.

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:36.123 align:middle line:90%
Here they are, and call them up.

00:07:36.123 --> 00:07:38.420 align:middle line:84%
So I'd just call them
up, and sure enough it

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:39.295 align:middle line:90%
would be that person.

00:07:39.295 --> 00:07:41.336 align:middle line:84%
It used to kind of blow
my mind in the beginning,

00:07:41.336 --> 00:07:42.270 align:middle line:90%
then I got used to it.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:45.180 align:middle line:90%


00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.600 align:middle line:84%
One of the very first people--
and it's someone no one's

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.500 align:middle line:84%
ever heard of, I'm sure-- and
his name was Wilf Chipman.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And he was an alchemist,
and they led me to him.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And I studied with him
for over two years,

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.440 align:middle line:90%
and I studied alchemy.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And he was an
extraordinary teacher.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.890 align:middle line:84%
He really knew what he was
doing on a lot of levels,

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:04.865 align:middle line:84%
and it was a very important
groundwork, especially out

00:08:04.865 --> 00:08:07.420 align:middle line:90%
of coming out of the Kabbalah.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:11.759 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time that I
working with Wilf Chipman,

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:14.050 align:middle line:84%
there was another person that
some of you may remember,

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:17.570 align:middle line:84%
which was Karpal Singh, and
I began to work through him

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:20.170 align:middle line:84%
and work with him
during that time.

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:24.870 align:middle line:84%
This was back in
probably about 1972.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:30.450 align:middle line:84%
At that same time,
I was brought to,

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:34.049 align:middle line:84%
or introduced into, the
Order of Melchizedek.

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:37.190 align:middle line:10%
This is actually Alpha and
Omega Order of Melchizedek,

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:42.690 align:middle line:10%
and it was the first order of
the Great White Brotherhood.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:45.530 align:middle line:10%
There are 72 orders in the
Great White Brotherhood,

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:48.520 align:middle line:10%
and my introduction was through
the first order, the oldest

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.890 align:middle line:10%
one, and also the
youngest order.

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:54.830 align:middle line:84%
The youngest order is the
Brotherhood of the Seven Rays,

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:57.870 align:middle line:84%
and so it's through
those, the two

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:03.110 align:middle line:84%
ends of the alpha and the
omega, that-- it would really

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.460 align:middle line:84%
be more appropriate to say
that they work through me

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.681 align:middle line:90%
than I work through them.

00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:09.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Brotherhood
of the Seven Rays

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:16.450 align:middle line:84%
is actually in Bolivia, very
near the border of Peru.

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:21.200 align:middle line:84%
The entry way is through
the Valley of the Blue Moon.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:25.950 align:middle line:84%
After that time, I became
involved very deeply in Sufism,

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:32.950 align:middle line:84%
and Sufism, which came out
of the Muslim tradition

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:37.320 align:middle line:84%
and the Quran maybe
about 700 years ago,

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.880 align:middle line:84%
was one of the
first religions that

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.770 align:middle line:84%
began to see that, really,
all religions are one.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:45.420 align:middle line:90%
They are all interconnected.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Of course, if you ask
a Buddhist or if you

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:52.160 align:middle line:84%
ask a Catholic or someone else
if there is interconnection,

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.240 align:middle line:90%
they'll say, no.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.050 align:middle line:84%
But if you study deeply
and go into the geometries

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:59.000 align:middle line:84%
of the inner aspects of
every religion, of all the

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.300 align:middle line:84%
eight major religions, they
are deeply interconnected.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And the Sufis saw
this a long time ago,

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:11.480 align:middle line:84%
and so it became my
path for about 11 years.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:15.040 align:middle line:10%
And the first teacher
that came to me

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:20.260 align:middle line:10%
was Hazrat Inayat Khan, who
brought Sufism to the West

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:24.830 align:middle line:10%
a long time ago, and then later,
through his son, Pierre Vilayat

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:26.570 align:middle line:10%
Khan.

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:28.170 align:middle line:10%
One of the most
important teachers

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:32.180 align:middle line:10%
that I had through all of this
was a man named Murshid Hassan,

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:36.010 align:middle line:10%
and Murshid Hassan was the
head of seven dervish orders.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:41.140 align:middle line:84%
He actually lives in a
concentration camp in Israel,

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:44.580 align:middle line:84%
though he is one of the most
respected people in Israel,

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.080 align:middle line:90%
at least in terms of Sufism.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And I spent not a long
time with this man.

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:58.565 align:middle line:84%
It was only a few weeks,
but he changed so many

00:10:58.565 --> 00:11:05.560 align:middle line:84%
of my viewpoints of how I
interpreted the reality.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.884 align:middle line:90%
He was about 90 years old.

00:11:06.884 --> 00:11:08.050 align:middle line:90%
He was a skinny, little man.

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:09.120 align:middle line:90%
He was very healthy.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, I
was into macrobiotics,

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:15.650 align:middle line:84%
and I was extremely
strict about what I ate

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:18.770 align:middle line:90%
and all that kind of thing.

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, this
teacher comes in,

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.570 align:middle line:84%
who affected me on
a very deep level

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:27.640 align:middle line:90%
just by being in his presence.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And as I watched
him work, he just

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:31.820 align:middle line:84%
began to destroy
everything that I thought

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:33.330 align:middle line:90%
was true on a lot of levels.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:35.160 align:middle line:84%
I thought that the
food was so important,

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.040 align:middle line:90%
and it is, in certain ways.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.760 align:middle line:84%
But I watched a man
here who, for two weeks,

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.562 align:middle line:84%
I never saw him eat a single
bite of food, nothing.

00:11:43.562 --> 00:11:45.770 align:middle line:84%
He may have snuck something
in his room or something.

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:48.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, but I didn't
see him eat anything.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:52.810 align:middle line:84%
But what I did see him do was
he took a cup, about this big,

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:56.130 align:middle line:84%
put about half filled
with pure white sugar,

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:58.700 align:middle line:84%
pour this thick coffee
into it, and smoke

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.290 align:middle line:84%
these long cigarettes,
these brown cigarettes.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And all he did was drink
this sugar-coffee water

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.020 align:middle line:90%
and these cigarettes.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:06.880 align:middle line:84%
It was the only
thing he ever ate,

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:12.440 align:middle line:84%
and yet his light that came
off of him was incredible.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.170 align:middle line:90%
He loved children.

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:18.510 align:middle line:84%
He saw children as the
true teachers of the world,

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:20.600 align:middle line:84%
and if someone would bring
a child into the room,

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.750 align:middle line:84%
he would be sitting
on the stage with 100,

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:23.886 align:middle line:90%
200 people around him.

00:12:23.886 --> 00:12:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And if someone brought
a child into the room,

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.030 align:middle line:90%
he would just stop.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:30.400 align:middle line:84%
He would get down off of his
chair where he was teaching

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.230 align:middle line:84%
and have the child put on
the chair because he said,

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:37.730 align:middle line:90%
this is truly our real teachers.

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:42.710 align:middle line:84%
There were other Sufi
teachers that influenced me.

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:45.960 align:middle line:10%
One was Murshid Isa, who
has the circle of friends

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:49.930 align:middle line:10%
from around the world,
and Murshid Sam Lewis,

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:52.760 align:middle line:10%
who was a very important
teacher of mine.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:56.200 align:middle line:90%


00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.000 align:middle line:10%
I love them all.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.750 align:middle line:90%


00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:04.010 align:middle line:84%
I also became involved in
Hinduism in lots of ways,

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:05.830 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know if
I could even begin

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.480 align:middle line:84%
to bring up all the
different aspects of that.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.390 align:middle line:10%
I was very closely
connected to Yogananda,

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:15.790 align:middle line:10%
and I still love this man,
who was also interconnected

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:18.150 align:middle line:10%
with the Order of Melchizedek.

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:20.080 align:middle line:10%
And probably not
very many people

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.260 align:middle line:10%
from the Self-Realization
Foundation know that,

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.340 align:middle line:10%
but he was, and
also Sri Yukteswar,

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:30.330 align:middle line:10%
which was Yogananda's teacher
and who has recently given me

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:33.510 align:middle line:10%
a great deal of information.

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:36.410 align:middle line:84%
Also Bhajan Sri
Wajani, you know,

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:39.960 align:middle line:84%
I know he's [INAUDIBLE] a
lot of people on that one,

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.870 align:middle line:84%
for his presence in
the United States.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:45.170 align:middle line:84%
He was primarily
a Daoist teacher,

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:47.674 align:middle line:84%
and he used himself
as an example.

00:13:47.674 --> 00:13:49.590 align:middle line:84%
So here's a man who comes
to the United States

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and has something like
200 Mercedes-Benz,

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:53.534 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is,
or Rolls Royces,

00:13:53.534 --> 00:13:54.700 align:middle line:90%
and everybody's saying, wow.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.630 align:middle line:84%
He's just totally
into materialism.

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:59.590 align:middle line:84%
But what he was doing was
showing, through his own being,

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:03.290 align:middle line:84%
exactly what we were
doing and using himself.

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:05.470 align:middle line:84%
If you understand Daoism,
you'll understand what

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:06.594 align:middle line:90%
he was doing as a teaching.

00:14:06.594 --> 00:14:09.070 align:middle line:90%


00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:13.520 align:middle line:84%
I was real close with Ram Dass,
from the very, very beginning,

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.310 align:middle line:90%
and I really love this man also.

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:20.640 align:middle line:84%
He taught me that I can
just use myself openly,

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.390 align:middle line:84%
and anything that
happens in my life,

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:25.905 align:middle line:84%
I can use that
openly, without fear.

00:14:25.905 --> 00:14:27.280 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
instead of trying

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.910 align:middle line:84%
to protect your image of
who you think you are,

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:middle line:90%
just let God do it.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And open up, and
just be who you are.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And don't worry about what
anyone thinks or anything else.

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And it was very, very powerful,
what Ram Dass gave to me.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:47.710 align:middle line:84%
I also spent a long time-- well,
not a long time, but a couple

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:51.385 align:middle line:84%
years-- at Lama Foundation,
where Ram Dass taught a lot,

00:14:51.385 --> 00:14:52.760 align:middle line:84%
and there were
many teachers that

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.810 align:middle line:84%
came through there
that influenced me

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:57.360 align:middle line:90%
in what happened here.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.900 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the very act of
living at Lama Foundation

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.010 align:middle line:84%
was a great deal a
part of this teaching.

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:08.240 align:middle line:10%
In more recent times, Sai
Baba has been very involved

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.860 align:middle line:10%
in what we're doing.

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.865 align:middle line:10%
He is involved with
something that's

00:15:13.865 --> 00:15:15.740 align:middle line:10%
called the Tri-Phase,
which we don't actually

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:16.720 align:middle line:10%
get into here yet.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:19.210 align:middle line:84%
It's a higher
level of this work.

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And his work is important
to what we are doing.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:31.800 align:middle line:84%
While I was at Lama, I even
became Muslim for about a year.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:37.130 align:middle line:84%
I did Salah five
times a day, and I

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:39.190 align:middle line:84%
passed through all
the various aspects

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:42.965 align:middle line:84%
and studied the Quran to
see how they saw the world

00:15:42.965 --> 00:15:44.420 align:middle line:90%
and where they were coming from.

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's very beautiful,
their point of view.

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:50.850 align:middle line:90%


00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:54.761 align:middle line:84%
I really love what they
have to offer to the world.

00:15:54.761 --> 00:15:57.530 align:middle line:84%
The Tibetans played
a very important part

00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:59.600 align:middle line:90%
in understanding the role.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.230 align:middle line:10%
The Tibetans probably know
more about the Merkaba

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:05.360 align:middle line:10%
than anyone else in the world,
though Sai Baba is getting

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:10.320 align:middle line:10%
very close to it right now,
and the biggest teacher

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:13.320 align:middle line:10%
that I had through
Tibet was Kalu Rinpoche,

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:18.820 align:middle line:10%
who died not too long ago but
is now back in human form.

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:24.410 align:middle line:10%
He's just a child right
now, and he was my greatest

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:25.530 align:middle line:10%
Tibetan teacher.

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:26.970 align:middle line:90%
I will always say that.

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:32.430 align:middle line:84%
I love him, though I had
to study with other ones.

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:35.480 align:middle line:84%
I had to go to Boulder and study
with Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:38.750 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really
like that very much.

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:41.945 align:middle line:84%
It was a lifetime of chaos
for him, that he was teaching,

00:16:41.945 --> 00:16:45.060 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't real comfortable
to be in his teachings.

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:46.580 align:middle line:84%
But they were
important teachings,

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:49.630 align:middle line:84%
and I needed to learn
what that was about.

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:52.190 align:middle line:84%
There was a little bit
of Tarthang Tulku also

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:56.470 align:middle line:84%
that was involved in Tibet,
but mostly Kalu Rinpoche

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:59.860 align:middle line:90%
had the strongest effect on me.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:03.750 align:middle line:84%
I have studied Daoism
for a long time,

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:06.720 align:middle line:84%
and my main teacher in
there was Master Chu Fang

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.589 align:middle line:84%
Chu, who taught me
the Daoist breathing

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:13.280 align:middle line:84%
and the breath and
the chi and the power

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.839 align:middle line:90%
that comes through the breath.

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:19.930 align:middle line:84%
His understanding, to me,
was really, really important,

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:23.520 align:middle line:84%
and the I Ching, itself, though
it appears to just be a book,

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.819 align:middle line:84%
is much more than that
once it's understood.

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:28.890 align:middle line:84%
It's an exact
replica of the DNA,

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:35.850 align:middle line:84%
and that I spent a
long time studying.

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:41.330 align:middle line:84%
I feel, through almost all
of this various religious

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:43.640 align:middle line:84%
teachings, that
Daoism is probably

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:50.920 align:middle line:84%
the closest thing that I feel
is the closest to my heart.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.925 align:middle line:84%
There have been many
psychic and channels that

00:17:53.925 --> 00:17:56.045 align:middle line:90%
have entered into this work.

00:17:56.045 --> 00:18:00.280 align:middle line:90%


00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:03.190 align:middle line:84%
One, for example, was
Bashar, out of Los Angeles.

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:06.740 align:middle line:10%
That's the actual person that
comes through the channel,

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:10.369 align:middle line:10%
and Bashar is actually
one of the Greys, which

00:18:10.369 --> 00:18:11.410 align:middle line:10%
we will be talking about.

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:12.451 align:middle line:90%
He's not actually a Grey.

00:18:12.451 --> 00:18:15.560 align:middle line:84%
He's one of the races that
was derived from the Greys,

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.900 align:middle line:84%
coming from the future,
300 years from our future,

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:22.960 align:middle line:84%
coming back here to help correct
some of the anomalies that

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.030 align:middle line:90%
have happened here.

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And his work was very
interesting to me

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:31.870 align:middle line:84%
and what he has to
say, though I have

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:37.190 align:middle line:84%
to admit that probably the
biggest influence-- or one

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:38.610 align:middle line:84%
of the biggest
influences, put it

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:43.210 align:middle line:84%
that way-- that have affected me
has been the Native Americans.

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:45.060 align:middle line:84%
I have 12 Native
American teachers.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.910 align:middle line:90%


00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:49.790 align:middle line:84%
A couple of those I
have not even met yet.

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:51.930 align:middle line:84%
They're still coming
in the future,

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:55.840 align:middle line:84%
but I know that that number
is how many there are.

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.112 align:middle line:10%
The first one, and
the most powerful one

00:18:58.112 --> 00:19:00.070 align:middle line:10%
that has ever come to
me, was Grandfather David

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:01.890 align:middle line:10%
from the Hopi Tribe,
who held the Hopi

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:04.620 align:middle line:10%
prophecy for a long time.

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:08.400 align:middle line:10%
And what he had to
teach me and give to me

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.970 align:middle line:10%
was essential in all of this.

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:16.400 align:middle line:10%
From there also, in the Taos
Tribe in Taos, New Mexico,

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.880 align:middle line:10%
was Tellus Good Morning, who
was the head of the Peyote

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:25.080 align:middle line:10%
Tribe out of Taos, and
his son, Jimmy Reyna.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:28.280 align:middle line:10%
And those two,
especially Jimmy Reyna,

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:31.080 align:middle line:10%
have played a
really crucial role.

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.990 align:middle line:84%
I studied with Jimmy
Reyna almost for 14 years,

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:38.400 align:middle line:84%
and the way that he would
teach and what he would show me

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:43.610 align:middle line:84%
and how everything was through
the Native American eyes

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:48.210 align:middle line:84%
is essential in what is
being presented here.

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:50.070 align:middle line:84%
Though Tellus Good
Morning and Jimmy Reyna

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:53.660 align:middle line:84%
were very important
teachers in the sense

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:57.090 align:middle line:84%
that I worked directly with
them on a day-to-day basis,

00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:59.910 align:middle line:84%
two of the most important,
even on other levels,

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:02.420 align:middle line:84%
more important, people
from the Taos Pueblo

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.320 align:middle line:84%
were Juan Concha
and Cradleflower.

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:09.090 align:middle line:10%
They were brother and
sister, and Juan Concha

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:11.560 align:middle line:10%
was the chief of the Taos
Tribe until the Bureau

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.930 align:middle line:10%
of Indian Affairs came in and
didn't allow that anymore.

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:18.730 align:middle line:10%
And they made a governor and
a board of directors, kind of,

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:21.920 align:middle line:10%
and when they did,
they took Juan Concha

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:25.530 align:middle line:10%
and made him the cacique
or the religious leader.

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And Juan Concha came to
my house for over 35 years

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.890 align:middle line:84%
before he died, every
single year, usually

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:36.192 align:middle line:84%
at Christmas time,
and I never knew why

00:20:36.192 --> 00:20:37.400 align:middle line:90%
these guys were coming there.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.105 align:middle line:84%
Every year, there would be ham
and for or five Indians that

00:20:40.105 --> 00:20:43.406 align:middle line:84%
would sit down and eat dinner
with us, and I was going,

00:20:43.406 --> 00:20:44.530 align:middle line:90%
who are these guys, anyway?

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:46.115 align:middle line:84%
You know, and after a while,
you just sort of assume

00:20:46.115 --> 00:20:47.250 align:middle line:90%
they're there.

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:49.380 align:middle line:84%
But he was just
making sure that he

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:51.260 align:middle line:84%
knew where I was all
the time because we

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:56.490 align:middle line:84%
had an agreement, going all the
way back until the year 1890.

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And there were things
that I had to do

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:02.060 align:middle line:84%
for them, which
you will understand

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:07.200 align:middle line:90%
as this video unfolds.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:13.350 align:middle line:10%
Cradleflower, his sister,
she was a medicine woman,

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:16.590 align:middle line:10%
and she taught me so
much on so many levels.

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:19.484 align:middle line:10%
Every time that I needed
to communicate with her--

00:21:19.484 --> 00:21:20.900 align:middle line:10%
or put it this
way, every time she

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.859 align:middle line:10%
wanted to communicate with
me-- she would send a crow.

00:21:23.859 --> 00:21:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And the crow would
come to my window,

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.370 align:middle line:84%
and it would just keep
pecking on my window

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:29.790 align:middle line:84%
until I would get on the
phone and call her or go down.

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.902 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't leave
until I'd go there,

00:21:31.902 --> 00:21:34.110 align:middle line:84%
and then when I'd get there
and show up at her house,

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:36.215 align:middle line:84%
she'd say, well, did
you see the crow?

00:21:36.215 --> 00:21:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'd go, yeah, and
then she'd tell me.

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:41.490 align:middle line:90%
And it's an interesting world.

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:44.020 align:middle line:90%


00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:52.290 align:middle line:84%
The area of sacred geometry is
an area where great influence

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:56.110 align:middle line:84%
has come in also, but you must
understand that I didn't even

00:21:56.110 --> 00:22:00.300 align:middle line:84%
know what sacred geometry
was for many years

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:01.290 align:middle line:90%
in the beginning.

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:04.980 align:middle line:84%
These were just images that were
coming to me from the angels,

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:06.940 align:middle line:84%
and I was just
copying them down.

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And I would get great
understanding from them,

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:11.555 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't know that
there were other people that

00:22:11.555 --> 00:22:12.580 align:middle line:90%
had studied this before.

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:16.200 align:middle line:84%
I thought this was something
just I knew, but eventually,

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.554 align:middle line:84%
many years down
the line, I began

00:22:18.554 --> 00:22:20.720 align:middle line:84%
to realize that other people
had studied this thing,

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.460 align:middle line:84%
and I started working and
studying with other people.

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And there were certain people,
like Robert Lawlor and Keith

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:28.390 align:middle line:84%
Critchlow and their work,
which was very instrumental,

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:31.990 align:middle line:84%
and Buckminster Fuller,
of course, Stan Tenen

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:33.930 align:middle line:84%
and the language work
that he has done,

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:37.750 align:middle line:84%
and Derald Langham's work
was very, very powerful

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:40.580 align:middle line:84%
in understanding the
relationship of geometries

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:41.910 align:middle line:90%
to life.

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And people like Dan Winter,
and there are many other people

00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:48.330 align:middle line:84%
that have-- Bob
Gulick, I don't know

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:50.900 align:middle line:84%
if I can remember them all,
but there are many people that

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:55.110 align:middle line:84%
have come in here and
have shown me things

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:58.680 align:middle line:84%
about sacred geometry
that have even added to,

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.880 align:middle line:84%
though most of this
work you're going to see

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:04.240 align:middle line:90%
came before I knew any of this.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And probably the person who has
influenced the geometry more

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:14.360 align:middle line:84%
than anyone else,
and more information

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.960 align:middle line:84%
is coming from this one person
than just about anyone else,

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.670 align:middle line:84%
especially around the
area of sacred geometry,

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:25.290 align:middle line:84%
was someone who is
still alive, though he

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:27.939 align:middle line:90%
was born 52,000 years ago.

00:23:27.939 --> 00:23:30.230 align:middle line:10%
I know that's going to be
pretty hard TO sink in there,

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:36.750 align:middle line:10%
but his name Thoth, T-H-O-T-H.
At least that was his name

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:38.450 align:middle line:10%
during the time of Egypt.

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:41.130 align:middle line:10%
I'll be talking about
him pretty soon,

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:44.450 align:middle line:10%
and you'll know more about
this particular person.

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:47.350 align:middle line:84%
But he's extraordinary, and
he's been helping people

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:52.470 align:middle line:84%
all over the world to understand
the deeper levels of what

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:54.830 align:middle line:90%
life is really about.

00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And I guess in the
area of science,

00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:02.060 align:middle line:84%
there's been one person
who has dramatically

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:06.280 align:middle line:84%
affected many of the ways of my
interpretation of the reality

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:10.610 align:middle line:84%
through science, and this was
a man named Bob Dratch who

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:12.370 align:middle line:90%
lives in Colorado.

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And his work is incredible
because he is understood

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:18.290 align:middle line:84%
and now understands the
relationship of what's

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:20.690 align:middle line:90%
called waveform and reality.

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:24.390 align:middle line:84%
It's the unfoldment
of a zero point,

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:27.740 align:middle line:90%
which is how a womb works.

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:31.760 align:middle line:84%
How creation actually comes
into being is at this moment

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:35.390 align:middle line:84%
being understood by the world,
though not too many people

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:40.880 align:middle line:84%
talk about it, and so his
work has been very powerful.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.170 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sure there's
probably other people

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:44.870 align:middle line:84%
that I'm leaving
out, and to them, I'm

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:49.420 align:middle line:84%
sorry if I haven't at this
moment come up with your names.

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:55.520 align:middle line:84%
But this is a list of most
of the people and areas that

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:59.320 align:middle line:84%
have influenced what you're
about to see, so thank you.

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:02.820 align:middle line:90%


00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:07.470 align:middle line:84%
Because there is one
crucial aspect of this,

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:12.840 align:middle line:84%
and that is that about
13,000 years ago,

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.240 align:middle line:90%
something happened on Earth.

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:19.638 align:middle line:84%
And it actually started
about 16,000 years ago,

00:25:19.638 --> 00:25:22.402 align:middle line:84%
but the actual
physical event was just

00:25:22.402 --> 00:25:24.030 align:middle line:90%
under 13,000 years ago.

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:24.940 align:middle line:90%
We did something.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:28.510 align:middle line:84%
We changed the way we breathe,
which I will talk about

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:35.270 align:middle line:84%
in detail, and the direct effect
of that change in breathing

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:39.460 align:middle line:84%
pattern is something called
good and evil consciousness,

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:43.700 align:middle line:84%
where we perceive ourselves
as being inside of a body,

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:47.660 align:middle line:84%
looking out at what appears to
be totally separate from you,

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:49.145 align:middle line:90%
which is completely an illusion.

00:25:49.145 --> 00:25:55.085 align:middle line:84%
There's no truth in that at all,
but it appears that way to us.

00:25:55.085 --> 00:25:59.988 align:middle line:84%
And our right brain, which
is the aspect of us that

00:25:59.988 --> 00:26:07.220 align:middle line:84%
is feminine and that controls
the left side of our body,

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:11.920 align:middle line:84%
it is pretty much
in tune, actually.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:16.630 align:middle line:84%
It is aware that
there is only one God

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:20.440 align:middle line:84%
and that kind of everything is
OK, though it can't tell you.

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:22.306 align:middle line:84%
It can't really
explain to you why,

00:26:22.306 --> 00:26:26.305 align:middle line:84%
but the left side
of our brain, which

00:26:26.305 --> 00:26:29.300 align:middle line:84%
controls the right side of our
body, the male aspect of us,

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:33.457 align:middle line:84%
this is where the
real problem lies.

00:26:33.457 --> 00:26:37.290 align:middle line:84%
Pretty much everyone
agrees on this.

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:40.040 align:middle line:84%
Our left brain, the
logical side of us,

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:43.610 align:middle line:84%
looks outside of the
universe and sees everything

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:46.740 align:middle line:90%
polarized, separated.

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:48.906 align:middle line:84%
And there's black and white,
and there's up and down

00:26:48.906 --> 00:26:50.175 align:middle line:90%
and male and female.

00:26:50.175 --> 00:26:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And there's the inside
and the outside,

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:55.280 align:middle line:84%
and there's the good and the
bad and all these things.

00:26:55.280 --> 00:27:01.225 align:middle line:84%
And so your left brain does
not see the unity of life

00:27:01.225 --> 00:27:04.550 align:middle line:84%
and does not really believe
that there's only one God.

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:07.988 align:middle line:84%
It may even say the words,
I believe there is one God.

00:27:07.988 --> 00:27:09.487 align:middle line:84%
But inside there
is this little part

00:27:09.487 --> 00:27:13.524 align:middle line:84%
that's got this doubt
because there's the good guy.

00:27:13.524 --> 00:27:15.020 align:middle line:84%
There's God, and
there's the devil.

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.681 align:middle line:84%
There's all these
separated aspects of us.

00:27:17.681 --> 00:27:21.050 align:middle line:90%


00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And so these first
three and a half,

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:30.130 align:middle line:84%
four days, the main
purpose is to clearly show

00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:35.490 align:middle line:84%
your logical side that
there is an absolute unity

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:39.412 align:middle line:84%
to the reality and that you are
an intimate part of that unity

00:27:39.412 --> 00:27:42.280 align:middle line:90%
and that there is only one God.

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:45.980 align:middle line:84%
It's essential in the sense
that once your left brain

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:49.550 align:middle line:84%
sees that and
understands it, then

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:53.560 align:middle line:84%
it begins to interlock between
and integrate between the left

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:54.820 align:middle line:90%
and right brain.

00:27:54.820 --> 00:28:00.816 align:middle line:84%
And the pineal gland is then
capable of functioning again,

00:28:00.816 --> 00:28:04.314 align:middle line:84%
because at the moment your
pineal gland is-- well,

00:28:04.314 --> 00:28:05.980 align:middle line:84%
it does have a little
bit of functioning

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:08.290 align:middle line:84%
through linear light that
passes through the eyes

00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:09.751 align:middle line:84%
and goes through
the hypothalamus

00:28:09.751 --> 00:28:11.020 align:middle line:90%
and into the pineal gland.

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And so you have a certain
amount of functioning

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:17.180 align:middle line:84%
of the pineal gland,
but it's true purpose

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:20.480 align:middle line:84%
is to receive light,
to receive prana,

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:21.940 align:middle line:90%
which is another form of light.

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:24.820 align:middle line:84%
But it's primarily
higher dimensional light,

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:27.504 align:middle line:84%
and it can't do
that at the moment.

00:28:27.504 --> 00:28:29.920 align:middle line:84%
Once this integration between
the left and the right brain

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.870 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] place,
then your pineal gland

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:40.456 align:middle line:84%
is capable of doing something,
of receiving this pranic light.

00:28:40.456 --> 00:28:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And then the
meditation is possible.

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:47.180 align:middle line:84%
So if someone were to
just do this meditation

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:50.040 align:middle line:84%
in this particular
state, without having

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:53.490 align:middle line:84%
the understanding of
these first four days,

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:57.094 align:middle line:84%
it's highly unlikely that they
would get very much out of it,

00:28:57.094 --> 00:28:59.030 align:middle line:84%
even if they were
doing it perfectly,

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:06.431 align:middle line:84%
because they've got a block,
a shield that's blocking that

00:29:06.431 --> 00:29:07.494 align:middle line:90%
from working.

00:29:07.494 --> 00:29:09.910 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we have to go
through so much of this stuff,

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:10.993 align:middle line:90%
and I don't like to do it.

00:29:10.993 --> 00:29:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And most people don't even like
to watch it because it's hard,

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:15.810 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's mathematics
and all this stuff,

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:22.990 align:middle line:84%
but that's who we're talking
to, is your male side,

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:26.670 align:middle line:90%
is this male knowledge.

00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's also super condensed,
which makes it harder.

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:35.330 align:middle line:84%
This was given only one other
time in the world's history,

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:38.420 align:middle line:84%
at least in the
last 13,000 years,

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:41.160 align:middle line:84%
and that was in Egypt
during the 18th Dynasty.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.795 align:middle line:84%
And it was only given
for 17 and 1/2 years

00:29:43.795 --> 00:29:46.400 align:middle line:90%
in a short period of time.

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:49.110 align:middle line:84%
There, it took them
12 years to present

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:51.996 align:middle line:84%
what we're giving you
in about four days,

00:29:51.996 --> 00:29:57.580 align:middle line:84%
and so you're getting a
super condensed, very rapid

00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:01.080 align:middle line:90%
presentation of this.

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.723 align:middle line:84%
So I can understand
why some of you

00:30:02.723 --> 00:30:05.410 align:middle line:84%
come back two or three
times, trying to get,

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:06.900 align:middle line:90%
what was that he said?

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a lot,
I know it's a lot.

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:12.190 align:middle line:90%


00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:23.340 align:middle line:84%
OK, the other
thing about this is

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:29.420 align:middle line:84%
that if you just
come here and listen

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:31.130 align:middle line:84%
to what I have to
say and then go home

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:33.560 align:middle line:84%
and practice the
meditation kind of thing,

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:37.020 align:middle line:84%
you'll kind of be missing
the point in a way

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:41.390 align:middle line:84%
because what we're really
talking about here, what you

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:44.760 align:middle line:84%
might say is group
consciousness, consciousness

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:50.410 align:middle line:84%
beyond your individual
self, because as you go up

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:53.020 align:middle line:84%
in consciousness, you keep
coming to these places where

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:56.610 align:middle line:84%
you will realize that you
merge with, you would say,

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:57.697 align:middle line:90%
zillions of other souls.

00:30:57.697 --> 00:31:00.030 align:middle line:84%
It just keeps going on on
these higher and higher levels

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:03.410 align:middle line:84%
of awareness, and you have
to lose your identity.

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:06.140 align:middle line:84%
It's very much like if
you look at your body.

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:09.200 align:middle line:84%
Your body is always
this little microcosm

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.399 align:middle line:84%
that reflects the
macrocosm and all that is,

00:31:12.399 --> 00:31:16.130 align:middle line:84%
and you've got about 100
trillion cells in your body.

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:17.470 align:middle line:90%
And they're all like people.

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:20.011 align:middle line:84%
They have different sizes, and
they have different functions.

00:31:20.011 --> 00:31:21.734 align:middle line:84%
And they're in
different regions,

00:31:21.734 --> 00:31:23.942 align:middle line:84%
and you might say, like,
different dimensional levels

00:31:23.942 --> 00:31:25.110 align:middle line:90%
and places and things.

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And they all work
together as a whole,

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:31.880 align:middle line:84%
but there is this kind
of over-person, you,

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:33.680 align:middle line:90%
that's beyond all of that.

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:37.180 align:middle line:84%
And coming up through the
levels is like a single.

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:39.790 align:middle line:84%
You're like a single
cell down here,

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:43.440 align:middle line:84%
about to go up through the
various levels, and if you do,

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:46.910 align:middle line:84%
you will merge with tissues
and then organs and higher

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:49.930 align:middle line:84%
and higher levels of the
body, until you become

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:54.640 align:middle line:84%
this-- like, really, what
we're referring to as God

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:57.150 align:middle line:90%
is like me relative to a cell.

00:31:57.150 --> 00:32:01.030 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, there's more
beyond what we call God.

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:06.940 align:middle line:84%
Our levels of what we are,
concepts of God are limited,

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:10.190 align:middle line:84%
but nevertheless, we
have to reach as far

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:15.200 align:middle line:84%
as our limits will take us,
whatever our possibilities are.

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
about to happen to us.

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:22.460 align:middle line:84%
We're about to go up
from a cell to a person,

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:28.426 align:middle line:84%
make a huge leap in awareness,
and it's going to be a big one.

00:32:28.426 --> 00:32:31.919 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
happen quick, real soon.

00:32:31.919 --> 00:32:38.905 align:middle line:90%


00:32:38.905 --> 00:32:40.901 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:40.901 --> 00:32:41.899 align:middle line:90%
The sooner the better.

00:32:41.899 --> 00:32:47.910 align:middle line:90%


00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:51.979 align:middle line:84%
This group consciousness thing
needs to be reflected here,

00:32:51.979 --> 00:33:00.520 align:middle line:84%
and if at this time we can
begin to merge with this group--

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:02.240 align:middle line:84%
just, we've got to
start somewhere.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:05.091 align:middle line:84%
We've all come from
all over the place.

00:33:05.091 --> 00:33:06.632 align:middle line:84%
People are here from
Hawaii, England,

00:33:06.632 --> 00:33:09.830 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know where else,
all over, from various places

00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:11.810 align:middle line:90%
around the United States.

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:14.945 align:middle line:84%
But what I do know
about these groups

00:33:14.945 --> 00:33:17.300 align:middle line:90%
is that each one comes here.

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:20.660 align:middle line:84%
I can almost say for certain
if you are here at this time,

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:22.880 align:middle line:84%
you all have
connections together.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:25.838 align:middle line:90%


00:33:25.838 --> 00:33:28.056 align:middle line:84%
You may be surprised
how much you

00:33:28.056 --> 00:33:31.261 align:middle line:84%
have in common on
certain levels,

00:33:31.261 --> 00:33:33.650 align:middle line:84%
and if you were to go
back into past lives,

00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:38.475 align:middle line:84%
you may be seeing how many
times you have interwoven

00:33:38.475 --> 00:33:41.125 align:middle line:90%
with each other before.

00:33:41.125 --> 00:33:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And you've all been around
a long time, most of you,

00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:55.100 align:middle line:84%
and I can almost say with
certainty that you all

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:58.510 align:middle line:84%
have more than likely walked
into your bodies, though not

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:02.524 align:middle line:84%
necessarily, at some
time in your life.

00:34:02.524 --> 00:34:06.476 align:middle line:84%
And you are almost more than
likely interdimensional beings.

00:34:06.476 --> 00:34:10.428 align:middle line:84%
You've come from another
dimension, not another planet,

00:34:10.428 --> 00:34:12.898 align:middle line:90%
another consciousness level.

00:34:12.898 --> 00:34:15.368 align:middle line:84%
And you've come down here
for a purposeful reason,

00:34:15.368 --> 00:34:18.414 align:middle line:84%
because that's
primarily what one

00:34:18.414 --> 00:34:20.670 align:middle line:84%
of my main purposes
of communicating

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:25.964 align:middle line:84%
to these groups like this
is, to act as a catalyst

00:34:25.964 --> 00:34:29.227 align:middle line:84%
to remind you of who you are
so that your memories can come

00:34:29.227 --> 00:34:30.027 align:middle line:90%
back.

00:34:30.027 --> 00:34:32.574 align:middle line:84%
And you can remember
where you came from

00:34:32.574 --> 00:34:36.435 align:middle line:84%
and why you came here
and these kind of things

00:34:36.435 --> 00:34:40.219 align:middle line:84%
because this is important, for
you to finish what you do here.

00:34:40.219 --> 00:34:49.080 align:middle line:84%
My background is mostly in
mathematics and physics.

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:51.820 align:middle line:90%
That's what I started out.

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:54.525 align:middle line:84%
I got within a few days
of graduating and that.

00:34:54.525 --> 00:34:56.916 align:middle line:84%
I had one quarter
left-- that was

00:34:56.916 --> 00:34:58.790 align:middle line:84%
at the University of
California in Berkeley--

00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:02.240 align:middle line:84%
when I decided that that's
not what I wanted to do.

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And I switched from the left
brain to the right brain

00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:06.590 align:middle line:84%
and went into fine
arts and painting,

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:08.564 align:middle line:90%
and they thought I was crazy.

00:35:08.564 --> 00:35:09.548 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I was.

00:35:09.548 --> 00:35:11.000 align:middle line:90%
I don't know, but I did it.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And it took me two
more years to graduate.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.850 align:middle line:84%
But I can see the
wisdom in that now

00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:20.120 align:middle line:84%
and why I did that, though
I couldn't understanding,

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:21.610 align:middle line:84%
even at the time,
why I was doing

00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:25.510 align:middle line:84%
what I did because when you look
at what's on the screen here,

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:31.150 align:middle line:84%
you'll see it's an integration
of art and science, mathematics

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:38.110 align:middle line:84%
and religion, which is what all
of the ancients all tell you,

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:41.190 align:middle line:84%
is that those three things
are all interrelated.

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Art, from a long time ago, was
not expressionistic type art

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:46.090 align:middle line:90%
that we have now.

00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:51.820 align:middle line:84%
It was a very holy thing
that was done and sacred,

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:55.020 align:middle line:84%
but at this point, of course,
it could be almost anything.

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:59.240 align:middle line:90%


00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:04.140 align:middle line:84%
In my own life, I was,
like everyone else,

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:07.140 align:middle line:84%
trying to figure out why we
were here and what was going on.

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:10.304 align:middle line:90%


00:36:10.304 --> 00:36:13.070 align:middle line:84%
I went into the military
when I was really young,

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:14.160 align:middle line:90%
thinking that might help.

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:17.610 align:middle line:90%


00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:20.760 align:middle line:84%
It did, actually, because
I ended up in Vietnam.

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:23.760 align:middle line:84%
I spent 13 months there,
long before everything

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:27.310 align:middle line:84%
started happening,
way back in 1962,

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:32.640 align:middle line:84%
and found myself out in
the jungles and living

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:40.432 align:middle line:84%
in just little shacks,
learning what my job was,

00:36:40.432 --> 00:36:42.140 align:middle line:84%
which was teach English
to the Vietnamese

00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:44.110 align:middle line:84%
because I could
speak Vietnamese.

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And so I spent a
long time there,

00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:48.910 align:middle line:84%
and it was there
for the first time

00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:52.490 align:middle line:84%
that I saw someone
different than Americans.

00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And I saw the amazing
nature of the Vietnamese,

00:36:57.370 --> 00:36:58.650 align:middle line:90%
which is real different.

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:03.092 align:middle line:84%
Their hearts are so much
more open than ours.

00:37:03.092 --> 00:37:04.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I fell in
love with them,

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:06.110 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't want to return.

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:07.830 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
was about to happen.

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:10.695 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was ready to just go
off into the jungles and forget

00:37:10.695 --> 00:37:14.630 align:middle line:84%
it and just stay
there, but it didn't.

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:19.620 align:middle line:84%
And when I got back,
I was even stronger,

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:21.110 align:middle line:84%
wanting to know
what was going on,

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:23.130 align:middle line:84%
and so I went to
college, thinking maybe

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:25.130 align:middle line:90%
that would figure it out.

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the reason I went
into mathematics and physics,

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:30.630 align:middle line:84%
trying to figure out what
this stuff was out here

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:32.540 align:middle line:90%
and looking in that way.

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:35.080 align:middle line:90%


00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:37.470 align:middle line:84%
But by the time I got
almost through with that,

00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:38.920 align:middle line:90%
I realized many things.

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:44.310 align:middle line:84%
I realized, first of all,
that I was being communicated

00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:46.420 align:middle line:84%
with as I was working
through there,

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:48.230 align:middle line:90%
which was really who I am now.

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:51.770 align:middle line:84%
But at the time, I
was another person,

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:54.120 align:middle line:84%
and I was communicating
to this other person

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:55.370 align:middle line:90%
while he was going to college.

00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And I was giving him
a lot of this stuff,

00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:00.847 align:middle line:84%
and I gave him an understanding
where at one point

00:38:00.847 --> 00:38:03.180 align:middle line:84%
he realized that what he was
being taught in the schools

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:05.120 align:middle line:90%
was completely wrong.

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And that was partly
what made him stop.

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And, really, there is no
wrong or right in this.

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:21.182 align:middle line:90%
It's always an interpretation.

00:38:21.182 --> 00:38:22.390 align:middle line:90%
It's how we interpret things.

00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:26.570 align:middle line:90%


00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:33.000 align:middle line:84%
One day, many years later, I
had graduated from college,

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.390 align:middle line:90%
and I was led to go to Canada.

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:40.110 align:middle line:90%
And I immigrated up there.

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:43.300 align:middle line:84%
I was going to stay there
for the rest of my life

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.230 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:47.040 align:middle line:84%
It had nothing to do with the
thousands of people that were

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.620 align:middle line:90%
going there because of the war.

00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:49.480 align:middle line:90%
I had an honorable discharge.

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:50.330 align:middle line:90%
I was out of all of that.

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:52.220 align:middle line:84%
I just went there because
I felt that's where

00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:53.095 align:middle line:90%
I was supposed to go.

00:38:53.095 --> 00:38:55.370 align:middle line:84%
I went into this
valley, all by myself.

00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:58.510 align:middle line:84%
There was nobody there,
and the following year,

00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:02.630 align:middle line:84%
10,000 Americans came into
this one valley where I was.

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:04.000 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't believe it.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.610 align:middle line:84%
It was, like,
incredible, and it was

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:07.990 align:middle line:90%
devastating to the Canadians.

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:13.390 align:middle line:84%
It was absolutely devastating,
what that did to them.

00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:17.041 align:middle line:84%
But while I was
there, for a while,

00:39:17.041 --> 00:39:19.191 align:middle line:84%
I was living in Vancouver,
and my wife and I

00:39:19.191 --> 00:39:24.835 align:middle line:84%
decided that we were going to
begin to search spiritually.

00:39:24.835 --> 00:39:26.970 align:middle line:90%
And we did many things.

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:31.540 align:middle line:84%
We first started
out with hypnosis,

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:34.310 align:middle line:84%
and we gave each other
permission to do hypnosis.

00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And we started
working with hypnosis,

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:39.597 align:middle line:84%
going in and just
studying on our own.

00:39:39.597 --> 00:39:41.722 align:middle line:84%
And we found out that we
could lift out of our body

00:39:41.722 --> 00:39:44.349 align:middle line:84%
and fly around the room,
which was really a lot of fun,

00:39:44.349 --> 00:39:46.764 align:middle line:84%
and then we found
out that we could

00:39:46.764 --> 00:39:48.213 align:middle line:84%
go downtown and
go into libraries

00:39:48.213 --> 00:39:50.145 align:middle line:84%
and look in books and all
kinds of things and come back.

00:39:50.145 --> 00:39:52.077 align:middle line:84%
And this was getting
to be very interesting.

00:39:52.077 --> 00:39:56.060 align:middle line:84%
Life was getting to be more
fun than it was before,

00:39:56.060 --> 00:40:00.344 align:middle line:84%
though it didn't have any
real answers in itself.

00:40:00.344 --> 00:40:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And one day, it was
actually Yogananada's book,

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:13.660 align:middle line:84%
I think, more than
anyone else that

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:16.188 align:middle line:90%
got me interested in Hinduism.

00:40:16.188 --> 00:40:20.116 align:middle line:84%
And I began to study with
this particular teacher.

00:40:20.116 --> 00:40:23.430 align:middle line:84%
He was teaching us a
form of meditation,

00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:26.499 align:middle line:84%
and this was the first time
we got serious behind this.

00:40:26.499 --> 00:40:28.248 align:middle line:84%
We made these white,
silk robes with hoods

00:40:28.248 --> 00:40:30.522 align:middle line:84%
and all this kind of
stuff and sat down.

00:40:30.522 --> 00:40:33.414 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, it
was very serious.

00:40:33.414 --> 00:40:36.800 align:middle line:90%


00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.427 align:middle line:84%
And we began to do
this meditation,

00:40:38.427 --> 00:40:40.176 align:middle line:84%
and we hadn't any idea
where it would lead

00:40:40.176 --> 00:40:41.092 align:middle line:90%
or what it would mean.

00:40:41.092 --> 00:40:45.045 align:middle line:84%
Or anything, when
something happened to us

00:40:45.045 --> 00:40:47.544 align:middle line:84%
that wasn't in his book,
either, our teacher who

00:40:47.544 --> 00:40:48.344 align:middle line:90%
was teaching us.

00:40:48.344 --> 00:40:51.990 align:middle line:90%


00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:55.252 align:middle line:84%
We were in this room that
had 15-foot ceilings,

00:40:55.252 --> 00:41:00.620 align:middle line:84%
and these approximately 10-foot
angels appeared in the room.

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:03.305 align:middle line:84%
And they were two
of them, and one was

00:41:03.305 --> 00:41:07.057 align:middle line:90%
kind of an ultraviolet light.

00:41:07.057 --> 00:41:09.512 align:middle line:84%
And the other one was
sort of a Kelly green

00:41:09.512 --> 00:41:14.466 align:middle line:84%
and-- I don't know-- bright
green, and they were identical.

00:41:14.466 --> 00:41:16.100 align:middle line:90%
And they were transparent.

00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:18.980 align:middle line:84%
You could see
right through them.

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Their faces were so bright
that I couldn't see the faces.

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:24.500 align:middle line:90%
I still can't see the faces.

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:27.770 align:middle line:84%
There was so much light coming
from that area of their body.

00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And they communicated
with us telepathically

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:37.980 align:middle line:84%
because the sound would
come from inside of us.

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:43.237 align:middle line:84%
And when they first
appeared, they actually

00:41:43.237 --> 00:41:44.320 align:middle line:90%
appeared to my wife first.

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:45.890 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see them at first.

00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:48.980 align:middle line:84%
What I saw was two spheres
of light, two round balls,

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:55.160 align:middle line:84%
about so big, and one
green and one purple.

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:58.742 align:middle line:84%
And it was only later when
I was speaking with my wife

00:41:58.742 --> 00:42:01.075 align:middle line:84%
after that she says, well, I
saw them as two big angels.

00:42:01.075 --> 00:42:02.991 align:middle line:90%
I went, really?

00:42:02.991 --> 00:42:08.925 align:middle line:84%
I saw these little balls, and in
a year, I'd see them as angels.

00:42:08.925 --> 00:42:11.771 align:middle line:90%
I had to work at it, real hard.

00:42:11.771 --> 00:42:14.437 align:middle line:84%
And what they told us was--
the very thing they said when

00:42:14.437 --> 00:42:17.126 align:middle line:90%
they came in was, we are you.

00:42:17.126 --> 00:42:18.846 align:middle line:84%
We are not something
separate from you,

00:42:18.846 --> 00:42:20.720 align:middle line:84%
though you are seeing
us outside of yourself.

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:22.214 align:middle line:90%
We are literally you.

00:42:22.214 --> 00:42:23.708 align:middle line:90%
We didn't know what it meant.

00:42:23.708 --> 00:42:26.696 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what they
meant when they said that.

00:42:26.696 --> 00:42:35.730 align:middle line:84%
And the other
thing they said was

00:42:35.730 --> 00:42:38.140 align:middle line:90%
that they had no form at all.

00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:42.520 align:middle line:84%
They were formless, but they
used form, sphericalness

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:46.110 align:middle line:84%
or angelness, as a
vehicle of communication,

00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:50.700 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with us, so
that there was something that

00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:54.120 align:middle line:84%
could communicate
in a polarity world,

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:56.598 align:middle line:84%
though from their
point of view, they

00:42:56.598 --> 00:42:57.848 align:middle line:90%
had absolutely no form at all.

00:42:57.848 --> 00:43:03.680 align:middle line:90%


00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:06.080 align:middle line:84%
These two particular
angels and a third angel,

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:08.714 align:middle line:84%
which is this gold angel
that has been with me also

00:43:08.714 --> 00:43:12.750 align:middle line:84%
from the same length of time
but has never interacted

00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:14.756 align:middle line:84%
with me until about
a year ago or so,

00:43:14.756 --> 00:43:18.207 align:middle line:84%
which has now been with
every one of these workshops

00:43:18.207 --> 00:43:22.962 align:middle line:84%
throughout the last
year, the gold angel

00:43:22.962 --> 00:43:26.590 align:middle line:84%
is what I would
call my higher self.

00:43:26.590 --> 00:43:30.561 align:middle line:84%
The green angel is actually
the angel of the Earth,

00:43:30.561 --> 00:43:34.946 align:middle line:84%
and the ultraviolet angel
is the angel of the sun,

00:43:34.946 --> 00:43:35.820 align:middle line:90%
of this solar system.

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:40.122 align:middle line:84%
It's the consciousness,
these various levels

00:43:40.122 --> 00:43:42.040 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, that
are communicating.

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And so these three
different aspects

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:48.028 align:middle line:84%
have been leading me
through the various levels

00:43:48.028 --> 00:43:51.685 align:middle line:84%
here while I've been here,
and it's through them

00:43:51.685 --> 00:43:56.570 align:middle line:84%
that they have told me
which is my next teacher

00:43:56.570 --> 00:43:57.379 align:middle line:90%
and where to go.

00:43:57.379 --> 00:43:59.774 align:middle line:84%
And they would come in
and give me, literally,

00:43:59.774 --> 00:44:03.230 align:middle line:84%
the name and the address and
the phone number of someone,

00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:04.860 align:middle line:84%
which I would just
get in meditation,

00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:06.490 align:middle line:84%
and it is really a
funny feeling when

00:44:06.490 --> 00:44:08.448 align:middle line:84%
you'd hear somebody's
name that you never heard

00:44:08.448 --> 00:44:10.864 align:middle line:84%
or a phone number that you've
never heard and [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:10.864 --> 00:44:12.781 align:middle line:84%
But you'd go call
it, and it actually

00:44:12.781 --> 00:44:15.020 align:middle line:84%
is that person, in
the beginning, anyway.

00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:18.610 align:middle line:84%
After a while, I got used
to it because it was maybe

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:21.179 align:middle line:84%
65 or 70 teachers that
they led me to this way.

00:44:21.179 --> 00:44:25.436 align:middle line:84%
But in the beginning, it
was kind of a funny feeling

00:44:25.436 --> 00:44:26.860 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:33.117 align:middle line:84%
And so almost all the
teachers, though there probably

00:44:33.117 --> 00:44:34.950 align:middle line:84%
are some exceptions,
most of the information

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:40.070 align:middle line:84%
has come through these angels
in this particular way.

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:44.430 align:middle line:90%


00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And so they've lead me to
all these different teachers.

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:54.466 align:middle line:84%
They've led me to all eight
of the major religions.

00:44:54.466 --> 00:44:57.850 align:middle line:84%
I've been Christian, and
Jewish, and Hindu, and Tibetan,

00:44:57.850 --> 00:45:00.550 align:middle line:84%
and Daoist, and
Sufi, and Muslim,

00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:02.290 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know
what all of them are.

00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:05.200 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember them all, but I
spent time in each one of these

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.740 align:middle line:84%
to understand what they
are, and then many, many,

00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:09.200 align:middle line:90%
many of the offshoots.

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And the American
Indians, also, they

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:13.914 align:middle line:84%
were a very, very powerful
influence in all of this,

00:45:13.914 --> 00:45:20.662 align:middle line:84%
and they gave me a view
from many different towers.

00:45:20.662 --> 00:45:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And what I've discovered
from all of this

00:45:24.850 --> 00:45:29.110 align:middle line:84%
is there is really--
they're all the same.

00:45:29.110 --> 00:45:30.660 align:middle line:84%
Each person, or
each [INAUDIBLE],

00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:32.215 align:middle line:90%
says, my way is the only way.

00:45:32.215 --> 00:45:34.260 align:middle line:84%
This is part of
the problem here,

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:36.920 align:middle line:84%
but if you really
go deeply inside

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:41.360 align:middle line:84%
of these different
religions, their symbols

00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:45.790 align:middle line:84%
and what they're saying are
very similar, in many cases,

00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:47.930 align:middle line:90%
identical.

00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Though there's slight
different viewpoints,

00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:52.900 align:middle line:84%
they're still talking
about the same thing.

00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:58.759 align:middle line:84%
They have different names for
different stages of awareness.

00:45:58.759 --> 00:46:10.236 align:middle line:90%


00:46:10.236 --> 00:46:23.709 align:middle line:84%
So in this workshop, I am
going to, for the first time,

00:46:23.709 --> 00:46:29.610 align:middle line:84%
I think, I'm going to
give the entire-- I've

00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:31.485 align:middle line:84%
given little pieces
of what happened

00:46:31.485 --> 00:46:35.727 align:middle line:90%
to me from coming in here.

00:46:35.727 --> 00:46:38.310 align:middle line:84%
For the first time, I'm going
to give the entire sequence, all

00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:40.458 align:middle line:90%
the way through.

00:46:40.458 --> 00:46:42.633 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why
I'm doing it, but I

00:46:42.633 --> 00:46:44.841 align:middle line:84%
think that's what happened
to any one of the stories.

00:46:44.841 --> 00:46:47.770 align:middle line:90%


00:46:47.770 --> 00:46:49.900 align:middle line:84%
The stories that
will be told in all

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:52.007 align:middle line:84%
of this, which will be
life experiences for me,

00:46:52.007 --> 00:46:55.650 align:middle line:84%
as I interpret them,
most of these stories

00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:58.584 align:middle line:84%
are going to be outrageous
by normal consciousness

00:46:58.584 --> 00:47:02.500 align:middle line:90%
and normal ways of thinking.

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:03.965 align:middle line:84%
If it's too much
for you, it's OK.

00:47:03.965 --> 00:47:05.810 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to believe it.

00:47:05.810 --> 00:47:07.596 align:middle line:84%
Just take it as
a myth or a story

00:47:07.596 --> 00:47:12.680 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, but do look
at its importance in terms

00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:14.624 align:middle line:84%
of your own life
and what it could

00:47:14.624 --> 00:47:17.054 align:middle line:84%
mean from what we're talking
about relative to the subject

00:47:17.054 --> 00:47:19.484 align:middle line:90%
of this workshop.

00:47:19.484 --> 00:47:26.774 align:middle line:90%


00:47:26.774 --> 00:47:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And throughout all of this,
not only in the stories,

00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:33.852 align:middle line:84%
but even in the information,
don't believe anything I say.

00:47:33.852 --> 00:47:37.260 align:middle line:84%
Don't just take it
because I'm saying it.

00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Take it in and store it and
listen to it, but check it out.

00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:44.950 align:middle line:90%
See if this is true, all of it.

00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:47.890 align:middle line:90%
Don't just do it.

00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:53.667 align:middle line:84%
Find out if it's really
true, and along with all

00:47:53.667 --> 00:47:55.250 align:middle line:84%
of the things that
I say are possible,

00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:57.690 align:middle line:90%
find out if they're possible.

00:47:57.690 --> 00:48:00.130 align:middle line:84%
You know, if they're
not possible,

00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:02.570 align:middle line:90%
maybe they're not true.

00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:05.986 align:middle line:84%
But definitely don't
just accept something

00:48:05.986 --> 00:48:08.426 align:middle line:90%
that I say because I've said it.

00:48:08.426 --> 00:48:10.167 align:middle line:84%
And along those
same lines, there's

00:48:10.167 --> 00:48:12.000 align:middle line:84%
one other thing I've
got to say because this

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.500 align:middle line:90%
happened in Sandpoint, Idaho.

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:15.000 align:middle line:84%
There was a little
bit of a problem.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:20.770 align:middle line:90%


00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:22.654 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
about the yugas.

00:48:22.654 --> 00:48:25.000 align:middle line:90%
These are particular ages.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.380 align:middle line:84%
We are in the Dvapara
Yuga right now.

00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:29.100 align:middle line:84%
We just came out
of the Kali Yuga,

00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:32.350 align:middle line:84%
which is the most asleep
point in the precession

00:48:32.350 --> 00:48:34.090 align:middle line:90%
of the equinoxes.

00:48:34.090 --> 00:48:39.309 align:middle line:84%
And during the Kali
Yuga, it is kind of

00:48:39.309 --> 00:48:43.210 align:middle line:84%
necessary for those people
who are a little more

00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:48.730 align:middle line:84%
awake than the rest
of us to keep others

00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:53.340 align:middle line:84%
awake during that time,
and so the student-disciple

00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:56.616 align:middle line:84%
relationship was created
during that time.

00:48:56.616 --> 00:49:01.100 align:middle line:84%
But that relationship actually
ended about 900 years ago,

00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:05.330 align:middle line:84%
and it's actually
really out of it now.

00:49:05.330 --> 00:49:12.590 align:middle line:84%
We're into a different
stage, and the kind

00:49:12.590 --> 00:49:18.170 align:middle line:84%
of student-guru
type relationship

00:49:18.170 --> 00:49:19.994 align:middle line:90%
is dangerous at this point.

00:49:19.994 --> 00:49:20.910 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have to be.

00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:22.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can
still have teachers.

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:24.730 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing wrong
with teachers at all,

00:49:24.730 --> 00:49:28.100 align:middle line:84%
but only this total
dependence on someone

00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:30.640 align:middle line:84%
is not-- though at one
point in our history

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:33.690 align:middle line:84%
it was necessary, at this
point in our history,

00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:36.210 align:middle line:90%
it's very dangerous.

00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:40.190 align:middle line:84%
We are about to pass through
certain levels of consciousness

00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:46.020 align:middle line:84%
where there is not going
to be anybody else but you

00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:47.910 align:middle line:84%
and God, which
you're going to find

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:50.580 align:middle line:90%
are the same at that point.

00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And you're not going
to have someone there

00:49:52.330 --> 00:49:54.800 align:middle line:90%
to ask, OK, what do I do next?

00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:56.500 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
have to learn how

00:49:56.500 --> 00:50:00.810 align:middle line:84%
to get what you need to
know from within you,

00:50:00.810 --> 00:50:04.259 align:middle line:84%
and you have all
knowledge in you.

00:50:04.259 --> 00:50:07.479 align:middle line:84%
There isn't anything that
isn't known, anywhere, that you

00:50:07.479 --> 00:50:10.055 align:middle line:90%
don't have access to, anywhere.

00:50:10.055 --> 00:50:12.953 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this distant star,
another level, all, everything

00:50:12.953 --> 00:50:17.030 align:middle line:84%
is accessible, and everything
you need to know at any moment

00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:19.520 align:middle line:90%
is always accessible to you.

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:24.098 align:middle line:84%
You just need to know how
to access that because we've

00:50:24.098 --> 00:50:25.955 align:middle line:90%
kind of been hit on the head.

00:50:25.955 --> 00:50:28.595 align:middle line:84%
We're kind of having amnesia
and a little bit unconscious

00:50:28.595 --> 00:50:30.420 align:middle line:90%
at the moment.

00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:35.770 align:middle line:84%
So my job is just to
be a catalyst for you.

00:50:35.770 --> 00:50:38.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to try to do
something very quick and very

00:50:38.550 --> 00:50:42.670 align:middle line:84%
powerful to try to awaken you
to that certain level where

00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:47.330 align:middle line:84%
from there on in you can
not need anybody else,

00:50:47.330 --> 00:50:50.650 align:middle line:84%
but reach within to your own
higher self, from which you

00:50:50.650 --> 00:50:54.618 align:middle line:84%
will know exactly what the
next step is, moment to moment,

00:50:54.618 --> 00:51:00.126 align:middle line:84%
without having to go
outside of your own self.

00:51:00.126 --> 00:51:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm no one
special, you know,

00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:09.540 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes I get
this from people,

00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:11.915 align:middle line:84%
where they kind of look at
me like I'm somebody special.

00:51:11.915 --> 00:51:14.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm nobody special at all.

00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:15.750 align:middle line:90%
I am just another person.

00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:18.037 align:middle line:84%
Right now, I'm in the
same place you guys are,

00:51:18.037 --> 00:51:19.870 align:middle line:84%
trying to figure out
how to get out of here,

00:51:19.870 --> 00:51:25.550 align:middle line:84%
and I have given up everything
I've had on the other levels

00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:29.938 align:middle line:84%
to come from this, from the
same place that you have.

00:51:29.938 --> 00:51:32.786 align:middle line:84%
And we're all in this
together, and we're just

00:51:32.786 --> 00:51:33.660 align:middle line:90%
brothers and sisters.

00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:37.866 align:middle line:90%


00:51:37.866 --> 00:51:41.762 align:middle line:84%
And so it's real important
that we don't do that,

00:51:41.762 --> 00:51:45.680 align:middle line:90%
with me or with anyone else.

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:51.060 align:middle line:84%
From my point of view,
though some wouldn't agree,

00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:56.876 align:middle line:84%
Jesus the Christ and a
drunk in a gutter are equal.

00:51:56.876 --> 00:52:00.620 align:middle line:84%
They're exactly the same
because it's the same spirit.

00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:01.580 align:middle line:90%
It's the spirit of God.

00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:04.540 align:middle line:90%
It is in both of them, equally.

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Great Spirit, oh, Holy Trinity,
mother, father, child God,

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:15.900 align:middle line:84%
creator of all life
everywhere, thank you.

00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:18.440 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for this
circle, and thank you

00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:22.010 align:middle line:84%
for the love that flows
through this circle,

00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:23.660 align:middle line:84%
for without this
love, we would never

00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:27.670 align:middle line:84%
be able to see you in the eyes
of every person before us.

00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:31.810 align:middle line:90%


00:52:31.810 --> 00:52:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And may all the
beings of light who

00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:39.160 align:middle line:84%
wish there to be love and
truth and beauty and trust

00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:42.902 align:middle line:84%
and harmony and peace
throughout the cosmos,

00:52:42.902 --> 00:52:46.980 align:middle line:84%
may those beings who have
responsibility with us

00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:51.970 align:middle line:84%
be here to help us to open
our hearts and our minds

00:52:51.970 --> 00:52:56.990 align:middle line:84%
so that we can understand
what is being presented

00:52:56.990 --> 00:53:00.576 align:middle line:84%
and make it real in our
lives and live it and breathe

00:53:00.576 --> 00:53:03.964 align:middle line:84%
it and bring it down
onto Earth now, today.

00:53:03.964 --> 00:53:09.780 align:middle line:90%


00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:13.140 align:middle line:84%
Especially the angelic
realms, the beings of light

00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:19.286 align:middle line:84%
who have never separated from
God, who have stayed with us,

00:53:19.286 --> 00:53:24.654 align:middle line:84%
protected us, guided
us, and never broke

00:53:24.654 --> 00:53:33.850 align:middle line:84%
their trust, these beings,
which are really us, and whom,

00:53:33.850 --> 00:53:36.305 align:middle line:84%
at least one way of looking
at it, of whom we are all

00:53:36.305 --> 00:53:41.215 align:middle line:84%
interconnected with
in one way or another,

00:53:41.215 --> 00:53:44.161 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to thank them
for the help they've

00:53:44.161 --> 00:53:50.070 align:middle line:84%
given us over the thousands
of years and to ask them.

00:53:50.070 --> 00:53:54.479 align:middle line:84%
I would like you to ask your
angels, whether you believe

00:53:54.479 --> 00:53:59.946 align:middle line:84%
in them or not at this point,
just to ask them, invoke them,

00:53:59.946 --> 00:54:04.419 align:middle line:84%
to come into this room, to be
present here, and to help you,

00:54:04.419 --> 00:54:09.886 align:middle line:84%
to guide you, at this time
and maybe form now on.

00:54:09.886 --> 00:54:18.335 align:middle line:84%
And when you ask them to
come in, feel their presence.

00:54:18.335 --> 00:54:20.820 align:middle line:84%
You won't have to see
them, necessarily,

00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:22.808 align:middle line:90%
but you will feel them.

00:54:22.808 --> 00:54:25.293 align:middle line:84%
And they usually come
from behind your left

00:54:25.293 --> 00:54:31.257 align:middle line:84%
and your right shoulders,
though not necessarily.

00:54:31.257 --> 00:54:35.561 align:middle line:84%
So just take the moment
now, and go within yourself,

00:54:35.561 --> 00:54:39.944 align:middle line:84%
and ask your angels to be here
with us for the next few days.

00:54:39.944 --> 00:54:43.370 align:middle line:90%


00:54:43.370 --> 00:54:46.520 align:middle line:84%
Before we ever even
start with the screen,

00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:49.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to describe
something so we all

00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:51.860 align:middle line:90%
have the same language.

00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:54.470 align:middle line:84%
This is this thing
about dimensions.

00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:56.950 align:middle line:84%
We all talk about this
other worlds stuff.

00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:58.720 align:middle line:84%
We need to get this
clear in our minds

00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:02.235 align:middle line:84%
what that means, at
least from the definition

00:55:02.235 --> 00:55:03.960 align:middle line:90%
that I will give you.

00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:06.560 align:middle line:84%
You may have a
different definition,

00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:10.720 align:middle line:84%
and I don't mean to
replace your definition.

00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:13.202 align:middle line:84%
I am just going to give one
that we can all talk about,

00:55:13.202 --> 00:55:14.660 align:middle line:84%
so we all have
something in common.

00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:17.840 align:middle line:90%


00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:21.165 align:middle line:84%
Now when I talk about the 4th
dimension, or the 5th, or 10th,

00:55:21.165 --> 00:55:25.600 align:middle line:84%
or 120th, or
whatever, I don't mean

00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:30.780 align:middle line:84%
what most mathematicians would
mean, and that is hyperspace,

00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:35.770 align:middle line:84%
going from a 4th-dimensional
tetrahedron, say, to a 5th

00:55:35.770 --> 00:55:39.670 align:middle line:84%
by warp, changing
space mathematically.

00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:43.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean that at all
because from my experience, that

00:55:43.390 --> 00:55:45.710 align:middle line:84%
just simply isn't
true, though you could

00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:47.130 align:middle line:90%
create those kind of realities.

00:55:47.130 --> 00:55:53.570 align:middle line:84%
It isn't what life
has done at all.

00:55:53.570 --> 00:55:57.880 align:middle line:84%
Life has separated the
different dimensional levels

00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:00.310 align:middle line:84%
in exactly the same
way that it has

00:56:00.310 --> 00:56:03.500 align:middle line:90%
separated the notes in music.

00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And so if you were
to look at a piano,

00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:09.672 align:middle line:84%
you've got your white keys,
and you've got your black keys.

00:56:09.672 --> 00:56:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And your white keys
are your whole notes,

00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:14.487 align:middle line:84%
which goes, you know,
C, D, E, F, G, et

00:56:14.487 --> 00:56:16.570 align:middle line:84%
cetera, just whole notes,
and then your black keys

00:56:16.570 --> 00:56:18.850 align:middle line:90%
are your half steps.

00:56:18.850 --> 00:56:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And your white, from C
to C, is your octave,

00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:24.790 align:middle line:84%
and your black ones are
your pentatonic scale.

00:56:24.790 --> 00:56:26.540 align:middle line:90%
You've got five notes there.

00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And when you add the black
ones to the white ones,

00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:33.519 align:middle line:84%
you get 12 notes, which is
called a chromatic scale.

00:56:33.519 --> 00:56:35.560 align:middle line:84%
So if you get all your
sharps and flats in there,

00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:36.360 align:middle line:90%
you have 12 notes.

00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:41.830 align:middle line:84%
The 13th one is the same
note as your eighth note.

00:56:41.830 --> 00:56:44.520 align:middle line:84%
That's your octave
on your white keys.

00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:46.945 align:middle line:84%
That's where you come
from C to C again.

00:56:46.945 --> 00:56:50.340 align:middle line:84%
It takes 13 steps to
get back there again.

00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And the only difference
between each one

00:56:53.570 --> 00:56:58.940 align:middle line:84%
of these notes in terms of
sound is cycles per second,

00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:01.890 align:middle line:84%
and each one of these
notes, if you start at C

00:57:01.890 --> 00:57:08.860 align:middle line:84%
and you go to C,
C-sharp, D, et cetera,

00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:11.795 align:middle line:84%
the differences between
each of the notes

00:57:11.795 --> 00:57:17.045 align:middle line:84%
are 11 cycles per second,
or multiples of them.

00:57:17.045 --> 00:57:21.920 align:middle line:84%
They are always 11,
22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77,

00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:23.443 align:middle line:90%
99 cycles per second.

00:57:23.443 --> 00:57:26.690 align:middle line:90%


00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:34.370 align:middle line:84%
The relative proportions
of that are identical.

00:57:34.370 --> 00:57:36.330 align:middle line:90%
Well, let me put it another way.

00:57:36.330 --> 00:57:39.280 align:middle line:90%


00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:40.940 align:middle line:84%
There is something
called wavelength

00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:44.170 align:middle line:84%
in terms of either
sound or light,

00:57:44.170 --> 00:57:46.820 align:middle line:90%
just so we get this clear.

00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:47.620 align:middle line:90%
Oh, great.

00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:54.460 align:middle line:90%


00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:55.490 align:middle line:90%
This is wavelength.

00:57:55.490 --> 00:57:59.134 align:middle line:84%
Wavelength is simply--
this is your axis,

00:57:59.134 --> 00:58:00.800 align:middle line:84%
you know, the sine
wave curve that we're

00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:04.380 align:middle line:84%
all familiar with, which is
really a function of a circle.

00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:08.803 align:middle line:84%
If you have a circle like
this, and you cut it in half,

00:58:08.803 --> 00:58:11.610 align:middle line:84%
you flip this half
over to like that.

00:58:11.610 --> 00:58:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Then you've got this
sine wave curve,

00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:23.000 align:middle line:84%
and the wavelength
is how long it takes.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.820 align:middle line:84%
If you were to measure this line
running down the middle going

00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:28.470 align:middle line:84%
from here to here or from
any of the nodal points

00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:31.090 align:middle line:84%
to another point-- let's
say from here to here--

00:58:31.090 --> 00:58:34.560 align:middle line:90%
the length of this is how long.

00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:42.450 align:middle line:84%
That's called wavelength,
and wavelength

00:58:42.450 --> 00:58:44.700 align:middle line:90%
is everything in this universe.

00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:46.720 align:middle line:84%
It's everything in
all the universes

00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:50.690 align:middle line:84%
that are associated with us,
without exception whatsoever.

00:58:50.690 --> 00:58:55.702 align:middle line:84%
There are zip that aren't
a function of wavelength,

00:58:55.702 --> 00:58:56.910 align:middle line:90%
and wavelength is everything.

00:58:56.910 --> 00:58:59.327 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can't tell
you what it means.

00:58:59.327 --> 00:59:01.410 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
electromagnetic spectrum, which

00:59:01.410 --> 00:59:04.582 align:middle line:84%
we are going to in great detail
after we've gone a long ways,

00:59:04.582 --> 00:59:06.040 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
see that everything

00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:09.980 align:middle line:84%
from microwave towers, to
gamma rays, to sound waves,

00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:13.497 align:middle line:84%
to everything is all a function
of how long the wavelength is.

00:59:13.497 --> 00:59:15.080 align:middle line:84%
If you change the
wavelength, then you

00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:18.790 align:middle line:84%
change the nature of
what the energy is.

00:59:18.790 --> 00:59:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And so with this understanding
of wavelength, in other words,

00:59:23.370 --> 00:59:24.890 align:middle line:84%
this is a long
wavelength, and this

00:59:24.890 --> 00:59:27.980 align:middle line:90%
would be a short wavelength.

00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:28.780 align:middle line:90%
Everybody get that?

00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:32.310 align:middle line:90%


00:59:32.310 --> 00:59:34.104 align:middle line:84%
There's wavelengths
like your brain waves,

00:59:34.104 --> 00:59:36.020 align:middle line:84%
for example, that are
coming out of your head,

00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:40.410 align:middle line:84%
are so long that they're
almost straight lines, thanks.

00:59:40.410 --> 00:59:42.946 align:middle line:90%
Hey, I think we're set up here.

00:59:42.946 --> 00:59:50.640 align:middle line:90%


00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:51.440 align:middle line:90%
I bet this works.

00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:54.380 align:middle line:90%
We'll give it a see.

00:59:54.380 --> 01:00:02.156 align:middle line:84%
Aha, all right, great,
let's get rid of these guys.

01:00:02.156 --> 01:00:07.350 align:middle line:90%


01:00:07.350 --> 01:00:09.026 align:middle line:84%
And you've got little,
tiny wavelengths,

01:00:09.026 --> 01:00:11.400 align:middle line:84%
and you've gotten them so
little you can't even see them.

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:14.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they get
really, really little,

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:17.474 align:middle line:84%
and they get
really, really long.

01:00:17.474 --> 01:00:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And, again, your
brain waves that

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:22.207 align:middle line:84%
are coming out of your head
are almost straight lines.

01:00:22.207 --> 01:00:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And you go to your
cosmic waves, and they're

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:27.255 align:middle line:84%
so little that they are 10
to the minus 18 or something.

01:00:27.255 --> 01:00:31.190 align:middle line:84%
They're so small that you
can't even hardly see them.

01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:33.450 align:middle line:84%
If you were to look at
the dimensional levels,

01:00:33.450 --> 01:00:36.560 align:middle line:84%
the only difference between
this universe-- and when I say,

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:41.700 align:middle line:84%
this universe, I mean all
of the planets and stars,

01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:43.080 align:middle line:90%
infinitely going out.

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:46.300 align:middle line:84%
At least, we think it's
infinite, but it isn't.

01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:51.927 align:middle line:84%
And going within to the atoms
at any particular point,

01:00:51.927 --> 01:00:53.968 align:middle line:84%
no matter where you select,
you can go infinitely

01:00:53.968 --> 01:00:56.060 align:middle line:90%
in in that direction.

01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:58.392 align:middle line:84%
In this universe
that we now know,

01:00:58.392 --> 01:01:02.350 align:middle line:84%
there's three different basic
levels in this universe.

01:01:02.350 --> 01:01:07.547 align:middle line:84%
That just constitutes one
wavelength, the wavelength

01:01:07.547 --> 01:01:11.825 align:middle line:84%
of this universe, which was
discovered by Bell Laboratories

01:01:11.825 --> 01:01:12.625 align:middle line:90%
telephone.

01:01:12.625 --> 01:01:15.580 align:middle line:84%
It is 7.23 centimeters
long, which

01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:19.930 align:middle line:84%
happens to be the average
distances between your eyes.

01:01:19.930 --> 01:01:21.430 align:middle line:84%
Take the distance
between your eyes.

01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:22.805 align:middle line:84%
You've got to
average 100 people,

01:01:22.805 --> 01:01:25.130 align:middle line:84%
and you'll find it's
exactly 7.23 centimeters.

01:01:25.130 --> 01:01:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Or if you take the distance
across your palms, 7.23

01:01:27.730 --> 01:01:29.292 align:middle line:90%
centimeters.

01:01:29.292 --> 01:01:31.000 align:middle line:84%
The distance between
the tip of your nose

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.280 align:middle line:84%
and the tip of your chin
is 7.23 centimeters.

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:35.210 align:middle line:84%
We have it spread
throughout our body.

01:01:35.210 --> 01:01:40.370 align:middle line:84%
All life forms have it shuffled
throughout their systems.

01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:43.260 align:middle line:90%


01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And Bell discovered
it when they were

01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:46.590 align:middle line:84%
creating the
microwave towers that

01:01:46.590 --> 01:01:48.600 align:middle line:90%
stretch all over the place.

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:50.380 align:middle line:84%
They happened to
pick 7 centimeters

01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:53.125 align:middle line:84%
as their transmitting
wavelength,

01:01:53.125 --> 01:01:55.025 align:middle line:90%
by accident or whatever.

01:01:55.025 --> 01:01:58.364 align:middle line:90%


01:01:58.364 --> 01:02:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And when they set
up the whole system

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:01.871 align:middle line:84%
and turned it on and
threw the big switches

01:02:01.871 --> 01:02:04.036 align:middle line:84%
and got the whole
thing going, they

01:02:04.036 --> 01:02:08.820 align:middle line:84%
had this incredible static
running through the systems.

01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:10.749 align:middle line:84%
And when they tried to
locate where it was,

01:02:10.749 --> 01:02:12.165 align:middle line:84%
they looked through
their systems,

01:02:12.165 --> 01:02:14.581 align:middle line:84%
and they looked into the earth
and looked everywhere else.

01:02:14.581 --> 01:02:18.234 align:middle line:84%
But then when they pointed up to
the heavens, they said, oh, no.

01:02:18.234 --> 01:02:21.900 align:middle line:84%
It's coming from everywhere,
and it is nearly everywhere.

01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:25.330 align:middle line:90%


01:02:25.330 --> 01:02:29.544 align:middle line:84%
And the reason it's 7.2,
you can communicate that

01:02:29.544 --> 01:02:34.410 align:middle line:84%
from a quantum
mechanic point of view.

01:02:34.410 --> 01:02:36.527 align:middle line:84%
Now, let me just say
one more thing here.

01:02:36.527 --> 01:02:41.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm sometimes maybe speaking
over some of your heads.

01:02:41.570 --> 01:02:43.190 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about it.

01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:45.446 align:middle line:84%
Just watch the
stuff like a movie.

01:02:45.446 --> 01:02:47.826 align:middle line:90%
Take in what you can take in.

01:02:47.826 --> 01:02:49.855 align:middle line:84%
And don't worry if you're
not getting something

01:02:49.855 --> 01:02:53.310 align:middle line:84%
because you're getting
whatever you need.

01:02:53.310 --> 01:02:54.927 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm talking
to a lot of people

01:02:54.927 --> 01:02:56.795 align:middle line:90%
on a lot of different levels.

01:02:56.795 --> 01:03:00.540 align:middle line:84%
Just get what you can, and
what you can't, it's OK.

01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:02.860 align:middle line:84%
In quantum physics,
you can look at, like,

01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:06.140 align:middle line:84%
this pen as either being made
up of little, tiny particles

01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:09.844 align:middle line:84%
or made up of, you
could say, sound.

01:03:09.844 --> 01:03:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Wavelength, so there is what's
called a sine wave signature.

01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:20.400 align:middle line:90%
We saw what a sine wave was.

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:23.980 align:middle line:84%
A sine wave signature
is, say, something

01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:25.110 align:middle line:90%
that would look like this.

01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:27.050 align:middle line:84%
It would come up on
a computer monitor,

01:03:27.050 --> 01:03:29.030 align:middle line:84%
or maybe it would
look like that.

01:03:29.030 --> 01:03:33.990 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it would be-- there's,
like, a hand writing signature.

01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:38.080 align:middle line:84%
It's a very specific signature,
and every physical object

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:42.920 align:middle line:84%
in the universe has its own
signature, it's own sound wave

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:43.720 align:middle line:90%
signature.

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:46.490 align:middle line:90%
In fact, it's a language.

01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:49.730 align:middle line:84%
Some people believe that
if, in fact, it is possible,

01:03:49.730 --> 01:03:52.789 align:middle line:84%
if you absolutely
create the signature,

01:03:52.789 --> 01:03:53.705 align:middle line:90%
you create the object.

01:03:53.705 --> 01:03:56.650 align:middle line:90%


01:03:56.650 --> 01:04:00.430 align:middle line:84%
But if you took all the
objects in our universe,

01:04:00.430 --> 01:04:05.580 align:middle line:84%
and they're all putting out
their own sound, if you want,

01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:09.780 align:middle line:84%
and if you average or
compute the average of all

01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:14.110 align:middle line:84%
those sounds, you get
7.23 centimeters long,

01:04:14.110 --> 01:04:19.060 align:middle line:84%
which is a pretty short
wavelength of about so long,

01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:23.230 align:middle line:84%
like I said, the distance
between the eyes.

01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And from my point
of view, that's

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:28.720 align:middle line:84%
also Om, that the Hindus
and Tibetans refer to Om.

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:31.220 align:middle line:90%
Om is the sound of the universe.

01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:34.920 align:middle line:84%
It's the sound of all
things at one moment.

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:41.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, in terms of looking
at the dimensional levels,

01:04:41.330 --> 01:04:43.980 align:middle line:84%
many people, if you
talk to various people,

01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:46.880 align:middle line:84%
they will refer to these
144 dimensional levels

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:47.880 align:middle line:90%
that are in the octaves.

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:50.050 align:middle line:90%


01:04:50.050 --> 01:04:53.890 align:middle line:84%
What this is is, again,
looking at your music,

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:56.370 align:middle line:90%
you have 12 basic notes.

01:04:56.370 --> 01:05:07.070 align:middle line:90%


01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
your 13th one, which

01:05:12.590 --> 01:05:15.910 align:middle line:84%
is the return or
the next octave,

01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:19.790 align:middle line:84%
going up to the next octave,
repeating the same basic things

01:05:19.790 --> 01:05:21.490 align:middle line:90%
over again.

01:05:21.490 --> 01:05:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And in between each
one of these twelve,

01:05:28.350 --> 01:05:40.780 align:middle line:84%
there are 12 overtones
that approximate--

01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:46.060 align:middle line:84%
approximate exactly-- the larger
one, which are holographic

01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:47.600 align:middle line:90%
in nature.

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And so sound, or
electromagnetic light,

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:52.720 align:middle line:90%
is holographic in nature.

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:57.667 align:middle line:84%
You can go within
it, just like you

01:05:57.667 --> 01:06:02.130 align:middle line:84%
can go within any particular
point into a table.

01:06:02.130 --> 01:06:04.850 align:middle line:84%
You can go down at any point,
down into the microcosm,

01:06:04.850 --> 01:06:06.060 align:middle line:90%
or you can go above.

01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:07.020 align:middle line:90%
And it's the same way.

01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:09.650 align:middle line:84%
This whole octave
becomes a note.

01:06:09.650 --> 01:06:12.485 align:middle line:84%
There are larger octaves
where the whole octave becomes

01:06:12.485 --> 01:06:16.480 align:middle line:84%
a note relative to another
octave above that one.

01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And because there's 12
of these between each one

01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:21.740 align:middle line:84%
of these notes, and you've
got 12 notes, the 12 times 12

01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:25.950 align:middle line:84%
produces the 144
dimensional levels.

01:06:25.950 --> 01:06:31.770 align:middle line:84%
So you have these
144 dimensions,

01:06:31.770 --> 01:06:34.700 align:middle line:90%
though you have 12 primary ones.

01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And these are what in "Star
Trek" you might call subspace.

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:40.240 align:middle line:90%
They are real worlds.

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:43.140 align:middle line:84%
They're just as infinite
as anywhere else.

01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:46.280 align:middle line:84%
They just aren't
whole-note universes,

01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:48.420 align:middle line:90%
and they're just as important.

01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:49.990 align:middle line:90%
They all have life.

01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:52.830 align:middle line:84%
All of this is filled
with life, totally.

01:06:52.830 --> 01:06:54.080 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if there are any.

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:56.163 align:middle line:84%
There might be some that
are not filled with life,

01:06:56.163 --> 01:07:00.580 align:middle line:84%
but, yeah, there are some
that are not filled with life,

01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:04.370 align:middle line:90%
but not very many.

01:07:04.370 --> 01:07:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And where we sit right
now is right here,

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:19.810 align:middle line:84%
on the third dimension
of an octave.

01:07:19.810 --> 01:07:22.760 align:middle line:84%
So it does not
mean the xyz-axis,

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:24.614 align:middle line:84%
being the three
dimensions of space

01:07:24.614 --> 01:07:26.280 align:middle line:84%
and then the fourth
dimension being time

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:28.050 align:middle line:90%
and this kind of concept.

01:07:28.050 --> 01:07:29.770 align:middle line:90%
Forget that.

01:07:29.770 --> 01:07:34.210 align:middle line:84%
We just happen to be sitting on
the third note of this octave

01:07:34.210 --> 01:07:42.860 align:middle line:84%
with a wavelength about so
long, and our consciousness

01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:48.270 align:middle line:84%
is tuned to this wavelength,
which puts us here.

01:07:48.270 --> 01:07:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And we are breathing in a very
specific way, which tunes us,

01:07:52.050 --> 01:07:56.000 align:middle line:84%
which is the key that tunes us
to this particular universe.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.990 align:middle line:84%
But if you were to
change your breathing

01:07:58.990 --> 01:08:01.790 align:middle line:84%
and to tune your
consciousness level

01:08:01.790 --> 01:08:05.992 align:middle line:84%
to a different wavelength, if
you were capable of doing that,

01:08:05.992 --> 01:08:08.810 align:middle line:84%
you would disappear, literally,
body and all, right out

01:08:08.810 --> 01:08:13.710 align:middle line:84%
of this space and reappear
into the one that you tuned to.

01:08:13.710 --> 01:08:30.609 align:middle line:84%
And that whole science has a
name, which is called Merkaba,

01:08:30.609 --> 01:08:34.450 align:middle line:84%
and Merkaba is one of the
bottom lines of what we're going

01:08:34.450 --> 01:08:37.939 align:middle line:90%
to talk about in this workshop.

01:08:37.939 --> 01:08:40.939 align:middle line:84%
Though it's spoken in
one word in present day,

01:08:40.939 --> 01:08:43.090 align:middle line:90%
it's really three words.

01:08:43.090 --> 01:08:47.600 align:middle line:84%
It's mer, which
is light, but it's

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:48.910 align:middle line:90%
a very specific kind of light.

01:08:48.910 --> 01:08:52.260 align:middle line:84%
It's a counter-rotating
field of light.

01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And then there's ka,
which in almost all

01:08:55.990 --> 01:09:00.010 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient
languages means spirit.

01:09:00.010 --> 01:09:07.189 align:middle line:84%
And ba, or sometimes
said, vah, depending

01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:13.510 align:middle line:84%
on the language it came
from-- in the Hebrew,

01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:18.620 align:middle line:84%
it's vah-- it means
body, though that only

01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:22.520 align:middle line:90%
holds true if there are bodies.

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:25.439 align:middle line:84%
As you move up, you
rapidly move into areas

01:09:25.439 --> 01:09:32.410 align:middle line:84%
where matter is not a
part of a relationship.

01:09:32.410 --> 01:09:34.279 align:middle line:84%
And so it could
either mean body,

01:09:34.279 --> 01:09:36.620 align:middle line:84%
or it could just
simply mean reality,

01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:39.260 align:middle line:84%
the taking of a
reality or a portion

01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:41.060 align:middle line:90%
of the reality with you.

01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:45.294 align:middle line:84%
And so the three words together
mean a counter-rotating field

01:09:45.294 --> 01:09:49.380 align:middle line:84%
of light that contains
both spirit and body,

01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:53.850 align:middle line:84%
and it becomes a vehicle
take you from one dimension

01:09:53.850 --> 01:09:57.030 align:middle line:84%
into another, one
universe to another.

01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:59.827 align:middle line:84%
This is known
everywhere, by everybody,

01:09:59.827 --> 01:10:01.660 align:middle line:84%
except for when you
come way, way, way down,

01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:05.060 align:middle line:84%
like where we are,
where we're unconscious

01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:06.760 align:middle line:90%
and we don't remember very much.

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:08.675 align:middle line:90%
But everybody else knows.

01:10:08.675 --> 01:10:12.490 align:middle line:84%
It's, like, you know, everybody
is totally aware of it,

01:10:12.490 --> 01:10:17.720 align:middle line:84%
though the science is known
to greater and greater degrees

01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:19.900 align:middle line:90%
as people progress up further.

01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:21.900 align:middle line:84%
We are as far down the
line as you can get,

01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:23.720 align:middle line:90%
down in these two other octaves.

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:26.030 align:middle line:90%
This is not even self-aware.

01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:27.380 align:middle line:90%
We are at the very bottom.

01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:31.440 align:middle line:84%
This is the lowest possible
consciousness in the octave

01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:35.000 align:middle line:84%
there is of consciousness
and still be self-aware.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.150 align:middle line:90%


01:10:39.150 --> 01:10:42.890 align:middle line:84%
There is only one level of
consciousness underneath us,

01:10:42.890 --> 01:10:45.670 align:middle line:84%
and that one is
actually higher than us.

01:10:45.670 --> 01:10:47.600 align:middle line:90%
I'll explain that later.

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:53.690 align:middle line:84%
So we are the lowest form of--
we're the bottom right now.

01:10:53.690 --> 01:10:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And so each one of these
changes the wavelength,

01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:08.050 align:middle line:84%
gets actually shorter as you
go up in higher energy levels,

01:11:08.050 --> 01:11:11.450 align:middle line:84%
kind of like red light has a
long wavelength and violet,

01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:14.255 align:middle line:84%
purple has a short wavelength,
and the shorter wavelengths

01:11:14.255 --> 01:11:16.120 align:middle line:90%
is higher energy.

01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:19.364 align:middle line:84%
And as you progress up through
the dimensional levels,

01:11:19.364 --> 01:11:21.280 align:middle line:84%
you'll go into shorter
and shorter and shorter

01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:22.410 align:middle line:90%
wavelengths.

01:11:22.410 --> 01:11:24.550 align:middle line:84%
You go this way,
they get longer.

01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, there's
an octave below this,

01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:29.740 align:middle line:90%
and there's an octave above it.

01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:33.195 align:middle line:84%
And the octave above
it and below it

01:11:33.195 --> 01:11:37.840 align:middle line:84%
have very specific
relationships to each other,

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:38.780 align:middle line:90%
but music is the key.

01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Once you know the wavelength of
this one, and you know music,

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:44.950 align:middle line:84%
you can calculate very
precisely all the wavelengths

01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:47.800 align:middle line:84%
of all the other ones, depending
on your accuracy of how good

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:49.340 align:middle line:90%
you got that one.

01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And you can know exactly
right where they are.

01:11:52.150 --> 01:12:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And between each one of
these universes is nothing.

01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:03.380 align:middle line:90%
It's void.

01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:07.739 align:middle line:84%
It's absolutely no
thing, and there's

01:12:07.739 --> 01:12:08.905 align:middle line:90%
different kinds of voidness.

01:12:08.905 --> 01:12:12.900 align:middle line:84%
There's 144 different kinds
of voidness, each one having

01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:15.640 align:middle line:84%
different mean, depending
on what one you're in,

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:21.100 align:middle line:84%
but no matter how you do
it, it's nothing, no thing.

01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:25.780 align:middle line:84%
Only spirit moves through
these various levels,

01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:34.690 align:middle line:84%
though they have learned how to
take matter through these voids

01:12:34.690 --> 01:12:35.545 align:middle line:90%
up to here.

01:12:35.545 --> 01:12:38.450 align:middle line:90%


01:12:38.450 --> 01:12:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And right there,
and over here also,

01:12:42.810 --> 01:12:47.650 align:middle line:84%
there are what many people
refer to as the great walls.

01:12:47.650 --> 01:12:52.220 align:middle line:84%
There are these void
states here and here

01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:55.950 align:middle line:84%
that are so great and so deep
and so vast in their nature

01:12:55.950 --> 01:12:59.470 align:middle line:84%
that no thing can
pass through them.

01:12:59.470 --> 01:13:02.390 align:middle line:84%
This is the dilemma of
certain people like the Greys,

01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:03.970 align:middle line:90%
which we will go into later on.

01:13:03.970 --> 01:13:07.020 align:middle line:84%
Many of you may not
know who the Greys are,

01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:12.100 align:middle line:84%
but the Greys are a particular
race of beings in this octave

01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:15.680 align:middle line:84%
that have progressed
intellectually

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:20.220 align:middle line:84%
to the point of
saturation, you might say.

01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:23.140 align:middle line:84%
They got it all,
at least they got

01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:25.730 align:middle line:84%
half of what-- they didn't
get the emotional side of it,

01:13:25.730 --> 01:13:27.890 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't get the
intellectual side of it.

01:13:27.890 --> 01:13:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And intellectually, they can
find no way to through here

01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:35.230 align:middle line:84%
because the only way you
can get through there

01:13:35.230 --> 01:13:39.590 align:middle line:90%
is just spirit, all by itself.

01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And they are trying to use
physical machines, UFOs, flying

01:13:43.310 --> 01:13:45.696 align:middle line:84%
craft to get through,
and there is no way.

01:13:45.696 --> 01:13:47.570 align:middle line:84%
At least, there is no
known way in existence.

01:13:47.570 --> 01:13:51.560 align:middle line:90%


01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And so this basic
understanding will

01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:57.520 align:middle line:84%
help when we start
referring to various things

01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:00.980 align:middle line:90%
at different dimensional levels.

01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:06.070 align:middle line:84%
What this class teaches is how
to go from one particular level

01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:09.107 align:middle line:84%
to another specific
level, which lies--

01:14:09.107 --> 01:14:16.100 align:middle line:84%
1, 2, 3-- they sit right here,
right before the 5th dimension.

01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:21.880 align:middle line:84%
It's the 10th, 11th, and
12th overtone of the 4th.

01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:26.780 align:middle line:84%
This is the 4th, and this one is
the 5th, on a chromatic scale.

01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's right here that we're
going to go from here to there,

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:39.340 align:middle line:84%
and this is just above
the angelic realms,

01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:42.220 align:middle line:84%
of which is the 7th,
8th, and 9th overtone

01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:44.190 align:middle line:90%
of the 4th dimension.

01:14:44.190 --> 01:14:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And the 10th, 11th,
and 12th is where

01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:51.190 align:middle line:84%
a particular level of
unity consciousness

01:14:51.190 --> 01:14:52.880 align:middle line:90%
begins to take place.

01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:56.090 align:middle line:84%
It begins in these
levels, though it really

01:14:56.090 --> 01:15:03.550 align:middle line:84%
doesn't impact the person
making the transition until they

01:15:03.550 --> 01:15:04.850 align:middle line:90%
get to the 5th.

01:15:04.850 --> 01:15:07.090 align:middle line:84%
But it's right here,
where you would

01:15:07.090 --> 01:15:09.230 align:middle line:90%
call Christ consciousness.

01:15:09.230 --> 01:15:14.310 align:middle line:84%
There is a body that
exists everywhere,

01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:16.400 align:middle line:84%
and there is only
one of these bodies.

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:20.120 align:middle line:84%
There is only one son
of God, and this body

01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:23.020 align:middle line:90%
extends from this point out.

01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And there is, you might
say, an infinite number

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:29.120 align:middle line:84%
of beings that are connected
to this body or cells

01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:35.990 align:middle line:84%
in this body, and it's a
very specific understanding,

01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:38.650 align:middle line:84%
a very specific
interpretation of the reality.

01:15:38.650 --> 01:15:40.280 align:middle line:84%
There's only one
reality, but there's

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:42.770 align:middle line:90%
a lot of ways to interpret it.

01:15:42.770 --> 01:15:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And so this is where
this particular Merkaba

01:15:48.530 --> 01:15:52.310 align:middle line:84%
that I'm teaching will take
us to go from planet Earth

01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:55.940 align:middle line:90%
to these very specific places.

01:15:55.940 --> 01:15:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And from there, you won't
need me or anything else

01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:02.320 align:middle line:84%
because after that, once
you learn how to get there,

01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:07.090 align:middle line:84%
you'll be met by other specific
levels of awareness that

01:16:07.090 --> 01:16:10.180 align:middle line:84%
are connected to you
and take you on through,

01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:11.940 align:middle line:90%
through the rest of it.

01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:13.720 align:middle line:84%
So the job of this
workshop is just

01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:16.524 align:middle line:84%
to make this one little
step over to here,

01:16:16.524 --> 01:16:18.815 align:middle line:84%
and whether or not you go
into the 10th, 11th, or 12th,

01:16:18.815 --> 01:16:19.880 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't really matter.

01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:23.980 align:middle line:84%
But you will go
according to your nature,

01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:27.940 align:middle line:84%
your different
particular levels there,

01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:31.770 align:middle line:90%
and that's a stepping stone.

01:16:31.770 --> 01:16:33.826 align:middle line:84%
It's a Place to make a
translation from there

01:16:33.826 --> 01:16:35.822 align:middle line:84%
to the 5th, and from
then on in, you're

01:16:35.822 --> 01:16:38.848 align:middle line:84%
going to move very rapidly,
beyond your imagination

01:16:38.848 --> 01:16:39.648 align:middle line:90%
right now.

01:16:39.648 --> 01:16:41.393 align:middle line:84%
There aren't any words
that I can tell you

01:16:41.393 --> 01:16:43.809 align:middle line:84%
that would even begin to come
close to talking about that.

01:16:43.809 --> 01:16:47.756 align:middle line:84%
We can talk about this, kind
of, but from there on out,

01:16:47.756 --> 01:16:50.558 align:middle line:84%
it's just words that don't
mean a whole lot about anything

01:16:50.558 --> 01:16:53.330 align:middle line:90%
except experience.

01:16:53.330 --> 01:16:58.656 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the essence, on
a tactical level, of what we're

01:16:58.656 --> 01:17:01.610 align:middle line:90%
going to be teaching you.

01:17:01.610 --> 01:17:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And so now that
we've got that, I'm

01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:11.040 align:middle line:84%
going to take one
second here now.

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:12.960 align:middle line:90%
Are there any questions on this?

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>>When we go to the 4th
dimension of the 10th, 11th,

01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:20.014 align:middle line:84%
and 12th, is it Earth
in a higher dimension,

01:17:20.014 --> 01:17:21.555 align:middle line:84%
or is it someplace
totally different?

01:17:21.555 --> 01:17:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, we will
be on Earth still.

01:17:23.190 --> 01:17:27.550 align:middle line:90%


01:17:27.550 --> 01:17:30.700 align:middle line:84%
The dimensions are
all superimposed.

01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:33.570 align:middle line:84%
You don't go anywhere
to get there.

01:17:33.570 --> 01:17:37.460 align:middle line:84%
All of them, without exception,
are right here in my hand.

01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:39.970 align:middle line:84%
They are all passed
through each other,

01:17:39.970 --> 01:17:41.410 align:middle line:84%
and they're all
in the same place.

01:17:41.410 --> 01:17:42.409 align:middle line:90%
It's a matter of tuning.

01:17:42.409 --> 01:17:43.850 align:middle line:90%
It's like a television.

01:17:43.850 --> 01:17:45.780 align:middle line:90%
You've got one TV.

01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:47.260 align:middle line:90%
You change the channel.

01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:50.030 align:middle line:84%
All you're doing is changing
the wavelength of the reception,

01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:52.390 align:middle line:90%
and you get a different picture.

01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And so Earth has many
dimensional levels,

01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:57.340 align:middle line:84%
though it's really
not that many.

01:17:57.340 --> 01:18:01.460 align:middle line:84%
It has the third
dimensional level.

01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:04.950 align:middle line:84%
There's kind of a vacuum
right after the third,

01:18:04.950 --> 01:18:07.810 align:middle line:84%
but in the fourth,
there's a lot going on

01:18:07.810 --> 01:18:15.910 align:middle line:84%
between the fourth and all
the way up into-- well,

01:18:15.910 --> 01:18:20.170 align:middle line:84%
we've got some going all
the way up until the 12th.

01:18:20.170 --> 01:18:22.800 align:middle line:84%
At this point, we've even
got it over into the 13th,

01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:23.633 align:middle line:90%
which is incredible.

01:18:23.633 --> 01:18:24.598 align:middle line:90%


01:18:24.598 --> 01:18:26.510 align:middle line:84%
The cream of the
crop of our awareness

01:18:26.510 --> 01:18:28.490 align:middle line:84%
has made it, the
ascended masters.

01:18:28.490 --> 01:18:31.105 align:middle line:84%
A small number of
our ascended masters

01:18:31.105 --> 01:18:34.540 align:middle line:84%
have figured out how to get on
to the other side of the wall,

01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:37.470 align:middle line:84%
so Earth has made the leap
all the way over here,

01:18:37.470 --> 01:18:40.400 align:middle line:84%
though it's only a very
small number of us.

01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:44.620 align:middle line:84%
So we have these
different places in them,

01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:47.680 align:middle line:90%
in terms of the octave.

01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:53.020 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of life going
on in the fourth dimension.

01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:54.910 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot going
on in the fifth.

01:18:54.910 --> 01:18:56.660 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole lot
going on in the sixth,

01:18:56.660 --> 01:18:58.590 align:middle line:84%
especially into the
last 3 overtones

01:18:58.590 --> 01:19:00.480 align:middle line:90%
of the sixth dimension.

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:03.230 align:middle line:84%
The 10th, 11th, and
12th overtone, that's

01:19:03.230 --> 01:19:04.950 align:middle line:84%
where all the ascended
masters reside.

01:19:04.950 --> 01:19:09.270 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole world
there, a universe

01:19:09.270 --> 01:19:11.410 align:middle line:90%
that's there, on Earth.

01:19:11.410 --> 01:19:17.761 align:middle line:84%
And then there's only
three or four people

01:19:17.761 --> 01:19:19.760 align:middle line:84%
who were able to get into
the seventh dimension,

01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:24.630 align:middle line:84%
just in terms of human
bodies, the pineal gland.

01:19:24.630 --> 01:19:26.250 align:middle line:84%
And it was their
understanding that

01:19:26.250 --> 01:19:29.660 align:middle line:84%
allowed us to go over
to the great wall.

01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:33.062 align:middle line:84%
There's a huge learning
that's going on

01:19:33.062 --> 01:19:34.746 align:middle line:84%
with the ascended
masters right now.

01:19:34.746 --> 01:19:38.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they are just
learning like crazy right now

01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:41.590 align:middle line:84%
on a lot of things,
and so we do have

01:19:41.590 --> 01:19:45.468 align:middle line:84%
these other universes
that are around,

01:19:45.468 --> 01:19:47.095 align:middle line:90%
that the Earth is tuned to.

01:19:47.095 --> 01:19:49.152 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be somebody
there tuned to it.

01:19:49.152 --> 01:19:51.277 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's got to
be a conscioussness that's

01:19:51.277 --> 01:19:54.703 align:middle line:84%
tuned to it, and so there's life
there that is tuned to this.

01:19:54.703 --> 01:19:56.667 align:middle line:90%
It's very complex.

01:19:56.667 --> 01:20:00.595 align:middle line:84%
And I won't get into all of
it because it's very complex.

01:20:00.595 --> 01:20:05.014 align:middle line:84%
You can't speak unless
you've got the magic mic.

01:20:05.014 --> 01:20:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>>I have a question about--
do these dimensions also

01:20:10.830 --> 01:20:13.777 align:middle line:84%
relate or correspond to
the chakra in the body?

01:20:13.777 --> 01:20:14.610 align:middle line:90%
Are we moving from--

01:20:14.610 --> 01:20:16.550 align:middle line:84%
>>Absolutely, they
are identical.

01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:17.935 align:middle line:90%
You have 12 primary chakras.

01:20:17.935 --> 01:20:22.220 align:middle line:84%
The 13th one is over your head,
and the chakra system running

01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:25.350 align:middle line:84%
up, the template that
creates the chakra system,

01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:28.735 align:middle line:84%
is exactly the same template
that creates the universes.

01:20:28.735 --> 01:20:30.193 align:middle line:84%
It's also exactly
the same one that

01:20:30.193 --> 01:20:31.318 align:middle line:90%
creates the light patterns.

01:20:31.318 --> 01:20:33.130 align:middle line:84%
It's the same on that
creates your eyes.

01:20:33.130 --> 01:20:38.630 align:middle line:84%
It's the same one that all your
mental patterns are stored on.

01:20:38.630 --> 01:20:41.030 align:middle line:90%
It's used your emotional body.

01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:44.190 align:middle line:84%
It's the same exact
template, but it is the same.

01:20:44.190 --> 01:20:46.160 align:middle line:84%
The chakra patterns
moving up here

01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:47.881 align:middle line:84%
and this are
absolutely interlinked.

01:20:47.881 --> 01:20:49.845 align:middle line:84%
>>OK, so we're not
going anywhere.

01:20:49.845 --> 01:20:53.097 align:middle line:84%
We're just opening up and moving
into that different chakra.

01:20:53.097 --> 01:20:54.555 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, it's not
really a movement.

01:20:54.555 --> 01:20:57.144 align:middle line:90%
It's a consciousness change.

01:20:57.144 --> 01:20:59.060 align:middle line:90%
>>And then there is [INAUDIBLE].

01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:03.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've experienced moving
into the different chakras

01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:09.180 align:middle line:84%
at times, but this seems
to be a settling of inside

01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:11.090 align:middle line:90%
of that fourth dimension.

01:21:11.090 --> 01:21:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, there is a real
difference in, like,

01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:19.136 align:middle line:84%
moving your attention
from one chakra to another

01:21:19.136 --> 01:21:25.460 align:middle line:84%
and actually going into
it because if you actually

01:21:25.460 --> 01:21:28.170 align:middle line:84%
go beyond just moving
attention and you actually

01:21:28.170 --> 01:21:33.330 align:middle line:84%
go into that chakra, you
will be in that place.

01:21:33.330 --> 01:21:35.850 align:middle line:90%
You will be in that universe.

01:21:35.850 --> 01:21:38.347 align:middle line:84%
And so it's kind of
like the difference

01:21:38.347 --> 01:21:41.876 align:middle line:84%
between talking
about going to Europe

01:21:41.876 --> 01:21:45.940 align:middle line:84%
and actually getting on a
plane and flying over there,

01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:48.360 align:middle line:90%
which is the actual experience.

01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of times,
much of the meditation,

01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:54.134 align:middle line:84%
even for the posture
meditation, if you're

01:21:54.134 --> 01:21:55.675 align:middle line:84%
sitting for 18
hours or something

01:21:55.675 --> 01:22:02.130 align:middle line:84%
of this kind of nature, that may
or may not be the experience.

01:22:02.130 --> 01:22:03.472 align:middle line:90%
You may still be veiled.

01:22:03.472 --> 01:22:05.472 align:middle line:84%
You may be sitting there,
thinking you're having

01:22:05.472 --> 01:22:06.763 align:middle line:90%
the experience, and you're not.

01:22:06.763 --> 01:22:10.280 align:middle line:90%


01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:13.870 align:middle line:84%
If you ever move, say,
into the heart chakra,

01:22:13.870 --> 01:22:17.600 align:middle line:84%
you will know definitely that
you moved into the heart chakra

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:20.890 align:middle line:84%
because you will become
the entire universe.

01:22:20.890 --> 01:22:25.886 align:middle line:84%
It's an experience that's beyond
words, and if you have that,

01:22:25.886 --> 01:22:27.870 align:middle line:90%
you'll know it.

01:22:27.870 --> 01:22:31.000 align:middle line:84%
Whereas you could sit for
40 years in meditation,

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.830 align:middle line:84%
thinking that you are having the
experience of the heart chakra,

01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:35.288 align:middle line:90%
which, really, you're not.

01:22:35.288 --> 01:22:44.036 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know for sure
what to say to you on that.

01:22:44.036 --> 01:22:48.440 align:middle line:84%
>>Is is possible with
frequency, sound, to move?

01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:51.720 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about doing
the breathing, which is also

01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:55.830 align:middle line:84%
frequencies, but there must be
a sound wave that can vibrate.

01:22:55.830 --> 01:22:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>>OK, yeah, there is.

01:22:59.660 --> 01:23:03.560 align:middle line:90%


01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:06.280 align:middle line:84%
The technique of the
Merkaba that I'm using

01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:07.200 align:middle line:90%
is based on breathing.

01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:11.390 align:middle line:90%


01:23:11.390 --> 01:23:15.190 align:middle line:84%
There are other techniques
around breathing

01:23:15.190 --> 01:23:19.310 align:middle line:84%
that will do similar
things, that will work also.

01:23:19.310 --> 01:23:23.190 align:middle line:84%
This one that I'm using
is the primary one.

01:23:23.190 --> 01:23:25.480 align:middle line:84%
It's easiest one
and simplest one.

01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's the one that most
people in the universe

01:23:29.330 --> 01:23:31.906 align:middle line:84%
find quicker, though there
are lots of other ones.

01:23:31.906 --> 01:23:32.822 align:middle line:90%
It's not the only way.

01:23:32.822 --> 01:23:34.626 align:middle line:84%
There are other
breathing techniques,

01:23:34.626 --> 01:23:38.194 align:middle line:84%
but this criteria is
that all you have to do

01:23:38.194 --> 01:23:40.780 align:middle line:84%
is tie the information
of the Merkaba

01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:46.330 align:middle line:84%
to any aspect of
your physical body.

01:23:46.330 --> 01:23:49.350 align:middle line:90%
So you could tie it to sound.

01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:50.860 align:middle line:84%
You can tie it to
the human voice.

01:23:50.860 --> 01:23:54.282 align:middle line:84%
The human voice has the level
of frequencies of everything

01:23:54.282 --> 01:23:57.448 align:middle line:90%
that's necessary to scan this.

01:23:57.448 --> 01:24:00.412 align:middle line:84%
You could also tie it to
other aspects of the body.

01:24:00.412 --> 01:24:04.348 align:middle line:84%
You could tie it to the
very movement of the body

01:24:04.348 --> 01:24:07.624 align:middle line:90%
through space if you wanted to.

01:24:07.624 --> 01:24:13.732 align:middle line:84%
You could tie it to
sexual energy and Tantra

01:24:13.732 --> 01:24:17.989 align:middle line:90%
or to heart rhythms.

01:24:17.989 --> 01:24:21.910 align:middle line:84%
It has to be something you can
control, you have control over.

01:24:21.910 --> 01:24:24.500 align:middle line:84%
If you can control your heart,
then you can use that rhythm.

01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:27.340 align:middle line:90%


01:24:27.340 --> 01:24:30.806 align:middle line:84%
But one of the easiest things
to control is breathing,

01:24:30.806 --> 01:24:33.310 align:middle line:90%
and it has direct relationship.

01:24:33.310 --> 01:24:34.850 align:middle line:90%
So that's why we use breathing.

01:24:34.850 --> 01:24:36.260 align:middle line:90%
It's the simplest one.

01:24:36.260 --> 01:24:37.708 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of other ones.

01:24:37.708 --> 01:24:42.688 align:middle line:84%
If you study Shiva in
Hinduism, through Shiva you

01:24:42.688 --> 01:24:46.870 align:middle line:84%
will see that there are
113 forms of meditation

01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:50.034 align:middle line:84%
that they teach,
and this is very

01:24:50.034 --> 01:24:51.200 align:middle line:90%
similar to what I am saying.

01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:56.620 align:middle line:84%
The first 8 of those 113 forms
are breathing techniques.

01:24:56.620 --> 01:24:58.268 align:middle line:84%
They say these are
all the meditation

01:24:58.268 --> 01:25:00.658 align:middle line:84%
techniques there are in
existence, according to Shiva.

01:25:00.658 --> 01:25:02.570 align:middle line:84%
The first eight of
them are breathing,

01:25:02.570 --> 01:25:03.620 align:middle line:84%
and they are very
different patterns.

01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:06.264 align:middle line:84%
And no matter what the breathing
pattern is around the world,

01:25:06.264 --> 01:25:08.704 align:middle line:84%
they can fit it into
one of those eight.

01:25:08.704 --> 01:25:15.536 align:middle line:84%
And then after that,
you've got 104 more.

01:25:15.536 --> 01:25:18.938 align:middle line:90%
There's actually 112 and 1.

01:25:18.938 --> 01:25:23.330 align:middle line:84%
The first 112 are all male
because they have form.

01:25:23.330 --> 01:25:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And they have shape, and
you can communicate it

01:25:25.930 --> 01:25:27.110 align:middle line:90%
from one person to another.

01:25:27.110 --> 01:25:28.980 align:middle line:90%
You say, this is how you do it.

01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:33.620 align:middle line:84%
The 113th one is female,
and it has no form.

01:25:33.620 --> 01:25:35.844 align:middle line:84%
So you can't tell
somebody how to do it.

01:25:35.844 --> 01:25:37.510 align:middle line:84%
It's just following
the heart, and there

01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:39.160 align:middle line:90%
is no right or wrong way.

01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And so that's different,
but the male ways all

01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:42.932 align:middle line:90%
have you do it this way.

01:25:42.932 --> 01:25:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And you do it this way,
and you do it this way.

01:25:44.890 --> 01:25:47.160 align:middle line:90%
You've got form to it.

01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And the 104 ways after the
first 8 are totally unique.

01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:57.530 align:middle line:90%
They're all primal functions.

01:25:57.530 --> 01:25:59.598 align:middle line:90%
They're different.

01:25:59.598 --> 01:26:00.996 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember them all.

01:26:00.996 --> 01:26:04.480 align:middle line:84%
I can only remember a few, but
one of them, when I read it,

01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:06.074 align:middle line:84%
it was-- I'm giving
you a course.

01:26:06.074 --> 01:26:06.990 align:middle line:90%
That's a primal thing.

01:26:06.990 --> 01:26:09.980 align:middle line:84%
One of them is that you're
just sucking your thumb.

01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:11.240 align:middle line:90%
It's very primal.

01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:14.680 align:middle line:84%
It's the first thing
a baby does, man.

01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:17.976 align:middle line:84%
And for some people, they
can suck their thumb,

01:26:17.976 --> 01:26:22.936 align:middle line:84%
and they remember their
connection to God, only a few,

01:26:22.936 --> 01:26:25.325 align:middle line:84%
just one in maybe
200,000 people.

01:26:25.325 --> 01:26:26.408 align:middle line:90%
I'm just guessing at that.

01:26:26.408 --> 01:26:27.208 align:middle line:90%
It's only a few.

01:26:27.208 --> 01:26:30.872 align:middle line:90%


01:26:30.872 --> 01:26:34.190 align:middle line:84%
If you can, if you start
messing around with this stuff

01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:39.120 align:middle line:84%
before you're ready, you could
go into some dimensional level

01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:40.792 align:middle line:90%
that you're not ready for.

01:26:40.792 --> 01:26:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And when you do
that, what life does,

01:26:43.670 --> 01:26:47.920 align:middle line:84%
if you show up somewhere where
you're not supposed to be,

01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:51.764 align:middle line:90%
life kind of confiscates you.

01:26:51.764 --> 01:26:53.800 align:middle line:84%
It says, OK, you got
here ahead of time.

01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:54.834 align:middle line:90%
You just wait now.

01:26:54.834 --> 01:26:57.167 align:middle line:84%
And it'll hold you there, and
you won't be able to move.

01:26:57.167 --> 01:27:00.767 align:middle line:84%
It'll hold you there until the
rest of your consciousness,

01:27:00.767 --> 01:27:02.234 align:middle line:90%
the rest of the cells, meet up.

01:27:02.234 --> 01:27:04.359 align:middle line:84%
So those of you who read
The Emerald Tablet-- who's

01:27:04.359 --> 01:27:06.036 align:middle line:90%
read The Emerald Tablet?

01:27:06.036 --> 01:27:08.722 align:middle line:84%
A few people, you remember
when Thoth was entering

01:27:08.722 --> 01:27:09.968 align:middle line:90%
into the sixth dimension?

01:27:09.968 --> 01:27:13.587 align:middle line:90%
He wrote that book 2,000 years.

01:27:13.587 --> 01:27:15.170 align:middle line:84%
But at that time,
he was really afraid

01:27:15.170 --> 01:27:16.840 align:middle line:84%
because that was when he was
just beginning to enter it.

01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Of course, now, they're all
living in the sixth dimension.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.416 align:middle line:84%
They were just going in there,
and when they got in there,

01:27:21.416 --> 01:27:24.360 align:middle line:84%
there were the hounds that
were chasing them and trying

01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:25.200 align:middle line:90%
to get them.

01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:28.382 align:middle line:84%
And if they got them, they
would hold them and keep them.

01:27:28.382 --> 01:27:29.330 align:middle line:90%
They don't kill you.

01:27:29.330 --> 01:27:31.780 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they just hold you.

01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:32.612 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

01:27:32.612 --> 01:27:35.100 align:middle line:84%
They just keep you
there for a while,

01:27:35.100 --> 01:27:41.420 align:middle line:84%
so you could get
detained or arrested

01:27:41.420 --> 01:27:45.005 align:middle line:84%
if you proceed too
quickly and too far.

01:27:45.005 --> 01:27:46.490 align:middle line:90%
But you won't get hurt.

01:27:46.490 --> 01:27:49.955 align:middle line:84%
I mean, ultimately, you may
have to wait a long time.

01:27:49.955 --> 01:27:56.576 align:middle line:84%
It would be better to
proceed in an organic--

01:27:56.576 --> 01:27:58.435 align:middle line:84%
not to be sucked into
so much of a hurry

01:27:58.435 --> 01:28:00.914 align:middle line:84%
and experience each one of
those steps the way you have to.

01:28:00.914 --> 01:28:05.204 align:middle line:90%


01:28:05.204 --> 01:28:06.870 align:middle line:84%
OK, we only get a
couple more questions,

01:28:06.870 --> 01:28:07.950 align:middle line:90%
then we've got to go on.

01:28:07.950 --> 01:28:10.660 align:middle line:84%
>>You mentioned that the
Greys can travel from one wall

01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:12.400 align:middle line:90%
to another.

01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>>They are trapped
within these walls.

01:28:15.530 --> 01:28:17.811 align:middle line:84%
>>So they can exist in other
dimensions, or do exist?

01:28:17.811 --> 01:28:19.310 align:middle line:84%
>>Oh, yeah, yeah,
they're real good.

01:28:19.310 --> 01:28:21.460 align:middle line:84%
They can go anywhere within
these 144 dimensions.

01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:23.890 align:middle line:90%
They just can't get out.

01:28:23.890 --> 01:28:26.590 align:middle line:84%
>>And the Lucifer
aspect, how far can he

01:28:26.590 --> 01:28:28.120 align:middle line:90%
travel, also from wall to wall?

01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:30.552 align:middle line:84%
>>Lucifer is also trapped in
those 144 dimensional lines.

01:28:30.552 --> 01:28:31.352 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you.

01:28:31.352 --> 01:28:35.240 align:middle line:90%


01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>>OK, two more
questions, and that's

01:28:36.890 --> 01:28:38.260 align:middle line:90%
it, just these two people here.

01:28:38.260 --> 01:28:43.500 align:middle line:90%


01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:46.690 align:middle line:84%
>>What is the difference
between the successive octaves

01:28:46.690 --> 01:28:48.235 align:middle line:90%
and getting through the wall?

01:28:48.235 --> 01:28:49.610 align:middle line:84%
It just puts you
to a new octave?

01:28:49.610 --> 01:28:51.100 align:middle line:90%
What's the octave?

01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:57.580 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, you see, once--
OK, that's a good question.

01:28:57.580 --> 01:29:03.600 align:middle line:90%


01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:05.880 align:middle line:84%
I think I said we
exist on other levels,

01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:07.421 align:middle line:84%
when we were talking
about the angels

01:29:07.421 --> 01:29:08.740 align:middle line:90%
being us on another level.

01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:11.690 align:middle line:84%
You exist on a lot
of other levels.

01:29:11.690 --> 01:29:16.850 align:middle line:84%
Most people exist on
anywhere from five

01:29:16.850 --> 01:29:21.260 align:middle line:84%
to maybe 100 or so other
dimensional levels,

01:29:21.260 --> 01:29:24.856 align:middle line:84%
and, literally, you have a
counterpart, an aspect of you

01:29:24.856 --> 01:29:26.380 align:middle line:90%
that is literally there.

01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:28.750 align:middle line:90%
And it's you.

01:29:28.750 --> 01:29:32.710 align:middle line:84%
Though most of that is
totally conscious of itself,

01:29:32.710 --> 01:29:34.080 align:middle line:90%
stretched throughout there.

01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:37.034 align:middle line:84%
It's only this lowest,
lowest, lowest level, us,

01:29:37.034 --> 01:29:39.730 align:middle line:84%
down here that we're not aware,
though the other aspect of it

01:29:39.730 --> 01:29:40.530 align:middle line:90%
is aware of you.

01:29:40.530 --> 01:29:46.867 align:middle line:90%


01:29:46.867 --> 01:29:49.560 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
this like a piano,

01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:54.630 align:middle line:84%
and you were to play those
other worlds that you're on,

01:29:54.630 --> 01:29:57.610 align:middle line:84%
you would find that they
form chords, almost always.

01:29:57.610 --> 01:30:02.190 align:middle line:84%
It's really rare, unless
you're a terrible piano player.

01:30:02.190 --> 01:30:04.235 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] almost
always will be

01:30:04.235 --> 01:30:08.757 align:middle line:84%
in other dimensional levels
that are harmonic with the one

01:30:08.757 --> 01:30:10.080 align:middle line:90%
that you're in.

01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:14.424 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
combinations that can come out

01:30:14.424 --> 01:30:17.460 align:middle line:84%
of here besides this one,
so there's lots and lots

01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:19.040 align:middle line:90%
of other combinations.

01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:22.196 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is a
person, or a little spirit,

01:30:22.196 --> 01:30:23.570 align:middle line:84%
will learn how to
play one chord,

01:30:23.570 --> 01:30:26.140 align:middle line:84%
and then once it figures out,
hey, you can make chords,

01:30:26.140 --> 01:30:29.830 align:middle line:84%
it will try another one and then
another one and another one.

01:30:29.830 --> 01:30:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon, it learns
how to play the piano,

01:30:32.730 --> 01:30:36.010 align:middle line:84%
and eventually it learns
how to go through all 144

01:30:36.010 --> 01:30:37.350 align:middle line:90%
dimensional levels.

01:30:37.350 --> 01:30:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And the key is to be able
to go into that world

01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:43.939 align:middle line:84%
and be conscious and
stable and stay there

01:30:43.939 --> 01:30:45.480 align:middle line:84%
because what usually
happens when you

01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:48.404 align:middle line:84%
go into a dimensional world
that you're not supposed

01:30:48.404 --> 01:30:50.446 align:middle line:84%
to be there, it's either
going to trap you there,

01:30:50.446 --> 01:30:52.862 align:middle line:84%
or it's going to spit you back
out and throw you back out.

01:30:52.862 --> 01:30:54.778 align:middle line:84%
You can't stay
there for maybe more

01:30:54.778 --> 01:30:58.940 align:middle line:84%
than just-- maybe a few
minutes, experientially, or just

01:30:58.940 --> 01:31:00.570 align:middle line:90%
a short time.

01:31:00.570 --> 01:31:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And then you're really
throwing yourself out,

01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:07.260 align:middle line:84%
which I'll explain later,
but it won't keep you.

01:31:07.260 --> 01:31:09.040 align:middle line:90%
You won't be able to stay there.

01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:10.659 align:middle line:84%
But after a while,
when you slowly

01:31:10.659 --> 01:31:12.200 align:middle line:84%
start learning how
to play the piano,

01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:15.300 align:middle line:84%
you slowly learn how to go
into any of these worlds

01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:17.460 align:middle line:84%
and be comfortable and
stay there, no matter

01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:20.350 align:middle line:84%
where it is, no matter how
high it is or low it is

01:31:20.350 --> 01:31:23.920 align:middle line:84%
or complex or simple or
whatever it is that's going on.

01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:26.545 align:middle line:84%
And each one of these
different universes

01:31:26.545 --> 01:31:29.956 align:middle line:84%
are visually, experientially,
and sensually totally

01:31:29.956 --> 01:31:33.108 align:middle line:84%
different, absolutely,
completely different.

01:31:33.108 --> 01:31:34.524 align:middle line:84%
Just going from
where you're going

01:31:34.524 --> 01:31:37.622 align:middle line:84%
to go right now to this
next [INAUDIBLE] up here,

01:31:37.622 --> 01:31:39.955 align:middle line:84%
it's so different that it's
going to take me a long time

01:31:39.955 --> 01:31:42.420 align:middle line:90%
to describe it.

01:31:42.420 --> 01:31:43.960 align:middle line:90%
Even the colors aren't the same.

01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:47.150 align:middle line:84%
Shape will not be
anything like your mind

01:31:47.150 --> 01:31:48.830 align:middle line:90%
can conceive of right now.

01:31:48.830 --> 01:31:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Everything will be
real, real different,

01:31:51.330 --> 01:31:53.539 align:middle line:84%
but between this
close of a jump,

01:31:53.539 --> 01:31:54.830 align:middle line:90%
there are certain similarities.

01:31:54.830 --> 01:31:57.620 align:middle line:90%


01:31:57.620 --> 01:32:01.680 align:middle line:84%
But as you go up, it really
starts changing a lot,

01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:06.000 align:middle line:84%
and so it takes
time for a spirit

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:07.581 align:middle line:84%
to eventually get
to the place where

01:32:07.581 --> 01:32:08.830 align:middle line:90%
it can go through all of them.

01:32:08.830 --> 01:32:11.180 align:middle line:84%
When someone does
that, when they finally

01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:13.550 align:middle line:84%
learn how to do
them all, and then

01:32:13.550 --> 01:32:15.925 align:middle line:84%
they learn how to get
on to the other side,

01:32:15.925 --> 01:32:17.630 align:middle line:90%
and they realize, son of a gun.

01:32:17.630 --> 01:32:19.345 align:middle line:90%
It keeps repeating itself.

01:32:19.345 --> 01:32:20.870 align:middle line:90%
And they realize, wow.

01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:21.840 align:middle line:90%
It's all the same.

01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:23.370 align:middle line:90%
It just repeats itself.

01:32:23.370 --> 01:32:28.020 align:middle line:84%
Then a big lesson happens
right here for that spirit,

01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:31.930 align:middle line:90%
and a choice has to be made.

01:32:31.930 --> 01:32:37.880 align:middle line:84%
At that point, they can see
the whole, no matter what

01:32:37.880 --> 01:32:40.340 align:middle line:84%
octave they're in, they can
see the whole from that point.

01:32:40.340 --> 01:32:45.190 align:middle line:90%


01:32:45.190 --> 01:32:47.590 align:middle line:84%
Long before they ever
reach this place,

01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:52.730 align:middle line:84%
they're going to realize that
there is no inside and outside

01:32:52.730 --> 01:32:55.850 align:middle line:84%
and that everything
that is is them,

01:32:55.850 --> 01:32:59.695 align:middle line:90%
and so that kind of connection.

01:32:59.695 --> 01:33:02.430 align:middle line:90%


01:33:02.430 --> 01:33:04.030 align:middle line:84%
But when they make
this jump, they

01:33:04.030 --> 01:33:08.630 align:middle line:84%
will really understand
that because they

01:33:08.630 --> 01:33:14.580 align:middle line:84%
will have spanned the whole
spectrum of this experiment

01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:15.380 align:middle line:90%
that we're in.

01:33:15.380 --> 01:33:21.890 align:middle line:90%


01:33:21.890 --> 01:33:24.561 align:middle line:84%
Because they know
that all life is them,

01:33:24.561 --> 01:33:26.310 align:middle line:84%
they are either going
to make the decision

01:33:26.310 --> 01:33:30.300 align:middle line:84%
to stay here in this
wave form universe

01:33:30.300 --> 01:33:36.960 align:middle line:84%
and to help all the aspects
that are lower to get through

01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:38.840 align:middle line:84%
and to understand
or, in other words,

01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:40.346 align:middle line:90%
to complete the experiment.

01:33:40.346 --> 01:33:41.720 align:middle line:84%
They are either
going to do that,

01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:44.380 align:middle line:84%
or they're going
to leave, go what

01:33:44.380 --> 01:33:47.370 align:middle line:84%
the Tibetans call beyond the
beyond the beyond the beyond.

01:33:47.370 --> 01:33:50.640 align:middle line:84%
They're going to leave the whole
universe, totally, step back

01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:54.400 align:middle line:84%
outside the system from
which it was created,

01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:59.500 align:middle line:84%
and return into godness, return
into the single spirit that

01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:08.190 align:middle line:84%
created this from before, and
from which either way is OK.

01:34:08.190 --> 01:34:12.340 align:middle line:84%
It just depends on
what you choose.

01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:15.383 align:middle line:84%
If you choose to do that,
if you choose to stay here,

01:34:15.383 --> 01:34:18.630 align:middle line:84%
the name for that
is Melchizedek,

01:34:18.630 --> 01:34:20.510 align:middle line:84%
and it's another
level of consciousness

01:34:20.510 --> 01:34:23.300 align:middle line:84%
that is very much like
Christ consciousness.

01:34:23.300 --> 01:34:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And it is one that has
spanned the whole spectrum.

01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:30.720 align:middle line:90%


01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:33.453 align:middle line:84%
And if you do that,
the moment you

01:34:33.453 --> 01:34:35.740 align:middle line:84%
make that decision
in your heart,

01:34:35.740 --> 01:34:44.375 align:middle line:84%
life grabs you real
good, and it uses you.

01:34:44.375 --> 01:34:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And it uses you primarily in
dimensional changes and things

01:34:48.210 --> 01:34:51.210 align:middle line:84%
to do with dimensions because
you're an expert at it.

01:34:51.210 --> 01:34:54.166 align:middle line:84%
And so whenever there is a
problem in any of the worlds

01:34:54.166 --> 01:34:57.124 align:middle line:84%
or levels, octaves-- and
there's always little problems,

01:34:57.124 --> 01:34:59.600 align:middle line:90%
just like there is in your body.

01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:03.005 align:middle line:84%
When problems happen in life,
we use the [INAUDIBLE] to go in

01:35:03.005 --> 01:35:09.480 align:middle line:84%
and to try to alter or change
whatever life wants you to do.

01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:13.570 align:middle line:84%
If you go beyond, you brought
with you experience back

01:35:13.570 --> 01:35:18.000 align:middle line:84%
to that which created
the experiment,

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:19.010 align:middle line:90%
and so either way is OK.

01:35:19.010 --> 01:35:21.722 align:middle line:90%


01:35:21.722 --> 01:35:23.870 align:middle line:84%
But there is a point
where you make a decision.

01:35:23.870 --> 01:35:29.040 align:middle line:84%
If you do choose to stay within
the Melchizedek consciousness,

01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:33.960 align:middle line:84%
you then really can't
help yourself anymore

01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:37.090 align:middle line:84%
because you've gone as far
as you can on that level.

01:35:37.090 --> 01:35:40.820 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing to do but
to go back down into life

01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:44.250 align:middle line:90%
and to serve and to work.

01:35:44.250 --> 01:35:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And you try to help because
you know absolutely,

01:35:47.590 --> 01:35:50.483 align:middle line:84%
beyond any doubt
whatsoever, that there's

01:35:50.483 --> 01:35:52.284 align:middle line:90%
an absolute unity to life.

01:35:52.284 --> 01:35:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And so you begin to
allow God to work

01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:02.608 align:middle line:84%
through you so that the original
intent of the creation unfolds.

01:36:02.608 --> 01:36:08.089 align:middle line:90%


01:36:08.089 --> 01:36:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And many of you in
this room are very

01:36:09.630 --> 01:36:11.890 align:middle line:84%
close to making that
decision on certain levels.

01:36:11.890 --> 01:36:14.570 align:middle line:84%
There are certain completion
patterns that you have to do.

01:36:14.570 --> 01:36:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's not true
for most people on Earth.

01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:20.150 align:middle line:84%
Most people on
Earth, some of them

01:36:20.150 --> 01:36:22.290 align:middle line:84%
are still working
with simple chords.

01:36:22.290 --> 01:36:24.830 align:middle line:90%


01:36:24.830 --> 01:36:29.880 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean that
you're higher than them.

01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:33.160 align:middle line:84%
It just means
because you are them.

01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:37.850 align:middle line:84%
It just simply means that
your point of consciousness

01:36:37.850 --> 01:36:40.281 align:middle line:84%
is kind of lit further
down, and so you

01:36:40.281 --> 01:36:41.322 align:middle line:90%
have more responsibility.

01:36:41.322 --> 01:36:42.810 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

01:36:42.810 --> 01:36:44.794 align:middle line:90%
You've just got more to do.

01:36:44.794 --> 01:36:45.786 align:middle line:90%
You work harder.

01:36:45.786 --> 01:36:49.260 align:middle line:90%


01:36:49.260 --> 01:36:52.252 align:middle line:84%
>>So when you talked
to the few masters who

01:36:52.252 --> 01:37:00.964 align:middle line:84%
were right at the
wall, and they're

01:37:00.964 --> 01:37:02.620 align:middle line:84%
learning a whole
bunch right now,

01:37:02.620 --> 01:37:06.245 align:middle line:84%
are they just
within this octave?

01:37:06.245 --> 01:37:08.786 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, they're just within--
this is Earth consciousness I'm

01:37:08.786 --> 01:37:12.223 align:middle line:84%
referring to, and Earth
consciousness is learning how,

01:37:12.223 --> 01:37:14.678 align:middle line:84%
at the moment, to
go through the wall

01:37:14.678 --> 01:37:17.150 align:middle line:84%
and to make these
kinds of decisions.

01:37:17.150 --> 01:37:18.813 align:middle line:84%
And it's looking
like we're all going

01:37:18.813 --> 01:37:21.520 align:middle line:84%
to be faced with these decisions
because if what we think

01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:24.750 align:middle line:84%
is true, we are about
to make an extremely

01:37:24.750 --> 01:37:28.950 align:middle line:84%
unheard of, unparalleled,
never-seen-before, rapid change

01:37:28.950 --> 01:37:31.890 align:middle line:84%
from where we are down here
all the way through all

01:37:31.890 --> 01:37:36.590 align:middle line:84%
these dimensional levels at
an extremely accelerated pace.

01:37:36.590 --> 01:37:39.180 align:middle line:84%
We don't know why
it's happening.

01:37:39.180 --> 01:37:40.280 align:middle line:90%
We just think.

01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:42.244 align:middle line:84%
We believe at this
point that that's

01:37:42.244 --> 01:37:46.172 align:middle line:84%
what's going to happen here,
and everything is already

01:37:46.172 --> 01:37:48.627 align:middle line:90%
opening up that way.

01:37:48.627 --> 01:37:51.082 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] happens, it's
going to be extraordinary.

01:37:51.082 --> 01:37:53.537 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be an
extraordinary experience.

01:37:53.537 --> 01:37:57.956 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] because
this is brand new.

01:37:57.956 --> 01:38:01.884 align:middle line:84%
There's not very many brand-new
experiences in the universe,

01:38:01.884 --> 01:38:03.880 align:middle line:90%
but this a brand-new experience.

01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:07.890 align:middle line:84%
It's only every once in a
while that God intersects

01:38:07.890 --> 01:38:10.630 align:middle line:84%
outside the system,
and that appears

01:38:10.630 --> 01:38:12.390 align:middle line:84%
to be what's happening
right now on Earth,

01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:14.610 align:middle line:84%
is that God is
directly intervening

01:38:14.610 --> 01:38:17.510 align:middle line:90%
from outside the system.

01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:18.860 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

01:38:18.860 --> 01:38:20.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm really glad to see it.

01:38:20.780 --> 01:38:24.380 align:middle line:84%
OK, we'll take that
one last question then.

01:38:24.380 --> 01:38:26.240 align:middle line:90%
Just speak it out loud.

01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>>What is the reason that
God is intervening now?

01:38:29.060 --> 01:38:32.820 align:middle line:90%


01:38:32.820 --> 01:38:36.790 align:middle line:84%
>>He put this little
seed into the universe

01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:43.090 align:middle line:84%
and created a situation where
there was no other way to go,

01:38:43.090 --> 01:38:44.800 align:middle line:84%
and then what the
seed was chosen,

01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:47.440 align:middle line:84%
then everything has
unfolded because of it.

01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:49.730 align:middle line:84%
So hidden deep in
the universe was

01:38:49.730 --> 01:38:53.092 align:middle line:84%
this little thing, which
we'll talk about later,

01:38:53.092 --> 01:38:55.244 align:middle line:84%
and it's created everything
that's happening here,

01:38:55.244 --> 01:38:56.044 align:middle line:90%
the way it's going.

01:38:56.044 --> 01:38:59.990 align:middle line:90%


01:38:59.990 --> 01:39:02.600 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty obvious
that this is what

01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:09.760 align:middle line:84%
us on the outside of the system
wanted to take place, but why

01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:11.290 align:middle line:90%
now?

01:39:11.290 --> 01:39:13.540 align:middle line:84%
I can say, why now,
on certain levels,

01:39:13.540 --> 01:39:17.720 align:middle line:84%
but why now on the big
picture I have no idea.

01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:18.520 align:middle line:90%
OK, one more.

01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:21.460 align:middle line:90%
You're absolutely the last.

01:39:21.460 --> 01:39:22.440 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:23.910 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:28.426 align:middle line:84%
>>OK, give her the magic wand,
and then right after this,

01:39:28.426 --> 01:39:29.240 align:middle line:90%
we'll cut this one.

01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:31.510 align:middle line:90%
And this will be the first one.

01:39:31.510 --> 01:39:33.810 align:middle line:90%
>>So why are we here?

01:39:33.810 --> 01:39:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And has that seed
been implanted in us?

01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:41.803 align:middle line:84%
Because before I arrived,
I kept hearing that word,

01:39:41.803 --> 01:39:43.320 align:middle line:90%
without ever hearing it before.

01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:44.232 align:middle line:90%
>>What word?

01:39:44.232 --> 01:39:45.116 align:middle line:90%
>>Merkaba.

01:39:45.116 --> 01:39:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>>Oh, Merkaba, well,
it's an ancient word,

01:39:47.260 --> 01:39:49.520 align:middle line:90%
and we all know the sound of it.

01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:54.560 align:middle line:84%
The Zulus in Africa,
they talk about how

01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:55.880 align:middle line:90%
they came in-- it's this guy.

01:39:55.880 --> 01:39:56.730 align:middle line:84%
He's going around
all over the world

01:39:56.730 --> 01:39:58.970 align:middle line:84%
right now, talking about
their ancient culture.

01:39:58.970 --> 01:40:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And he talks about
how they come in

01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:06.290 align:middle line:84%
on these disk-shaped Merkabas,
using exactly the same word.

01:40:06.290 --> 01:40:08.020 align:middle line:90%
It's in their ancient tradition.

01:40:08.020 --> 01:40:11.385 align:middle line:84%
Or if you go back to
Ezekiel in the Bible,

01:40:11.385 --> 01:40:18.006 align:middle line:84%
or if you go to-- it's the
sound of that word, is ancient.

01:40:18.006 --> 01:40:22.230 align:middle line:90%
And it's an old, old, old one.

01:40:22.230 --> 01:40:23.530 align:middle line:90%
But why you?

01:40:23.530 --> 01:40:25.280 align:middle line:84%
When you're talking
about you coming here,

01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:26.675 align:middle line:84%
nobody can answer
that question but you.

01:40:26.675 --> 01:40:27.605 align:middle line:90%
That's why--

01:40:27.605 --> 01:40:30.860 align:middle line:90%
>>Us, I mean, this group of us.

01:40:30.860 --> 01:40:34.947 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, there are people that
are coming from the past.

01:40:34.947 --> 01:40:37.280 align:middle line:84%
There are people that are
coming from within the future.

01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:40.420 align:middle line:84%
There are people that are
coming from into the future,

01:40:40.420 --> 01:40:43.020 align:middle line:84%
a lot of intersecting
stuff that's

01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:47.410 align:middle line:84%
going on here that's usually
not done, at least to the degree

01:40:47.410 --> 01:40:49.392 align:middle line:84%
that it's taking
place here right now.

01:40:49.392 --> 01:40:50.850 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
things going on,

01:40:50.850 --> 01:40:55.713 align:middle line:84%
and we'll slowly unfold
this over the next few days

01:40:55.713 --> 01:40:58.248 align:middle line:84%
to the best of my
ability, is to explain

01:40:58.248 --> 01:41:01.636 align:middle line:84%
all the different levels
that are going on.

01:41:01.636 --> 01:41:03.260 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of
people coming here

01:41:03.260 --> 01:41:10.780 align:middle line:84%
that are very advanced souls
and have real definite purpose

01:41:10.780 --> 01:41:13.976 align:middle line:84%
why you're here, though
most of you, or many of you,

01:41:13.976 --> 01:41:16.460 align:middle line:84%
don't know what
that is right now.

01:41:16.460 --> 01:41:18.760 align:middle line:84%
While you may feel
it in your heart,

01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:23.870 align:middle line:84%
you may not know exactly what it
is, and that's part of my job,

01:41:23.870 --> 01:41:26.330 align:middle line:90%
is to try to jar those memories.

01:41:26.330 --> 01:42:22.919 align:middle line:90%
