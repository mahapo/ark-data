00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.888 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.888 --> 00:00:17.030 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.500 align:middle line:84%
>>It's real easy to see how
those five shapes are connected

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.465 align:middle line:90%
through crystalline structures.

00:00:22.465 --> 00:00:29.220 align:middle line:84%
It's just because they are
so obviously related to it.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.300 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at an organic
structure like this fetus

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.365 align:middle line:84%
of this baby, or yourself in
the mirror, or a tree, or a bug,

00:00:39.365 --> 00:00:45.340 align:middle line:84%
or something like this,
and I said to you,

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.780 align:middle line:84%
the same five structures
are creating those shapes,

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:56.340 align:middle line:84%
and just as much as in the
crystalline structures--

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it just
doesn't look like.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.340 align:middle line:84%
You don't see any
geometry in there.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.560 align:middle line:84%
Organic chemistry tends
to be soft and curvy

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.050 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't have
any straight lines

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.364 align:middle line:90%
and all this kind of stuff.

00:01:07.364 --> 00:01:08.780 align:middle line:84%
We don't see where
any of this is,

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.270 align:middle line:84%
so it just doesn't seem
like it's possible.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And until you look
very, very carefully--

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.890 align:middle line:84%
because hidden in
organic chemistry

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.575 align:middle line:84%
is all these very things
that we just saw in crystals.

00:01:21.575 --> 00:01:26.020 align:middle line:90%


00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.940 align:middle line:84%
In order to do that, we're going
to begin to look at conception.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.610 align:middle line:84%
We're going to start at
the very, very beginning

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.850 align:middle line:84%
of human life and work
our way out from there.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And in conception,
the conceptual process

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.275 align:middle line:84%
I'm about to show-- though we're
going to be talking about it

00:01:47.275 --> 00:01:54.200 align:middle line:84%
in terms of humans-- will
apply to all life forms known.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.130 align:middle line:90%
That's A-L-L, underlined.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.930 align:middle line:90%
All of them.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.160 align:middle line:84%
The entire spectrum of life
on this planet that we know of

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.890 align:middle line:84%
will all move through
these same exact steps

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.940 align:middle line:90%
in the same exact way.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.390 align:middle line:84%
Though we will be
talking about humans.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.470 align:middle line:84%
So we'll begin with-- the
process begins with a sphere,

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.860 align:middle line:90%
the first sacred form.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.590 align:middle line:90%
The ovum is a round ball.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.440 align:middle line:90%
It's a really round ball.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.540 align:middle line:84%
It's not kind of round
or sort of round.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.740 align:middle line:90%
It's perfectly round.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.320 align:middle line:84%
Looks like the moon,
if you could see--

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.930 align:middle line:84%
You take a chicken
egg, I always say

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.716 align:middle line:84%
that, when you hard
boil it, you take

00:02:34.716 --> 00:02:35.840 align:middle line:90%
the yolk out of the middle.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.840 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever done that?

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.920 align:middle line:90%
And you look at it?

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.160 align:middle line:90%
It's really round.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.940 align:middle line:84%
That's the most
female form there is.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And so the female
chose that shape.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.774 align:middle line:84%
If it was the male
that had the womb,

00:02:47.774 --> 00:02:48.940 align:middle line:90%
it would probably be a cube.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.814 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:51.814 --> 00:02:57.570 align:middle line:90%


00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.860 align:middle line:84%
So this is a sea urchin ovum,
with a little sea urchin

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:03.730 align:middle line:90%
sperm on there.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:04.570 align:middle line:90%
At least, I hope so.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.900 align:middle line:90%


00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.310 align:middle line:90%
So it begins as a sphere.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, the membrane of the ovum
is called the zona pellucida.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.040 align:middle line:84%
Remember the word
zona pellucida,

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.390 align:middle line:84%
because I'm going to refer
to it a whole bunch of times,

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.320 align:middle line:84%
which is just the membrane
of the first cell.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And inside the zona
pellucida there

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.050 align:middle line:84%
are these two little bodies
that are called polar bodies.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And they're embedded
inside the membrane.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.130 align:middle line:90%
And then in here's a liquid.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And inside that liquid
is another sphere,

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.950 align:middle line:84%
which is called the
female pronucleus.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And it contains 22
plus 1 chromosome.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.630 align:middle line:84%
I always say plus 1,
because the other one

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.210 align:middle line:90%
is the one that determines sex.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.100 align:middle line:84%
I should really just
say 23 chromosomes.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.300 align:middle line:84%
The process that I'm going
to describe-- mitosis

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.570 align:middle line:84%
is what it's called, cell
division-- is going to begin.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.274 align:middle line:84%
If this was the ovum
here, this little sphere,

00:04:09.274 --> 00:04:10.690 align:middle line:84%
the cells that are
going to divide

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.189 align:middle line:84%
are going to get
littler and littler

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:13.600 align:middle line:90%
and littler inside of it.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.040 align:middle line:84%
But the outer surface
of the zona pellucida

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.855 align:middle line:90%
is going to remain fixed.

00:04:17.855 --> 00:04:20.716 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't change size.

00:04:20.716 --> 00:04:21.560 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.030 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of an
important part of this,

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.620 align:middle line:90%
which you'll see later.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And the ovum-- which
you can actually

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.080 align:middle line:84%
see with the naked eye--
it's 200 times bigger

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.840 align:middle line:84%
than the average
cell on the body.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.605 align:middle line:84%
You could see it
without a microscope.

00:04:36.605 --> 00:04:38.490 align:middle line:90%
It's the only one you can.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:47.314 align:middle line:84%
This is huge, huge single
cell that, again, the division

00:04:47.314 --> 00:04:48.980 align:middle line:84%
will get smaller and
smaller and smaller

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.390 align:middle line:84%
inside it until it reaches
512 cells, at which point

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.550 align:middle line:84%
the average size of the human
cell will have been reached.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And so the process
first goes within itself

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.190 align:middle line:90%
to figure out how it's done.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And then it turns around
and expands beyond itself.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.420 align:middle line:90%


00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.100 align:middle line:90%
This is even in the geometry.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.860 align:middle line:84%
Here is the ovum
saturated with the sperm.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.980 align:middle line:84%
You probably read in
your books that it takes

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.930 align:middle line:90%
one sperm to conceive a baby.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And now they've known
actually for some time now,

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.560 align:middle line:84%
with the use of electron
microscopes, that that's not

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.140 align:middle line:90%
true.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.390 align:middle line:90%
That was only a partial truth.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.970 align:middle line:84%
The whole truth is
that it takes 10, 11,

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:44.880 align:middle line:84%
or 12 sperm that join around
the 11th, 12th, or 13th sperm,

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.800 align:middle line:84%
which form some kind
of energy package

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.450 align:middle line:84%
that allow that one
single sperm to go in.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.490 align:middle line:84%
The single sperm cannot go
through there by itself.

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.550 align:middle line:84%
It needs these other
10 or 11 or 12 guys

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:59.850 align:middle line:90%
to be able to get him through.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's my belief that this is
exactly what Jesus was doing.

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:07.640 align:middle line:84%
Jesus came to a round
ball called the Earth,

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.610 align:middle line:84%
and he gathered up 12
males called his disciples,

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:17.260 align:middle line:84%
which he absolutely had to
have to do what he had to do.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And with their energies allowed
him to penetrate into the earth

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.650 align:middle line:90%
to create a new consciousness.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.410 align:middle line:90%


00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And so much is this
analogy kind of true

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.755 align:middle line:84%
that even as you
watch the shapes that

00:06:31.755 --> 00:06:35.580 align:middle line:84%
are formed, at one point,
this will become a cube,

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.540 align:middle line:84%
as you'll see here
a little later.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.660 align:middle line:90%
And we did exactly that thing.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Our consciousness prior to Jesus
saw the earth as being round.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And then we went to the
point, in the area where

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.760 align:middle line:84%
it was conceived in, in
Europe, and went to the point

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:57.790 align:middle line:84%
where we saw the earth as
being flat and cubicle.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And then it stayed that
way for a period of time.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And then Copernicus came
along and turned it back

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:05.730 align:middle line:90%
into being round again.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.180 align:middle line:90%
And that's exactly what happens.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.060 align:middle line:84%
It starts out as being
round, it turns into a cube,

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.860 align:middle line:84%
and it goes back to
being round again.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.872 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, make up
your own mind on that.

00:07:14.872 --> 00:07:16.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.010 align:middle line:84%
These kinds of things
are hard to say for sure.

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:20.510 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, it
definitely, though,

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.820 align:middle line:84%
does take 10, 11, or 12 sperm
to allow this one to go in.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And he enters in and begin
swimming toward to pronucleus.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.190 align:middle line:84%
The next thing that
happens is the tail

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:33.563 align:middle line:84%
breaks off of that little
head and just disappears.

00:07:33.563 --> 00:07:35.670 align:middle line:90%
Just "voop," It goes away.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And the little, tiny head
expands out very quickly

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.750 align:middle line:84%
and becomes a perfect
sphere, exactly the same size

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.490 align:middle line:90%
as the female pronucleus.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.340 align:middle line:84%
This exactly the same
size is very important,

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.300 align:middle line:84%
I believe, judging by what
I know about the geometries,

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:56.580 align:middle line:84%
because the next motion is that
they merge through each other

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:00.150 align:middle line:84%
and form the vesica
piscis, the image

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.860 align:middle line:90%
of the first day of genesis.

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.040 align:middle line:84%
So at this moment, they
contain all the knowledge

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:09.470 align:middle line:84%
of the universe between them
by their very geometries.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And they can't form
that perfect image

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:16.574 align:middle line:84%
unless the male is
identical to her.

00:08:16.574 --> 00:08:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And I have a belief
here, though there's

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.800 align:middle line:90%
no scientific basis on it.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.330 align:middle line:84%
Just as each person in
this room would penetrate

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.405 align:middle line:84%
into the darkness a
certain distance-- so

00:08:24.405 --> 00:08:27.930 align:middle line:84%
our natural abilities, we
have a different size sphere

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:30.600 align:middle line:84%
around each one of us-- I
think each one of these sperm

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:35.364 align:middle line:84%
also has a different size sphere
around them that she can sense.

00:08:35.364 --> 00:08:36.780 align:middle line:10%
And I don't think
that she's going

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:41.590 align:middle line:10%
to allow any of these guys
in here unless they have

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:45.010 align:middle line:10%
the perfect size, unless
the resonance of that sphere

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:47.474 align:middle line:10%
is identical to hers.

00:08:47.474 --> 00:08:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And for this reason,
I think there

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.264 align:middle line:84%
could be a male and a female
that could try all they want

00:08:51.264 --> 00:08:55.750 align:middle line:84%
and never have a baby, because
if their spherical sizes

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:57.260 align:middle line:84%
of their natures
are too different,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.480 align:middle line:84%
they won't correspond,
because it's

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:06.230 align:middle line:84%
so obvious to me from this fact
here that this must take place.

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:08.975 align:middle line:84%
And then on the very next
step that happens after that,

00:09:08.975 --> 00:09:12.195 align:middle line:84%
they merge right through each
other and become a single cell.

00:09:12.195 --> 00:09:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And they contain the
46 chromosomes of life.

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:17.960 align:middle line:84%
This is called the human
zygote and is the first cell

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.190 align:middle line:90%
of the human body.

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:20.990 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.760 align:middle line:10%
That's a mouse, though.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.580 align:middle line:10%
Doesn't look like one, does it?

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.560 align:middle line:10%
It's starting to go
to number two there.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:31.040 align:middle line:10%
There's the fertilized
egg of a mouse.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.374 align:middle line:10%
That's an electron
microscope view of one.

00:09:33.374 --> 00:09:35.790 align:middle line:10%
The next thing that happens
is the two little polar bodies

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.835 align:middle line:10%
migrate, and they
find a place that

00:09:37.835 --> 00:09:44.030 align:middle line:10%
is north/south, which I believe
lines up with mommy/daddy,

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:45.450 align:middle line:10%
with mommy, rather.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:48.650 align:middle line:10%
They tune to her field.

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:51.980 align:middle line:10%
And from the north, and I
believe it's from the north,

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:56.240 align:middle line:10%
a tube runs down to the south
and just sort of appears

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.220 align:middle line:10%
out of nowhere very quickly.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.244 align:middle line:10%
It's a little thread.

00:09:59.244 --> 00:10:00.910 align:middle line:10%
Actually, I don't
show it here, but it's

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:04.930 align:middle line:10%
attached to the top and bottom,
a tube right down the center.

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:07.420 align:middle line:10%
And then the chromosomes
of the first cell

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:12.200 align:middle line:10%
break in half and line up along
that tube, half on one side

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.210 align:middle line:10%
and half on the other.

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:18.750 align:middle line:10%
And what you have
here right now is--

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:23.320 align:middle line:10%
as you see the electromagnetic
fields of your own body

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:27.580 align:middle line:10%
later-- you can see that this is
really an abstract view of you

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.020 align:middle line:10%
when you're an adult.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.590 align:middle line:84%
You can see you have a
north and a south pole.

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:34.320 align:middle line:84%
You're going to realize that
you have a tube down the middle,

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.575 align:middle line:84%
that you have a sphere
of energy around that,

00:10:36.575 --> 00:10:39.200 align:middle line:84%
and that half of you is on
one side and half of you's

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.980 align:middle line:90%
on the other side.

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:47.170 align:middle line:84%
It's really, very close to
what the ultimate end will be.

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:50.610 align:middle line:10%
Though the actual
dimensions of your body

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:53.600 align:middle line:10%
are also about to be
contained in here,

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:58.340 align:middle line:10%
the actual precise dimensions
of the adult human.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:02.879 align:middle line:10%
It takes a couple more steps
here before that takes place.

00:11:02.879 --> 00:11:05.337 align:middle line:10%
So the next thing that happens
is you then go from one cell

00:11:05.337 --> 00:11:07.002 align:middle line:10%
to two.

00:11:07.002 --> 00:11:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And there's the mouse egg
again, showing that they've

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:10.750 align:middle line:90%
taken off the zona pellucida.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:14.320 align:middle line:84%
So the other two
cells are like that.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, it then goes
from two to four.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:24.380 align:middle line:84%
Most of your books,
it shows this.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.970 align:middle line:84%
They didn't really know for
a long time what happens.

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:29.770 align:middle line:84%
So they usually just put them
in a square or something that.

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:32.830 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know
what shape it took.

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:34.450 align:middle line:90%
But now they do know.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And the shape is that it forms
a tetrahedron, where the four

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:48.560 align:middle line:84%
cells line up on the
points, the four points,

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:53.080 align:middle line:84%
of this tetrahedron and lined
up with the north/south.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.995 align:middle line:84%
It could be the
other way around too.

00:11:54.995 --> 00:11:56.995 align:middle line:84%
You got three of them up
here and one down here.

00:11:56.995 --> 00:12:00.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, to show you
that using geometry,

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:03.380 align:middle line:84%
this would be the zona pellucida
here, the inner surface of it.

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
four cells lining up

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:08.900 align:middle line:84%
like that, which is the tightest
compact way that you can

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.656 align:middle line:90%
get four cells into a sphere.

00:12:10.656 --> 00:12:12.156 align:middle line:10%
And this would be
a top view, if you

00:12:12.156 --> 00:12:14.145 align:middle line:10%
were looking down from below.

00:12:14.145 --> 00:12:16.270 align:middle line:10%
It would be like putting
three and one more stacked

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:17.182 align:middle line:10%
in the middle.

00:12:17.182 --> 00:12:18.890 align:middle line:10%
So if you connected
the centers together,

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:19.890 align:middle line:10%
you'd get a tetrahedron.

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:23.980 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is an actual view
of a tetrahedronal mouse egg.

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:34.480 align:middle line:84%
Here's your first cell,
your second, your third.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.862 align:middle line:84%
And this back here, over
here, is the fourth one.

00:12:37.862 --> 00:12:39.195 align:middle line:90%
Don't look at this one here yet.

00:12:39.195 --> 00:12:42.000 align:middle line:84%
If you went across here,
you'd get a triangle.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And if you ran those triangles
over to this other one,

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:49.712 align:middle line:84%
this back over here, the bigger
one, you'd get a tetrahedron.

00:12:49.712 --> 00:12:51.420 align:middle line:84%
This is beginning to
go to the next step.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.600 align:middle line:84%
It's real hard for them to get--
this thing is going so fast.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:13:01.610 align:middle line:84%
It's very hard for them to get
it exactly at the proper stage.

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:04.280 align:middle line:90%
So now you have you.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.770 align:middle line:90%
You exist as a tetrahedron.

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing that happens,
it goes from four to eight.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:15.500 align:middle line:10%
And what it does is it forms
another tetrahedron, facing

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:23.450 align:middle line:10%
the other way, and forms a
star tetrahedron, like this,

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:29.540 align:middle line:10%
so that the eight cells are on
there, which looks like this.

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:35.530 align:middle line:10%
It forms the egg of life,
the second sacred form that

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:39.360 align:middle line:10%
came out of the second
rotation of genesis.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.700 align:middle line:10%
This is what you would see.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:46.390 align:middle line:84%
This particular level of
life, according to the angels,

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:49.140 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most
important stages

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.830 align:middle line:84%
of development of
organic chemistry,

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:55.330 align:middle line:84%
or of human beings
or anything else.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:58.750 align:middle line:84%
Every life form passes through
the stage, flies, everything

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:00.210 align:middle line:90%
else, even mosquitoes.

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:02.590 align:middle line:90%
They all go through it.

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And they all end up looking
like these eight little spheres.

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And what science knows about
this is that, first of all,

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.660 align:middle line:84%
they can't tell any difference
between these spheres.

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:22.085 align:middle line:84%
They appear to be
absolutely identical.

00:14:22.085 --> 00:14:24.290 align:middle line:84%
It would be like eight
identical twins in the room.

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:27.350 align:middle line:84%
They can't see any
differences at all.

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:29.792 align:middle line:84%
They can't detect any
differences at all.

00:14:29.792 --> 00:14:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And though usually you can tell
the difference between cell

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:35.530 align:middle line:84%
and another, they can't on this
one at all, not at this level.

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:40.300 align:middle line:90%


00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And they've found that they can
sever the bonds of this, right

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:45.630 align:middle line:84%
between these two, and get
two of these like that,

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:48.069 align:middle line:90%
and get two identical beings.

00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:50.110 align:middle line:84%
Or they can sever the
bonds this way and this way

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:52.720 align:middle line:90%
and make four identical beings.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- in
works I've read,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.410 align:middle line:84%
I haven't seen
them do this yet--

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:58.430 align:middle line:84%
but theoretically they
could sever this in three

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:00.390 align:middle line:84%
different ways and make
eight, though I don't

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:03.500 align:middle line:90%
know anybody that's done that.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And what the angels
say is that these eight

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:13.880 align:middle line:84%
cells, first of
all, are immortal,

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.180 align:middle line:90%
relative to your body.

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.540 align:middle line:84%
They remain with
your body as long

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:22.957 align:middle line:84%
as your body is alive, unless
something terrible happens

00:15:22.957 --> 00:15:24.040 align:middle line:90%
to that part of your body.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.560 align:middle line:90%
It may get blown away.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what that
really means, spiritually.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:32.210 align:middle line:90%
But they'll remain in your body.

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:35.260 align:middle line:84%
Most of the cells in your
body will be regenerated.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.060 align:middle line:84%
They die, and new
ones are formed

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:39.020 align:middle line:90%
every five to seven years.

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.820 align:middle line:84%
So every five to
seven years, depending

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:44.360 align:middle line:84%
on what your cycle is, you
completely replace your body

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.590 align:middle line:90%
with a brand new body.

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:51.720 align:middle line:84%
But these cells stay there from
day one all the way to the end.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.529 align:middle line:90%
They never die.

00:15:53.529 --> 00:15:54.820 align:middle line:90%
That's not science saying that.

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Science doesn't know
where they're located.

00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And the angels also say the
precise location of them

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:05.270 align:middle line:84%
is down near the
base of the spine,

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:08.215 align:middle line:84%
and that it's straight
underneath the perineum,

00:16:08.215 --> 00:16:09.360 align:middle line:90%
going up from there.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And a short distance up from
underneath in there, up inside

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:15.210 align:middle line:84%
of there is where
they're located,

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:18.280 align:middle line:84%
which happens to be
the geometrical center

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:20.310 align:middle line:90%
of your body.

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:23.060 align:middle line:84%
If you were to measure
your body from that point,

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:26.120 align:middle line:84%
the base of your spine
to the top of your head,

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.960 align:middle line:84%
and then from that
base down to the bottom

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.920 align:middle line:90%
of your feet, same distance.

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.927 align:middle line:90%
It's exactly the same.

00:16:32.927 --> 00:16:34.885 align:middle line:84%
That is, if you take 100
people and measure it.

00:16:34.885 --> 00:16:36.562 align:middle line:84%
You might be a little
longer, and you

00:16:36.562 --> 00:16:38.790 align:middle line:84%
might have short legs,
or something like that.

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:44.940 align:middle line:10%
And they said that this is
closer to who you really are,

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.460 align:middle line:10%
though it may seem
kind of funny.

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:51.300 align:middle line:10%
They said it's really more
who you really, is these eight

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:52.710 align:middle line:10%
spheres.

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:57.310 align:middle line:10%
At one point I'm going to
talk about Egyptian Tantra.

00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:59.262 align:middle line:84%
We have eight
aspects to ourselves.

00:16:59.262 --> 00:17:01.470 align:middle line:84%
It's the reason why there's
eight electrical circuits

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:03.850 align:middle line:90%
moving through our body.

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:06.770 align:middle line:84%
There's eight totally
different aspects to our cells.

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And we have eight different,
completely, totally different

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:16.650 align:middle line:84%
lives associated with our cells,
according to Egyptian Tantra.

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:20.069 align:middle line:84%
At the right time, I will
talk about this more.

00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:23.030 align:middle line:84%
We need to lay out more before
I can really get into that.

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:28.359 align:middle line:84%
But their concepts of Tantra
and life and everything

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:32.176 align:middle line:84%
was real far more expanded
than Hindu or Tibetan or Taoist

00:17:32.176 --> 00:17:33.300 align:middle line:90%
or any of these other ways.

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:36.690 align:middle line:90%


00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:39.360 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, this is one
of the stages of it.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.175 align:middle line:84%
And it's the egg of
life, first pattern

00:17:41.175 --> 00:17:42.010 align:middle line:90%
that we're talking about.

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:44.301 align:middle line:84%
We're going to back to it
and talk about it many, many,

00:17:44.301 --> 00:17:46.720 align:middle line:90%
many times more again.

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.610 align:middle line:90%
It then goes from 8 to 16.

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:53.640 align:middle line:84%
This is the view of
that, those eight cells.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.840 align:middle line:90%
This is one edge of it.

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.670 align:middle line:84%
This is a hexagonal,
aerial view of those eight

00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:00.710 align:middle line:90%
cells packed in there.

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:03.800 align:middle line:84%
This is the electron
microscope view of that.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.450 align:middle line:84%
It's starting to
twist a little bit.

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:07.080 align:middle line:90%
This one doesn't count.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.790 align:middle line:84%
There's one, two,
three, four, five, six.

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:09.790 align:middle line:90%
There'd be seven, eight.

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:11.360 align:middle line:90%
They would form a cube in there.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.980 align:middle line:90%
That's the other thing.

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:18.254 align:middle line:84%
The start, this thing, is
the same as this thing.

00:18:18.254 --> 00:18:19.545 align:middle line:90%
Everybody sees that, don't you?

00:18:19.545 --> 00:18:22.830 align:middle line:90%


00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:24.985 align:middle line:90%
Which is a cube, also.

00:18:24.985 --> 00:18:27.580 align:middle line:90%


00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:36.940 align:middle line:84%
So they go from tetrahedronal to
star tetrahedronal to cubicle.

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And then, at that
point, it goes to eight.

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And this little guy forms one
out on the edge of each one.

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Let me see if there's--
I didn't put it in there.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:52.200 align:middle line:84%
But it first becomes
a cube within a cube.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.370 align:middle line:84%
One goes out here,
on the other edge.

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:58.360 align:middle line:84%
Just like that comes
out of Metatron's Cube.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.540 align:middle line:84%
That cube comes out as
a cube within a cube,

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:02.880 align:middle line:84%
and it forms a
cube within a cube.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And then that's the last
time it gets symmetrical.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:08.060 align:middle line:84%
Because if you make one of
those models, which I've done,

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:11.010 align:middle line:90%
you go to 8, then you go to 16.

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:14.590 align:middle line:84%
Then you take 16 more, and
you put them in symmetrically,

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:16.220 align:middle line:84%
only there's two
places left over.

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:19.980 align:middle line:84%
No matter how you do it,
there's two empty spots.

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And so then you go to
32, and you take 32,

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:24.820 align:middle line:84%
and you fill in those
two spots, and you

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:28.650 align:middle line:84%
try to make it symmetrical,
it just starts going funny.

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:31.412 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what happens in life.

00:19:31.412 --> 00:19:35.340 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:41.240 align:middle line:90%


00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:45.520 align:middle line:84%
The little perfect cube
forms a cube within a cube,

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.360 align:middle line:84%
and then it starts
doing this funny thing,

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:52.940 align:middle line:84%
and it starts becoming
a blob like this.

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And the blob starts
growing in such a way

00:19:55.540 --> 00:20:03.360 align:middle line:84%
that it becomes hollow and turns
into a sphere, a hollow sphere.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And then, at the north
and the south pole,

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:08.230 align:middle line:84%
led by probably
the eight cells--

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:12.660 align:middle line:84%
is what I suspect--
a tube begins

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:16.470 align:middle line:84%
to drop down through the
middle and go down and connect

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:19.960 align:middle line:90%
to the south one, like this.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.160 align:middle line:84%
This is an actual
electron microscope of it.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.210 align:middle line:90%
This is it the hollow ball.

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:27.140 align:middle line:84%
At this point, there's
512 cells in here.

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's a torus,
by the way, too.

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:36.020 align:middle line:84%
The [INAUDIBLE] becomes this,
and this toroidal pattern

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:39.960 align:middle line:84%
forms down through the center
and forms this structure

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.440 align:middle line:90%
through the middle.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And you have a structure that
is identical to an apple.

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:48.400 align:middle line:84%
It looks just like one, only
it's hollow in the middle.

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.580 align:middle line:84%
Can you see this core
running through here?

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:54.400 align:middle line:84%
They've ripped this apart so
you could see inside of there.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And what then happens
is this opening

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:58.880 align:middle line:90%
here becomes your mouth.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:01.560 align:middle line:90%
The other end becomes your anus.

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:04.040 align:middle line:84%
All that's inside
of this core becomes

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:07.150 align:middle line:84%
your internal structure,
when your organs are.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:10.330 align:middle line:84%
These become your lung
structures in here,

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:11.640 align:middle line:90%
where this is.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is the last time that
we have everything in common.

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:21.840 align:middle line:84%
In other words, every
life form goes-- just

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.380 align:middle line:84%
to recap this--
every life form goes

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:32.400 align:middle line:84%
from a sphere to a tetrahedron,
to a star tetrahedron,

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:37.210 align:middle line:84%
to a cube made in the
form of this one here.

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:40.450 align:middle line:84%
Then from a cube it
turns back into a sphere

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:46.073 align:middle line:84%
again, and then becomes a torus
and the shape of the apple.

00:21:46.073 --> 00:21:49.260 align:middle line:84%
All of these are all
these sacred shapes

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:54.260 align:middle line:84%
that we saw out of
Metatron's Cube.

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And every living form
known becomes the apple.

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And then from the
apple, then it depends.

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:01.440 align:middle line:84%
If it's a fly, little
wings come out.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.106 align:middle line:84%
Or if it's a dog, a little
tail starts wagging.

00:22:04.106 --> 00:22:05.930 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:11.529 align:middle line:84%
Or if it's a horse
it wants to gallop.

00:22:11.529 --> 00:22:13.320 align:middle line:84%
Or if it's a person,
we sort of stand there

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:14.521 align:middle line:90%
and wait for it to happen.

00:22:14.521 --> 00:22:16.130 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:16.930 align:middle line:90%


00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:18.420 align:middle line:90%
But we all have this in common.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:22.080 align:middle line:84%
That's why, I really do, I
think, the Bible says the tree,

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:25.916 align:middle line:84%
the fruit tree, that we bit
of in the Bible, the tree

00:22:25.916 --> 00:22:27.290 align:middle line:84%
of the knowledge
of good and evil

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:29.248 align:middle line:84%
that got us into this
place in the first place,

00:22:29.248 --> 00:22:30.720 align:middle line:90%
was an apple tree.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And the symbology is so
deeply involved in here

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:40.400 align:middle line:84%
that-- The writing of
the Bible and a lot

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.870 align:middle line:84%
of these sacred
documents were done

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:44.150 align:middle line:84%
by people on real
high levels that

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:48.920 align:middle line:84%
knew how to talk on a lot of
other levels than just one.

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:51.730 align:middle line:84%
Like the Bible, for example,
what Stan Tenen has found,

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:56.780 align:middle line:84%
not only does the Bible have
a story going through it,

00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:01.840 align:middle line:84%
but he's found that every
single letter in the Bible

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:05.200 align:middle line:84%
has deep, mathematical
significance, showing

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:10.320 align:middle line:84%
all the laws of the universe,
how the universe was created.

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.360 align:middle line:84%
The very first
line of the Bible,

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.400 align:middle line:84%
of the Hebrew Bible--
and he could show you

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:20.350 align:middle line:84%
this-- describes in
detail the Great Pyramid.

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:23.370 align:middle line:84%
Mathematically
describes it in detail.

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:24.850 align:middle line:90%
The first thing.

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:25.650 align:middle line:90%
Lays it all out.

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:27.020 align:middle line:90%
>>In what language?

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:27.820 align:middle line:90%
>>In Hebrew.

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:31.040 align:middle line:90%


00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And so we're just
not to the place

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:36.115 align:middle line:84%
yet where we're quite
able to function

00:23:36.115 --> 00:23:38.415 align:middle line:84%
in those kinds of levels,
where you could read a book

00:23:38.415 --> 00:23:39.770 align:middle line:90%
at about 100 different levels.

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:44.530 align:middle line:84%
The Emerald tablets were
written on 100 different levels.

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And you can read that
from 100 different levels

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:50.150 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness and read
something totally different

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:53.570 align:middle line:84%
into it, depending on who you
are and the time that you're

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:56.080 align:middle line:90%
reading it.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:03.140 align:middle line:84%
So we now begin to get the
feel about how the geometry is

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:07.390 align:middle line:84%
a function inside of yourself,
as well as the crystal patterns

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:08.570 align:middle line:90%
and these kinds of things.

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:10.840 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
informational systems

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:13.420 align:middle line:84%
that we're going
to be talking with.

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:17.720 align:middle line:84%
What I just showed was
the internal structure,

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.320 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning of life forms.

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And you can see how
this geometry is used.

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:25.420 align:middle line:84%
But we're now going to jump out
to the outer edge of the life

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:26.220 align:middle line:90%
form.

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:29.600 align:middle line:84%
We're going to look at the
electromagnetic fields that

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:33.260 align:middle line:84%
are around the body,
seeing how they correspond

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:39.630 align:middle line:84%
with these inner conceptional
fields inside of there,

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:42.690 align:middle line:84%
so that you can see that
these same shapes are

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:46.260 align:middle line:84%
around your body, as
well as in your body.

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And from there, it leads into
some real interesting areas

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:54.840 align:middle line:90%
that we can begin to discuss.

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.034 align:middle line:90%
