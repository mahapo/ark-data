00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.010 align:middle line:84%
>>These crop circles have
been found all over the world,

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.990 align:middle line:90%
not just in England.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.370 align:middle line:84%
But they've always been found
on one of these lines that

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.570 align:middle line:90%
comes off of Stonehenge.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.880 align:middle line:84%
There's always been a
connection back to it.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And they've not only been
found in crops, but also

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.460 align:middle line:90%
in sand and snow.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.700 align:middle line:90%
And in other countries.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.366 align:middle line:84%
They've been found
in the United States.

00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.990 align:middle line:90%
They've been found in Canada.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.260 align:middle line:90%
They've been found all over.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.770 align:middle line:84%
In fact, those guys,
Doug and what's

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.313 align:middle line:84%
his name who said that they
were the ones-- Doug and who?

00:00:47.313 --> 00:00:48.113 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:48.113 --> 00:00:51.016 align:middle line:84%
>>Doug and Dave who said that
they were the ones who did it.

00:00:51.016 --> 00:00:53.630 align:middle line:84%
While they were on TV,
at the very moment they

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.710 align:middle line:84%
were on TV saying that
we're the guys that did it,

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.970 align:middle line:84%
a crop circle was being
formed, and people

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:05.180 align:middle line:84%
were witnessing it with no
visible thing in Canada.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.170 align:middle line:90%
So those guys are really good.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.848 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:09.848 --> 00:01:11.234 align:middle line:90%

>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:12.715 --> 00:01:13.515 align:middle line:90%

>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.020 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, they tell me
they would let me know

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.650 align:middle line:90%
if I ever made it to England.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully I'll get there
real soon, God willing.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.960 align:middle line:90%
And we'll find out what it is.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:35.790 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty much clearly a
very highly evolved-- somebody,

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.680 align:middle line:84%
whoever's doing this,
is very intelligent.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.450 align:middle line:84%
But what they have found out
of these crop circles that

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.946 align:middle line:84%
have been coming up over
and over and over again,

00:01:44.946 --> 00:01:47.320 align:middle line:84%
I guess you're all pretty
well familiar with them.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is one that Richard
Hoagland worked on, and found

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.780 align:middle line:84%
that all the angles,
et cetera, in all

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.390 align:middle line:84%
of this one, this
particular one,

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.350 align:middle line:84%
also mathematically describes
a star tetrahedron inscribed

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.150 align:middle line:90%
in a sphere.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And so that whoever
is doing this,

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.430 align:middle line:84%
also seems to think that
this funny little shape is

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.776 align:middle line:90%
real important somehow.

00:02:10.776 --> 00:02:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And though this
one is probably one

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:24.480 align:middle line:84%
of the clearest tetrahedral
ones that have ever come up.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And this one, from the
analysis of this one,

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.330 align:middle line:84%
this is not only a
three-dimensional star

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.365 align:middle line:84%
tetrahedral field, because
of the slight bends--

00:02:32.365 --> 00:02:34.090 align:middle line:84%
you see this little
bend right here?

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.110 align:middle line:84%
This is a straight line,
but this particular bend

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.180 align:middle line:84%
that they have over here
describes mathematically

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.930 align:middle line:84%
a fourth dimensional
hyperspace tetrahedral

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:53.580 align:middle line:84%
cube, tetrahedral shape,
which wasn't even worked out

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.020 align:middle line:90%
until more or less recently.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:01.470 align:middle line:84%
It was a-- this is really a more
or less modern-day cutting-edge

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.730 align:middle line:90%
mathematics.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And all of the-- just the whole
thing that's going on here

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.470 align:middle line:84%
is a very high-level-- it's
talking about Merkaba fields.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.404 align:middle line:84%
And-- OK, you're gonna
have to stick it again.

00:03:18.404 --> 00:03:19.328 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:03:19.328 --> 00:03:21.638 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:03:21.638 --> 00:03:22.450 align:middle line:90%
>>What happened?

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.392 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:03:23.392 --> 00:03:24.192 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh.

00:03:24.192 --> 00:03:30.770 align:middle line:90%


00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>>This particular crop circle
is talked about in quite length

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.560 align:middle line:84%
on a tape that was made
by Norman Milanovich that

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.750 align:middle line:84%
channeled information
from the Arcturians.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And the little circle that's
down in the bottom right-hand

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.435 align:middle line:84%
corner, with all those little
like a half circle and then

00:03:50.435 --> 00:03:53.170 align:middle line:84%
a little jog, another half
circle and a little jog,

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.610 align:middle line:84%
those are something
about-- was it

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.313 align:middle line:84%
the spiral steps that go
into the queen's chamber?

00:03:58.313 --> 00:04:03.910 align:middle line:84%
That are in those-- the exact
relationship with-- there's

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.580 align:middle line:84%
something encoded in this
that relates directly

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.180 align:middle line:84%
to the geometry of
the Great Pyramid.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.150 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, I could see
that that could be true.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.890 align:middle line:84%
You could see this making
a quarter turn, then

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.350 align:middle line:90%
a 90-degree turn.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And again, we saw just
in the chakra centers,

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.110 align:middle line:84%
you have this 90-degree turn
every quarter of these things.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.144 align:middle line:84%
There's a-- I think
that if you were

00:04:28.144 --> 00:04:29.810 align:middle line:84%
to analyze all the
information in there,

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.400 align:middle line:84%
you could probably fit
into a book about that big,

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.670 align:middle line:84%
because geometry, as you
can see, is a language,

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.490 align:middle line:84%
and a great deal can
be said geometrically

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.010 align:middle line:90%
in the least amount of lines.

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, you can
just put this on there,

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:45.960 align:middle line:90%
and it says a lot.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.090 align:middle line:84%
But when you're putting
something as incredible as this

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.785 align:middle line:84%
and all these are various levels
and all these rotational speeds

00:04:52.785 --> 00:04:54.660 align:middle line:84%
and all these other
things that are on there,

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.130 align:middle line:84%
and so many things,
even the distances

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.470 align:middle line:84%
between each one of these
things and all this stuff,

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.360 align:middle line:84%
this is not done
by just some bunch

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.690 align:middle line:90%
of college kids or something.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
somebody behind here

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.300 align:middle line:84%
which has a great
deal of understanding.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And we start seeing that the
information that's in the crop

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.580 align:middle line:90%
circles is also on Mars.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's not only on
Mars, but it's also

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.560 align:middle line:84%
into the sacred sites that
are all around the world.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.930 align:middle line:84%
The same information
is embedded in there.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And the angles and
the shapes and stones

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.370 align:middle line:84%
and things that are going on,
all over the whole planet,

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.520 align:middle line:84%
not just in the Great
Pyramid or Stonehenge,

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.380 align:middle line:84%
but all over the world,
they're all interlinked.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:39.450 align:middle line:84%
There's 83,000 sacred sites,
and they're all one thing points

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:40.402 align:middle line:90%
to the next.

00:05:40.402 --> 00:05:42.860 align:middle line:84%
Richard Hoagland was trying to
bring up someone else's work

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.830 align:middle line:84%
where I can't remember
his name in the film.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And this, again, we've
also been saying,

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.446 align:middle line:84%
how in the very beginning, they
made that hole in the desert

00:05:52.446 --> 00:05:53.660 align:middle line:90%
near the Great Pyramids.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And then they were laid out
in that spiral from there.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, all
other of the sacred sites

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.220 align:middle line:84%
were laid out to all
over the whole planet,

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.120 align:middle line:84%
each one interconnected
to the next,

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.080 align:middle line:90%
back to that single little hole.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And that this was what it
was all about, both in Mars

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.300 align:middle line:90%
and what's going on.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.300 align:middle line:90%
And this is present-day.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.640 align:middle line:90%
This is right now.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.630 align:middle line:84%
This is something
going on right now.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And not a million
years in the past,

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.450 align:middle line:90%
or in the last 13,000 years.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.640 align:middle line:90%
This is simply present.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.600 align:middle line:84%
But all these things
are all interconnected

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.400 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose was to create
the Christ consciousness grid.

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.100 align:middle line:84%
This is the purpose
behind all of it,

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.750 align:middle line:90%
though not what was on Mars.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.690 align:middle line:90%
That was not the purpose.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.010 align:middle line:90%
Now, who's doing this and why?

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:44.520 align:middle line:90%
I really don't want to say now.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.130 align:middle line:84%
I have certain thoughts about
it and feelings about it,

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.180 align:middle line:84%
but I don't even want to
say it until I go over there

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.216 align:middle line:84%
and have the experience
myself and see what's going on

00:06:53.216 --> 00:06:56.392 align:middle line:90%
and let them say to me.

00:06:56.392 --> 00:06:59.730 align:middle line:84%
They have seen-- the
experiences of people

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.670 align:middle line:84%
that have seen
various ships, they

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:07.955 align:middle line:84%
tend to be extraterrestrial in
the experiences of people who

00:07:07.955 --> 00:07:10.880 align:middle line:84%
have watched the things go
on, and the spheres of light

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.070 align:middle line:84%
and the kind of ships that they
talk about that are doing this.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.260 align:middle line:84%
Whether or not this is true or
what's going, I don't know yet.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.340 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.140 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:23.076 align:middle line:90%


00:07:23.076 --> 00:07:25.970 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm a member of the Crop
Circle Research Society

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:26.770 align:middle line:90%
in England.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of last
year, we had the chairman

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.370 align:middle line:90%
came and gave us a lecture.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And at the very end of the
crop circle season, which

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:41.090 align:middle line:84%
is just before the harvest,
some very-- an individual

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:44.740 align:middle line:84%
who was so fed up with seeing
symbols came out of the pub

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.260 align:middle line:84%
one night and said, why
won't they write something?

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.360 align:middle line:84%
Why don't they just write
something in the crops?

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And the very next
day, they found what

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:57.050 align:middle line:90%
looked like Hebrew writing.

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:00.280 align:middle line:90%


00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.670 align:middle line:90%
>>What'd it say?

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:03.247 align:middle line:90%
>>And nobody can read it, right?

00:08:03.247 --> 00:08:06.590 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:07.935 align:middle line:90%
>>That's right.

00:08:07.935 --> 00:08:08.735 align:middle line:90%
Um--

00:08:08.735 --> 00:08:12.290 align:middle line:84%
>>Then he has to go get
another beer and say,

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.618 align:middle line:84%
why don't they drop a
book that tells you--

00:08:14.618 --> 00:08:16.570 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:18.210 align:middle line:90%
Well I'm not teasing on that.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:22.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean obviously, they're
aware of what we are.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:24.656 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
communicate with us.

00:08:24.656 --> 00:08:30.190 align:middle line:84%
This is-- from a
high-level intelligence,

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:32.354 align:middle line:90%
this is real clear.

00:08:32.354 --> 00:08:33.848 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:33.848 --> 00:08:34.850 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:39.683 align:middle line:84%
>>I'd like to get the
photograph of it to Stan Tenen.

00:08:39.683 --> 00:08:40.549 align:middle line:90%
>>Uh-huh.

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:43.576 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that would be
a really good idea.

00:08:43.576 --> 00:08:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Send it to me and I'll-- give it
to me and I'll send it to him.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.330 align:middle line:84%
He's been-- he would
love to have that.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:54.830 align:middle line:84%
There is a thing I'd like
to show you right now.

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:56.590 align:middle line:84%
The last crop circle
that came out,

00:08:56.590 --> 00:09:00.201 align:middle line:84%
the very, very, very last one,
which usually indicates what's

00:09:00.201 --> 00:09:01.950 align:middle line:84%
going to happen the
next year, so the crop

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.049 align:middle line:84%
circles, they haven't
started yet, right?

00:09:04.049 --> 00:09:05.090 align:middle line:90%
They haven't started yet.

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:07.570 align:middle line:84%
But the very last
one that came out

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:10.910 align:middle line:84%
was the Mandelbrot
fractal geometry.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:12.660 align:middle line:90%
Do you all know what that is?

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:13.600 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.524 align:middle line:90%
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

00:09:14.524 --> 00:09:15.450 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Mandelbrot was the guy who made
it, who happens to be English.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And the Mandelbrot
crop circle was

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:26.880 align:middle line:84%
right near where Mandelbrot
was born, where they placed it.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how
to spell Mandelbrot,

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.672 align:middle line:84%
but it's a thing that
looks kind of like this.

00:09:34.672 --> 00:09:39.010 align:middle line:90%


00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:44.300 align:middle line:90%
It kind of looks like this.

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And then off of it are
these little things that

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.260 align:middle line:90%
look like hearts all around.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.250 align:middle line:84%
This is not it at
all, but there's

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.340 align:middle line:84%
these things that-- coming
off of it like this.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:54.970 align:middle line:84%
You'll see that this
isn't even close.

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:59.345 align:middle line:84%
But it has kind of
that feel to it.

00:09:59.345 --> 00:10:01.220 align:middle line:84%
I think I want to erase
it as quick as I can.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.944 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:03.944 --> 00:10:07.365 align:middle line:84%
Don't get it embedded
too deeply in there.

00:10:07.365 --> 00:10:08.224 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:10:08.224 --> 00:10:09.586 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:10:09.586 --> 00:10:12.490 align:middle line:84%
>>And what-- and that's
talking about something

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:14.250 align:middle line:90%
a little different.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:16.280 align:middle line:84%
It's talking about
the infinity of life

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.720 align:middle line:84%
and the infinity
of the geometry.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:25.620 align:middle line:84%
It is a geometrical expression
of what infinity is,

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.550 align:middle line:90%
what it means to be infinite.

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:31.160 align:middle line:90%


00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And I know of no better way to
say that than with geometry.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.085 align:middle line:90%
