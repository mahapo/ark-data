00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>>We kind of left off about
6,000 years ago in Egypt--

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.480 align:middle line:84%
or 4,000 years ago,
whenever it was.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.730 align:middle line:90%
A lot has happened since then.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.160 align:middle line:90%


00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.080 align:middle line:84%
But in present-day time,
there was a certain series

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.030 align:middle line:84%
of events that led up-- that
had a lot of implications

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.010 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth, and we need
to see what those were.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.920 align:middle line:84%
It began with a man named
David Suzuki out of Canada,

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.630 align:middle line:90%
who's a geneticist, actually.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.430 align:middle line:90%
He's a very brilliant person.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.272 align:middle line:84%
He won the Nobel
Prize in genetics.

00:00:52.272 --> 00:00:54.870 align:middle line:90%


00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.970 align:middle line:84%
He won this prize not by
looking through a microscope,

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.630 align:middle line:84%
but by looking
through a telescope.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.490 align:middle line:90%
As above, so below.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And he was very
interested in watching

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.270 align:middle line:84%
the movement of
asteroids as they

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.380 align:middle line:90%
moved through the Solar System.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.520 align:middle line:84%
Unknown to most people
on Earth, though not

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.280 align:middle line:84%
to the scientific
community, we live inside

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.252 align:middle line:90%
of a bubble of matter.

00:01:23.252 --> 00:01:25.710 align:middle line:84%
There is the Solar System, the
Sun, the planets, everything

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.410 align:middle line:84%
like that, and then
outside of that,

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.262 align:middle line:84%
it's a sphere made
up of asteroids.

00:01:31.262 --> 00:01:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, there's
all these little--

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.892 align:middle line:84%
it's like we live inside
an eggshell, kind of.

00:01:35.892 --> 00:01:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And they rotate,
and they're always

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.110 align:middle line:84%
kind of moving
around and rotating,

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.410 align:middle line:84%
and they move with the
solar system as we move.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And every once in a while,
when these little asteroids

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.860 align:middle line:84%
will break off and move
through the Solar System--

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.045 align:middle line:84%
we get lots of them,
50, 60, 70 a year

00:01:48.045 --> 00:01:50.420 align:middle line:84%
or something like that, where
they'll move from one place

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.400 align:middle line:90%
to another.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And it was the movement
of these asteroids

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.660 align:middle line:90%
that he applied to genetics.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.660 align:middle line:84%
It's just like looking
at a big cell, you know,

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.570 align:middle line:84%
where you really get
it down into detail.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And he had a team of people that
watched the sky all the time,

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.389 align:middle line:84%
and he also had
another, smaller team

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:13.400 align:middle line:84%
of people who watched
the sky during the day,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.790 align:middle line:90%
watching the Sun.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And one day in the year 1950,
this team witnessed something

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.840 align:middle line:84%
coming off the Sun that wasn't
in any of the textbooks.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.917 align:middle line:90%
It didn't fit.

00:02:27.917 --> 00:02:29.500 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know
what the heck it was.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.610 align:middle line:90%
It didn't make any sense at all.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.160 align:middle line:84%
But they witnessed a
spiral of energy coming off

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.840 align:middle line:84%
the sun that went
right past the earth,

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.190 align:middle line:90%
and no one knew what it was.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.442 align:middle line:84%
No one knew what it
meant or anything.

00:02:41.442 --> 00:02:43.150 align:middle line:84%
All they knew is they'd
just recorded it.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.290 align:middle line:90%


00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.320 align:middle line:90%
That was in 1950.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.000 align:middle line:84%
At that same moment,
the Earth happened

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.450 align:middle line:84%
to be at the
furthest-distance point

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.380 align:middle line:84%
in the particular elliptical
pattern of a wobble.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.720 align:middle line:84%
We talk about another
wobble, the procession.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.740 align:middle line:84%
There's other wobbles--
I mentioned them.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.310 align:middle line:84%
There's this one
particular wobble

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:15.170 align:middle line:84%
that is 14 years around
that David had identified,

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.840 align:middle line:90%
and that he was working with.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.110 align:middle line:90%
And so it was like this.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.190 align:middle line:90%


00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.095 align:middle line:84%
It took 14 years to go
around this one thing,

00:03:26.095 --> 00:03:30.480 align:middle line:84%
and there's these points
here, and the Earth

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.530 align:middle line:84%
happened to be sitting
right there when

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.500 align:middle line:84%
the Sun did this "whoop"
thing, whatever it was.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.120 align:middle line:90%
And they just recorded it.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.820 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know what it
meant, except that they noticed

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:53.680 align:middle line:84%
that, three years later-- this
was in 1950-- approximately

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.650 align:middle line:84%
three years later,
in 1953-- boy,

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.690 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to write
on this, it rocks.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:06.430 align:middle line:84%
In 1953, the Sun did
this thing again.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.470 align:middle line:90%
In 1956, it did it again.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And each time it
kept doing-- this one

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.440 align:middle line:84%
was stronger than that one,
and this one was a lot stronger

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.790 align:middle line:90%
than that one.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And then in 1957, we
were on the other end

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.400 align:middle line:84%
of this thing of
the wobble, and it

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.130 align:middle line:84%
had been calculated that
we were not where we

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.740 align:middle line:90%
were supposed to be.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:38.570 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the wobble had
started to enlarge, like that.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.870 align:middle line:90%


00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.200 align:middle line:90%
They weren't certain.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:52.530 align:middle line:84%
In 1959, the Sun did another
pulse of energy, stronger

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.260 align:middle line:90%
than the one in 1956.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.310 align:middle line:84%
It was every three years,
the same sort of doing this.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And so again, in 1962, the
Sun pulsed again in this way.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.765 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, this kept
going out further and further.

00:05:11.765 --> 00:05:19.560 align:middle line:90%


00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:29.870 align:middle line:84%
In 1964, we'd come
around one time on here.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.240 align:middle line:84%
It was at that point that
the David Suzuki team

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.350 align:middle line:90%
was convinced of something.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.320 align:middle line:84%
However, they kept it
secret unto themselves

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.450 align:middle line:90%
until the year 1968.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.682 align:middle line:84%
They calculated further
for a long time,

00:05:49.682 --> 00:05:50.640 align:middle line:90%
for another four years.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.110 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to be
certain that it was true.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:06:01.670 align:middle line:84%
In 1968, David Suzuki
published a scientific paper--

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.850 align:middle line:84%
that was really only
released to Canada,

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:09.710 align:middle line:84%
the United States, and
certain other governments--

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.540 align:middle line:84%
that it was the belief
of this scientific team

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.750 align:middle line:84%
that there would be an
explosion of the Sun

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.610 align:middle line:84%
of unparalleled levels, the
likes of which we'd never

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.990 align:middle line:84%
seen before, in either
August, September, October,

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:30.150 align:middle line:84%
or November of 1972, which
would be in four more years.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And that by the
end of the century,

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.740 align:middle line:84%
and at a very specific
time, we would have

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.860 align:middle line:90%
a new North and South Pole.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.970 align:middle line:84%
They were convinced of it, and
they had very powerful proof

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:49.130 align:middle line:84%
to come up with this, that
the axis of the Earth and such

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:56.530 align:middle line:84%
was beginning to wobble
outside of its normal wobbles.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And the world governments
became aware at this time.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.500 align:middle line:84%
David Suzuki--
actually, even sooner

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:09.160 align:middle line:84%
than that-- was given
unlimited funds.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Any amount of money whatsoever,
didn't make any difference--

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.910 align:middle line:90%
whatever he needed.

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:17.320 align:middle line:84%
They gave him the University
of British Columbia.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.670 align:middle line:90%
He could have it.

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:21.402 align:middle line:84%
Anything he wanted,
didn't matter.

00:07:21.402 --> 00:07:22.860 align:middle line:84%
They gave him a
nine-story building

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.734 align:middle line:84%
filled with all the
scientists that he wanted

00:07:24.734 --> 00:07:26.306 align:middle line:90%
and any equipment he wanted.

00:07:26.306 --> 00:07:27.805 align:middle line:84%
Trudeau would've
given him anything.

00:07:27.805 --> 00:07:29.530 align:middle line:90%
It didn't matter.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:33.430 align:middle line:84%
The Canadian government began to
build these spheres that would

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.770 align:middle line:90%
house 12 males and 12 females.

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:37.880 align:middle line:84%
They were high up in
the Rocky Mountains.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And they could survive under
any imaginable conditions

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.340 align:middle line:90%
you could think of.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.750 align:middle line:84%
Even if the oceans went over
the Rocky Mountains, which

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.220 align:middle line:84%
was a very definite
possibility, they

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.650 align:middle line:84%
were designed to break
through the crust and float.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:54.770 align:middle line:84%
They would go through
any conceivable scenario.

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:57.360 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully they'd-- and
they built several of these

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.800 align:middle line:84%
as a survival things, because
to them, this was real.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:07.030 align:middle line:84%
The United States also began
to build underground terminals

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:12.290 align:middle line:84%
and things all around the
world, from Pine Gap, Australia,

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:22.800 align:middle line:84%
all the way up into-- you could
go all the way from Colorado

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.105 align:middle line:84%
Springs, Colorado, all the
way deep into White Sands, New

00:08:26.105 --> 00:08:26.905 align:middle line:90%
Mexico.

00:08:26.905 --> 00:08:28.580 align:middle line:84%
It went all the way
over, way the heck

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.780 align:middle line:84%
into the middle of Arizona
underground right now.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.470 align:middle line:90%
Never come back, never surface.

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:36.220 align:middle line:84%
All this stuff was in
the name, of course,

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:38.610 align:middle line:90%
of war and atomic bombs.

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:42.190 align:middle line:84%
They gave it other names,
but underneath all this,

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:46.850 align:middle line:84%
they knew that we were heading
for big-time trouble very,

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:48.020 align:middle line:90%
very soon.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.870 align:middle line:90%
And they were preparing.

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:51.349 align:middle line:90%
