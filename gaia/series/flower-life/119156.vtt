00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.930 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:17.270 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.420 align:middle line:84%
>>And they secretly
made plans to begin

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.320 align:middle line:84%
to try to control the
Earth, the beginning

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.900 align:middle line:84%
of the secret government, going
all the way back to Atlantis.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.660 align:middle line:90%


00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And they immediately
began to create

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.920 align:middle line:84%
the pyramids and the
functional buildings

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.530 align:middle line:84%
that they had done on
Cydonia on Atlantis

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.120 align:middle line:84%
to recreate the external
Merkaba to gain control of space

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.970 align:middle line:84%
and time and thereby to be able
to control the planet Earth.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And this time they
were very serious.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.690 align:middle line:84%
They were not going to be
swayed by someone telling them

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.720 align:middle line:90%
they should not do that.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing is that
it had been a long time

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.420 align:middle line:90%
since they had done this.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And so when they set
up the whole experiment

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.160 align:middle line:84%
and did the whole thing,
unlike the precision

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.140 align:middle line:84%
that they had done
on Mars, they lost

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.530 align:middle line:84%
control of this huge,
counter-rotating field

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:28.150 align:middle line:84%
of energy and was not able to--
and I mean really lost control

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.760 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure scared the
pants off even those guys.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And it began to rip open
the dimensional levels

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.160 align:middle line:84%
around Earth, primarily the
lower dimensional levels.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.765 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I think it was totally
a lower dimensional levels.

00:01:44.765 --> 00:01:47.140 align:middle line:84%
It could have equally been
the higher dimensional levels,

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.170 align:middle line:90%
but that isn't what happened.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And it would have been
better if it had been.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.460 align:middle line:84%
It would have been a much
easier situation to heal.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.910 align:middle line:90%
But that isn't what happened.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And this was a situation,
kind of like in terms

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.890 align:middle line:84%
of the human body,
the dimensions are

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.210 align:middle line:84%
like different
parts of the body.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.344 align:middle line:90%
It's like you have organs.

00:02:09.344 --> 00:02:11.260 align:middle line:84%
You've got a heart doing
one thing and a liver

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.580 align:middle line:90%
doing another thing.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And you got the stomach
doing another thing.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And you don't want to
break the membranes

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.780 align:middle line:90%
and go between all these things.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And the membranes are like
the dimensional thresholds

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.500 align:middle line:84%
that this Merkaba
just ripped apart.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.429 align:middle line:84%
And it was more like
a tear, like a rip.

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And so it would be just like
taking your stomach lining

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.320 align:middle line:90%
and just ripping it open.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.390 align:middle line:84%
What happens is
cells, or spirits,

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.700 align:middle line:84%
from other dimensional levels on
the other side of the membrane,

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.297 align:middle line:84%
or like blood, came
pouring into the stomach.

00:02:42.297 --> 00:02:43.630 align:middle line:90%
They're not supposed to do that.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.250 align:middle line:90%
That's against the law.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And so you had billions
of these, and maybe a lot

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.490 align:middle line:84%
more than just billions,
of these lower-dimensional,

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.470 align:middle line:84%
inner-dimensional
spirits or beings

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.050 align:middle line:84%
coming in to this
higher-dimensional world

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.050 align:middle line:90%
for them.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.300 align:middle line:90%
And they were scared to death.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.620 align:middle line:84%
They were like little
children scared to death.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.900 align:middle line:84%
This was outside of
their experience,

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.140 align:middle line:90%
and they were flowed in here.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.700 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't their
fault, poured in here.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.660 align:middle line:90%
And it was a horrible situation.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.520 align:middle line:84%
The ascended masters of
the Earth-- at that time

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:31.610 align:middle line:84%
there were only
about 1,600 of them--

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.420 align:middle line:84%
did everything they could
to heal the situation

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.570 align:middle line:84%
and act as rapidly
as they could.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.070 align:middle line:90%
And they did a very good job.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And if it had not been for them,
it would have been all over.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.530 align:middle line:90%
We would have lost this place.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.770 align:middle line:90%
It would have been gone.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.790 align:middle line:90%
We would have lost it.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.040 align:middle line:84%
But they managed to seal
up the dimensional levels,

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.900 align:middle line:84%
and they managed to get
most of these spirits back

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.630 align:middle line:84%
into the place where
they're supposed to be,

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.750 align:middle line:90%
but not all of them.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Many of them came
into the people

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.436 align:middle line:84%
that existed in Atlantis
at that time and even

00:04:07.436 --> 00:04:08.810 align:middle line:84%
into people all
around the world,

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.980 align:middle line:84%
but mostly in the Atlanteans in
the area where this took place.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.880 align:middle line:90%
And they just went into people.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And so the people were no
longer alone in their bodies.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.910 align:middle line:84%
They had anywhere
from one to hundreds

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.840 align:middle line:84%
of other people in their bodies
with him at the same time.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.880 align:middle line:90%
And it was horrible.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And there was like an internal
war going on and struggle.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And everything began
to degenerate horribly.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.320 align:middle line:84%
All the systems broke down, all
the emotional bodies and all

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.840 align:middle line:84%
your kinds of systems
of all kinds of levels

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.580 align:middle line:84%
that we call culture, all
broke down to nothing.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.780 align:middle line:90%
And total chaos ensued.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.120 align:middle line:90%
Disease became rampant.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And in the last 40,000 years of
Atlantis, it was a living hell.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.780 align:middle line:84%
It was much worse than anything
you can conceive of on Earth.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.240 align:middle line:84%
It was absolutely
terrible everywhere.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And it was looking like if it
continued the way it was going,

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.616 align:middle line:90%
Earth would just die.

00:05:23.616 --> 00:05:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And I mean a real,
permanent kind

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.930 align:middle line:84%
of death, not this environmental
stuff where the Earth could

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.520 align:middle line:84%
restore itself, but a real,
permanent death, where it would

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.430 align:middle line:84%
just not be able to be used
for its real purpose, which

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:42.670 align:middle line:84%
is a star seed, to seed
cultures and races to go out.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:59.537 align:middle line:90%
And so what did they do next?

00:05:59.537 --> 00:06:02.317 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:02.317 --> 00:06:03.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting a little
tired of this so.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.500 align:middle line:84%
This is hard to-- it's
not impossible for me,

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.610 align:middle line:90%
but it's a little hard.

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.780 align:middle line:84%
Do while I'm doing
all this talking,

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm also working with
you guys psychically

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.630 align:middle line:84%
to try to balance
things and stuff.

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.303 align:middle line:90%
And there a lot of people here.

00:06:18.303 --> 00:06:21.782 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:21.782 --> 00:06:22.582 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:06:22.582 --> 00:06:24.454 align:middle line:84%
>>--win-win situation.
[INAUDIBLE] stop and do some

00:06:24.454 --> 00:06:25.390 align:middle line:90%
balancing [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:26.990 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, right, OK.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm very glad some of you guys
have seen the videos there.

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:31.440 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.680 align:middle line:90%


00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.860 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know what to do,
and so they called in-- belief

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.280 align:middle line:84%
in different
consciousness levels

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.630 align:middle line:84%
from all over, from
galactic levels

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:46.472 align:middle line:84%
to all kinds of
places and things.

00:06:46.472 --> 00:06:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if
Galactic command was called

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.530 align:middle line:84%
in on that kind of
level, but there

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:58.620 align:middle line:84%
were a lot of levels of life
that were asked for help.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And nobody really knew
exactly what to do.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.190 align:middle line:84%
There had been
kind of a plan that

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.410 align:middle line:90%
had been taken place before.

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And so that was looked
at, and after a while,

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.850 align:middle line:84%
it was finally decided that
that's what they ought to do.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And again, what
they were looking

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:18.240 align:middle line:84%
for was a situation where
both sides would win,

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.690 align:middle line:84%
both the Martians
would come out of it

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:24.700 align:middle line:84%
and Lemurians would come
out of it in such a way

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.050 align:middle line:84%
that they could become
friends again and keep growing

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:30.130 align:middle line:90%
through this whole situation.

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.790 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like looking for
a situation with the Israelis

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:37.030 align:middle line:84%
and the Arabs can both live
together and be happy--

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:40.990 align:middle line:84%
not easy when you got
hate going back and forth

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.370 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of weird stuff
and everything's in chaos.

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.192 align:middle line:90%
It's really hard.

00:07:45.192 --> 00:07:47.150 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, you
can't just go down there

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.440 align:middle line:84%
and just shoot all the Martians
or shoot all the Americans

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.490 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:56.174 align:middle line:84%
Because the higher
consciousness knows

00:07:56.174 --> 00:07:58.090 align:middle line:84%
that there is no such
thing as death-- there's

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:02.070 align:middle line:84%
only transformation--
and that they're

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:03.640 align:middle line:84%
tied to the
evolutionary patterns,

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.860 align:middle line:84%
so it's just all going
to recycle back again.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:10.400 align:middle line:84%
The problem would just be
delayed for a short time.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.540 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't solve anything.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.410 align:middle line:84%
So they were looking
for a real solution.

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, it's getting
worse and worse and worse.

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:18.870 align:middle line:84%
They finally decided
that they were

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:21.340 align:middle line:84%
going to wait till this
particular moment over here.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:24.110 align:middle line:90%


00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the
moment of transformation.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:30.330 align:middle line:84%
They know that you can make
certain kinds of consciousness

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.260 align:middle line:84%
changes and transformation at
that time that would be easier

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.580 align:middle line:90%
then than at any other time.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.210 align:middle line:84%
It's the proper moment
for that kind of thing.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:41.169 align:middle line:84%
So they had to wait
for 4,000 years,

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:43.409 align:middle line:84%
or whatever that
number difference is

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:51.970 align:middle line:84%
there, 3,500 years or so
till they got over to there.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And then about 200
years before this

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:59.500 align:middle line:84%
is when it really began, right
in this little-- just a couple

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.480 align:middle line:84%
hundred years before that
time, right in there.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:05.560 align:middle line:90%


00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.810 align:middle line:84%
What it was decided is that
they would synthetically

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:12.640 align:middle line:84%
put the planet-- they knew
that we'd already dropped down

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.220 align:middle line:84%
through the levels, down,
down, down, down, because

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:16.310 align:middle line:90%
of this experiment.

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:19.310 align:middle line:84%
Experiment was still
going on and was still

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:23.450 align:middle line:84%
out of control, though they
had managed to confine it

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:28.010 align:middle line:84%
to kind of an oscillating
pattern, which we'll talk about

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:30.700 align:middle line:84%
a little while later,
which what that pattern is

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:35.710 align:middle line:84%
is what many people call
the Bermuda Triangle.

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:37.450 align:middle line:84%
The star tetrahedronal
field that's

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:39.890 align:middle line:84%
still sitting down
here on the ocean floor

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:43.760 align:middle line:84%
is primarily submerged, and
it's a counter-rotating field.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:47.760 align:middle line:84%
Part of it-- when the
mathematical differences

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.250 align:middle line:84%
between the one that's rotating
counterclockwise and one that's

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:56.160 align:middle line:84%
rotating clockwise
means that there

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.780 align:middle line:84%
is a greater differences going
clockwise, and the whole thing

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.170 align:middle line:90%
is moving this way.

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.670 align:middle line:90%
Then everything is normal.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:08.270 align:middle line:84%
But when it reaches its
peak and the other side

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:10.520 align:middle line:84%
starts rotating
back the other way,

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:14.350 align:middle line:90%
then it ends up being abnormal.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And you have this triangular
shape sticking out

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:21.970 align:middle line:84%
of the ocean, the apex
of this thing, which is

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:24.320 align:middle line:90%
the locked aspect of the field.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And when anything that's inside
of this sphere of energy,

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:30.890 align:middle line:84%
and especially the
tetrahedronal aspect of it,

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:33.560 align:middle line:84%
when that thing starts
going clockwise,

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.314 align:middle line:90%
you have spacetime distortion.

00:10:36.314 --> 00:10:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And all you got
to do is just look

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:40.313 align:middle line:84%
back through all of the various
things and the airplane pilots

00:10:40.313 --> 00:10:42.850 align:middle line:84%
and the boats and all the
other stuff that we're seeing,

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:44.610 align:middle line:84%
all the crazy things
that are going on.

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:48.622 align:middle line:84%
And you can go right in here in
one hour and have no problem.

00:10:48.622 --> 00:10:51.080 align:middle line:84%
Because as long as it's going
that way, there's no problem.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.375 align:middle line:84%
As soon as it goes back
the other way, bingo.

00:10:53.375 --> 00:10:54.750 align:middle line:84%
You can have all
this stuff going

00:10:54.750 --> 00:11:00.300 align:middle line:84%
on that is weird because
of the very nature of what

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.860 align:middle line:90%
a Merkaba is.

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:07.980 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, they
decided to create

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.550 align:middle line:84%
a-- they knew that we
were going to fall,

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:12.300 align:middle line:84%
and they knew we were
going to fall heavy,

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.540 align:middle line:84%
and they were hoping we wouldn't
fall any lower than where

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.530 align:middle line:90%
we are now.

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And they knew that
once we got down here,

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:25.680 align:middle line:84%
if all things would go well,
that they could get us back

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.070 align:middle line:84%
once we got over to this
other point over here, which

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:33.500 align:middle line:84%
is where we are now, if
it was carefully planned.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And what they had
to do, then, was

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:44.370 align:middle line:84%
to reconstruct, which in effect
would be to synthetically

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:48.530 align:middle line:84%
create a Christ consciousness
grid that was destroyed when we

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:50.930 align:middle line:84%
fell, a new Christ
consciousness grid

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:54.820 align:middle line:84%
for us, which is
actually something

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.680 align:middle line:90%
that wouldn't normally happen.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.120 align:middle line:84%
If we'd have fallen, and
they just didn't do anything,

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:04.820 align:middle line:84%
we would stay where
we are for a long time

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.590 align:middle line:84%
before we would come
around the place

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:09.340 align:middle line:84%
where we'd never make it back up
to Christ consciousness again.

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:13.440 align:middle line:84%
So they decided that,
in order to save us,

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.620 align:middle line:84%
they would synthetically,
or alchemically,

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.810 align:middle line:84%
however we want to look at it,
step in and create the Christ

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:23.460 align:middle line:84%
consciousness grid
around the Earth,

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:25.720 align:middle line:84%
long before it would
normally take place.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.900 align:middle line:84%
And they began 200 years before
the fall actually took place.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.990 align:middle line:84%
They did that by going
out into the desert, which

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:35.000 align:middle line:90%
wasn't a desert then.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.120 align:middle line:84%
It was a beautiful
rainforest, actually,

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.620 align:middle line:84%
in an area that we now
call Egypt and Giza, which

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.670 align:middle line:90%
is now a desert.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And they went out to a
very specific spot there,

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:52.580 align:middle line:84%
because in the Halls
of Amenti where

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:55.360 align:middle line:84%
the little flame
of consciousness

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:59.090 align:middle line:84%
that the Annunaki
and the Assyrians

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:02.250 align:middle line:84%
created from us a
long time ago, there

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:05.290 align:middle line:84%
are these poles
that come out, these

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:08.870 align:middle line:84%
axis things of all the various
levels of consciousness

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:11.610 align:middle line:90%
that we will someday arrive at.

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And one of those is the
Christ consciousness one.

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And the pole actually
comes right out

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:19.300 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth at a
very specific spot,

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:25.587 align:middle line:84%
and I mean really specific,
like about the size of an atom,

00:13:25.587 --> 00:13:27.170 align:middle line:84%
out in the middle
of the desert there,

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:30.850 align:middle line:90%
which wasn't a desert then.

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:32.860 align:middle line:90%
And it's a vortex.

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:34.520 align:middle line:84%
It's a rotating
field coming out.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And there's one at
the bottom, which

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.695 align:middle line:84%
is on a little island
called Moorea out

00:13:38.695 --> 00:13:40.800 align:middle line:84%
in the Pacific
Ocean, where the two

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.780 align:middle line:90%
poles emanate from each other.

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And one is female,
and one is male.

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And so they went to
this spot, and it

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:54.390 align:middle line:84%
was Ra and Aragot and Thoth
who went to this spot.

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:58.220 align:middle line:84%
These were three men that were
from the Naacal mystery school.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And then they went
there, and they

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:17.190 align:middle line:84%
made a hole in the ground, which
was to serve-- nothing there.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:19.620 align:middle line:84%
They just made this
little hole in the ground.

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:23.050 align:middle line:84%
Only the hole was about--
oh, I don't know-- six,

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:24.560 align:middle line:90%
eight feet around.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.309 align:middle line:90%
And it was round.

00:14:26.309 --> 00:14:27.350 align:middle line:90%
It was lined with bricks.

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And it went for one mile into
the Earth, approximately,

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.950 align:middle line:90%
a deep, absolute straight line.

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:35.490 align:middle line:84%
These were
six-dimensional beings.

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:40.770 align:middle line:84%
Whatever they thought
happened, I mean instantaneous.

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:43.350 align:middle line:84%
There was hardly any time
in between it at all.

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:46.790 align:middle line:84%
These are very
high-level people.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:52.494 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't have
to dig this hole.

00:14:52.494 --> 00:14:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Believe me, all they did is
they just thought it in place,

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:57.850 align:middle line:84%
and it was there, lined with
the bricks and the whole thing.

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:00.680 align:middle line:84%
You'll understand
here in a little while

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.620 align:middle line:90%
why they did this out of stone.

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:05.570 align:middle line:84%
They didn't use sophisticated
metals or things

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:08.357 align:middle line:84%
like this, which would
be more high-tech looking

00:15:08.357 --> 00:15:09.940 align:middle line:84%
and more sophisticated
in some levels.

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.180 align:middle line:84%
There was a very
definite reason why they

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:15.222 align:middle line:90%
chose to use natural materials.

00:15:15.222 --> 00:15:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And coming out of there
was a-- this would

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:27.240 align:middle line:90%
be an aerial view from above.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:31.486 align:middle line:84%
There was this vortex coming
out like this into space.

00:15:31.486 --> 00:15:33.860 align:middle line:84%
This would be like the shadow
on the surface of the Earth

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.550 align:middle line:90%
with that vortex from above.

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And there was
really more than one

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:42.760 align:middle line:90%
of these coming out of there.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.786 align:middle line:90%
I think there's four.

00:15:44.786 --> 00:15:46.910 align:middle line:84%
But they chose one, and I
don't know why they chose

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:49.150 align:middle line:90%
this particular one they did.

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And then on a
fourth-dimensional level,

00:15:55.240 --> 00:16:08.310 align:middle line:84%
they made three pyramids
that were lined up

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:15.220 align:middle line:84%
so the apexes were lined up
precisely on this spiral.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And then he created
this one, which is now

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:20.860 align:middle line:90%
called the Great Pyramid.

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:25.460 align:middle line:84%
They created it from the
top down with thought.

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.339 align:middle line:84%
And our science
has verified that.

00:16:27.339 --> 00:16:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't know
what to think about it,

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:32.100 align:middle line:84%
so it shoved it under the rug,
along with everything else.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:36.570 align:middle line:84%
When they carbon dated these
stones, which is really

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:39.400 align:middle line:84%
the mortar and
everything between there,

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.162 align:middle line:84%
they found that the oldest
stones were on the top.

00:16:42.162 --> 00:16:44.320 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHING] The youngest
ones were on the bottom.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know what
to think about that.

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:47.668 align:middle line:84%
So they just take
it under the rug.

00:16:47.668 --> 00:16:50.240 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't fit in our mind.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.720 align:middle line:84%
These two were
created much later,

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.470 align:middle line:84%
but they were
fourth-dimensionally created

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:54.610 align:middle line:90%
there in the first place.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And then there's actually
six more little pyramids

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:59.929 align:middle line:90%
that were made there.

00:16:59.929 --> 00:17:00.970 align:middle line:90%
They were timing devices.

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:04.760 align:middle line:90%


00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.369 align:middle line:84%
And then over in
this spot over here,

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:12.740 align:middle line:84%
they built a building,
which the Egyptians did not

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:16.109 align:middle line:84%
find until about eight
or nine years ago, maybe.

00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:19.469 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was there in '85,
so it's been-- a lot of time

00:17:19.469 --> 00:17:20.302 align:middle line:90%
goes by, doesn't it?

00:17:20.302 --> 00:17:29.190 align:middle line:90%


00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:32.620 align:middle line:84%
It's been almost 15
years now, I guess,

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:34.954 align:middle line:90%
when they first discovered that.

00:17:34.954 --> 00:17:36.870 align:middle line:84%
There's a building there,
and if you go there,

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:38.280 align:middle line:84%
you'll see that there's
only about that much

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.030 align:middle line:84%
of a building left,
the foundation.

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:43.150 align:middle line:84%
It's a golden rectangle
building, I think.

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:44.520 align:middle line:90%
It looks like it.

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And they have taken
aerial surveys of this

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:52.770 align:middle line:84%
and found that the center
of the hole, the south face

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:55.130 align:middle line:84%
of the building,
and the north face

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:58.255 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid, which I
don't have this lined up right.

00:17:58.255 --> 00:17:59.830 align:middle line:90%
It would be over here.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:04.080 align:middle line:84%
These Things are all in
a perfect, flawless line.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.760 align:middle line:90%
They can't see it at all.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And there's like about over
a mile between these things.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's so perfect
that they just

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.520 align:middle line:84%
can't conceive of how the
Egyptians could possibly have

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.810 align:middle line:90%
done that from so far away.

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:20.910 align:middle line:90%
But there it sits.

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And this line between
this whole thing

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.790 align:middle line:90%
marks the center of this hole.

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And then later,
they have discovered

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:31.950 align:middle line:84%
that there is another one
out here about a block away

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:37.830 align:middle line:84%
and another spiral coming
around through this whole thing.

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:41.320 align:middle line:84%
This one they have discovered
is a Fibonacci spiral.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And this one is a
golden mean spiral,

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.790 align:middle line:84%
which we'll get in this later,
showing that they actually

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:48.060 align:middle line:84%
know the difference
between these whole things.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:52.042 align:middle line:90%
They were perfectly lined up.

00:18:52.042 --> 00:18:54.130 align:middle line:84%
But a little later, we'll
talk about all this.

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:55.505 align:middle line:84%
Because this is
really important.

00:18:55.505 --> 00:18:57.550 align:middle line:84%
Because from an
Egyptian point of view,

00:18:57.550 --> 00:19:00.610 align:middle line:84%
you could not
resurrect if you didn't

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:03.165 align:middle line:84%
know the difference
between a Fibonacci spiral

00:19:03.165 --> 00:19:05.070 align:middle line:90%
and a logarithmic spiral.

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:07.680 align:middle line:84%
It was essential for their
particular resurrection

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.480 align:middle line:90%
philosophy.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.270 align:middle line:90%


00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:12.540 align:middle line:90%
And they marked that.

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And from the aerial view
of the Great Pyramids,

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.970 align:middle line:90%
it was really important to them.

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:19.910 align:middle line:84%
But I'll show you
this clearer later on.

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:23.620 align:middle line:10%
But anyway, this hole
and this marking here

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:28.310 align:middle line:10%
was the key to the beginning
of a worldwide grid,

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:30.590 align:middle line:10%
what we call sacred
spots, or power places,

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:32.930 align:middle line:10%
or whatever you
want to call them.

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:35.390 align:middle line:84%
There are over,
or approximately,

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:41.140 align:middle line:84%
83,000 of these
all over the world.

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And they are geomancy
places in the ley lines

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:50.260 align:middle line:84%
and the grids of the Earth that
affect an electromagnetic field

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:51.780 align:middle line:90%
that shapes around the Earth.

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.500 align:middle line:10%
By the very sticking
of rods in the earth

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.730 align:middle line:10%
and building the
pyramids and putting

00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:00.430 align:middle line:10%
crystals in certain places and
these sort of elusive things,

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:04.470 align:middle line:10%
you can affect and shape a
geometrical electromagnetic

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:07.580 align:middle line:10%
field that can be detected
electromagnetically,

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:11.070 align:middle line:10%
though it's very
weak, around the Earth

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:14.780 align:middle line:10%
and shape it so that
shape is geometrically

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:16.590 align:middle line:10%
perfect from that.

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:20.150 align:middle line:84%
The entire 83,000
sacred sites were

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:23.190 align:middle line:84%
created through these three men
on a fourth-dimensional level

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:24.650 align:middle line:90%
first.

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:28.400 align:middle line:10%
Then, over 13,000 years,
people all over the world

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.560 align:middle line:10%
were just drawn to these
places like Machu Picchu

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:37.680 align:middle line:10%
and Sacsayhuaman and Palenque
and Uxmal, all these places

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:40.670 align:middle line:10%
all over the world, and
built these structures

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:44.050 align:middle line:10%
on these very particular places.

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:46.390 align:middle line:10%
They had inner direction,
and they built them

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:48.980 align:middle line:10%
according to their
inner direction, which

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:55.640 align:middle line:10%
was following this higher
will to create this pattern.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And so it took 13,000 years
to create the grid up here.

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:02.000 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't finished until 1989.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.460 align:middle line:90%
It was just finished.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:08.100 align:middle line:90%
But this was the first place.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:11.670 align:middle line:84%
Every-- and I'll say this,
though the proof has not come

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:13.970 align:middle line:90%
out, but eventually it will.

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:15.920 align:middle line:90%
Because Thoth said one.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:19.145 align:middle line:84%
Not only is this laid out
in a logarithmic spiral,

00:21:19.145 --> 00:21:23.320 align:middle line:84%
a golden spiral, but all the
sacred sites on the planet

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:26.540 align:middle line:84%
are laid out on either goal
mean or logarithmic spirals.

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And they are all
mathematically delineated back

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:31.010 align:middle line:90%
to this single point here.

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:37.460 align:middle line:84%
Or actually, probably the
one set is delineated here,

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:39.400 align:middle line:84%
and the other set
is delineated here.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.390 align:middle line:84%
But that's the origin
of all of them,

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:46.350 align:middle line:84%
all the temples that
go down the Nile,

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:48.360 align:middle line:84%
all laid out on these
logarithmic spirals

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:49.720 align:middle line:90%
or Fibonacci spirals.

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:52.540 align:middle line:84%
But everything over
the whole planet is.

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:54.920 align:middle line:10%
And I don't think there's
any exceptions to this,

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:55.850 align:middle line:10%
though there might.

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:59.010 align:middle line:10%
There's exceptions to
just about everything.

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:02.900 align:middle line:10%
But there's not going
to be much of there is.

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And what many people
are discovering now

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:09.530 align:middle line:84%
is that the whole
system is holographic,

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:13.764 align:middle line:84%
that once you know one
building, you can determine what

00:22:13.764 --> 00:22:14.930 align:middle line:90%
the next one is going to be.

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And you can keep doing
this all the way through,

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:19.480 align:middle line:84%
that there's an
interrelationship between all

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.390 align:middle line:84%
these various times
and cultures that

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:25.060 align:middle line:84%
are all over the world,
that there was a greater

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:27.740 align:middle line:84%
mind working
through all of this,

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:30.250 align:middle line:84%
that the Peruvians were
not working on their own,

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:31.730 align:middle line:84%
that the Mexicans
were not working

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:34.000 align:middle line:84%
on their own, the Tibetans
the American Indians, all

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.790 align:middle line:84%
these various people, that
there was a greater mind doing

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:37.610 align:middle line:90%
all of this.

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And the evidence keeps
pouring in daily on that.

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:41.530 align:middle line:90%
This is true.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:45.870 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, they began
the process there.

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:48.190 align:middle line:84%
They built this one
pyramid right here.

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:53.250 align:middle line:84%
They then built a huge
city, a city of temples,

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:55.220 align:middle line:84%
really, underneath
the Great Pyramid,

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:58.210 align:middle line:84%
which they have located
some of the rooms of this,

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:01.320 align:middle line:84%
though they do
not understand it.

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.852 align:middle line:90%
Because they're in the Nile.

00:23:03.852 --> 00:23:04.690 align:middle line:90%
They've found them.

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:07.080 align:middle line:84%
They're inside the Nile with
water flowing around them.

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.070 align:middle line:84%
But there's no
water in the rooms.

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:11.090 align:middle line:84%
But they go way
deep into the Earth.

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:17.380 align:middle line:84%
The Great Pyramid sits on a
huge mountain of solid rock.

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And underneath that in the
apex of that rock structure

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:28.810 align:middle line:84%
that's underneath there
is a complex designed

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:33.960 align:middle line:90%
to hold about 10,000 people.

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And it never quite
needed that many,

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.870 align:middle line:84%
but they made it a little
bit bigger than they needed.

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:45.470 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, it held about 8,000
people at its maximum point,

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:49.720 align:middle line:84%
because that was how many
people that reached immortality

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:53.718 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth toward the
very end of all of this.

00:23:53.718 --> 00:23:56.470 align:middle line:90%


00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:58.960 align:middle line:84%
So they built all of this stuff,
laid out the whole things,

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.918 align:middle line:84%
laid out the whole
patterns, and then went back

00:24:00.918 --> 00:24:02.970 align:middle line:84%
and sat on Atlantis
for 200 years

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:06.150 align:middle line:84%
and watched everything
degenerate even further.

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, no more than
hours before Atlantis sank,

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:17.120 align:middle line:84%
they went back to this
little place, which

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.430 align:middle line:90%
is called the Land of Khem.

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:24.160 align:middle line:84%
They went to a
place that we call,

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.770 align:middle line:84%
which is right near there,
which is called the Sphinx.

00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:28.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the Emerald
Tablets, by the way,

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:32.710 align:middle line:84%
it says that Thoth
created the Sphinx.

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:35.000 align:middle line:84%
But according to
Thoth himself, he

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.070 align:middle line:84%
said that was a
mistake by Doreal.

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And he also said, by the
way, for some people here,

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:42.710 align:middle line:84%
that Doreal made many
mistakes in the interpretation

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:46.890 align:middle line:84%
of the Emerald Tablets, that
there were many-- for example,

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:50.990 align:middle line:84%
in Doreal's interpretation,
when he talks about this ship

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:55.850 align:middle line:84%
that I'm about to talk about, he
says that it had atomic motors.

00:24:55.850 --> 00:25:00.690 align:middle line:84%
This was interpreted
in 1925 or '27-- 1925.

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
most far-out thing

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:08.640 align:middle line:90%
that Doreal could think of.

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.800 align:middle line:84%
But actually, there's no
motors in there at all.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.900 align:middle line:84%
You don't need anything
because it's a Merkaba.

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:15.690 align:middle line:90%
It's a Merkaba resonance field.

00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:17.720 align:middle line:84%
So it locks on with
a living Merkaba

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.280 align:middle line:90%
field when it's activated.

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:21.560 align:middle line:90%
It runs on thought and emotion.

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:24.870 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't require
motors like we know.

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:30.780 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, so they
waited for 200 years,

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:37.830 align:middle line:84%
and then they went back to
the Sphinx, which is a marker.

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:39.510 align:middle line:90%
And that Sphinx is ancient.

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Even Thoth doesn't
know who did it,

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:45.210 align:middle line:84%
because he says it was created
before the 5 1/2 million year

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:47.920 align:middle line:90%
period.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.200 align:middle line:84%
That puts it a little bit
older than the 10,000 years

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.540 align:middle line:84%
that they're worried
about in that whole thing.

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:55.610 align:middle line:90%
He says it's really old.

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:59.040 align:middle line:84%
You might wonder,
well, how can that be?

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.280 align:middle line:90%
It could have been underground.

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.850 align:middle line:84%
Even when Napoleon
found the Sphinx,

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:07.415 align:middle line:84%
all that was sitting on
the Earth was the head.

00:26:07.415 --> 00:26:12.030 align:middle line:84%
He didn't even know there
was a body attached to it.

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And so it was hard to say
how old that thing is.

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:17.660 align:middle line:84%
All you can do is judge
it-- age the rock.

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:19.460 align:middle line:90%
That's about it.

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:22.147 align:middle line:90%
And see how old that stuff is.

00:26:22.147 --> 00:26:23.480 align:middle line:90%
He says it's really, really old.

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.930 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't know how old it is.

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And he doesn't even
know who did it.

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:30.960 align:middle line:84%
But he says that underneath
there is the oldest-- well,

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:35.980 align:middle line:84%
he says is the oldest synthetic
object in the world, which

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:39.820 align:middle line:90%
is a vehicle.

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:44.460 align:middle line:84%
It sits approximately a mile
down underneath there also

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:47.130 align:middle line:90%
in a round, circular room.

00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And from the top, it's a ship
that looks like that, just

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:52.790 align:middle line:90%
a round circle.

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And from inside,
it looks like that.

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:59.150 align:middle line:84%
It's like a disk,
just like a big,

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:10.070 align:middle line:84%
flat disk with
approximately about 20-,

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:13.670 align:middle line:84%
22-foot space between
the top and the bottom,

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:16.320 align:middle line:84%
something roughly
about that big,

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:20.130 align:middle line:84%
and about two city
blocks across.

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:22.990 align:middle line:84%
Something around
about that area.

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:25.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:27.799 align:middle line:84%
It's based on the proportions
of the Great Pyramid.

00:27:27.799 --> 00:27:29.340 align:middle line:84%
Or the other way
around-- the pyramid

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:31.600 align:middle line:90%
was based on these proportions.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:37.792 align:middle line:84%
When the pyramid was
created, it looked like this.

00:27:37.792 --> 00:27:42.220 align:middle line:90%


00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:44.972 align:middle line:84%
This is the wrong angle
here, but it's all right.

00:27:44.972 --> 00:27:50.740 align:middle line:90%


00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:55.430 align:middle line:84%
The Great Pyramid has
a missing capstone.

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:57.680 align:middle line:90%
It has a big piece off the top.

00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:00.460 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds of ideas about
where that missing capstone is

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:01.260 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:04.250 align:middle line:84%
According to Thoth, it's
in the Halls of Records.

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:07.130 align:middle line:84%
It's 5 1/2 inches
high of solid gold,

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:10.020 align:middle line:84%
and it's a holographic image
of the whole thing with all

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:12.430 align:middle line:84%
the little rooms in
it and everything.

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And it is a miniature
of the Great Pyramid.

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:21.597 align:middle line:84%
And it was not
really a capstone.

00:28:21.597 --> 00:28:23.430 align:middle line:84%
That's a big piece
that's missing off there.

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:25.437 align:middle line:90%
I think it's 24-feet square.

00:28:25.437 --> 00:28:27.270 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a few
blocks that are missing.

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:29.870 align:middle line:84%
You get up there and
it's like a room.

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:31.890 align:middle line:90%
It's a big, flat, huge place.

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And what it is is
a landing platform.

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:37.730 align:middle line:84%
This is according
to Thoth's teaching.

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:46.775 align:middle line:84%
And the ship was flown
back to-- they got into it.

00:28:46.775 --> 00:28:51.110 align:middle line:84%
Thoth was the one that
flew it the last time.

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:53.990 align:middle line:90%
Ra and Aragot also got into it.

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:57.180 align:middle line:84%
It used Thoth's spine,
though, to activate it.

00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And then they raised it
to one overtone higher

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:03.770 align:middle line:84%
than the Earth sits
on, allowing it

00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:06.950 align:middle line:84%
to pass right through the
Earth up into the atmosphere.

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:08.674 align:middle line:90%
And they flew it to Atlantis.

00:29:08.674 --> 00:29:10.590 align:middle line:84%
They picked up the rest
of the immortal beings

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:11.940 align:middle line:90%
that were there.

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:15.120 align:middle line:84%
By this time, there were
about 1,600 of them.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:19.370 align:middle line:90%
And-- is that right?

00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:21.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, about 1,600.

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And then he said that they got
no more than about 1/4 mile

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:31.250 align:middle line:84%
up away from the
surface when all of it,

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:33.814 align:middle line:84%
the last bit of Atlantis,
went in the water.

00:29:33.814 --> 00:29:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And they all sat
there and watched

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:36.710 align:middle line:90%
this thing go in the water.

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And then they flew
from there to Egypt

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:47.880 align:middle line:90%
and landed on top of this thing.

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:52.610 align:middle line:84%
So that must have
been quite a sight,

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:59.337 align:middle line:84%
considering that this was
perfectly smooth with stones

00:29:59.337 --> 00:30:01.670 align:middle line:84%
that are fitted so close
together that you couldn't even

00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:04.530 align:middle line:84%
hardly see the
seams, couldn't even

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:09.670 align:middle line:84%
get a piece of paper in the
middle, and perfectly smooth,

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:15.450 align:middle line:84%
gleaming light, and this
transparent, flat disk sitting

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:16.330 align:middle line:90%
on top.

00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:18.329 align:middle line:84%
If you'd have brought the
pyramid up to its apex

00:30:18.329 --> 00:30:21.940 align:middle line:84%
at the top, it would exactly hit
where the top surface of this

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:22.750 align:middle line:90%
was.

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to look
at this from above,

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:28.370 align:middle line:90%
this is what you would see.

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:34.710 align:middle line:84%
Let's do it in the
proper colors, I guess.

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:38.510 align:middle line:84%
You would see-- I'm going
to make this smaller.

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:40.500 align:middle line:90%
You'd see the pyramid like this.

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:50.630 align:middle line:90%


00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And you would see this thing
is sitting on top of it,

00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:55.710 align:middle line:90%
approximately like that.

00:30:55.710 --> 00:31:01.500 align:middle line:90%


00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.540 align:middle line:84%
The circumference
of this ship was

00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:07.560 align:middle line:84%
equal to the perimeter
of the Great Pyramid.

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:09.310 align:middle line:84%
For those of you who
know sacred geometry,

00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:14.250 align:middle line:84%
that's the dimensions
of life itself,

00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:17.319 align:middle line:84%
which we'll talk about when we
get into the sacred geometry

00:31:17.319 --> 00:31:18.360 align:middle line:90%
and all this other stuff.

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:23.010 align:middle line:90%


00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:24.555 align:middle line:84%
And he said they
no sooner landed on

00:31:24.555 --> 00:31:26.680 align:middle line:84%
there, locked in their
fields and everything-- now,

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.630 align:middle line:84%
remember this is an entire
group of 1,600 people creating

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:33.590 align:middle line:84%
a group Merkaba that is a
rotating field where there's

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:37.270 align:middle line:84%
a star tetrahedral
pattern moving in here

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:40.560 align:middle line:84%
and a bunch of other ones,
which I'm not going to get into.

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a
spherical pattern in that

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:51.330 align:middle line:84%
and then a huge Merkaba
field around that.

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And they locked
that in, creating

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:56.640 align:middle line:84%
their own electromagnetic
and magnetic fields.

00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:00.130 align:middle line:84%
Very, very important in a
pole shift, because when

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:03.270 align:middle line:84%
the pole shifts, what happens
is for hundreds of years

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:06.060 align:middle line:84%
prior to the poles shifting,
the magnetic field begins

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:09.340 align:middle line:84%
to decrease, going down
and down and down and down,

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:12.300 align:middle line:84%
which our science will
tell you has been going

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:13.820 align:middle line:90%
on for 500 years on Earth.

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:16.210 align:middle line:84%
It's been getting weaker and
weaker and weaker and weaker

00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:20.800 align:middle line:84%
for 500 years and now
beginning to migrate and move.

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:24.319 align:middle line:84%
This is the reason the whales
come in, land into the beaches

00:32:24.319 --> 00:32:25.860 align:middle line:84%
and things, because
they're following

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:30.410 align:middle line:84%
these ancient
electromagnetic lines, which

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:32.890 align:middle line:84%
have been a certain way for
a long time, which are now

00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:33.690 align:middle line:90%
distorting.

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:35.300 align:middle line:90%
They're moving into land masses.

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And they're just following
these things right

00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:38.508 align:middle line:84%
into there, which are
not supposed to be there.

00:32:38.508 --> 00:32:41.560 align:middle line:84%
It's all getting distorted and
changed and getting weaker.

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:44.140 align:middle line:84%
We will come up to a
place prior to the poles

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:47.840 align:middle line:84%
shifting when the magnetic
field of the Earth

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.610 align:middle line:90%
will just collapse in.

00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:50.550 align:middle line:90%
It will go away.

00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:51.350 align:middle line:90%
There won't be any.

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:54.480 align:middle line:90%


00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.840 align:middle line:84%
A little later, I'll
show you an article here

00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:58.640 align:middle line:84%
that they just
discovered something

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.185 align:middle line:90%
brand new in the human brain.

00:33:00.185 --> 00:33:01.685 align:middle line:84%
They haven't
discovered anything new

00:33:01.685 --> 00:33:03.920 align:middle line:90%
in the human body in 300 years.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And they just
discovered something,

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:08.450 align:middle line:84%
and that is that the
cells of the human brain

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:10.330 align:middle line:90%
have magnets in them.

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And there's a magnetic
sheath that moves

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.457 align:middle line:84%
around the entire brain, which
they never knew was there.

00:33:16.457 --> 00:33:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And what they will
eventually discover

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:22.960 align:middle line:84%
is that memory is a function
of a magnetic field, which

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:26.340 align:middle line:84%
has a very specific geometrical
pattern, which I'll show you

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:31.210 align:middle line:84%
a little later, and
that it requires

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:38.380 align:middle line:84%
a low-level, external magnetic
field to keep it intact.

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:48.800 align:middle line:90%


00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And not just any kind of
field-- it needs the Earth.

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:56.310 align:middle line:84%
Or it needs a pattern
that can be regenerated

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:58.450 align:middle line:90%
very much like the Earth.

00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And when that pattern
totally goes away,

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:05.910 align:middle line:90%
something else also goes away.

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:08.699 align:middle line:90%
It's called memory.

00:34:08.699 --> 00:34:12.396 align:middle line:84%
It's like pulling the
plug on a computer.

00:34:12.396 --> 00:34:15.620 align:middle line:90%
We know nothing.

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:18.310 align:middle line:90%
Everything we've stored is gone.

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:21.389 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
happened on Atlantis.

00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:25.219 align:middle line:84%
Here's all these people,
very, very sophisticated.

00:34:25.219 --> 00:34:28.859 align:middle line:84%
You would really be amazed at
how sophisticated they were

00:34:28.859 --> 00:34:31.150 align:middle line:84%
and where they were at and
what the levels of awareness

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:32.139 align:middle line:90%
they were at.

00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden in a 20-hour
period, gone-- no awareness,

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.339 align:middle line:90%
nothing.

00:34:42.339 --> 00:34:44.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just imagine what
would happen right now if you

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:46.699 align:middle line:90%
suddenly had your mind erased.

00:34:46.699 --> 00:34:49.960 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't know how to
get out of this building.

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:53.300 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't know
what anything was for.

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:57.690 align:middle line:84%
It would just be like-- it
would just be pure survival.

00:34:57.690 --> 00:34:58.830 align:middle line:90%
You would still be alive.

00:34:58.830 --> 00:34:59.630 align:middle line:90%
You'd be conscious.

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:00.770 align:middle line:90%
You'd be aware.

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:03.189 align:middle line:84%
But you wouldn't know
what anything was.

00:35:03.189 --> 00:35:04.730 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't know
how to open a door.

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:07.850 align:middle line:90%
You wouldn't know anything.

00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:10.850 align:middle line:84%
And these people were
right back to figuring out

00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:16.530 align:middle line:84%
how to make fires and keep alive
and stay warm and right back

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:18.330 align:middle line:90%
down to the basics again.

00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:23.210 align:middle line:84%
But not these guys, because they
had created their own Merkaba

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:26.820 align:middle line:84%
field, which keeps
their memory intact.

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And again, the definition
that I'm defining immortality

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:33.810 align:middle line:90%
is the memory that stays intact.

00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And so once you get your
Merkaba, the living field

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:41.710 align:middle line:84%
Merkaba in place, you
can keep your memory

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:44.700 align:middle line:84%
intact under any
conditions whatsoever,

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:48.420 align:middle line:84%
even under conditions
that you would not

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:51.200 align:middle line:84%
imagine that this kind of field
could possibly protect you

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.910 align:middle line:84%
under, like an atomic
bomb blowing up

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:55.000 align:middle line:90%
or something like this.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.277 align:middle line:90%
Wouldn't affect it.

00:35:56.277 --> 00:35:57.860 align:middle line:84%
You could be right
in the midst of it,

00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:59.151 align:middle line:90%
and it wouldn't even affect it.

00:35:59.151 --> 00:36:02.450 align:middle line:84%
You could walk away from
it, would not affect it.

00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:03.410 align:middle line:90%
Nothing can affect it.

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:07.370 align:middle line:84%
Not even the middle of
a sun can affect it.

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:09.370 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the basic
creation pattern and what

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:10.910 align:middle line:90%
created all this stuff.

00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:12.860 align:middle line:84%
It's what we created
the whole thing with.

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:16.970 align:middle line:84%
It's what we stepped in with,
and it's the doorway out.

00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:19.230 align:middle line:84%
No one's going to
create an experiment

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:23.830 align:middle line:84%
and get into it if there
isn't some way out.

00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:24.810 align:middle line:90%
And that's the way out.

00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And so this magnetic field
kept their memories intact

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.260 align:middle line:84%
while everybody
else's was erased,

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:34.230 align:middle line:84%
except for one group of
people, which I still do not

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:35.980 align:middle line:90%
understand how they did it.

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:38.800 align:middle line:84%
They had to have some of the
ancient memory of the Merkaba.

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.200 align:middle line:90%
And that's the Mayans.

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.630 align:middle line:90%
The Mayans came from Atlantis.

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:44.584 align:middle line:84%
There's a document called
the Troano Document.

00:36:44.584 --> 00:36:46.000 align:middle line:84%
Let me see if I've
still got that.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.754 align:middle line:90%


00:36:48.754 --> 00:36:50.420 align:middle line:84%
No, I didn't bring
it with me this time.

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:54.270 align:middle line:10%
There's the Troano
Document, which

00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:58.280 align:middle line:10%
was translated by le Plongeon,
which is sitting in the British

00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:59.080 align:middle line:10%
Museum right now.

00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:02.190 align:middle line:10%
It's Troano, T-R-O-A-N-O.

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And it is a series of stones
on this wall describing

00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:09.700 align:middle line:90%
the sinking of Atlantis.

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And it describes how Atlantis
upheaveled, went up and down,

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:18.540 align:middle line:84%
and all these things
took place and how

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:22.350 align:middle line:84%
there were 10 countries
in Atlantis corresponding

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:25.330 align:middle line:84%
to the 10 points and that
64 million people were

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:27.246 align:middle line:90%
killed in one night.

00:37:27.246 --> 00:37:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And it shows on there the
Mayans escaping in these boats

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:36.430 align:middle line:84%
while there's modern-looking
cities with pyramids

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:38.960 align:middle line:84%
and volcanoes going
off everywhere.

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And then there was
three and a half stones

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:45.120 align:middle line:84%
that were painted
black, which are

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:48.660 align:middle line:84%
the three and a half
days that happens

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:51.620 align:middle line:90%
when the field collapses.

00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And the pole shift
is 20 hours, OK?

00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:58.580 align:middle line:84%
But the field is gone for about
anywhere from two and a half

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:01.290 align:middle line:90%
to about four and a quarter.

00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And it usually is three to
three and a half days long.

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Those are the minimum
and maximum amounts

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:07.900 align:middle line:90%
that anybody's ever seen it.

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:09.800 align:middle line:84%
But it's usually about three
or three and a half days long.

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And the last time was probably
three and a half days long.

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:14.217 align:middle line:84%
Because each one
of these was a day.

00:38:14.217 --> 00:38:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And they just painted them
black, and then the third one

00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:19.720 align:middle line:84%
they painted half black,
and they came back again.

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And so this description
was very pretty good.

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:28.790 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, and they did
that 3,500 years ago.

00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:30.410 align:middle line:90%
They wrote that.

00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:33.440 align:middle line:84%
So somehow, they
were able to keep

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:34.730 align:middle line:90%
their memory of all of this.

00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how they did it
unless there was somebody there

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:41.040 align:middle line:90%
that had this awareness.

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:46.880 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so what happened
was a lot of these people

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:49.160 align:middle line:84%
went all over what's now
Europe, the survivors

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:54.300 align:middle line:84%
of this everywhere else,
and basically started over.

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:58.540 align:middle line:84%
There's very little
left from that.

00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:02.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, this was the
time that the Bible

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:06.741 align:middle line:84%
refers to as Noah's Ark
and the Great Flood.

00:39:06.741 --> 00:39:10.670 align:middle line:90%


00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:14.590 align:middle line:84%
Whether or not it's
true that there was only

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:18.210 align:middle line:84%
Noah and no one else
survived out of this,

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:21.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how that's really
possible, because there's

00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:29.490 align:middle line:84%
over 118 stories around
the world of the deluge

00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:33.900 align:middle line:90%
from around the entire globe.

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Who were there writing
these 118 stories?

00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:41.290 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:44.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
it's really true.

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:47.170 align:middle line:84%
I can't say that
for sure or not.

00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:49.374 align:middle line:84%
Somebody had to
write those stories.

00:39:49.374 --> 00:39:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And if it was
somebody afterwards,

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:55.310 align:middle line:84%
they couldn't be talking about
what happened, because they

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:57.140 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't have been there.

00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And if it all started
out with just six people

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:01.580 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it was, it
would have taken a long time

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:04.130 align:middle line:90%
to repopulate the Earth.

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:04.930 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:08.940 align:middle line:90%


00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:09.740 align:middle line:90%
>>This is true.

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Also, well, that's
another story, though,

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:16.850 align:middle line:84%
how he handed that to--
that's the Peruvian story

00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:19.797 align:middle line:90%
of after the deluge.

00:40:19.797 --> 00:40:21.380 align:middle line:84%
According to the
Peruvian story, Thoth

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:24.280 align:middle line:84%
came down and gave
the golden rod

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:28.880 align:middle line:84%
to Manco, who became the
first king of the Inca Empire.

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:33.360 align:middle line:84%
He was defined the
lost city of Cusco.

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:34.590 align:middle line:90%
And began the empire.

00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And that happened right after
the first stone emerged out

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:41.080 align:middle line:90%
of the Great Flood.

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know, but
according to Thoth,

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:49.870 align:middle line:84%
that's not exactly
accurate, that there

00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:55.640 align:middle line:84%
were survivors around the
world, and quite a few of them.

00:40:55.640 --> 00:41:00.156 align:middle line:84%
But they had not much
going on up there.

00:41:00.156 --> 00:41:01.527 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:01.527 --> 00:41:03.110 align:middle line:84%
Though they had a
real high-tech body.

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:04.265 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:04.265 --> 00:41:05.677 align:middle line:90%
They had all the equipment.

00:41:05.677 --> 00:41:07.135 align:middle line:84%
They just didn't
have the software.

00:41:07.135 --> 00:41:11.020 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:14.330 align:middle line:84%
They had the good
computer, though.

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:17.730 align:middle line:90%
And so-- let's see.

00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:19.770 align:middle line:90%
Where were we on this?

00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:21.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to have to end this.

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:22.997 align:middle line:90%
We are really behind.

00:41:22.997 --> 00:41:24.830 align:middle line:84%
You guys haven't asked
any questions at all,

00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:25.620 align:middle line:90%
and we're still behind.

00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:27.036 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand
how this works.

00:41:27.036 --> 00:41:33.200 align:middle line:90%


00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:41.350 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, after this all
happened-- the deluge,

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:45.400 align:middle line:84%
by the way, was the poles that
where Hawaii, et cetera were.

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.140 align:middle line:90%
They melted completely.

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:49.150 align:middle line:84%
That was part of
what was going on.

00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:52.230 align:middle line:84%
But evidently, there was
another thing going on also,

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:55.010 align:middle line:84%
which science is
now coming up with.

00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:56.820 align:middle line:84%
In the Bible, it talks
about the springs

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:59.580 align:middle line:84%
that began to come
forth and all of this.

00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:01.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, has anybody
seen the evidence now

00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:06.360 align:middle line:84%
that they're bringing
forth, what science is--?

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:11.026 align:middle line:84%
They think that there was a huge
amount of water in the Earth,

00:42:11.026 --> 00:42:15.430 align:middle line:84%
like a ring around there, and
that it began to come forth,

00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:17.970 align:middle line:90%
just like huge amounts.

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:20.690 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of physical
evidence of this,

00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:24.087 align:middle line:84%
that the Earth was
literally just deluged.

00:42:24.087 --> 00:42:25.920 align:middle line:84%
On top of this, not
only did the poles melt,

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:29.010 align:middle line:84%
which would have risen
them 200 or 300 feet,

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:31.320 align:middle line:84%
but there was much
more water coming out

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:35.170 align:middle line:84%
of the center of the
Earth in all of this.

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, the Great
Pyramids, by the way,

00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:45.820 align:middle line:84%
were covered with water
for a long period of time

00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:47.340 align:middle line:90%
to about the 2/3 level.

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:50.040 align:middle line:90%


00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:53.870 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the proofs
that the Great Pyramid was not

00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:57.519 align:middle line:84%
created in the Fourth
Dynasty, as they say.

00:42:57.519 --> 00:42:59.060 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
hear this, though.

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:00.840 align:middle line:90%
But the evidence is there.

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:03.030 align:middle line:84%
Because even though
the stones were

00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:08.290 align:middle line:84%
moved by the Muslims a
few hundred years ago,

00:43:08.290 --> 00:43:12.410 align:middle line:84%
the impact of this
thing sitting in water

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:16.360 align:middle line:84%
so long ripped all the way
through, and the water mark

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:19.134 align:middle line:90%
is still there at the 2/3 level.

00:43:19.134 --> 00:43:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And when they entered
into the Great Pyramid--

00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:22.735 align:middle line:90%
this was Al-- what's his name?

00:43:22.735 --> 00:43:25.450 align:middle line:90%


00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:26.250 align:middle line:90%
He was Muslim.

00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:26.780 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember.

00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:28.820 align:middle line:84%
When they broke into it,
they basically broke in.

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:29.330 align:middle line:90%
There was a door there.

00:43:29.330 --> 00:43:30.360 align:middle line:84%
They could have just
pushed a button,

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:31.526 align:middle line:90%
and it would have opened up.

00:43:31.526 --> 00:43:34.200 align:middle line:84%
But they dug their way in and
came back out and then found

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:35.620 align:middle line:90%
the door.

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:39.264 align:middle line:90%
And you don't push a button.

00:43:39.264 --> 00:43:41.785 align:middle line:84%
You just touch it just
right and the whole door

00:43:41.785 --> 00:43:43.270 align:middle line:90%
would swivel back.

00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And when they entered
into the Great Pyramid,

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:49.520 align:middle line:84%
the entire pyramid,
all the King's

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:52.900 align:middle line:84%
Chamber, the Great Hallway,
all the rooms all the way down,

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:58.560 align:middle line:84%
everything was covered with
about 1/2 inch of sea salt.

00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And with that and
the water marks

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:04.270 align:middle line:84%
meant that this was built
before the Great Deluge.

00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:06.100 align:middle line:84%
Because there's never
been any time that we

00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:12.400 align:middle line:84%
know of in the last 4,000 years
when the Earth has been covered

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:14.910 align:middle line:84%
with water, especially
that area, which

00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:17.295 align:middle line:84%
is the center of the
planet, the center of all

00:44:17.295 --> 00:44:19.280 align:middle line:84%
land mass right in
there where that sits.

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:22.260 align:middle line:90%


00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:23.780 align:middle line:84%
That's the exact
center, by the way.

00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:25.030 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if you know that.

00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:27.990 align:middle line:84%
It's the precise center of all
the land masses of the Earth,

00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:30.570 align:middle line:90%
is where the Great Pyramid sits.

00:44:30.570 --> 00:44:36.610 align:middle line:84%
The ship was then flown
to the Island of the Sun,

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:42.910 align:middle line:84%
where-- well, first of all,
Ra got out here by an opening

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:46.270 align:middle line:84%
through the top into a room
that sat at that exact level

00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:51.980 align:middle line:84%
where the water level was at the
2/3 level, which that room has

00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:53.600 align:middle line:90%
not been found yet.

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:55.790 align:middle line:90%
But Thoth says it will be.

00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And when they do, they will
find that it's made out

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:01.660 align:middle line:84%
of red, black, and
white stones and that it

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:04.510 align:middle line:84%
was where the ceremony that--
Ra came out of there with about

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:06.740 align:middle line:84%
1/3 of the people,
held a ceremony,

00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:08.840 align:middle line:84%
and left from there to
the underground city.

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:11.700 align:middle line:90%


00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:14.585 align:middle line:84%
And it was Ra and
approximately 1/3

00:45:14.585 --> 00:45:16.460 align:middle line:84%
of the ascended masters
of the Naacal mystery

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:19.530 align:middle line:90%
school that began Egypt.

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:24.220 align:middle line:10%
The ship was then flown
to Peru, specifically

00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:27.580 align:middle line:10%
to the Island of the Sun on
Lake Titicaca in Bolivia.

00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:31.600 align:middle line:10%
And Thoth got out
there, and that's

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:36.650 align:middle line:10%
where he handed
the rod to Manco,

00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:39.200 align:middle line:10%
who became the first
king of the Inca Empire.

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:42.680 align:middle line:90%
And Thoth stayed there in Peru.

00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:43.780 align:middle line:90%
It became the love.

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:45.850 align:middle line:90%
He loved it there.

00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:48.020 align:middle line:84%
When I went to Peru, you
could tell by the way

00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:49.230 align:middle line:90%
he was, oh, and over here.

00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:50.860 align:middle line:84%
He was telling me
all these places.

00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:52.485 align:middle line:84%
In Egypt, he wouldn't
talk much at all.

00:45:52.485 --> 00:45:53.860 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't like Egypt.

00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:55.920 align:middle line:90%
But he liked Peru at lot.

00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:56.930 align:middle line:90%
He had a baby in Peru.

00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:58.055 align:middle line:90%
I think what's what did it.

00:45:58.055 --> 00:45:59.922 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:59.922 --> 00:46:01.140 align:middle line:90%
It softens you up.

00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:02.910 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:10.580 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, and then the ship
was flown to the Himalaya

00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:16.510 align:middle line:84%
Mountains, where Aragot got off,
along with about another 1/3

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:17.500 align:middle line:90%
of the people.

00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And seven of them flew the
ship back to the Sphinx,

00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:22.900 align:middle line:84%
lowered it down in that
room, where it remained there

00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:25.960 align:middle line:84%
until just a couple years
ago or a few years ago,

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:28.440 align:middle line:84%
where it was brought
back up into the air

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:34.560 align:middle line:84%
by a 23-year-old Peruvian
woman, who is now controlling

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:38.550 align:middle line:84%
the airways. [LAUGHING] Right
now it's really up to her

00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:41.770 align:middle line:84%
what happens on a lot
of levels of life.

00:46:41.770 --> 00:46:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to leave all
of this, concepts of things,

00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:52.400 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
head into Egypt.

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:54.881 align:middle line:84%
Though, however,
before we do, I'm

00:46:54.881 --> 00:46:56.630 align:middle line:84%
going to allow questions
to be asked here.

00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Because we've gone a
long time without any.

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And we've only got
about 20 more minutes,

00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:06.323 align:middle line:90%
and it's 9 o'clock already.

00:47:06.323 --> 00:47:11.120 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHING] We're going to have
to work real hard tomorrow.

00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:15.650 align:middle line:90%


00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Egypt is the area that
we're going to focus on.

00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Those three areas,
Egypt and Peru,

00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:27.760 align:middle line:84%
which includes the Yucatan all
the way down to Peru, and Tibet

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:30.270 align:middle line:84%
and that area up in
there, those were

00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:33.470 align:middle line:84%
chosen because of the
nature of the Earth's

00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:37.200 align:middle line:90%
geometrical and geomancy fields.

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:41.380 align:middle line:10%
Egypt became the male aspect of
the Christ consciousness grid.

00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:44.970 align:middle line:10%
The Yucatan/Peru became the
female aspect of the grid.

00:47:44.970 --> 00:47:47.560 align:middle line:10%
And the Tibet became the
child, or the neutral energy,

00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:48.940 align:middle line:10%
of the grid.

00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:52.200 align:middle line:10%
And there are pyramids in
all three of those areas.

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:53.384 align:middle line:10%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:53.384 --> 00:47:54.184 align:middle line:10%
>>Huh?

00:47:54.184 --> 00:47:57.160 align:middle line:10%
>>That last sentence,
please repeat it.

00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:00.270 align:middle line:10%
>>Tibet became the
neutral, or child, energy.

00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:05.020 align:middle line:10%
There's the mommy, daddy,
and baby energy of the field.

00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:08.290 align:middle line:10%
Everything is mommy, daddy,
and baby in one way or another.

00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:09.090 align:middle line:10%
And--

00:48:09.090 --> 00:48:10.150 align:middle line:10%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:10.950 align:middle line:10%
>>Hm?

00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:12.920 align:middle line:90%
>>The female is who?

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.605 align:middle line:84%
>>The female is
the Mayan/Peruvian.

00:48:14.605 --> 00:48:17.836 align:middle line:90%


00:48:17.836 --> 00:48:20.150 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm not going to talk
about those other two places

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.950 align:middle line:90%
very much.

00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:25.240 align:middle line:90%


00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:26.990 align:middle line:84%
My experiences
there and everything

00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:31.220 align:middle line:90%
were really powerful for me.

00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And I learned a lot being
in some of those places.

00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:41.150 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to
focus mostly on Egypt,

00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:43.720 align:middle line:84%
mostly because the
vast majority of people

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:52.150 align:middle line:84%
that come to this workshop have
Egyptian-based backgrounds,

00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:55.036 align:middle line:90%
though not always.

00:48:55.036 --> 00:48:56.110 align:middle line:90%
It depends.

00:48:56.110 --> 00:48:59.200 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I don't, but I
think this one is for sure.

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go to Egypt
also because that happened

00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:09.800 align:middle line:84%
to be the only place or area
where survivors from Atlantis

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:12.690 align:middle line:84%
and the Naacal mystery
school were co-located

00:49:12.690 --> 00:49:14.100 align:middle line:90%
at the same place.

00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Because in the other
ones, they were not

00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:21.557 align:middle line:84%
Atlanean people who survived
that, the different races.

00:49:21.557 --> 00:49:27.460 align:middle line:84%
It was Incas and other races
besides the Atlanteans.

00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:30.857 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to look at the
Sumerian and Egyptian cultures

00:49:30.857 --> 00:49:32.940 align:middle line:84%
as they unfolded and what
happened in all of that.

00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:36.580 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're going to start
him when we start in tomorrow.

00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have too much
more of that to go into.

00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And we'll eventually focus
in on one very specific area

00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:45.900 align:middle line:90%
of Egypt.

00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:50.310 align:middle line:84%
If you talk to most Christians
who are Catholic right now,

00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:53.940 align:middle line:84%
they will tend to look
at Egypt as being a cult

00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:59.940 align:middle line:84%
and not a very healthy place
to get information from.

00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:02.670 align:middle line:90%
And I agree with them.

00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:08.540 align:middle line:84%
There's only one tiny, little
speck of light that came out

00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:12.080 align:middle line:84%
of Egypt, and that
was for 17 1/2 years.

00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:14.065 align:middle line:84%
It came out of one
little dynasty.

00:50:14.065 --> 00:50:20.240 align:middle line:90%


00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:22.840 align:middle line:84%
But it was a real
blast of light.

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And we need to look at
what happened there.

00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:27.540 align:middle line:84%
That's when they said that
there was only one God.

00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And what happened in that
school was real important.

00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:33.980 align:middle line:84%
In fact, what happened
in that school,

00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:37.230 align:middle line:84%
according to Thoth
and his information,

00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:41.091 align:middle line:90%
created the Christian religion.

00:50:41.091 --> 00:50:42.590 align:middle line:84%
There was that one
particular school

00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:45.910 align:middle line:84%
that was the founder
behind all of that.

00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And the Coptics that came out
of that and the Essenes that

00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:54.030 align:middle line:84%
also were affected and came
out of that, all that was all

00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:56.420 align:middle line:90%
planned from a long time ago.

00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:59.080 align:middle line:84%
But again, if you are Christian,
you can just listen to this,

00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:01.288 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have to accept
it if you don't want to.

00:51:01.288 --> 00:51:04.610 align:middle line:84%
But this is what
Thoth has told me.

00:51:04.610 --> 00:51:07.750 align:middle line:90%


00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the area we're
going to head into tomorrow.

00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:13.000 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get into what
is called the Egyptian mystery

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.760 align:middle line:90%
school of Akhenaten.

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:17.290 align:middle line:84%
We will start in that
pretty early tomorrow.

00:51:17.290 --> 00:51:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And that will lead into
the sacred geometry.

00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And we'll begin to get out
of this kind of talking

00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:29.280 align:middle line:84%
about history and going into
very, very specific aspects

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:30.830 align:middle line:90%
of human nature and the mind.

00:51:30.830 --> 00:51:33.210 align:middle line:84%
>>I have a hard
time understanding

00:51:33.210 --> 00:51:38.560 align:middle line:84%
how these ascended master
beings like Thoth and Ra

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:43.180 align:middle line:84%
and Akhenaten can create
miraculous events on the Earth

00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:48.210 align:middle line:84%
like creating the pyramids
and knowing all about how

00:51:48.210 --> 00:51:50.610 align:middle line:84%
to put thought in
one area and create

00:51:50.610 --> 00:51:52.800 align:middle line:84%
these deep holes in the
ground, and yet they

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:55.720 align:middle line:84%
have to create these
vehicles to travel in.

00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:59.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm confused as
to what-- there's

00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:00.530 align:middle line:90%
sort of two parts to it.

00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:04.520 align:middle line:84%
One is why would they need
the vehicle, is one part.

00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And the second
part of my question

00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:12.540 align:middle line:84%
is, it seems as if this is,
in a sense in a certain way,

00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:16.560 align:middle line:84%
interfering with the normal
process of human evolution.

00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not quite sure where
this non-interference and help

00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:21.790 align:middle line:90%
comes in.

00:52:21.790 --> 00:52:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>>OK the interference,
first of all,

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:28.490 align:middle line:90%
was there from the beginning.

00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:31.390 align:middle line:84%
It was there from the moment
that the Martians stepped in.

00:52:31.390 --> 00:52:34.250 align:middle line:84%
It was there from the moment
that the Lucifer rebellion

00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:35.790 align:middle line:90%
started on.

00:52:35.790 --> 00:52:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And there's been so much
interference in this place,

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:41.530 align:middle line:84%
it's just ridiculous
what's going on.

00:52:41.530 --> 00:52:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And the only reason--
this interference here

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:48.570 align:middle line:90%
was ordained from higher levels.

00:52:48.570 --> 00:52:51.780 align:middle line:84%
Permission was granted
to do what was done here.

00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:55.390 align:middle line:84%
They did not do this
just on their own.

00:52:55.390 --> 00:52:58.810 align:middle line:84%
They asked permission
and said, what do we do?

00:52:58.810 --> 00:53:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
here's what you do.

00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:03.060 align:middle line:84%
So all of this was
totally ordained

00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:07.800 align:middle line:84%
from the highest levels of
consciousness in this galaxy.

00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of
using the vehicle,

00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:14.661 align:middle line:84%
the vehicle that was
chosen, this particular one,

00:53:14.661 --> 00:53:17.790 align:middle line:84%
they did not need vehicles
to personally travel

00:53:17.790 --> 00:53:20.550 align:middle line:90%
from one place to another.

00:53:20.550 --> 00:53:23.750 align:middle line:84%
That you can read about in
the Emerald Tablets, where

00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:26.290 align:middle line:84%
he would go into deep
space purely on his own

00:53:26.290 --> 00:53:28.270 align:middle line:84%
without any kind of
vehicle for anything.

00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:31.600 align:middle line:84%
But this was a traditional,
you might say, vehicle.

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:34.890 align:middle line:84%
It was considered a war
ship, written as a war ship,

00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:36.980 align:middle line:90%
in the Emerald Tablets.

00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when I
read that as a war ship,

00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:42.480 align:middle line:84%
it repelled me,
because I was thinking

00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:43.960 align:middle line:90%
in terms of light and stuff.

00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And I go, what's
this war ship stuff?

00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And that was before I found
out about the Greys or any

00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:51.340 align:middle line:90%
of that stuff.

00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:53.900 align:middle line:84%
But in conjunction of the
Greys and the various races

00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:56.191 align:middle line:84%
that are associated with it
are here and all that kinds

00:53:56.191 --> 00:53:58.770 align:middle line:84%
of stuff that they're
doing, which happens

00:53:58.770 --> 00:54:01.870 align:middle line:84%
to be timed with this very
event that's going on right now,

00:54:01.870 --> 00:54:08.970 align:middle line:84%
I can understand why they would
need a war ship to-- it says

00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:12.420 align:middle line:84%
right in there that every single
time that we come to these two

00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:16.790 align:middle line:84%
apexes on the precession, that
the dark side of our nature,

00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:19.520 align:middle line:84%
if you want to see
it as unity, always

00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:21.890 align:middle line:90%
tries to take over the Earth.

00:54:21.890 --> 00:54:24.030 align:middle line:84%
It has for hundreds
of millions of years,

00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:25.580 align:middle line:90%
and it has always failed.

00:54:25.580 --> 00:54:26.610 align:middle line:90%
But it always tries.

00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:28.150 align:middle line:90%
That's part of its job.

00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And this ship is
tuned to the Earth.

00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:39.440 align:middle line:84%
It's a ship that takes an
absolutely pure person that

00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:42.150 align:middle line:84%
has reached a particular
level at least of Christ

00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:45.020 align:middle line:84%
consciousness to
operate it, because it's

00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:49.900 align:middle line:84%
run on not just
understanding, but it's

00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:52.480 align:middle line:84%
run on universal,
unconditional love.

00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:55.250 align:middle line:84%
It's love that
operates that ship.

00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And so what a person can operate
it and move it in the air,

00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:00.640 align:middle line:84%
sure, you could sit
there and do that.

00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:07.150 align:middle line:84%
But to get the ship out, it's
been going on for so long.

00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:10.897 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know why you
have to do that for sure.

00:55:10.897 --> 00:55:12.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean I can conceive
of what you're saying,

00:55:12.730 --> 00:55:14.420 align:middle line:90%
why they don't have to do that.

00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:15.630 align:middle line:90%
But they do.

00:55:15.630 --> 00:55:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And even in 1992, we're still
using things, still out there.

00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:23.340 align:middle line:84%
This is what's forced all
the Greys to leave from here.

00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:26.360 align:middle line:90%
And it's an amplifier.

00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:31.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it only
requires one person.

00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:35.960 align:middle line:84%
And one person can turn
water into wine real easy.

00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:39.466 align:middle line:84%
One person can even
move a mountain.

00:55:39.466 --> 00:55:41.090 align:middle line:84%
Might be a little
harder for one person

00:55:41.090 --> 00:55:47.290 align:middle line:84%
to completely change the
entire nature of a planet,

00:55:47.290 --> 00:55:49.330 align:middle line:84%
but with that ship,
one person can

00:55:49.330 --> 00:55:53.420 align:middle line:84%
do that, one little female,
little, frail, 23-year-old

00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:56.080 align:middle line:90%
woman, was able to do that.

00:55:56.080 --> 00:56:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And so maybe at
some point, or maybe

00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:02.480 align:middle line:84%
at certain points
in our evolution,

00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:03.896 align:middle line:90%
we don't need to use that thing.

00:56:03.896 --> 00:56:05.520 align:middle line:84%
But I do understand
what you're saying,

00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:07.103 align:middle line:84%
because I went through
the same stuff,

00:56:07.103 --> 00:56:08.630 align:middle line:90%
like, what's this all about?

00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:09.430 align:middle line:90%
It's so weird.

00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:12.860 align:middle line:90%


00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:14.470 align:middle line:90%
But I kind of get it now.

00:56:14.470 --> 00:56:15.620 align:middle line:90%
It took me a long time.

00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:18.266 align:middle line:90%
And I kind of see why it's used.

00:56:18.266 --> 00:56:24.040 align:middle line:90%


00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:35.240 align:middle line:84%
But Thoth and the ascended
masters do not use spaceships.

00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:41.000 align:middle line:84%
This is the only vehicle
that is in their use,

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.180 align:middle line:90%
and it is not a normal vehicle.

00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:49.140 align:middle line:84%
It has no motors of
any sort whatsoever.

00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:54.640 align:middle line:84%
It's simply a shape that is
only three to five atoms thick.

00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:57.600 align:middle line:84%
The sides are three atoms
thick, and the top and bottom

00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:00.600 align:middle line:84%
are five atoms thick
in places, some places

00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:02.240 align:middle line:90%
only three atoms thick.

00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's translucent
and transparent,

00:57:06.330 --> 00:57:09.205 align:middle line:84%
and it is designed to
amplify and connect

00:57:09.205 --> 00:57:10.340 align:middle line:90%
in with your own Merkaba.

00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:13.880 align:middle line:84%
So you have to create a
living Merkaba field even

00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:15.560 align:middle line:90%
to get into it and make it work.

00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:19.791 align:middle line:90%


00:57:19.791 --> 00:57:22.040 align:middle line:84%
A person connected directly
with the Lucifer rebellion

00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:24.720 align:middle line:84%
could not run that no
matter what they did,

00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:26.390 align:middle line:90%
no matter how much they knew.

00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:29.140 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't make
it move or function.

00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:31.780 align:middle line:84%
It requires someone
at least on the level

00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:36.800 align:middle line:84%
of Christ consciousness to
ever even begin to get this up.

00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:39.225 align:middle line:84%
But I still don't-- even I'm
with you at a lot of levels--

00:57:39.225 --> 00:57:40.558 align:middle line:90%
I still don't really understand.

00:57:40.558 --> 00:57:43.470 align:middle line:90%


00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:47.200 align:middle line:84%
From what I now know, it
would only require two people

00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:49.770 align:middle line:84%
to come together to
create a living Merkaba

00:57:49.770 --> 00:57:51.400 align:middle line:90%
field much stronger than this.

00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:54.240 align:middle line:90%


00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:59.220 align:middle line:84%
But one person, I don't know if
that's possible without that.

00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:02.550 align:middle line:90%
OK, next one.

00:58:02.550 --> 00:58:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, if I could back
up just a little bit.

00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:07.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm not real clear
about-- you were

00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:13.180 align:middle line:84%
talking about how the Christ
consciousness was artificially

00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:16.044 align:middle line:84%
started on the planet or
seeded into the planet.

00:58:16.044 --> 00:58:16.947 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:58:16.947 --> 00:58:17.780 align:middle line:90%
>>How they did that?

00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:18.989 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, how did they do that?

00:58:18.989 --> 00:58:19.788 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:58:19.788 --> 00:58:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>>They did it first by making
that hole in the ground.

00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And that hole was tuned
right over the axis

00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:28.590 align:middle line:84%
of what would be the Christ
consciousness someday.

00:58:28.590 --> 00:58:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And then they connected
energetically to the spiral

00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:34.460 align:middle line:84%
by putting the Great
Pyramid right on it.

00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And then they started
doing geomancy

00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:38.380 align:middle line:84%
all over the Earth with
these pyramids and structures

00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:43.440 align:middle line:84%
all over the entire planet,
which shapes spacetime

00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:46.830 align:middle line:84%
around the Earth
and forms-- they're

00:58:46.830 --> 00:58:51.710 align:middle line:84%
aiming for a stellated
dodecahedron around the planet.

00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:53.200 align:middle line:90%
And we know this is there now.

00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:55.031 align:middle line:84%
Our governments
know this is there.

00:58:55.031 --> 00:58:57.280 align:middle line:84%
Our governments knew-- there's
three of these up there

00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:59.000 align:middle line:90%
that are human.

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.700 align:middle line:84%
Our governments
became aware even

00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:06.020 align:middle line:84%
in the late '40s, early
'50s of the first grid that

00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:08.440 align:middle line:84%
was up there, which is our
level of consciousness.

00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And then recently
they've become aware

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.280 align:middle line:90%
of the dodecahedronal field.

00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And that shaping is
something you can sense.

00:59:16.050 --> 00:59:18.030 align:middle line:90%
It's a real thing.

00:59:18.030 --> 00:59:21.510 align:middle line:84%
But without the
creation of that grid,

00:59:21.510 --> 00:59:23.290 align:middle line:84%
without the building
of these pyramids

00:59:23.290 --> 00:59:25.960 align:middle line:84%
and all this stuff that's been
going on all over the Earth,

00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:28.720 align:middle line:90%
the grid wouldn't happen.

00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:32.260 align:middle line:84%
It would only happen
naturally over if you just

00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:35.070 align:middle line:84%
let nature take its course
over a long, long time.

00:59:35.070 --> 00:59:36.570 align:middle line:84%
But if they did
that, we would never

00:59:36.570 --> 00:59:39.080 align:middle line:84%
make it because
of the distortion

00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:43.730 align:middle line:84%
that this field had done within
us and all that had happened.

00:59:43.730 --> 00:59:45.370 align:middle line:84%
We would have probably
never made it.

00:59:45.370 --> 00:59:48.200 align:middle line:84%
So they were trying to
look for a way to heal us

00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:52.750 align:middle line:84%
and to put us back to where
we were and get everybody

00:59:52.750 --> 00:59:57.020 align:middle line:84%
to be friends again
and to take off again

00:59:57.020 --> 00:59:59.530 align:middle line:90%
on the evolutionary pattern.

00:59:59.530 --> 01:00:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And it was their belief
that maybe-- they didn't

01:00:02.310 --> 01:00:04.260 align:middle line:90%
know if it would work or not.

01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:07.670 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it would work if
they could create a grid,

01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:09.760 align:middle line:84%
and they can create a
scenario where we all

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:11.990 align:middle line:90%
came back into this grid again.

01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:14.760 align:middle line:84%
Then we could get
back into this place

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:16.900 align:middle line:84%
where we were before
all of this took place.

01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:20.970 align:middle line:90%


01:00:20.970 --> 01:00:23.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
the percentage is.

01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:27.390 align:middle line:84%
There are times when
it doesn't work.

01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:29.570 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't always work.

01:00:29.570 --> 01:00:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
generally, that planet

01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:35.670 align:middle line:90%
just dies.

01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:39.680 align:middle line:84%
In our case, when it got
right up to the very end,

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:42.622 align:middle line:84%
it looked like it was
not going to work.

01:00:42.622 --> 01:00:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'll have to tell you
what they then further did,

01:00:44.830 --> 01:00:47.322 align:middle line:84%
something further on top
of all of that, which

01:00:47.322 --> 01:00:49.780 align:middle line:84%
is what's caused this incredible
thing that's now occurring

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:53.080 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, which is causing
the entire universe to begin

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:57.700 align:middle line:84%
to focus on Earth, which is also
something that's never happened

01:00:57.700 --> 01:01:00.510 align:middle line:90%
before.

01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:04.650 align:middle line:84%
All life has never were
focused on single point,

01:01:04.650 --> 01:01:08.753 align:middle line:84%
but we're creating something
here right now that is

01:01:08.753 --> 01:01:11.336 align:middle line:84%
[? attracting ?] [? attention ?]
from every level of existence

01:01:11.336 --> 01:01:12.136 align:middle line:90%
there is.

01:01:12.136 --> 01:01:14.625 align:middle line:90%


01:01:14.625 --> 01:01:15.425 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:01:15.425 --> 01:01:16.660 align:middle line:90%
Did I help at all on that?

01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, it did.

01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:17.800 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:19.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:22.966 align:middle line:84%
Wait, you've got to have the
little magic stick to talk.

01:01:22.966 --> 01:01:23.766 align:middle line:90%
>>I got it.

01:01:23.766 --> 01:01:24.566 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

01:01:24.566 --> 01:01:27.410 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:29.630 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>>I've heard channeled
by the ascended masters

01:01:31.850 --> 01:01:32.650 align:middle line:90%
a number of times.

01:01:32.650 --> 01:01:34.230 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO DROPS]

01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:37.406 align:middle line:84%
>>You've got to have
that little stick.

01:01:37.406 --> 01:01:39.474 align:middle line:90%
>>A couple part question here.

01:01:39.474 --> 01:01:40.765 align:middle line:90%
>>She's got the next one after.

01:01:40.765 --> 01:01:41.920 align:middle line:90%
>>She does.

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:42.720 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>>When Atlantis sank,
did the Hebrews migrate?

01:01:46.830 --> 01:01:48.520 align:middle line:90%
That's one part of it.

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:51.110 align:middle line:84%
Were the Martians
gone in Atlantis?

01:01:51.110 --> 01:01:52.860 align:middle line:90%
Were they humanoid?

01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:53.660 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:55.360 align:middle line:84%
>>The Martians were
extremely humanoid,

01:01:55.360 --> 01:02:05.590 align:middle line:84%
only they had a slightly bigger
skull, but very, very humanoid.

01:02:05.590 --> 01:02:10.120 align:middle line:84%
The humanoid form is used a
lot throughout time and space.

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:11.954 align:middle line:84%
>>Were they wiped out
in Atlantis when it--?

01:02:11.954 --> 01:02:12.753 align:middle line:90%
>>Who?

01:02:12.753 --> 01:02:13.750 align:middle line:90%
>>The Martians.

01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:15.380 align:middle line:90%
>>No, no way.

01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:16.880 align:middle line:84%
They're running the
world right now.

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>>That's what I'm wondering.

01:02:18.350 --> 01:02:20.930 align:middle line:84%
>>The secret government is
almost totally run by Martians.

01:02:20.930 --> 01:02:22.513 align:middle line:84%
>>I was wondering
if they're connected

01:02:22.513 --> 01:02:25.050 align:middle line:84%
with the Greys from
that time also.

01:02:25.050 --> 01:02:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, the Martians
are really very ancient,

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:32.320 align:middle line:84%
ancient race, older
than the Greys, really.

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:35.630 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this is the reason--
a lot of people have wondered.

01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:38.770 align:middle line:84%
The Greys who have been
here-- for some of you who

01:02:38.770 --> 01:02:41.010 align:middle line:84%
don't know who the
Greys are, they're

01:02:41.010 --> 01:02:43.570 align:middle line:84%
a race of beings that are
really all over the place.

01:02:43.570 --> 01:02:47.590 align:middle line:84%
They've got worlds
all over the place.

01:02:47.590 --> 01:02:50.510 align:middle line:84%
One of their primary places
were where most of the Greys

01:02:50.510 --> 01:02:56.340 align:middle line:84%
that come here are, are
centered around the little star

01:02:56.340 --> 01:03:00.350 align:middle line:84%
the belt of Orion, which
is the Crab Nebula, which

01:03:00.350 --> 01:03:01.560 align:middle line:90%
is an exploding nebula.

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And the shock waves from
that as they expand out

01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:07.150 align:middle line:84%
are wiping out their worlds,
one right after another.

01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And so they're looking
for new places to be.

01:03:11.490 --> 01:03:13.629 align:middle line:84%
However, that's not
their real problem.

01:03:13.629 --> 01:03:15.420 align:middle line:84%
They're concerned with
problems much deeper

01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:20.120 align:middle line:84%
than just some of their
planets being wiped out, much,

01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:22.470 align:middle line:90%
much deeper.

01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:26.690 align:middle line:84%
And the Greys are a race
who are little, tiny people

01:03:26.690 --> 01:03:30.250 align:middle line:84%
with these big heads and these
huge eyes, little tiny mouth.

01:03:30.250 --> 01:03:31.600 align:middle line:90%
And they have kind of grey skin.

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:32.900 align:middle line:90%
That's why they're called Grey.

01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And they believed in what
Lucifer said a long time ago,

01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:40.755 align:middle line:84%
and they followed the
Lucifer rebellion.

01:03:40.755 --> 01:03:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And basically, they
severed their connections

01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:44.590 align:middle line:84%
from God, the love
connection, which

01:03:44.590 --> 01:03:50.210 align:middle line:84%
was necessary, to create
the external Merkaba, which

01:03:50.210 --> 01:03:51.580 align:middle line:90%
is the UFO.

01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And they got in these ships
and began to live separately

01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:01.140 align:middle line:84%
from the rest of the universe,
along with lots and lots

01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:03.340 align:middle line:84%
and lots and lots and lots
and lots of other races

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:04.640 align:middle line:90%
that did this.

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And because their emotional
bond and love was gone,

01:04:14.130 --> 01:04:17.730 align:middle line:84%
they slowly quit being
involved with sexual energy

01:04:17.730 --> 01:04:21.380 align:middle line:84%
and began to use you might
say test tube babies.

01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:23.290 align:middle line:90%
Those got very sophisticated.

01:04:23.290 --> 01:04:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And they quit be
eating, drinking mostly

01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:30.180 align:middle line:84%
liquids and blood, was
their primary thing.

01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And they changed-- they ended
up with no emotional body,

01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:40.370 align:middle line:84%
no feelings, no compassion,
no nothing, just pure logic

01:04:40.370 --> 01:04:44.060 align:middle line:90%
and any of that kind of stuff.

01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:48.610 align:middle line:84%
The Martians were really kind of
like their great-grandfathers.

01:04:48.610 --> 01:04:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is the reason
why when the Greys came

01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:53.209 align:middle line:84%
here and immediately
started doing

01:04:53.209 --> 01:04:55.750 align:middle line:84%
all the experiments and all of
the interfering that they did,

01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:59.230 align:middle line:84%
the direct manipulation,
the reason-- there

01:04:59.230 --> 01:05:00.915 align:middle line:84%
are a lot of life
around this planet.

01:05:00.915 --> 01:05:01.790 align:middle line:90%
You wouldn't believe.

01:05:01.790 --> 01:05:03.650 align:middle line:84%
If you don't know,
you wouldn't believe

01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:06.590 align:middle line:84%
how much life is centered
around this planet right now.

01:05:06.590 --> 01:05:12.570 align:middle line:84%
When life forms come in, they
come in on one overtone higher,

01:05:12.570 --> 01:05:14.790 align:middle line:84%
because that way
we can't see them,

01:05:14.790 --> 01:05:16.060 align:middle line:90%
and yet they can monitor us.

01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And then they're
just one breath away

01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:20.350 align:middle line:84%
from being here whenever
they want to be here.

01:05:20.350 --> 01:05:22.840 align:middle line:90%
And it's very convenient.

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:24.910 align:middle line:84%
There's are so many
people here right now,

01:05:24.910 --> 01:05:28.176 align:middle line:84%
the overtone around
the Earth is filled.

01:05:28.176 --> 01:05:31.840 align:middle line:90%
It's like a Rams parking lot.

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:32.830 align:middle line:90%
It's just like solid.

01:05:32.830 --> 01:05:33.984 align:middle line:90%
There's no more space left.

01:05:33.984 --> 01:05:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And they've gone to
the second overtone.

01:05:35.650 --> 01:05:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And the second overtone
is just about filled up.

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:41.120 align:middle line:84%
There's so much life
here, wanting to witness

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:44.890 align:middle line:84%
this unique situation
that's developed.

01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And so there's so much life
here focused on here-- I mean,

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:50.960 align:middle line:84%
you've got the whole universe
focused on this place--

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:53.070 align:middle line:84%
that they can stop
the Greys like that.

01:05:53.070 --> 01:05:53.870 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:55.230 align:middle line:90%
Why don't they?

01:05:55.230 --> 01:05:57.120 align:middle line:84%
Why can the Greys
just go in here

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:59.610 align:middle line:84%
and take hundreds of
thousands of people

01:05:59.610 --> 01:06:02.360 align:middle line:84%
and manipulate them and do
all these things like this?

01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:06.080 align:middle line:84%
Because we have Grey blood
in us through the Martians.

01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:09.070 align:middle line:84%
The Martians and the Greys
are our brother and sister

01:06:09.070 --> 01:06:10.090 align:middle line:90%
interlinked.

01:06:10.090 --> 01:06:11.920 align:middle line:90%
And we have that blood in us.

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And so they have a
lineage link to us.

01:06:15.370 --> 01:06:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
they have this law

01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:21.570 align:middle line:84%
they have the right
to be able to do this.

01:06:21.570 --> 01:06:23.610 align:middle line:84%
No one else can
get away with it.

01:06:23.610 --> 01:06:25.100 align:middle line:84%
If anyone else
tried to do it, they

01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:27.020 align:middle line:90%
would just stop them flat out.

01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:28.850 align:middle line:90%
But the Greys do this.

01:06:28.850 --> 01:06:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And they knew they
could get away with it.

01:06:31.250 --> 01:06:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And they chose us because we
still have an emotional body.

01:06:36.450 --> 01:06:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And they have now learned
that the only way that they

01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:42.560 align:middle line:84%
can get through
the great wall is

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:44.480 align:middle line:84%
by-- they can't take
their spaceships

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:45.970 align:middle line:90%
through the great wall.

01:06:45.970 --> 01:06:48.870 align:middle line:84%
They have to learn how to
create a living Merkaba, which

01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:53.970 align:middle line:84%
requires understanding of
the laws and your connection

01:06:53.970 --> 01:06:57.420 align:middle line:84%
to God, the emotional
body, specifically

01:06:57.420 --> 01:06:59.300 align:middle line:84%
unconditional love
for all of life.

01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:01.610 align:middle line:84%
These things must be
whirling around you

01:07:01.610 --> 01:07:03.820 align:middle line:84%
in counter-rotating
motions, which

01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:06.930 align:middle line:84%
creates the living
Merkaba field, which

01:07:06.930 --> 01:07:09.450 align:middle line:84%
is the only vehicle that's
ever been able to get

01:07:09.450 --> 01:07:10.860 align:middle line:90%
through the great wall.

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:12.818 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know how
to create one of these,

01:07:12.818 --> 01:07:15.860 align:middle line:84%
because they've got a missing
component, no emotional body.

01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And so they have a real--
this is what I mean.

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:19.760 align:middle line:90%
They've got a real problem.

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:22.050 align:middle line:84%
Because this dimensional
level appears

01:07:22.050 --> 01:07:26.210 align:middle line:84%
to be about ready to be
nonfunctional for a while.

01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And so their great problem is
they've got to get out of here,

01:07:29.230 --> 01:07:30.740 align:middle line:90%
and they can't.

01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:34.370 align:middle line:84%
They're trapped in something
that is going to recycle them,

01:07:34.370 --> 01:07:35.310 align:middle line:90%
you might say.

01:07:35.310 --> 01:07:38.287 align:middle line:84%
Their form is going
to be destroyed,

01:07:38.287 --> 01:07:39.870 align:middle line:84%
and their spirit is
going to be forced

01:07:39.870 --> 01:07:42.867 align:middle line:84%
to-- I don't know
exactly what happens

01:07:42.867 --> 01:07:43.950 align:middle line:90%
under those circumstances.

01:07:43.950 --> 01:07:45.040 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how.

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:46.680 align:middle line:90%
Their spirit cannot be killed.

01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:49.270 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it can't be destroyed.

01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:51.520 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know how,
if it starts over,

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:53.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
the procedure is.

01:07:53.090 --> 01:07:54.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:56.570 align:middle line:90%
But they've got a real problem.

01:07:56.570 --> 01:07:59.384 align:middle line:84%
They chose us, because we
have our emotional body.

01:07:59.384 --> 01:08:00.800 align:middle line:84%
They have this
connection with us,

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:02.830 align:middle line:84%
allowing them to do
these kind of things.

01:08:02.830 --> 01:08:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And so what their decision was,
from purely logical mind was,

01:08:06.450 --> 01:08:09.570 align:middle line:84%
well, we can't make
it through, so we

01:08:09.570 --> 01:08:12.610 align:middle line:84%
will make a sub-race
with our genes in it that

01:08:12.610 --> 01:08:13.840 align:middle line:90%
maybe can make it through.

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:17.560 align:middle line:84%
So they took human
beings, and lots of them,

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:18.819 align:middle line:90%
and experimented with them.

01:08:18.819 --> 01:08:22.310 align:middle line:84%
They first started experimenting
with cows and horses

01:08:22.310 --> 01:08:26.310 align:middle line:84%
and a few other animals,
very specific animals.

01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Animals, you see-- when we
started breathing in this way,

01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:34.149 align:middle line:84%
taking the air in and out
through our mouth and our nose

01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:37.550 align:middle line:84%
and not through the top channels
up through like this here, that

01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:39.770 align:middle line:84%
was the direct
result of that, was

01:08:39.770 --> 01:08:42.210 align:middle line:90%
good and evil consciousness.

01:08:42.210 --> 01:08:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And when we started bringing
animals into us closely,

01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:50.460 align:middle line:84%
those animals by resonance
began to breathe the way we did.

01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And so the cows and
the horses and the dogs

01:08:52.310 --> 01:08:53.770 align:middle line:84%
and the cats and
all these things

01:08:53.770 --> 01:08:56.609 align:middle line:84%
are doing exactly the
kinds of breathing patterns

01:08:56.609 --> 01:08:57.689 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

01:08:57.689 --> 01:09:04.359 align:middle line:84%
And so the initial steps
were to do an experimentation

01:09:04.359 --> 01:09:06.479 align:middle line:84%
with the animals
that were associated

01:09:06.479 --> 01:09:10.029 align:middle line:90%
with us, and primarily cows.

01:09:10.029 --> 01:09:11.779 align:middle line:84%
And there sort of was
cattle mutilation.

01:09:11.779 --> 01:09:15.710 align:middle line:84%
If you look at Linda Howe's work
that she did through ABC called

01:09:15.710 --> 01:09:17.955 align:middle line:84%
"The Strange Harvest" that
was set up around there,

01:09:17.955 --> 01:09:20.510 align:middle line:84%
and you look at that carefully,
and if you talk to her now,

01:09:20.510 --> 01:09:22.510 align:middle line:84%
and the evidence
she has out now,

01:09:22.510 --> 01:09:24.470 align:middle line:84%
she can prove to you
that nobody on Earth

01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:27.350 align:middle line:84%
can possibly do the
cattle mutilation.

01:09:27.350 --> 01:09:29.010 align:middle line:84%
There is no technology
known on Earth

01:09:29.010 --> 01:09:32.939 align:middle line:84%
that can even come
close to do this.

01:09:32.939 --> 01:09:35.479 align:middle line:84%
They've found cows,
for example-- not only

01:09:35.479 --> 01:09:38.899 align:middle line:84%
is all the surgery,
high-tech laser

01:09:38.899 --> 01:09:42.100 align:middle line:84%
surgery that only a few people
in the world can even do,

01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:44.290 align:middle line:84%
and there's hundreds of
thousands of cows out there.

01:09:44.290 --> 01:09:46.373 align:middle line:84%
Somebody would be real
busy doing all this stuff.

01:09:46.373 --> 01:09:47.173 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:47.173 --> 01:09:49.910 align:middle line:84%
But on top of that,
they're finding these cows

01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:56.960 align:middle line:84%
without one single red blood
cell in them-- not even one.

01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:00.400 align:middle line:84%
We have no technology that
can do this that we know of.

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:01.810 align:middle line:90%
Talk to any doctor.

01:10:01.810 --> 01:10:04.750 align:middle line:84%
There's no technology that can
remove every single red blood

01:10:04.750 --> 01:10:08.470 align:middle line:84%
cell out of every single
tissue in the entire body.

01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:10.130 align:middle line:90%
We don't know how they did it.

01:10:10.130 --> 01:10:12.132 align:middle line:90%
And yet there they are.

01:10:12.132 --> 01:10:14.330 align:middle line:90%
They're doing it.

01:10:14.330 --> 01:10:18.340 align:middle line:84%
And they're primarily taking
out the breathing apparatus

01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:20.131 align:middle line:84%
and the sexual
organs, because that's

01:10:20.131 --> 01:10:21.630 align:middle line:84%
the areas that they
wanted to study,

01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:23.255 align:middle line:84%
was the sexual energy
and the breathing

01:10:23.255 --> 01:10:24.750 align:middle line:90%
patterns of these animals.

01:10:24.750 --> 01:10:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And then they started
doing it with people.

01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:30.600 align:middle line:90%
They look at us like bugs.

01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:32.790 align:middle line:90%
They see us on such a low level.

01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:35.540 align:middle line:84%
We don't even count from
their point of view.

01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:37.790 align:middle line:84%
It would be like us taking
a little-- like when

01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:39.717 align:middle line:90%
we're working with rats.

01:10:39.717 --> 01:10:41.050 align:middle line:90%
We don't think, well, who cares?

01:10:41.050 --> 01:10:41.850 align:middle line:90%
They don't matter.

01:10:41.850 --> 01:10:43.860 align:middle line:84%
It does matter if they
hurt, anything like that.

01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:48.060 align:middle line:84%
They don't see us as being much
more than just a very, very

01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:49.030 align:middle line:90%
low level of life.

01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:51.540 align:middle line:90%


01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And so from a logical point
of view, that may be true.

01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:58.790 align:middle line:84%
From a compassionate,
loving point of view,

01:10:58.790 --> 01:11:01.290 align:middle line:90%
that's not really true at all.

01:11:01.290 --> 01:11:06.100 align:middle line:84%
But they don't have that
aspect of themselves in there.

01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:14.440 align:middle line:84%
And so they wanted to create
another race of beings that

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:17.860 align:middle line:84%
would be primarily their
genes, but connecting

01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:21.654 align:middle line:84%
in our sexual energy
and our emotional body.

01:11:21.654 --> 01:11:23.820 align:middle line:84%
That's what they really
wanted to do, and blend that

01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:27.990 align:middle line:84%
in with them and create this
race between the two of us,

01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:30.710 align:middle line:84%
hoping that that race would
be able to create the living

01:11:30.710 --> 01:11:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Merkaba and would be able to
go over the great wall, which

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:37.000 align:middle line:90%
evidently it did.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.790 align:middle line:84%
It was able to do it,
though this is not

01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:46.140 align:middle line:84%
going to happen until 2012
from where we sit here now,

01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:49.070 align:middle line:84%
that that race does
make it through.

01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And an example of
that is Bashar.

01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:53.210 align:middle line:90%
Who's familiar with Bashar here?

01:11:53.210 --> 01:11:56.770 align:middle line:84%
Bashar is the end
result of that race

01:11:56.770 --> 01:12:00.410 align:middle line:84%
coming from 300 years in
the future back to here.

01:12:00.410 --> 01:12:03.900 align:middle line:84%
But their ultimate plan, what
the Greys have in mind for us,

01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:04.830 align:middle line:90%
is not very nice.

01:12:04.830 --> 01:12:07.610 align:middle line:84%
They do not really care
what happens to us.

01:12:07.610 --> 01:12:09.779 align:middle line:84%
Their plan, then, they
have underground bases

01:12:09.779 --> 01:12:10.820 align:middle line:90%
all over the whole world.

01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Their primary base was in
Dulce, which was between the New

01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:18.020 align:middle line:90%
Mexico and Colorado border.

01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:20.850 align:middle line:84%
There was more cattle mutilation
there than anyone anywhere else

01:12:20.850 --> 01:12:21.900 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:23.608 align:middle line:84%
However, cows were
found everywhere, even

01:12:23.608 --> 01:12:26.070 align:middle line:84%
on isolated islands out in
the middle of the Pacific.

01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:37.885 align:middle line:84%
And so they-- I
don't know how far I

01:12:37.885 --> 01:12:40.010 align:middle line:84%
want to get into all of
this stuff with these guys,

01:12:40.010 --> 01:12:44.240 align:middle line:84%
but what they planned
to do originally

01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:49.290 align:middle line:84%
was to get this
other race going,

01:12:49.290 --> 01:12:52.090 align:middle line:84%
create it primarily on the
fourth dimensional level

01:12:52.090 --> 01:12:53.910 align:middle line:84%
so it was really
used to function

01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:58.250 align:middle line:84%
from those levels of
existence, and then open up

01:12:58.250 --> 01:12:59.760 align:middle line:84%
very rapidly the
fourth dimensional

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:02.259 align:middle line:84%
level on the Earth, which will
kill everybody on the planet.

01:13:02.259 --> 01:13:04.450 align:middle line:84%
We would all go into
total separation and chaos

01:13:04.450 --> 01:13:09.000 align:middle line:84%
and wipe us all out, exterminate
all life on the planet

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:14.950 align:middle line:84%
and replace us with this super
race, which was more them

01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:16.130 align:middle line:90%
than us.

01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:17.710 align:middle line:90%
And that was their plan.

01:13:17.710 --> 01:13:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And I don't really think
that that plan has totally

01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:24.710 align:middle line:84%
been stopped, though a
great deal of pressure

01:13:24.710 --> 01:13:28.300 align:middle line:84%
has been applied for
them to not do this.

01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And the person who
raised the ship up,

01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:32.430 align:middle line:84%
the very first
thing that she did

01:13:32.430 --> 01:13:36.400 align:middle line:84%
after she got the crystal that
controlled the programming

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:38.920 align:middle line:84%
and changed the geomancy
of the whole planet

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:42.810 align:middle line:84%
put it into down her
spine, the very first thing

01:13:42.810 --> 01:13:47.620 align:middle line:84%
she did after she did
that was, she thought,

01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:49.840 align:middle line:84%
as long as the
Greys are here, they

01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:51.340 align:middle line:84%
are going to find
themselves getting

01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:53.240 align:middle line:84%
sick from an incurable
disease that's

01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:55.340 align:middle line:90%
associated only with Earth.

01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:56.140 align:middle line:90%
They leave here.

01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:58.260 align:middle line:90%
There will be no problem.

01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:02.912 align:middle line:84%
Immediately, Greys all over
the world started dying.

01:14:02.912 --> 01:14:06.820 align:middle line:84%
Within 30 to 60 days, the
UFO people were all going,

01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:07.620 align:middle line:90%
what's going on?

01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:08.420 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:10.940 align:middle line:90%
All the Greys are dying.

01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:16.380 align:middle line:84%
The secret governments, which
by now had originally made pacts

01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:18.282 align:middle line:84%
with them and
contracts with them

01:14:18.282 --> 01:14:19.990 align:middle line:84%
and thought that they
were the good guys,

01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:22.531 align:middle line:84%
eventually got down the line
and realized they weren't really

01:14:22.531 --> 01:14:24.870 align:middle line:84%
the good guys, and actually
went to war with them

01:14:24.870 --> 01:14:26.230 align:middle line:90%
and were winning.

01:14:26.230 --> 01:14:29.560 align:middle line:84%
They went into certain bases
and just like mowed them down.

01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:31.530 align:middle line:84%
The guys couldn't
even resist them.

01:14:31.530 --> 01:14:37.045 align:middle line:84%
And they finally,
by the end of 1992,

01:14:37.045 --> 01:14:38.670 align:middle line:84%
and that's what she
said, that they had

01:14:38.670 --> 01:14:40.730 align:middle line:90%
to leave by the end of 1992.

01:14:40.730 --> 01:14:43.510 align:middle line:84%
There were hardly any
Greys here left at all.

01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And at this point,
they're probably

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:49.681 align:middle line:84%
existing, if there are any
at all, outside the fields

01:14:49.681 --> 01:14:51.680 align:middle line:84%
and coming in very quickly
and getting back out.

01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:53.890 align:middle line:84%
Because they can't stay
here for very long.

01:14:53.890 --> 01:14:55.310 align:middle line:90%
But where did they go?

01:14:55.310 --> 01:14:57.110 align:middle line:84%
They just shifted it
back to another planet

01:14:57.110 --> 01:15:00.670 align:middle line:84%
called Mars and set up all
their bases all over there.

01:15:00.670 --> 01:15:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And now they've got
all their operations

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:05.390 align:middle line:84%
still going there,
just as strong as ever.

01:15:05.390 --> 01:15:08.340 align:middle line:84%
But they can't come
near the Earth.

01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't try
to totally stop them.

01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:14.080 align:middle line:84%
She just said, you
can't be here anymore.

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:16.170 align:middle line:90%
That's all she said.

01:15:16.170 --> 01:15:18.740 align:middle line:90%
And so it's not over.

01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:21.150 align:middle line:84%
There's still a lot
going on in those levels.

01:15:21.150 --> 01:15:22.340 align:middle line:90%
But it's OK.

01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:24.900 align:middle line:90%
We've already won this game.

01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:26.334 align:middle line:90%
