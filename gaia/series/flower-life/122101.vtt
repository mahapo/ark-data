00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.670 align:middle line:84%
>>So is consciousness
itself awareness?

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.740 align:middle line:84%
We talked about
love having shape.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.290 align:middle line:84%
Though we haven't
gotten to it yet.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about how
shape affects everything.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.210 align:middle line:84%
There is shape associated
with awareness.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.980 align:middle line:84%
How the lenses that you
interpret the reality with

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.230 align:middle line:84%
have shape to them, there's
shape connected it it.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.315 align:middle line:84%
It seems kind of like
a strange subject,

00:00:42.315 --> 00:00:43.700 align:middle line:90%
it seems kind of strange.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.470 align:middle line:84%
Like love would
have a shape too.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.362 align:middle line:90%
But so does awareness.

00:00:47.362 --> 00:00:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And since that's what we're
really talking about here

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.480 align:middle line:84%
is going from one level to
another, is changing awareness,

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.920 align:middle line:84%
changing consciousness
levels, we

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.950 align:middle line:84%
need to look at these
things for a moment.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.770 align:middle line:84%
According to Thoth, if you
were to come up to a planet

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.750 align:middle line:84%
you'd never seen
before and you wanted

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.810 align:middle line:84%
to know what level of
consciousness they had reached

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.200 align:middle line:84%
on there, he said,
all you'd have to do

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.090 align:middle line:90%
is just get a few of them.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And hold them still
and measure them.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:19.920 align:middle line:90%
Don't move.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And see the shape of the field
that would fit around them

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.310 align:middle line:90%
relative to a sphere.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.120 align:middle line:84%
And whether or
not the perimeter,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.040 align:middle line:84%
for humans for
example, the perimeter

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.560 align:middle line:84%
of the square that
fits around you

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.270 align:middle line:84%
is bigger or littler than the
circle that fits around you.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And how much bigger or
littler will determine exactly

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.950 align:middle line:84%
mathematically how they're
interpreting the reality.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:47.750 align:middle line:90%
There's other ways.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.583 align:middle line:84%
You could look at the
grid around the planet

00:01:49.583 --> 00:01:50.700 align:middle line:90%
and know instantly anyway.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.455 align:middle line:84%
But you could also tell by
their physical shape and form.

00:01:54.455 --> 00:01:57.975 align:middle line:90%


00:01:57.975 --> 00:01:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
this other thing

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.830 align:middle line:84%
he said that there was--
there's a legend says

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.160 align:middle line:84%
that there are nine
concentric crystal

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.450 align:middle line:90%
balls underneath the Sphinx.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.650 align:middle line:84%
There's if you can imagine,
this one crystal ball

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.360 align:middle line:84%
inside of another crystal
ball, inside of another one.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.050 align:middle line:90%
And there's nine of them.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And that this is supposedly
a physical object sitting

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.440 align:middle line:90%
somewhere underneath the Sphinx.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And that it was the key
to consciousness on Earth.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And there are people
searching for this real hard,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.696 align:middle line:84%
have been for many years,
trying to find his crystal ball

00:02:30.696 --> 00:02:32.570 align:middle line:84%
and thinking that that's
going to be the key.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.403 align:middle line:84%
Because once they get
the ball, then they've

00:02:34.403 --> 00:02:37.190 align:middle line:84%
got to figure out what it
is, which might take longer.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.870 align:middle line:90%


00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Thoth says that
it's really there.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.840 align:middle line:84%
But that it isn't
necessarily to have the ball.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.680 align:middle line:84%
All you've got to do is
draw nine concentric circles

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.480 align:middle line:90%
on a page.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.510 align:middle line:90%
That's good enough.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And so here are these
nine concentric circles

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.426 align:middle line:84%
starting from this little
one, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,

00:02:55.426 --> 00:02:58.000 align:middle line:90%
9 to the green one out there.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.710 align:middle line:90%


00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And Thoth says that if
you want to understand

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.770 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness, he says,
look at the relationship

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.450 align:middle line:90%
of the squares to the circles.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Again it's this male energy in
relationship to female energy.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.480 align:middle line:84%
Look at the squares
and the relationships.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And look how squares that
are around the circles

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.420 align:middle line:90%
interact with circles.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And look to see if there
any places where the phi

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.764 align:middle line:84%
ratio takes place, where the
golden mean ratio happens,

00:03:29.764 --> 00:03:32.180 align:middle line:84%
where the circle and the square
are in the same perimeter.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.590 align:middle line:84%
Or if it's very close
you're not going

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.130 align:middle line:84%
to get perfection starting
out, but where it hits really,

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.690 align:middle line:90%
really closely.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.090 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the first
one, the first square,

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.435 align:middle line:84%
around the first
circle, it doesn't even

00:03:45.435 --> 00:03:46.310 align:middle line:90%
touch another circle.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.560 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't interact
with another circle.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.030 align:middle line:84%
Square around the second
one still doesn't touch.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.630 align:middle line:84%
Square around the
third one starts

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.480 align:middle line:90%
to penetrate the fourth one.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.070 align:middle line:90%
But that's obviously not there.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.170 align:middle line:84%
But the square that goes
around the fourth circle

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.460 align:middle line:84%
relative to the
fifth circle happens

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.870 align:middle line:84%
to be an almost
perfect phi ratio.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.870 align:middle line:84%
That is the place that
self-aware consciousness

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.820 align:middle line:90%
happens for the first time.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.345 align:middle line:90%
That's 42 plus 2 chromosomes.

00:04:14.345 --> 00:04:17.180 align:middle line:90%
That's the aberrational.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.700 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't go into phi ratio
again until you get to 1, 2, 3,

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.270 align:middle line:90%
4, 5, 6, 7, this purple one.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.150 align:middle line:84%
The seventh circle relative to
not one above like the fourth

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.540 align:middle line:84%
and the fifth, but
the seventh circle

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.200 align:middle line:90%
relative to the ninth one.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.500 align:middle line:84%
So you see how it passes
through the green one here?

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.840 align:middle line:10%
We're just visually
looking at this right now.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.050 align:middle line:10%
That is the seventh relative
to the ninth also forms

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:52.310 align:middle line:10%
a near perfect phi ratio.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.200 align:middle line:84%
So there are two
places in there when

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.860 align:middle line:90%
you have in your perfect one.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.830 align:middle line:84%
However, according
to Thoth, life

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.750 align:middle line:84%
has never figured out how
to go from the fourth level

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.390 align:middle line:84%
to the seventh level
without passing

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.780 align:middle line:84%
through this dis-harmonic
level between them.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.520 align:middle line:84%
So there's another
stage in there.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.989 align:middle line:90%


00:05:11.989 --> 00:05:14.030 align:middle line:84%
I realize I'm not pinning
anything down here yet.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.930 align:middle line:90%
I will.

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.120 align:middle line:84%
So this fourth level here
relative to the fifth,

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.305 align:middle line:84%
there's two stages in
between this fourth circle

00:05:25.305 --> 00:05:29.098 align:middle line:84%
and the fifth circle
and the seventh circle.

00:05:29.098 --> 00:05:31.482 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting mixed
up myself here.

00:05:31.482 --> 00:05:37.230 align:middle line:84%
1, 2, 3, 4, the fourth square
and the seventh square,

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.420 align:middle line:84%
there are two other possible
squares that are in between.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.610 align:middle line:84%
As it turns out, and I never
understood why for a long time

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.170 align:middle line:84%
but it was the fifth circle
relative to sixth one

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:48.584 align:middle line:90%
that life has chosen.

00:05:48.584 --> 00:05:50.000 align:middle line:84%
He didn't tell me
for a long time.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.380 align:middle line:90%
He said, you figure it out.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, it took me two years or
something to figure it out.

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.200 align:middle line:90%
And I finally did figure it out.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And what it is, is
that if you take

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:04.780 align:middle line:84%
this square and-- on the seven
and turn it into a diamond,

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.510 align:middle line:84%
it will so happen
that this one will

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.020 align:middle line:90%
come up and touch perfectly.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.580 align:middle line:84%
If you drew these
perfectly, this

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.800 align:middle line:90%
is just touching that circle.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.210 align:middle line:84%
You see how this
square comes down?

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.490 align:middle line:90%
And if you do, it comes up.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:16.700 align:middle line:90%
And it will touch perfectly.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And that particular
consciousness

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:30.360 align:middle line:84%
shows or can determine where the
boundaries of the next one are.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And so in human terms, we
have something within us

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.470 align:middle line:84%
that is the key to
Christ consciousness.

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.010 align:middle line:84%
We are not Christ consciousness,
but we contain something

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.780 align:middle line:90%
within us that can reach it.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.660 align:middle line:84%
So that's just geometrically
showing what it is.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.530 align:middle line:10%
If you want to see
what I'm talking

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:55.040 align:middle line:10%
about in terms of the
ratios, this green one

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.880 align:middle line:10%
is the first level.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.270 align:middle line:10%
The red one is the second level.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:03.680 align:middle line:10%
And the blue one is the
third level of consciousness.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.799 align:middle line:10%
And you can actually
measure which

00:07:06.799 --> 00:07:09.340 align:middle line:10%
one is bigger than the other,
without any sticks or anything.

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.520 align:middle line:90%
You usually should be able to.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.720 align:middle line:84%
Using your radii as
your measuring stick,

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:18.189 align:middle line:84%
and counting that
measuring stick as one,

00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:19.480 align:middle line:90%
you could count it is anything.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.390 align:middle line:84%
But if you counted it as
1.6 it becomes complicated.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:25.920 align:middle line:90%
So you count it as one.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.060 align:middle line:84%
So your radii is
your measuring stick.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Then you could tell
how many radii are

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.310 align:middle line:90%
across one edge of the square.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:37.260 align:middle line:84%
Because it is the same as the
diameter of this fourth circle.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:41.320 align:middle line:10%
So there is 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8 radii

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.280 align:middle line:10%
across that fourth circle,
same number of radii

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.950 align:middle line:10%
across that edge.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:49.960 align:middle line:10%
And so since there's four edges
there's going to be 4 times 8,

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:56.160 align:middle line:10%
or 32 radii perfectly
around that green square.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And the fifth circle
out here, if you

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.760 align:middle line:84%
want to know how many
radii are around that,

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.710 align:middle line:90%
you just count across.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.940 align:middle line:10%
And you'll see that there are 10
radii across the fifth circle.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:09.380 align:middle line:10%
And you just go 10 times pi.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:13.050 align:middle line:10%
And 10 times pi is 31.40.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:18.060 align:middle line:10%
So there's 31.40 radii
around that circle.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.630 align:middle line:90%
So they're very close.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.810 align:middle line:84%
One is 31.4, and
the other one is 32.

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:28.850 align:middle line:84%
They're very, very
close in that.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:32.669 align:middle line:84%
And then they go way out until
you get to the seventh one.

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And the seventh one has 14 radii
across it and 4 times 14 is 56.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.860 align:middle line:10%
There's 56 radii
around the blue square.

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.409 align:middle line:10%
And if you come out
to the final circle,

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:44.950 align:middle line:10%
there's 18 radii across it.

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:49.130 align:middle line:10%
And 18 times pi is 56.52.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:52.820 align:middle line:10%
So the first one has the
circle a little bit smaller.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:56.120 align:middle line:10%
The second one has the
circle a little bit bigger.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:59.116 align:middle line:10%
And if you keep running these
circles out for a long ways,

00:08:59.116 --> 00:09:01.740 align:middle line:10%
you'll see this a little bigger,
little smaller, little bigger,

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.560 align:middle line:10%
little smaller, little
bigger, and how over time we

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.230 align:middle line:10%
keep getting closer and
closer to this perfection

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.720 align:middle line:10%
of this perfect square and
perfect circle as consciousness

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.520 align:middle line:10%
progresses.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.180 align:middle line:90%


00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:15.600 align:middle line:84%
The one that we are
in this red one, which

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.900 align:middle line:84%
is the stepping stone
between the two.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.930 align:middle line:10%
And we're not even close.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:25.510 align:middle line:10%
But it'll show that
if you measure them,

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:27.790 align:middle line:10%
I think we're about three
radii off or something.

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:29.720 align:middle line:10%
Our consciousness
isn't even-- we're

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.310 align:middle line:10%
not even close to
being harmonic,

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:36.910 align:middle line:10%
but a necessary place to go.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.260 align:middle line:90%
What is it about this?

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.470 align:middle line:84%
Why has this happened
at the fourth circle

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:43.690 align:middle line:90%
relative to the fifth?

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:47.440 align:middle line:84%
There is an actual reason
why consciousness becomes

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.430 align:middle line:90%
self-aware at that stage.

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:51.780 align:middle line:84%
There's a hidden
pattern behind this.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And the hidden pattern
is very familiar.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.230 align:middle line:90%
It's the fruit of life.

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.370 align:middle line:84%
If you take the fruit
of life, and you

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:02.170 align:middle line:84%
count this as your
radii as one, you

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.620 align:middle line:84%
make a circle which is there,
and you come out one more

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.210 align:middle line:84%
and put a circle which will come
around here, and then one more.

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:10.800 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you make
your concentric circles

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.582 align:middle line:84%
out from that, starting
with the radii that's this.

00:10:13.582 --> 00:10:14.415 align:middle line:90%
Here's what happens.

00:10:14.415 --> 00:10:18.660 align:middle line:90%


00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:23.870 align:middle line:84%
This becomes the 1, 2,
3, the fourth circle.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:25.095 align:middle line:90%
There's your square.

00:10:25.095 --> 00:10:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And the fifth circle is the
one that exactly contains.

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:36.360 align:middle line:84%
Look how the fruit of life fits
into that pattern like a key,

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:40.350 align:middle line:84%
perfectly, absolutely
flawlessly.

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
reason that self-aware

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:44.130 align:middle line:90%
happens at that point.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:45.710 align:middle line:90%
It's the reason behind it.

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:48.090 align:middle line:90%
It's the secret.

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:51.460 align:middle line:84%
In all your sacred geometry
when you get to something

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:54.360 align:middle line:84%
and you want to know
why, look further.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.160 align:middle line:90%
Look further.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.500 align:middle line:84%
See what the sacred forms are
that are hidden behind that.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll begin
to understand why.

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the
first time right here.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:14.030 align:middle line:84%
I get to talk
about Lucie Lubicz.

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:15.440 align:middle line:10%
She's a great woman.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.410 align:middle line:10%
Though she's dead now.

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:17.630 align:middle line:10%
I'm really sorry.

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:19.870 align:middle line:10%
I really wanted to meet her.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:23.490 align:middle line:10%
But she died a couple
a few years ago.

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:27.680 align:middle line:90%
She lived in Abydos, Egypt.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.590 align:middle line:84%
But when I was
studying all this,

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:33.590 align:middle line:84%
I started studying the
Egyptian thoughts on it.

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:34.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting this from Thoth.

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:35.700 align:middle line:90%
He tells me things.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And whenever he
tells me thing's I

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:40.630 align:middle line:90%
start checking them out always.

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:41.430 align:middle line:90%
He told me to.

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:42.513 align:middle line:90%
He says, don't believe me.

00:11:42.513 --> 00:11:43.562 align:middle line:90%
Go find out for yourself.

00:11:43.562 --> 00:11:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Which is the same
thing I tell you.

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:49.840 align:middle line:90%


00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.120 align:middle line:90%
So I started checking.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.340 align:middle line:84%
He said that there
were these five levels,

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:54.870 align:middle line:90%
and that we were within three.

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I start checking this in
Egyptian beliefs and thoughts.

00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And found out that
they did believe

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.250 align:middle line:90%
that there were five levels.

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And we were functioning
through three.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And Lucie Lubicz
happened to be one

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:08.910 align:middle line:84%
of the people who was Schwaller
Lubicz's daughter, one

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:14.560 align:middle line:84%
of the people who had really
studied this in depth,

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.076 align:middle line:84%
this whole concept
of these three

00:12:16.076 --> 00:12:17.450 align:middle line:84%
different levels
of consciousness

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:18.820 align:middle line:90%
that we were involved in.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And she took everything
she knew and put it

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:22.620 align:middle line:90%
into this one drawing.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:27.670 align:middle line:84%
It was the summation of
everything she knew about this.

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:30.630 align:middle line:10%
And so I had to
redraw the drawing.

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:34.140 align:middle line:84%
Because it wasn't real clear,
redrew the drawing down here

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.279 align:middle line:84%
like this, and all the
lines clear and straight.

00:12:36.279 --> 00:12:38.320 align:middle line:10%
And the first thing that
appears that you can see

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.440 align:middle line:10%
is you've got a Star of David
with a Star of David in it,

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.520 align:middle line:10%
and a circle in the center.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the minimum
amount of information

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:49.100 align:middle line:90%
to give the fruit of life.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:52.770 align:middle line:90%
So immediately you see that.

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And here you see this ladder
running up the middle,

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:59.550 align:middle line:90%
which goes from 0 to 19.

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes to go
to 20 and 21 up here.

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:04.680 align:middle line:10%
And she talks
about how there are

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:08.050 align:middle line:10%
three different size
of skulls associated

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:09.870 align:middle line:10%
with three different levels.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:13.250 align:middle line:10%
And this is talking about these
three difference skull sizes.

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:17.360 align:middle line:90%
She says the first one is at 18.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And according to
the Egyptian belief,

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:24.060 align:middle line:84%
we grew this entire
top of our head

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.980 align:middle line:84%
when writing was
introduced, to deal

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:30.922 align:middle line:90%
with the complexity of writing.

00:13:30.922 --> 00:13:34.780 align:middle line:90%
That this was added on later.

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And then later when we
go to the next level,

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.730 align:middle line:84%
we will grow a
much bigger skull,

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:42.210 align:middle line:84%
like Akhenaten-type
skull to deal

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:44.725 align:middle line:84%
with the complexity of fourth
dimensional consciousness.

00:13:44.725 --> 00:13:50.200 align:middle line:90%


00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.000 align:middle line:90%
This is that.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.030 align:middle line:84%
Remember I said there
was a big pile of rocks?

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:55.520 align:middle line:90%
It was at Karnak.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.335 align:middle line:84%
That was a big pile
of rocks, and she just

00:13:57.335 --> 00:14:00.760 align:middle line:84%
picked up one of them,
maybe two or three of them,

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.086 align:middle line:84%
measured them, looked
at it and said, aha.

00:14:03.086 --> 00:14:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And made a drawing and said,
that's what it looks like.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.305 align:middle line:84%
And told them, and they
put all the rocks together

00:14:09.305 --> 00:14:10.551 align:middle line:90%
and then formed it.

00:14:10.551 --> 00:14:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Then she went over to
another big pile of rocks.

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:14.976 align:middle line:84%
I don't have the other one
here, picked up some of those

00:14:14.976 --> 00:14:16.480 align:middle line:84%
and measured those,
and said, okay.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.830 align:middle line:90%
This is what it would look like.

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And they put it all
together, and it

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:21.390 align:middle line:84%
formed this other temple, which
was different than this one.

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And she could tell
just on the geometry.

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:27.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is how well
she understood what

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:30.330 align:middle line:90%
sacred geometry was all about.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Because these temples were all
holographic in their nature.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.720 align:middle line:84%
So she knew that once she
knew what a little piece was,

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.220 align:middle line:84%
she could figure
out what everything

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.860 align:middle line:90%
was going to be like.

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:43.520 align:middle line:84%
She was an amazing,
amazing person.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.690 align:middle line:10%
And this is the Luxor
Temple, an aerial view,

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:48.160 align:middle line:10%
a drawing of it from the Luxor.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.010 align:middle line:90%


00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:53.320 align:middle line:90%
And this temple is based on 19.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:59.860 align:middle line:84%
Remember that ladder went up and
at 19 it showed our skull size.

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And this was the temple
of man which is us.

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:05.510 align:middle line:90%


00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And you see the
skeleton behind here.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.630 align:middle line:90%
You enter in down [FADES OUT].

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:13.230 align:middle line:84%
This is a big, huge, enormous,
incredible three or four

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:14.470 align:middle line:90%
block long temple.

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:15.650 align:middle line:90%
It's big.

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:18.704 align:middle line:10%
And inside of here are all the
proportions of the human body,

00:15:18.704 --> 00:15:20.620 align:middle line:10%
and all these other kinds
of things, carefully

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:23.890 align:middle line:10%
worked out very, very carefully.

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:27.230 align:middle line:10%
And it's broken into
these 19 divisions.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:30.055 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've never been able to
correlate the straight Egyptian

00:15:30.055 --> 00:15:35.780 align:middle line:84%
18, 19, and 21 divisions that
they have given the three

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:37.860 align:middle line:84%
levels of consciousness
with, and the one

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:39.980 align:middle line:84%
that Thoth has
given me, which is

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:41.540 align:middle line:90%
this one of these other views.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:46.900 align:middle line:84%
I can't-- at this point, cannot
find a bridge between the two.

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.165 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be some
sacred geometry form hidden

00:15:49.165 --> 00:15:51.530 align:middle line:84%
behind there, that's there--
but I can't find it--

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:53.580 align:middle line:84%
that would bridge
those two things.

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:57.080 align:middle line:90%
So far I can't do that.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.854 align:middle line:84%
So I have to skip
between one or other,

00:15:58.854 --> 00:16:01.020 align:middle line:84%
whether I'm talking about
Egyptian system or the one

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:02.960 align:middle line:90%
that Thoth has given me.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And this is the one where I
told that story, which I'm not

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:10.800 align:middle line:84%
going to tell this time about
going in the temple of dreams.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.897 align:middle line:84%
For those of you
that saw the thing.

00:16:12.897 --> 00:16:14.480 align:middle line:84%
I know I haven't
told any stories yet.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:18.320 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm just barely being
able to get the information

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.710 align:middle line:90%
through here.

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:23.480 align:middle line:84%
I will tell the one-- I
will tell a couple here.

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.470 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know.

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:27.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have
to go to six days.

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:33.950 align:middle line:90%


00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:36.326 align:middle line:84%
That's why he did
it in six days.

00:16:36.326 --> 00:16:37.290 align:middle line:90%
He needed it.

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:41.630 align:middle line:90%


00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:43.330 align:middle line:84%
I can barely rest
doing it in five.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:44.130 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you.

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:45.220 align:middle line:90%
It's really hard.

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:46.020 align:middle line:90%
It's really hard.

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.644 align:middle line:84%
For a long time I
was doing it in four,

00:16:47.644 --> 00:16:50.440 align:middle line:84%
and I mean I had to
drop out tons of stuff

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.850 align:middle line:84%
and really move out
to be able to make it.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Well anyway, this temple
has a long causeway

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:01.740 align:middle line:84%
that goes for several miles
over to-- this is Luxor,

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.450 align:middle line:90%
and it goes over to Karnak.

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:05.349 align:middle line:84%
There's this wide, I
think about as wide

00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:07.829 align:middle line:84%
as this room, lined
with sphinxes,

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:09.700 align:middle line:90%
with sphinx heads on it.

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And then the sphinx heads
turn into rams heads

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:16.030 align:middle line:84%
as it gets into the
temple of dreams.

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:17.791 align:middle line:84%
And so the temple
of man are connected

00:17:17.791 --> 00:17:18.790 align:middle line:90%
to the temple of dreams.

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:20.890 align:middle line:84%
They have you come
in here for-- this is

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:23.270 align:middle line:90%
where your initiation begins.

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:25.290 align:middle line:84%
This is where Thoth
had me-- again,

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:27.425 align:middle line:90%
I had to start in that temple.

00:17:27.425 --> 00:17:32.400 align:middle line:84%
So if I started in any other
temple, forget it and go home.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And I had to start here for
the first initiation here,

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:38.656 align:middle line:84%
and then go to the temple
dreams, and then from there,

00:17:38.656 --> 00:17:40.780 align:middle line:84%
there were certain places
I had to go to all of it.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.580 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
talk about that.

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And the temple dreams
is very powerful,

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.530 align:middle line:90%
If you ever had that initiation.

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Because your dreams become
real, and it becomes a school.

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And for a long time I was
taught through my dreams.

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:59.160 align:middle line:90%
I mean there was no rest, right?

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.940 align:middle line:84%
I'd go in, and lay
down, and here I'd

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.620 align:middle line:84%
be with all these people
teaching me all this stuff.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:06.680 align:middle line:90%
And it was kind of fun.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.063 align:middle line:90%
But it was a lot of work.

00:18:09.063 --> 00:18:11.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of glad it's
over with actually.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.740 align:middle line:90%


00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:19.730 align:middle line:84%
So coming back to this, here's
this fruit of life pattern

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:21.500 align:middle line:90%
that's around here.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:27.720 align:middle line:84%
This skull that's up here
that the Egyptians claimed

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:35.170 align:middle line:84%
that we grew to, in
response to writing.

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:40.090 align:middle line:84%
There is physiological
evidence to suggest strongly

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:43.210 align:middle line:84%
that what they are
saying is true.

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
fact that you can

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.740 align:middle line:84%
take the entire top
half of your head

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:54.690 align:middle line:84%
and cut it off and throw it
away, and it doesn't kill you.

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:57.700 align:middle line:90%
It's called a lobotomy.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And this is the scheme of the
basic scheme of the human brain

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:04.620 align:middle line:90%
into electronics.

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And it says right
down here that removal

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:11.470 align:middle line:84%
of the upper cortical areas,
where conscious thinking takes

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:14.350 align:middle line:84%
place, has little effect on the
circuit of information required

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:16.780 align:middle line:84%
for equally complex
computations needed for walking

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:18.430 align:middle line:90%
and maintaining equilibrium.

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:20.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean obviously if you cut
off the top half of your head,

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:22.283 align:middle line:90%
you're not going to be the same.

00:19:22.283 --> 00:19:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And you can't learn computers
and things like that.

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:29.110 align:middle line:84%
But you don't die, which
is really remarkable

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:30.690 align:middle line:90%
that it doesn't kill you.

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:34.000 align:middle line:84%
That you can take something
so seemingly important,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.500 align:middle line:90%
and get rid of it.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.480 align:middle line:84%
But according to them, that's
because it was in addition to,

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.936 align:middle line:84%
it was not part of the
essential mechanism.

00:19:41.936 --> 00:19:45.350 align:middle line:90%


00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:48.219 align:middle line:84%
Now coming back to this
again, first of all,

00:19:48.219 --> 00:19:49.760 align:middle line:84%
there was this fruit
of life pattern,

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.330 align:middle line:90%
and this stair step pattern.

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:53.930 align:middle line:84%
Here was the fruit
of life pattern

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:56.090 align:middle line:90%
that she has around there.

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:59.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I redrew that patterns
as a separate drawing.

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:02.180 align:middle line:84%
I was going to begin to
analyze what she was doing.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.030 align:middle line:84%
So I drew one of the
patterns over here.

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And then I took the ladder
pattern, and I drew it.

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And the ladder pattern,
which is around here,

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:12.400 align:middle line:84%
is another way of drawing
concentric circles.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:13.851 align:middle line:90%
So I drew this pattern.

00:20:13.851 --> 00:20:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought
that I would just

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:19.294 align:middle line:84%
be able to take these two
patterns and superimpose them.

00:20:19.294 --> 00:20:20.710 align:middle line:84%
That was just my
way of proceeding

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:23.810 align:middle line:84%
to see-- try to figure
out all the ways

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:25.470 align:middle line:90%
that she was looking at this.

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:30.296 align:middle line:84%
And when I tried to join the
two together, they didn't fit.

00:20:30.296 --> 00:20:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And I went back, and I thought,
oh, I must have made a mistake.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at things again,
and put them back together,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:35.916 align:middle line:90%
and they wouldn't fit.

00:20:35.916 --> 00:20:38.306 align:middle line:90%
They just wouldn't go together.

00:20:38.306 --> 00:20:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And you see, because the
central pattern in her drawing

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:45.020 align:middle line:84%
shows clearly that the
central circle is divided

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:47.340 align:middle line:84%
into five equal places,
not counting this line

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:48.140 align:middle line:90%
down the middle.

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:51.346 align:middle line:84%
There's a very clear
five division and seven

00:20:51.346 --> 00:20:53.060 align:middle line:90%
above and seven below.

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:56.850 align:middle line:84%
So if I took-- the
fruit of life pattern

00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:59.005 align:middle line:84%
shows that from the
central pattern,

00:20:59.005 --> 00:21:02.100 align:middle line:84%
there's two circles above
it, reaching up to here.

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And if this is five, then
this would have to be five,

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:06.420 align:middle line:90%
and this would have to be five.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:09.580 align:middle line:84%
But when you integrate
those two patterns together,

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:11.780 align:middle line:84%
you'll find that
there's a half a circle

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:15.830 align:middle line:84%
above and a half circle
below, and it won't work.

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:17.347 align:middle line:90%
It just won't work.

00:21:17.347 --> 00:21:18.430 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't believe it.

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And I went back to
her original drawing.

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:25.076 align:middle line:84%
And then I very carefully-- I
assumed the ladder was equal.

00:21:25.076 --> 00:21:26.200 align:middle line:90%
Because that's what you do.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.800 align:middle line:84%
You assume that it's
an equal ladder, right?

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:32.730 align:middle line:84%
But when I carefully
analyzed or measured very,

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:35.870 align:middle line:84%
very carefully, I found that
the five spaces in the middle

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:38.166 align:middle line:84%
were one size, and
the seven above

00:21:38.166 --> 00:21:41.930 align:middle line:84%
and the seven below, she
had contracted them slightly

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:45.095 align:middle line:84%
to take up that half space,
so that the whole thing would

00:21:45.095 --> 00:21:46.550 align:middle line:90%
fit together.

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And that was her-- like
Leonardo had the writing

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.840 align:middle line:84%
that you had to
put a mirror onto,

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:56.770 align:middle line:84%
which would show the reflection
that the female was a mirror

00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:57.680 align:middle line:90%
image.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.790 align:middle line:84%
This was her way of saying
that our consciousness isn't

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:01.590 align:middle line:90%
harmonic.

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:04.655 align:middle line:90%


00:22:04.655 --> 00:22:06.280 align:middle line:84%
She knew that it
wouldn't fit together.

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And she had to distort the
image in order to make it fit.

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And you were supposed to find
that in order to know that.

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And there is, and I
will not say his name.

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:19.710 align:middle line:84%
There is an entire book
that's been written

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:24.330 align:middle line:84%
on this very ladder that had
assumed that it was equal,

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:27.290 align:middle line:84%
and all-- everything that
had been written in that book

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:28.800 align:middle line:90%
has to be wrong.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:33.270 align:middle line:84%
Because they didn't
pick that up.

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:35.395 align:middle line:84%
That one little thing
was not picked up.

00:22:35.395 --> 00:22:36.285 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:22:36.285 --> 00:22:38.070 align:middle line:90%
>>No, we're four.

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:47.220 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, coming back to the
three levels of consciousness,

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:50.610 align:middle line:84%
what I would like
to do now is to look

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:54.570 align:middle line:84%
at each one of these
levels geometrically,

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:57.110 align:middle line:84%
bring out the geometrical
limbs or image

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:59.260 align:middle line:84%
that each one of these
consciousness levels

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:02.866 align:middle line:84%
interprets the reality through,
and first identify them.

00:23:02.866 --> 00:23:06.200 align:middle line:84%
Get each one of them identified
so we can look at them.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And then we will talk about
them a little bit deeper.

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:14.100 align:middle line:84%
In order to do that, I'm
going to give them names.

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And the name-- and you'll
understand why I'm giving them

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.820 align:middle line:90%
these names as it progresses.

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:23.550 align:middle line:84%
The first one, the green one,
I'm going to give it an 8

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:27.120 align:middle line:84%
by 10, meaning that
the number of radii

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:32.650 align:middle line:84%
across the green square is
8, and the number of radii

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:36.240 align:middle line:84%
across circle that forms
the phi ratio is 10.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.260 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to call
that an 8 by 10.

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.266 align:middle line:90%
Does everybody get that?

00:23:40.266 --> 00:23:42.500 align:middle line:90%
Anybody not get it?

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:43.490 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:45.830 align:middle line:84%
The next one will be a
10 by 12, because there's

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:50.540 align:middle line:84%
10 radii across the square, and
12 radii across the circle that

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.700 align:middle line:90%
sort of forms a phi ratio.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:59.130 align:middle line:84%
The blue and is 14 by 18,
which is Christ consciousness.

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:05.520 align:middle line:10%
Now the first one, the 8 by
10, there's different ways

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:10.230 align:middle line:10%
that you can construct this
to get a perfect 8 by 10.

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:14.300 align:middle line:10%
And I started to--
I was just beginning

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:17.180 align:middle line:10%
to conceive of a way to do
it, when Thoth just said,

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:19.242 align:middle line:10%
look, let me just
tell you a way.

00:24:19.242 --> 00:24:22.170 align:middle line:84%
He says, it took us a long
time to figure this one out.

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:23.250 align:middle line:90%
And he showed me this.

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:24.960 align:middle line:90%
This is not mine.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:28.700 align:middle line:84%
But it's brilliant, it's
absolutely brilliant.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:34.900 align:middle line:84%
You take an x down circle,
you run Vesica Pisces

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:38.310 align:middle line:84%
down the circle in this
particular pattern.

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:39.620 align:middle line:90%
It makes an 8 by 10 perfectly.

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And you can measure
it without-- all

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:44.390 align:middle line:84%
you do is where the Vesica
Pisces-- you run lines

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:46.730 align:middle line:84%
down the center where
the Vesica Pisces is,

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:51.090 align:middle line:84%
and where they touch, which
will make parallel lines.

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:57.298 align:middle line:84%
And then you make parallel
lines running this way,

00:24:57.298 --> 00:24:59.100 align:middle line:90%
like this running down.

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:00.725 align:middle line:84%
When you do, you
come up with this.

00:25:00.725 --> 00:25:04.239 align:middle line:90%


00:25:04.239 --> 00:25:05.530 align:middle line:90%
You can see the grid behind it.

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:07.250 align:middle line:90%
And it'll be exactly an 8 by 10.

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:09.390 align:middle line:84%
Each one of these
things comes down

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:11.880 align:middle line:90%
and forms exactly 8 across here.

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:16.200 align:middle line:84%
But you know that it's a 10,
because you see this Vesica

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.620 align:middle line:90%
Pisces that extends out here?

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.890 align:middle line:84%
Half of it is in here, and
forms one of the squares.

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And the other half comes out and
tells you where the circle is.

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:30.830 align:middle line:84%
So you know you've got a perfect
8 by 10, without any measuring

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:32.890 align:middle line:90%
sticks or anything.

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And then you look
inside of here.

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:38.270 align:middle line:84%
Remember, though I did not
get into this in great detail,

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:42.050 align:middle line:84%
there is a book called
"Sacred Geometry,"

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:44.300 align:middle line:84%
by Robert Lawlor,
which is a really

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:45.620 align:middle line:90%
good book of sacred geometry.

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And I've got the thing on
where you can get this from.

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:52.505 align:middle line:84%
And in there he
will talk about it,

00:25:52.505 --> 00:25:55.746 align:middle line:84%
though there are a lot of other
sources that will talk about.

00:25:55.746 --> 00:25:58.200 align:middle line:84%
That the philosophy
of Egypt was reduced

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.515 align:middle line:84%
to the square root of 2, square
root of 3, square root of 5,

00:26:01.515 --> 00:26:04.076 align:middle line:90%
and 3-4-5 triangle.

00:26:04.076 --> 00:26:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And all of those sacred
angles and the 3-4-5

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:11.570 align:middle line:84%
are here at one moment,
which any time you

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:14.000 align:middle line:84%
see all that stuff
up here at one time,

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.480 align:middle line:84%
you know you've got
something real going on.

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.353 align:middle line:84%
For example, the diagonal
that runs across here

00:26:20.353 --> 00:26:22.240 align:middle line:90%
is the square root of 2.

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by the square
root of 2 is just this.

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:27.780 align:middle line:90%


00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Just so you understand
real quickly,

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:40.630 align:middle line:84%
if you count this as 1, and
count this as a, just set as a.

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:43.810 align:middle line:84%
Then we know that
a squared equals

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:48.750 align:middle line:90%
1 squared plus 1 squared.

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:54.240 align:middle line:84%
Or a squared equal-- that
should be an equal-- equals 1

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:59.545 align:middle line:84%
plus 1, which equals 2, or a
equals the square root of 2.

00:26:59.545 --> 00:27:02.630 align:middle line:90%


00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:09.990 align:middle line:84%
So this is a square
root of 2, diagonal.

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:13.020 align:middle line:90%


00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And the square
root of 5 is simply

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:21.450 align:middle line:84%
this shape, two
squares together,

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:28.570 align:middle line:84%
which is the Fibonacci, 1
over the shape of the King's

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:29.410 align:middle line:90%
Chamber.

00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:31.415 align:middle line:84%
If this is 1, and this
is 1, and this is 1,

00:27:31.415 --> 00:27:37.220 align:middle line:84%
and you're looking for that
diagonal, and this is a.

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:39.830 align:middle line:90%
Then a equals 1.

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And this equals 2, 1 plus-- so a
squared equals, 1 squared is 1,

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:54.800 align:middle line:84%
and 2 squared is
4, which equals 5.

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:58.950 align:middle line:84%
So a equals the
square root of 5.

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:02.990 align:middle line:84%
That's the other sacred
angle, the square root of 2,

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:04.590 align:middle line:90%
the square root of 5.

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:13.406 align:middle line:84%
And the square root of 3 is the
golden mean across that one,

00:28:13.406 --> 00:28:16.820 align:middle line:90%
a little more complex.

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.980 align:middle line:90%
So they're all here at once.

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:20.460 align:middle line:84%
Here's the line
coming down here,

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:21.800 align:middle line:90%
which is the square root of 2.

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:25.020 align:middle line:84%
If you come from this
point to this point,

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:28.590 align:middle line:84%
if you count four of
these squares as one,

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:29.520 align:middle line:90%
then there's your one.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.910 align:middle line:90%
And you've got 8 going this way.

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:33.230 align:middle line:90%
So that's 1 and that's 2.

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:35.410 align:middle line:90%
So that's the square root of 5.

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And then in the middle around
one of the Vesica Pisces,

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:42.430 align:middle line:84%
you have a rectangle, which
produces the square root of 3.

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:45.590 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit
more hard to explain.

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And then you have a 3-4-5
triangle inscribed in here.

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:51.260 align:middle line:84%
If you count two
of these squares

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:54.370 align:middle line:84%
as you're measuring stick
of 1, then this will be 1,

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:59.370 align:middle line:84%
2-- see this triangle that's
inscribed perfectly in here?

00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:03.310 align:middle line:90%
Well this edge will be 1, 2, 3.

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And this edge will
be 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:12.620 align:middle line:84%
3, 4, and by Pythagorean
rule that has to be 5.

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:15.380 align:middle line:84%
So you have a 3-4-5 triangle
inscribed perfectly.

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:21.330 align:middle line:84%
All the sacred things are
here in one place at one time.

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And all these kinds
of synchronicities,

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:26.900 align:middle line:84%
if you notice the
circle will precisely

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:32.600 align:middle line:84%
hit these precise edges,
all these perfect moving

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.757 align:middle line:90%
lines that go in there.

00:29:34.757 --> 00:29:36.590 align:middle line:84%
One more thing, which
is kind of funny here,

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:39.590 align:middle line:84%
you see this circle
and this eye in here.

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:41.921 align:middle line:90%
You see the-- it's the CBS eye.

00:29:41.921 --> 00:29:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Actually when we
go to the next one,

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:45.490 align:middle line:90%
you'll see the blur over here.

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:49.020 align:middle line:90%
And this is the same one again.

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:54.080 align:middle line:84%
There's a symbol for
CBS, which whoever

00:29:54.080 --> 00:30:00.490 align:middle line:84%
did that had something going for
them when they understood that.

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:03.240 align:middle line:90%
And that literally is an eye.

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.230 align:middle line:90%
It's a lens.

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:07.320 align:middle line:84%
It's a lens that the
aberrational interprets reality

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:08.690 align:middle line:90%
through.

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And so here you start seeing
all the synchronicities you just

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:12.930 align:middle line:90%
saw.

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And you see how the white
light spiral reflects

00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:18.450 align:middle line:84%
inside of there, a black light
spiral reflects perfectly,

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:19.830 align:middle line:90%
which we saw later.

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:22.515 align:middle line:84%
It will just precisely
tip the edge over there,

00:30:22.515 --> 00:30:27.260 align:middle line:84%
and all these kinds of things,
these amazing motions of lines

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:31.550 align:middle line:84%
that happen from this first
level of consciousness.

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:32.350 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:33.740 align:middle line:90%
Now we got that one.

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:37.230 align:middle line:90%


00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:43.740 align:middle line:84%
That one of 64 squares-- first
level has 64 squares in it--

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:50.300 align:middle line:84%
is related to another one that
we saw earlier of 64 squares.

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's related
to another drawing

00:30:53.880 --> 00:31:00.120 align:middle line:84%
we saw of Leonardo's, which is
where that other one came from.

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And so at this point,
you can superimpose.

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:08.280 align:middle line:84%
So this page was not flat
when the copier came on.

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:11.210 align:middle line:84%
You can start superimposing
all kinds of patterns

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:14.190 align:middle line:84%
over Leonardo's drawing
all at one time.

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:16.960 align:middle line:90%


00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.480 align:middle line:84%
You've got a lot of
stuff going on here now.

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:24.280 align:middle line:84%
But all those 64 squares,
and the first level

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:27.050 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, and all these
other things are all on there.

00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Notice also that here is
the eight cell division.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And you can clearly see
now how the proportions

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:38.530 align:middle line:84%
of the adult human being are
contained in the original eight

00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:42.680 align:middle line:84%
cells, before it ever
even got to be adult.

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.639 align:middle line:90%
That it's all in there.

00:31:44.639 --> 00:31:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And then you start seeing the
black and white spiral motions,

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:48.263 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of other things.

00:31:48.263 --> 00:31:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And you can superimpose
so many things over there

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:54.470 align:middle line:84%
that you can't even begin
to see it after a while.

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:55.390 align:middle line:90%
And it's all there.

00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:59.540 align:middle line:84%
These are all just some of the
energy fields around the body.

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:01.560 align:middle line:90%
And they're so complex.

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:05.885 align:middle line:84%
There's so many of them, it just
becomes like a light coming off

00:32:05.885 --> 00:32:07.520 align:middle line:90%
of this after a while.

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:10.230 align:middle line:90%


00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:13.230 align:middle line:84%
But what this means is,
is that we've always

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:16.420 align:middle line:84%
thought that this drawing
of Leonardo is us.

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:18.400 align:middle line:90%
It's not us.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.600 align:middle line:90%
It's the first level.

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:21.625 align:middle line:90%
It's where we came from.

00:32:21.625 --> 00:32:22.425 align:middle line:90%
It's our past.

00:32:22.425 --> 00:32:24.940 align:middle line:90%


00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:26.470 align:middle line:90%
It's our past.

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:28.950 align:middle line:90%
It's not the first level.

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:32.390 align:middle line:84%
It's not the second
level that we're on now.

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:37.270 align:middle line:84%
When I saw this, and realized
this here, my first inclination

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:42.900 align:middle line:84%
was, well did Leonardo
understand what

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:45.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm being taught through Thoth?

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:49.350 align:middle line:84%
He was amazing and
all this stuff.

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:50.940 align:middle line:90%
Is that how he got this?

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:53.660 align:middle line:84%
These were the thoughts that
were going through my mind.

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And so I started looking
through all of Leonardo works,

00:32:57.050 --> 00:33:00.610 align:middle line:84%
and went very deeply
through everything

00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:04.100 align:middle line:90%
that I could find on Leonardo.

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:06.220 align:middle line:84%
To looking for another--
see if this was an 8

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:10.390 align:middle line:84%
by 10, what I was looking
for was a 10 by 12, or a 14

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:15.330 align:middle line:84%
by 18, to see if Leonardo had
another one of the pieces.

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:17.940 align:middle line:84%
Because this could
just be a coincidence.

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:20.620 align:middle line:84%
This could be just
a coincidence.

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:26.510 align:middle line:84%
But if I did find a 10
by 12 or a 14 by 18,

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:29.346 align:middle line:84%
then that would be
kind of start going

00:33:29.346 --> 00:33:30.470 align:middle line:90%
outside of the coincidence.

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:32.094 align:middle line:84%
Because you could
make any kind of grid

00:33:32.094 --> 00:33:36.757 align:middle line:84%
in there to make a human
canon, in all kinds of ratios.

00:33:36.757 --> 00:33:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And so I looked and
looked and looked,

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:39.920 align:middle line:90%
and I never could find it.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:43.730 align:middle line:90%
And then one day it struck me.

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:46.471 align:middle line:84%
Well, this wasn't Leonardo's
drawing in the first place.

00:33:46.471 --> 00:33:47.970 align:middle line:84%
It came from his
teacher, Vitruvius.

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:51.120 align:middle line:90%


00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:54.692 align:middle line:10%
And then I thought,
well, once I realized

00:33:54.692 --> 00:33:56.650 align:middle line:10%
that Vitruvius was his
teacher, but his teacher

00:33:56.650 --> 00:33:58.410 align:middle line:10%
lived 200 years earlier.

00:33:58.410 --> 00:33:59.650 align:middle line:90%
His teacher was dead.

00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And so I then went
back and started

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:05.200 align:middle line:90%
studying Vitruvius's work.

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.330 align:middle line:84%
Vitruvius was his
primary instructor

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:08.699 align:middle line:90%
on this kind of work.

00:34:08.699 --> 00:34:10.600 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this drawing,
right in the book,

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.610 align:middle line:84%
it says write down here that
these are the human proportions

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:16.290 align:middle line:90%
after Vitruvius.

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:18.408 align:middle line:84%
And so I studied all
of Vitruvius's stuff

00:34:18.408 --> 00:34:19.699 align:middle line:90%
to see what was going on there.

00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:22.627 align:middle line:84%
And I started going through
all of his stuff, and bingo.

00:34:22.627 --> 00:34:23.460 align:middle line:90%
Here's this drawing.

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:25.350 align:middle line:90%
At first I didn't see it.

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:26.770 align:middle line:90%
It was a human canon.

00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:27.870 align:middle line:90%
And I'll show it to you.

00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden it
popped out, and I saw it.

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:35.300 align:middle line:84%
Here's the 10 by 12, two of
the three pieces were found.

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'll show it
to you in a moment.

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And then I highly suspected that
the same kind of information

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:47.010 align:middle line:84%
was not just something
that Thoth-- was new.

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:50.695 align:middle line:84%
But this was something that
it was a body of information

00:34:50.695 --> 00:34:52.969 align:middle line:84%
that had been kept on the
earth for a long time.

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:55.560 align:middle line:90%


00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to slowly bring
you to that level right

00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:59.830 align:middle line:90%
now in just a moment.

00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:04.250 align:middle line:84%
This is another way to lay
the Vesica Pisces down an axis

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:06.740 align:middle line:84%
a different way, which will
produce the second level

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:07.870 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:10.010 align:middle line:10%
Again, you do the same
thing, drawing your lines

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:13.200 align:middle line:10%
along the Vesica Piscis,
using your Vesica Pisces

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.040 align:middle line:10%
as an underlying grid.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:18.380 align:middle line:10%
And it comes up with this one.

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And again you can
see, only now here's

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:24.280 align:middle line:84%
your Vesica Pisces
overextends, and you

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.790 align:middle line:84%
can see that half of it's
on one side, half of it's

00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:27.660 align:middle line:90%
on the other.

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:28.535 align:middle line:90%
And you can count it.

00:35:28.535 --> 00:35:32.050 align:middle line:84%
There will be 10 this way, and
12 running across this way.

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:34.130 align:middle line:90%
So it's a 10 by 12, 100 squares.

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:36.650 align:middle line:90%


00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:42.170 align:middle line:84%
It could be why there's
100 squares in this thing.

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And the King's Chamber,
as we're going to see,

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:48.140 align:middle line:84%
this just struck me right
now, I never realized this

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:54.500 align:middle line:84%
until this minute, the King's
Chamber is one of these guys.

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And it is made for our
level of consciousness.

00:35:58.550 --> 00:36:00.410 align:middle line:90%
It sits on the floor level.

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:04.350 align:middle line:84%
You'll see it in a moment the
very high level of stones that

00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:07.120 align:middle line:84%
sits in there is another proof,
which I'll have to come up

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:08.870 align:middle line:84%
with in a minute that
they were referring

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:10.600 align:middle line:90%
to our level of consciousness.

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:14.045 align:middle line:84%
But the number of stones that
the King's Chamber is made out

00:36:14.045 --> 00:36:16.380 align:middle line:90%
of is exactly 100 stones.

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:19.150 align:middle line:84%
I never realized that until now
that it corresponded with this.

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:22.600 align:middle line:90%


00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:27.117 align:middle line:84%
Record that in there,
I guess I just did.

00:36:27.117 --> 00:36:29.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to tell you what
all this other stuff is, except

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:30.660 align:middle line:90%
for one thing.

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:34.070 align:middle line:90%
I will tell you in a moment.

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:36.290 align:middle line:84%
The four squares that
are around the body,

00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:38.160 align:middle line:84%
the center of the body
that are a reflection

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:41.820 align:middle line:84%
of the original
eight cells, when

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:45.730 align:middle line:84%
I tried to put in these-- I
took the original four squares

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:46.530 align:middle line:90%
out of here.

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And I started putting
the spirals in there.

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:50.150 align:middle line:90%
And it just goes all over.

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:51.590 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:53.226 align:middle line:84%
And Thoth watched
me for a while,

00:36:53.226 --> 00:36:55.530 align:middle line:84%
and watched me for a while,
and he's sitting there

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:56.990 align:middle line:90%
with a grin on his face.

00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And I says, what
are grinning for?

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well,
you're probably not going

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:04.110 align:middle line:90%
to get that this afternoon.

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:05.470 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what do you mean?

00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:09.190 align:middle line:84%
He says, well it took us about
10,000 years to figure it out.

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think I'll
just tell you, OK?

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:16.996 align:middle line:84%
And I would have probably
not figured it out.

00:37:16.996 --> 00:37:19.510 align:middle line:90%
The ratios change.

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:23.470 align:middle line:84%
The original four squares
around the first level

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:28.300 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, if I was
assuming that this was 1,

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:30.770 align:middle line:90%
but it's not 1, it's 1 squared.

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:33.274 align:middle line:90%
Of course, 1 squared equals 1.

00:37:33.274 --> 00:37:35.190 align:middle line:84%
So how in the heck do
you know the difference?

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:37.170 align:middle line:84%
There's no way to visually
tell the difference.

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:38.711 align:middle line:84%
And so when you come
to the next one,

00:37:38.711 --> 00:37:40.340 align:middle line:84%
in order to make
the energies work,

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:43.060 align:middle line:84%
you have to take--
you don't go 2,

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:45.960 align:middle line:84%
but you go to 2
squared, which is 4.

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And you must take four
squares as your base.

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:52.460 align:middle line:84%
So that the diagonal
of four squares,

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:55.080 align:middle line:84%
which is across two of
them rather than one,

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:56.730 align:middle line:90%
becomes your key.

00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:57.830 align:middle line:90%
And so I did that.

00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And so it goes 1, 1,
2, which exactly hits

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:05.850 align:middle line:84%
the apex at this point
up here, and leaves.

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And everything, all the
synchronicity hits again.

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:11.280 align:middle line:90%


00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And we'll explain what all
this is in just a moment.

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'll come back
to this as well.

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:19.730 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, this is
the eyeball that we

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:22.850 align:middle line:84%
use as a lens to interpret
our reality with.

00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:25.950 align:middle line:90%
And it is the second level.

00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:28.430 align:middle line:84%
But I'll come back to
that in just a moment.

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:35.308 align:middle line:84%
And this is Vitruvius's--
that's kind of funny to say--

00:38:35.308 --> 00:38:40.130 align:middle line:84%
Vitruvius's canon
of the human body.

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And at first it does not
look like a 10 by 12.

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:46.620 align:middle line:84%
Because it's got a whole
lot of squares in there.

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:50.520 align:middle line:84%
But if you notice, he
put these heavy dots

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:55.370 align:middle line:84%
on certain ones, which makes
a larger square grid hidden

00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:56.660 align:middle line:90%
underneath there.

00:38:56.660 --> 00:39:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And so if you count them, you'll
see that there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

00:39:01.850 --> 00:39:06.005 align:middle line:90%
6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:39:06.005 --> 00:39:10.970 align:middle line:84%
A 100 grid is hidden
underneath there.

00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And there's this-- it
looks like a Vesica Pisces,

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:19.460 align:middle line:84%
but if you actually
create it, it is not.

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:22.320 align:middle line:84%
The centers won't
meet with each other.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:26.470 align:middle line:84%
It's a constructed pattern
that is a key that if you then

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:30.380 align:middle line:84%
put a compass onto from the
center place to that place,

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:33.550 align:middle line:84%
and spin it, and
spin it around, it

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:35.210 align:middle line:84%
will form a circle
that will precisely

00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:38.100 align:middle line:84%
hit the longest
finger and forms a 10

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:40.120 align:middle line:90%
by 12 pattern around there.

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:43.460 align:middle line:84%
So he had it hidden
secretly behind there.

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:46.240 align:middle line:10%
And there are a lot of real
interesting things about this.

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:51.450 align:middle line:10%
He has this diamond pattern
here around there like that.

00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:53.150 align:middle line:84%
The diamond pattern
is also the key.

00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:54.940 align:middle line:90%
Remember the second level?

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:57.536 align:middle line:84%
The way that you--
remember you had

00:39:57.536 --> 00:40:00.004 align:middle line:84%
the three squares,
and the middle square,

00:40:00.004 --> 00:40:00.920 align:middle line:90%
which is where we are.

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:02.378 align:middle line:84%
To get to the Christ
consciousness,

00:40:02.378 --> 00:40:05.660 align:middle line:90%
you rotate it to a diamond.

00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And so the first
one goes like this.

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:08.460 align:middle line:90%
The second one goes like that.

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:11.350 align:middle line:90%
And the next one goes like this.

00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:15.980 align:middle line:90%
And I heard one wow back there.

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:25.080 align:middle line:90%


00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:30.310 align:middle line:84%
You'll see some
more things here.

00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:33.780 align:middle line:84%
The first level of
consciousness goes like this.

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:38.705 align:middle line:90%
The second one goes like that.

00:40:38.705 --> 00:40:40.916 align:middle line:84%
And the third one
goes like this.

00:40:40.916 --> 00:40:46.150 align:middle line:90%


00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's like the faces
of the cube equilibrium

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:55.980 align:middle line:90%
that he felt was so important.

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And so they even had
that hidden behind there,

00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:01.520 align:middle line:84%
even though it doesn't
really correspond

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:04.437 align:middle line:90%
with a whole lot in there.

00:41:04.437 --> 00:41:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I
want you to just notice

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:11.980 align:middle line:84%
is that each one of these
squares that is in there

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:13.290 align:middle line:90%
contains nine squares.

00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:18.962 align:middle line:90%


00:41:18.962 --> 00:41:20.670 align:middle line:84%
So just remember the
thing about the nine

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:21.880 align:middle line:90%
squares and the diamond.

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:24.680 align:middle line:84%
Because we're going to come
back to both of those details

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:25.480 align:middle line:90%
a little later.

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:28.090 align:middle line:90%


00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:31.650 align:middle line:10%
When I was working, I
got two of the pieces

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:35.500 align:middle line:10%
from two consecutive, from
Vitruvius and Leonardo,

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:38.020 align:middle line:10%
a student and disciple
in the same school.

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And Vitruvius, by the way, was
the Master Mason in Europe.

00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:46.070 align:middle line:84%
He was the one that made many
of these incredible cathedrals

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:47.420 align:middle line:90%
in Europe.

00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:53.410 align:middle line:84%
He was a super, super
person in olden days.

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:58.770 align:middle line:84%
But I never had any
absolute definite tied down

00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:01.660 align:middle line:84%
perfect proof that this was
true that these guys really

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:04.450 align:middle line:84%
understood what Thoth
was trying to teach me,

00:42:04.450 --> 00:42:08.630 align:middle line:84%
until about a year and a
half ago, or something.

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:11.570 align:middle line:84%
I gave a workshop
in Long Island.

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:15.574 align:middle line:84%
And I gave two back to back,
which I don't do anymore.

00:42:15.574 --> 00:42:19.120 align:middle line:84%
One weekend, and one the next
one, it totally wipes me out.

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:20.590 align:middle line:90%
It's not fair to the people.

00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:22.631 align:middle line:84%
Because by the time I get
done with these things,

00:42:22.631 --> 00:42:24.322 align:middle line:90%
I'm pretty tired.

00:42:24.322 --> 00:42:25.280 align:middle line:90%
But anyway, I did that.

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:26.680 align:middle line:90%
And I was sitting there.

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:28.750 align:middle line:90%
I had some time in between.

00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And so I was hanging out in this
house that had a big library.

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And in the library,
here's this big old book

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.450 align:middle line:90%
that I'd never seen before.

00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And it was called
"The Unpublished

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:44.140 align:middle line:84%
Works of Leonardo da Vinci,"
stuff that nobody thought

00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:45.265 align:middle line:90%
was important.

00:42:45.265 --> 00:42:48.036 align:middle line:84%
Because it was just sketches
and stuff like this.

00:42:48.036 --> 00:42:49.737 align:middle line:84%
It never made it to
anything like that.

00:42:49.737 --> 00:42:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking, wow, it's
something I've never seen.

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:53.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm going through this book.

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And I go to this one
chapter, and I just

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:57.766 align:middle line:84%
couldn't believe it,
what was in this chapter.

00:42:57.766 --> 00:42:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And the people
who wrote the book

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:02.102 align:middle line:84%
had no idea what it was
about, nothing at all.

00:43:02.102 --> 00:43:04.520 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know.

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:08.190 align:middle line:84%
This is Leonardo's drawing
of the flower of life,

00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:09.980 align:middle line:90%
extended out.

00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote extensively
about the flower of life,

00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:17.260 align:middle line:90%
not just a little bit.

00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:20.980 align:middle line:84%
He had all kinds of drawings,
showing for this sacred pattern

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:23.730 align:middle line:84%
in here and how all
the different patterns

00:43:23.730 --> 00:43:26.530 align:middle line:84%
that were hidden inside of
there, the relationships

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:28.940 align:middle line:90%
of triangles inside of there.

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:30.800 align:middle line:84%
All this various stuff,
the seed of life,

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.550 align:middle line:84%
everything else, these
were all the things

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:34.800 align:middle line:84%
that you'd find in
the walls at Abydos,

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:37.349 align:middle line:90%
on this temple over there.

00:43:37.349 --> 00:43:39.140 align:middle line:84%
It almost looks like
the same kind of stuff

00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:41.370 align:middle line:84%
that they were doing on
those walls over there.

00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:45.295 align:middle line:84%
And if that isn't
enough, he had pages

00:43:45.295 --> 00:43:48.610 align:middle line:84%
of showing all of the angles
and possibilities that

00:43:48.610 --> 00:43:51.430 align:middle line:84%
were contained in there, and
the rotational patterns that

00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:54.150 align:middle line:84%
were contained in
the flower of life.

00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:56.340 align:middle line:84%
You can see the spinning
rotations and patterns that

00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:58.990 align:middle line:90%
were down here and over here.

00:43:58.990 --> 00:44:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And he had pages of this
stuff going on and on and on.

00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And it was the book's belief
that all the inventions

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.550 align:middle line:84%
that Leonardo had come up
with, with all the gear

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:10.860 align:middle line:90%
ratios and all the things.

00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:13.850 align:middle line:84%
Because he was the first one
to invent all this stuff.

00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Though they didn't
understand it,

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:17.720 align:middle line:84%
they believed that it was
through these drawings

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:22.210 align:middle line:84%
somehow that he had come up with
these ratios and everything.

00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:24.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, if he understood
the flower of life,

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:27.860 align:middle line:84%
and you want to apply it to
mechanics or anything else,

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:29.190 align:middle line:90%
it makes everything easy.

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:32.850 align:middle line:84%
No wonder he was
considered a genius.

00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:36.260 align:middle line:84%
Because he understood the
underlying patterns of reality

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:37.060 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:41.400 align:middle line:90%


00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Anybody-- it turns
anybody into that.

00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:49.230 align:middle line:84%
So after I saw that, I mean I
don't know what you guys think.

00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:51.930 align:middle line:90%
But there's no doubt in my mind.

00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:54.570 align:middle line:84%
He was heading down
the exact same pathway

00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:56.480 align:middle line:84%
that we are in this
room right now.

00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>>Maybe he had a
teacher like you.

00:44:58.970 --> 00:44:59.770 align:middle line:90%
>>Huh?

00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:02.120 align:middle line:84%
>>Maybe he had a
teacher like you.

00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.000 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, he had Vitruvius.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.840 align:middle line:84%
He had all of Vitruvius's
works and everything.

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:08.490 align:middle line:90%
And that's what he was studying.

00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:11.760 align:middle line:84%
Plus he was a Mason, which
it was through the Masons

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:13.260 align:middle line:90%
that he got that.

00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:16.726 align:middle line:84%
And he had all that
information there.

00:45:16.726 --> 00:45:18.850 align:middle line:84%
But I just didn't realize
that the Masons had this.

00:45:18.850 --> 00:45:21.184 align:middle line:84%
But yet when I
talk to that guy--

00:45:21.184 --> 00:45:22.600 align:middle line:84%
when I talked to
the guy that came

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:26.940 align:middle line:84%
into my room that was a
Mason, I was asking him

00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:28.190 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of questions.

00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:32.415 align:middle line:84%
And he just kept
saying, I don't know.

00:45:32.415 --> 00:45:36.900 align:middle line:84%
I think that we have lost a
whole lot in present day time.

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:39.722 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the Masons
know a lot of this anymore.

00:45:39.722 --> 00:45:40.680 align:middle line:90%
Although maybe they do.

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:42.520 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to discredit them.

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:45.520 align:middle line:84%
But I just have a feeling that
a lot of this has been lost.

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:51.480 align:middle line:84%
I have been searching for the
Canon of Christ consciousness,

00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:53.450 align:middle line:90%
which they must have.

00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:55.870 align:middle line:10%
But as I was searching
for it, I suddenly

00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:57.180 align:middle line:10%
started getting discouraged.

00:45:57.180 --> 00:46:01.340 align:middle line:10%
Because I realized
that if they did

00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:06.430 align:middle line:10%
have-- I mean these guys
built these massive churches

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:08.020 align:middle line:10%
to Christ.

00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:11.430 align:middle line:84%
This was the most holy
sacred work of their life.

00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And if they did have the
sacred geometry of Christ

00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:17.045 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, they're
not going to have

00:46:17.045 --> 00:46:20.270 align:middle line:90%
it laying around somewhere.

00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:24.460 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be locked
up in gold boxes,

00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:28.480 align:middle line:84%
and buried 80 feet into
the ground or somewhere.

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:31.542 align:middle line:84%
And I'm probably not going
to find it very easily.

00:46:31.542 --> 00:46:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And I've never been
able-- and I've

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.958 align:middle line:84%
looked through everything
I can, and I've never

00:46:34.958 --> 00:46:36.100 align:middle line:90%
been able to find it.

00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:37.734 align:middle line:90%
But this is it right here.

00:46:37.734 --> 00:46:39.775 align:middle line:84%
>>I read that somewhere
that the rest of the work

00:46:39.775 --> 00:46:42.190 align:middle line:90%
is in the Vatican locked up.

00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:43.052 align:middle line:90%
>>Of who's work?

00:46:43.052 --> 00:46:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>>Leonardo's.

00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:46.950 align:middle line:84%
>>She said she read that the
rest of the work of Leonardo da

00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:49.270 align:middle line:84%
Vinci was locked
up in the Vatican.

00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:50.310 align:middle line:90%
That would make sense.

00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:53.100 align:middle line:90%


00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:54.960 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:57.540 align:middle line:84%
>>As I understand it,
from studying the Masons--

00:46:57.540 --> 00:47:00.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm not one-- you
don't get the knowledge

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:01.390 align:middle line:90%
until your 33rd degree.

00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Did the guy who
walked in your room,

00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:04.300 align:middle line:90%
was he a 33rd degree Mason?

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:05.841 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, I don't know
if this is true,

00:47:05.841 --> 00:47:07.380 align:middle line:84%
but I have talked
to people that are

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:09.850 align:middle line:90%
33 degree, who have seen this.

00:47:09.850 --> 00:47:12.627 align:middle line:84%
And said that this was--
they had never got--

00:47:12.627 --> 00:47:13.960 align:middle line:90%
received anything on this level.

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:14.340 align:middle line:90%
>>Really?

00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Because I know Walt
Disney was one.

00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:16.588 align:middle line:90%
I mean there are people who--

00:47:16.588 --> 00:47:17.820 align:middle line:90%
>>That makes sense too.

00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:20.450 align:middle line:84%
He actually did a sacred
geometry Donald Duck movie.

00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:24.851 align:middle line:90%


00:47:24.851 --> 00:47:28.280 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:30.430 align:middle line:90%
This is a cube, quack, quack.

00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:32.930 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:38.430 align:middle line:90%


00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:40.134 align:middle line:84%
There's more than
one Donald Duck?

00:47:40.134 --> 00:47:41.300 align:middle line:90%
She asked which Donald Duck.

00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:41.690 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:42.475 align:middle line:90%
Which Donald Duck movie?

00:47:42.475 --> 00:47:43.368 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh.

00:47:43.368 --> 00:47:44.862 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:47:44.862 --> 00:47:47.130 align:middle line:90%
>>Donald Duck in Mathmagic Land.

00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:49.080 align:middle line:90%
Donald Duck in Mathmagical Land?

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:50.620 align:middle line:90%
>>Mathmagic Land.

00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:51.752 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, Mathmagic Land.

00:47:51.752 --> 00:47:55.420 align:middle line:90%


00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:57.090 align:middle line:90%
Well anyway, this is it.

00:47:57.090 --> 00:47:58.450 align:middle line:90%
And you can go straight to it.

00:47:58.450 --> 00:48:00.930 align:middle line:84%
Because you've got all
nine concentric circles,

00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:02.720 align:middle line:84%
and it automatically
makes the grids.

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:05.970 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to go
through that complex before.

00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing is that one

00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:12.290 align:middle line:84%
that forms this one that
makes the grid around the body

00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:14.870 align:middle line:84%
is not 1 square, but 2
square, but 3 square, which

00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:16.670 align:middle line:90%
is 9 squares.

00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And remember on Vitruvius's
thing, every one of the squares

00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:21.430 align:middle line:90%
had nine squares in there.

00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:23.700 align:middle line:84%
Again, one of the
keys showing how,

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:26.330 align:middle line:84%
it was the key that
linked up to the next one.

00:48:26.330 --> 00:48:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And so nine squares is
the key to that one.

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And then so you have to
go across three squares

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:36.500 align:middle line:84%
to get to your yardstick of
1 to make everything work.

00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And again, three,
three perfectly

00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:42.250 align:middle line:84%
touching the apex
that they are leaving.

00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is Christ
consciousness here.

00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:46.720 align:middle line:84%
It's the lens that
the next third level

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:50.710 align:middle line:90%
interprets the reality through.

00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:56.110 align:middle line:84%
Now this next drawing
is not completely mine.

00:48:56.110 --> 00:48:57.360 align:middle line:90%
And I really don't know.

00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:01.410 align:middle line:84%
I want to give credit
for who did this.

00:49:01.410 --> 00:49:04.350 align:middle line:84%
Though I don't know who did
it, because so many people

00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:06.170 align:middle line:84%
have tried to take
credit for this.

00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:08.259 align:middle line:84%
Elizabeth Clare Prophet
said it was hers.

00:49:08.259 --> 00:49:10.550 align:middle line:84%
But it couldn't have been
hers, because James Blair had

00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:12.140 align:middle line:90%
done it 10 years earlier.

00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And he doesn't claim
that it is his.

00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And he says that he got it
from a much earlier source.

00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:22.910 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know where
the source came from.

00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:25.729 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it goes back to
Egypt or somewhere like that.

00:49:25.729 --> 00:49:28.020 align:middle line:84%
But what you're about to see,
if you've never seen this

00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:29.978 align:middle line:84%
before-- most of you have
seen this on a video,

00:49:29.978 --> 00:49:31.990 align:middle line:84%
but if you've never
seen this before,

00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:36.940 align:middle line:84%
this is a rather
remarkable piece of work.

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:40.200 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take these
three pieces that you just saw

00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:42.180 align:middle line:84%
and superimpose them
over this drawing

00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:45.160 align:middle line:84%
that you're about to
see, this new one.

00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:47.850 align:middle line:84%
But if you would
carefully-- and I

00:49:47.850 --> 00:49:49.270 align:middle line:90%
want to make a thing about this.

00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:52.430 align:middle line:90%


00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:56.740 align:middle line:84%
In this drawing I did not draw
it to precise proportions.

00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:58.880 align:middle line:84%
Though I know what the
precise proportions are.

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:00.180 align:middle line:90%
And I have drawn the drawing.

00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think I got
them back here.

00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:03.870 align:middle line:90%
I thought I put them in there.

00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:05.970 align:middle line:90%
We'll see if I did in a moment.

00:50:05.970 --> 00:50:14.680 align:middle line:84%
But if not, the proportions
are ever so slightly different.

00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And what I would like
to do is just strictly

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:19.450 align:middle line:84%
follow where I'm showing
you on the screen,

00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:22.030 align:middle line:84%
so that we can make
some sense out of this.

00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:27.240 align:middle line:84%
That is first of all, you see
the red grid of the eight cell

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:30.380 align:middle line:90%
division, this guy.

00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:33.270 align:middle line:90%
Everybody see that around here?

00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:34.880 align:middle line:90%
There's the eight cells.

00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:37.470 align:middle line:84%
There's the square that
fits around the eight cells.

00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:43.050 align:middle line:84%
The dotted line is the inner
surface of the zona pellucida.

00:50:43.050 --> 00:50:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And the solid line will
be the outer surface

00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:48.110 align:middle line:84%
to the zona pellucida,
or the place

00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:51.010 align:middle line:90%
that it goes into phi ratio.

00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:53.919 align:middle line:84%
And now, of course
at the same time,

00:50:53.919 --> 00:50:55.460 align:middle line:84%
though I don't have
it drawn on here,

00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:58.130 align:middle line:84%
you've got the human body in
here stretched across here

00:50:58.130 --> 00:50:59.630 align:middle line:90%
like Leonardo.

00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:01.900 align:middle line:84%
So you've got both the
four eight cells division

00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:03.500 align:middle line:90%
and the human body.

00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Now if you take a circle that
this blue one that goes around

00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:09.830 align:middle line:84%
here, it just fits
in from the top

00:51:09.830 --> 00:51:12.490 align:middle line:84%
of the head of the human body
to the bottom of the feet

00:51:12.490 --> 00:51:15.430 align:middle line:84%
of the human body, or
around the square that

00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:19.190 align:middle line:84%
will fit around the original
eight cells, either one.

00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And then you make a circle
that will fit perfectly

00:51:22.570 --> 00:51:27.410 align:middle line:84%
at the phi ratio point up here,
this one up here that will just

00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:29.570 align:middle line:84%
touch this circle
and be originated

00:51:29.570 --> 00:51:31.710 align:middle line:84%
from that place,
which happens to be

00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:34.230 align:middle line:90%
the 13th chakra above your head.

00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:38.910 align:middle line:84%
Then this circle here
and this circle here

00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:43.790 align:middle line:84%
are in the exact proportions
to the planet that we sit on,

00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:48.390 align:middle line:84%
and the moon that
rotates around us.

00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:52.640 align:middle line:84%
Those are the exact,
exact, exact sizes

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:54.910 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth and the Moon.

00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And they are contained
in your proportions,

00:51:58.830 --> 00:52:00.290 align:middle line:90%
or in the original eight cells.

00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And I can prove
it mathematically.

00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:04.700 align:middle line:90%
I'll do that right now.

00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:07.450 align:middle line:84%
Not only are they in
proportion to each other,

00:52:07.450 --> 00:52:10.780 align:middle line:84%
but they are in phi
ratio to each other.

00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:12.712 align:middle line:84%
Because I mean the square
and the circle that

00:52:12.712 --> 00:52:14.920 align:middle line:84%
fits through them are in
the phi ratio to each other.

00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:17.387 align:middle line:90%


00:52:17.387 --> 00:52:19.720 align:middle line:84%
So I can prove that they are
in proportion to each other

00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:24.530 align:middle line:84%
if I use the actual mileage
of the Earth and the Moon,

00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:26.430 align:middle line:84%
and that they are in
proportion to each other

00:52:26.430 --> 00:52:30.660 align:middle line:84%
if I can calculate that the
square-- if you can figure out

00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:33.370 align:middle line:84%
the miles around the square
that would fit around

00:52:33.370 --> 00:52:36.930 align:middle line:84%
the Earth itself
relative to a circle,

00:52:36.930 --> 00:52:40.110 align:middle line:84%
if you put the Moon right
on the surface of the Earth,

00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:42.660 align:middle line:84%
and you could calculate
how many miles

00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:45.430 align:middle line:84%
would go around
this circle here.

00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:48.480 align:middle line:84%
If those two were the same
that would simultaneously

00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:50.220 align:middle line:84%
prove that they
are in phi ratio,

00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:59.357 align:middle line:84%
and also that these proportions
are what I say they are.

00:52:59.357 --> 00:53:00.815 align:middle line:84%
And so it's real
easy to figure out

00:53:00.815 --> 00:53:01.981 align:middle line:90%
the square around the Earth.

00:53:01.981 --> 00:53:04.400 align:middle line:84%
Because all you have to do
is know how many miles are

00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:05.890 align:middle line:90%
in the diameter of the Earth.

00:53:05.890 --> 00:53:09.020 align:middle line:10%
Though the Earth is not
a perfectly round ball,

00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:12.670 align:middle line:10%
there's a slight variation,
you can take an average

00:53:12.670 --> 00:53:15.965 align:middle line:10%
and that average is this.

00:53:15.965 --> 00:53:17.340 align:middle line:10%
The average is,
is that there are

00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:21.760 align:middle line:10%
7,920 miles through the
diameter of the Earth.

00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:24.060 align:middle line:10%
And if you multiply that
times 4 to figure out

00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:29.640 align:middle line:10%
what the square would be,
there are 31,680 miles,

00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:33.850 align:middle line:10%
31,680 miles in this
imaginary square that

00:53:33.850 --> 00:53:35.893 align:middle line:10%
would fit around
the earth or a cube,

00:53:35.893 --> 00:53:38.710 align:middle line:10%
however you want to look at it.

00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:42.000 align:middle line:10%
And if you wanted to
know if the circle that

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:45.905 align:middle line:10%
would fit through the moon
if it was on the surface,

00:53:45.905 --> 00:53:48.660 align:middle line:10%
if the circumference of
this is the same that's

00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:49.765 align:middle line:10%
what you're looking for.

00:53:49.765 --> 00:53:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Then all you have to do is
take the diameter of the Earth

00:53:52.330 --> 00:53:56.680 align:middle line:84%
plus the radius of the Moon,
plus the radius of the Moon.

00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And the two radii
equal the diameter.

00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:01.770 align:middle line:84%
So you just take the diameter
of the Moon, the diameter

00:54:01.770 --> 00:54:03.540 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth, you
add them together,

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:06.550 align:middle line:90%
and you multiply times pi.

00:54:06.550 --> 00:54:09.490 align:middle line:10%
And that will give you how many
miles would fit around here.

00:54:09.490 --> 00:54:13.020 align:middle line:10%
And if it happens to be
the same or even close,

00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:16.710 align:middle line:10%
you've got a phi
ratio, which would

00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:18.982 align:middle line:10%
prove everything I just said.

00:54:18.982 --> 00:54:23.430 align:middle line:10%
And the diameter of the
Earth is 7,920 miles.

00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:26.750 align:middle line:10%
And the diameter of the
moon is 2,160 miles.

00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:28.640 align:middle line:10%
You can read this in any book.

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:31.580 align:middle line:10%
You add them together,
and you get 10,080.

00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:36.560 align:middle line:10%
If you want to take 22/7, which
happens to be a real close

00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:43.490 align:middle line:10%
approximation to pi, it comes
up with exactly 31,680 miles.

00:54:43.490 --> 00:54:47.610 align:middle line:10%
If you take pi, it's
off a couple miles.

00:54:47.610 --> 00:54:52.360 align:middle line:10%
But the fact that
you can do that,

00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:58.570 align:middle line:10%
the fact that the size of the
Earth and the size of the Moon

00:54:58.570 --> 00:55:01.560 align:middle line:10%
are contained in the
original eight cells of life,

00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:05.710 align:middle line:10%
or contained inside the
human body, the very planet

00:55:05.710 --> 00:55:07.585 align:middle line:10%
we live on.

00:55:07.585 --> 00:55:12.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean you might let that
sink in for a moment.

00:55:12.010 --> 00:55:15.360 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty amazing that
that would be there.

00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:19.887 align:middle line:84%
It's just like--
how can that be?

00:55:19.887 --> 00:55:22.833 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:55:22.833 --> 00:55:24.560 align:middle line:90%
>>He said, as above, so below.

00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:31.990 align:middle line:84%
But I mean that still
boggles my mind.

00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:37.240 align:middle line:84%
I still don't quite
understand that.

00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:42.975 align:middle line:84%
I'm still-- I mean that says
are there only certain sizes

00:55:42.975 --> 00:55:46.328 align:middle line:90%
of planets that are possible?

00:55:46.328 --> 00:55:50.090 align:middle line:90%
Are there only certain ratios?

00:55:50.090 --> 00:55:53.529 align:middle line:84%
Kepler felt that there were
only certain places that planets

00:55:53.529 --> 00:55:54.570 align:middle line:90%
could rotate around suns.

00:55:54.570 --> 00:55:56.740 align:middle line:84%
Are there also
only certain sizes

00:55:56.740 --> 00:55:59.630 align:middle line:90%
of planets that can even be?

00:55:59.630 --> 00:56:01.380 align:middle line:84%
We know that there are
only certain places

00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:03.890 align:middle line:90%
that electrons can be.

00:56:03.890 --> 00:56:08.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean this says some really,
really, really deep things.

00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:13.430 align:middle line:84%
On top of that if you were to
take the diameter of the Earth

00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:15.810 align:middle line:84%
and bring it up to
the center of the Moon

00:56:15.810 --> 00:56:18.730 align:middle line:84%
and back down, and align
from the center of the Moon

00:56:18.730 --> 00:56:23.710 align:middle line:84%
to the center of the
Earth, this view,

00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:30.270 align:middle line:84%
which is the view of a pyramid
from that angle, only this

00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:31.585 align:middle line:90%
but not this one.

00:56:31.585 --> 00:56:36.352 align:middle line:84%
It happens to be 51
degrees, 51 minutes

00:56:36.352 --> 00:56:39.780 align:middle line:90%
and approximately 24 seconds.

00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:42.140 align:middle line:90%
It's the Great Pyramid.

00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:47.240 align:middle line:84%
It is an exact view or a
proportion of the Great Pyramid

00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:48.040 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:50.580 align:middle line:90%


00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And in Emerald
Tablets Thoth says,

00:56:54.330 --> 00:56:57.630 align:middle line:84%
he says that he made
the Great Pyramid,

00:56:57.630 --> 00:57:01.702 align:middle line:84%
and that he made it from the
proportions of the earth.

00:57:01.702 --> 00:57:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And there is proof
that the proportions

00:57:04.730 --> 00:57:09.100 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid are
located in the Earth.

00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:10.630 align:middle line:90%
Oh well, yeah.

00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:15.040 align:middle line:84%
You are coming up-- this does
come back up with that image

00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:18.710 align:middle line:84%
that the Masons drew
in that first one.

00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And it also began to tell
me what these places are

00:57:24.970 --> 00:57:26.515 align:middle line:90%
that they drew to.

00:57:26.515 --> 00:57:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And what I now know is that in
the human body it's the navel.

00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:33.360 align:middle line:84%
That's what that spot is right
there that this comes up to.

00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:36.580 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly to where
the bellybutton is.

00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:39.770 align:middle line:84%
But what all these things
are in here, it has to do--

00:57:39.770 --> 00:57:41.400 align:middle line:84%
and we'll talk
about these later--

00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:43.750 align:middle line:84%
there's a sphere that
will move through here

00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:45.180 align:middle line:90%
and touch all four spheres.

00:57:45.180 --> 00:57:47.130 align:middle line:90%
It's real, real, real important.

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:50.410 align:middle line:84%
There's another one inside if
you could get it in there that

00:57:50.410 --> 00:57:52.770 align:middle line:90%
would touch all eight of these.

00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:55.490 align:middle line:84%
The relationship of
those two spheres,

00:57:55.490 --> 00:57:58.330 align:middle line:84%
if you put a square
around the little one,

00:57:58.330 --> 00:58:01.940 align:middle line:84%
and if you drew these to
the proper proportion,

00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:05.480 align:middle line:84%
if you put a square around the
one that fits through there,

00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:07.095 align:middle line:84%
relative to the one
that sits inside,

00:58:07.095 --> 00:58:09.142 align:middle line:84%
it makes a holographic
image of the whole one,

00:58:09.142 --> 00:58:11.480 align:middle line:90%
and it forms a phi ratio again.

00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's another
key to all of this.

00:58:14.350 --> 00:58:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And that, according to Thoth,
was why the Lucifer Rebellion

00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:21.570 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:58:21.570 --> 00:58:23.510 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about
that in a little bit.

00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:26.030 align:middle line:84%
So the inner aspect
of the whole thing

00:58:26.030 --> 00:58:29.160 align:middle line:84%
has an outer image of
what's on the outer aspect

00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:30.120 align:middle line:90%
of the whole thing.

00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:38.930 align:middle line:84%
But there is a great cosmic
controversy over all this,

00:58:38.930 --> 00:58:40.070 align:middle line:90%
which I'll bring up later.

00:58:40.070 --> 00:58:43.320 align:middle line:84%
It's the reason why that
Lucifer did what he did.

00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:45.932 align:middle line:84%
But I have to wait until
I get there to explain it.

00:58:45.932 --> 00:58:47.390 align:middle line:84%
Here I was just
going to show you--

00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:49.306 align:middle line:84%
the next thing I was
going to come up and show

00:58:49.306 --> 00:58:51.780 align:middle line:84%
you is the pyramid, and then
show you the actual pyramid.

00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:57.560 align:middle line:84%
This is the angle that they're
referring to over here.

00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:03.480 align:middle line:84%
Now these are the drawings
that these next two drawings

00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:07.150 align:middle line:84%
are of incredible
importance for some people,

00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:08.440 align:middle line:90%
not for most of you guys.

00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:14.880 align:middle line:84%
But the inner circle that
passes through the middle

00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:18.950 align:middle line:84%
determines if it's set up
here-- see this circle here.

00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:21.540 align:middle line:84%
If you set it up here, it will
determine the inner thickness

00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:23.960 align:middle line:90%
of the zona pellucida.

00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:27.800 align:middle line:84%
The inner circle that will
fit inside the middle,

00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:30.010 align:middle line:84%
if you run them over,
they will exactly

00:59:30.010 --> 00:59:35.900 align:middle line:84%
make-- if this is a 64
grid, it will exactly

00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:38.860 align:middle line:84%
form the original four
squares in the middle.

00:59:38.860 --> 00:59:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And if you run it
over, it will tell you

00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:45.550 align:middle line:84%
where the outer thickness
of the zona pellucida is.

00:59:45.550 --> 00:59:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And again those two circles
becomes very, very important.

00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And this is the one-- these are
the precise proportions now.

00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:55.510 align:middle line:84%
If you ran a square
around that one,

00:59:55.510 --> 00:59:59.140 align:middle line:84%
it would form a phi ratio,
like the bigger one.

00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And there is another
geometrical problem

01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:07.850 align:middle line:84%
that one would have to solve if
you wanted to know everything

01:00:07.850 --> 01:00:09.200 align:middle line:90%
about the subject.

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And that is that taking
this structure over here,

01:00:14.450 --> 01:00:16.180 align:middle line:84%
you can see this
Star of David pattern

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:22.120 align:middle line:84%
around here, which forms a cube
which is setting at an angle.

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:25.880 align:middle line:84%
And we know that that
is-- or at least I

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:28.030 align:middle line:84%
guess I'm just
basically telling you--

01:00:28.030 --> 01:00:31.480 align:middle line:84%
that is the way that the energy
field sits around the body.

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:35.660 align:middle line:84%
But remember we also had
a square going this way.

01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:38.460 align:middle line:90%


01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:43.350 align:middle line:84%
So we have a square going this
way, and a square going tilted.

01:00:43.350 --> 01:00:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And there has to be a
mathematical relationship

01:00:45.330 --> 01:00:49.270 align:middle line:84%
between those or
everything was wrong.

01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:51.280 align:middle line:84%
It took a long time
to figure it out.

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:54.130 align:middle line:90%
This is it right here.

01:00:54.130 --> 01:00:57.970 align:middle line:84%
That white tetrahedron is like
this green one right here.

01:00:57.970 --> 01:01:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And the black one, I think
it is, comes down like this

01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:04.730 align:middle line:84%
here, forming this
pattern like that.

01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is the square that
we see going around the body.

01:01:09.370 --> 01:01:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And these happen to be where
the lines are that were

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:14.470 align:middle line:90%
drawn on Leonardo's drawing.

01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:18.520 align:middle line:84%
He divided the whole thing
into 1, 2, 3, 4 parts.

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:21.350 align:middle line:84%
The piece that comes over
the top and the bottom

01:01:21.350 --> 01:01:23.710 align:middle line:84%
is the length of your hand
and all that other stuff.

01:01:23.710 --> 01:01:27.620 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually see the
tilted square or the star

01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:30.180 align:middle line:84%
tetrahedral field
in relationship

01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:32.595 align:middle line:90%
to the square at this time.

01:01:32.595 --> 01:01:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And you can mathematically
see how the two link together.

01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:37.312 align:middle line:90%


01:01:37.312 --> 01:01:39.020 align:middle line:84%
It was real important
for me to see that.

01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:41.395 align:middle line:84%
Because once I saw that
there was a square this way

01:01:41.395 --> 01:01:44.690 align:middle line:84%
and also this way, I
had to find the link.

01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:47.480 align:middle line:84%
Or my mind would never stop,
it would just keep going.

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Because then I would have
this little doubt in my head

01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:52.260 align:middle line:90%
in there about all of this.

01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:57.300 align:middle line:84%
But once I found all of this,
it solved the problems for me.

01:01:57.300 --> 01:02:02.590 align:middle line:84%
Another proof that
the Egyptians well

01:02:02.590 --> 01:02:05.910 align:middle line:84%
understood what we are saying
right here right now, if you

01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:09.990 align:middle line:84%
were to cut off the
pyramid right on the floor

01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:16.280 align:middle line:84%
of the King's Chamber like
this, where you cut it off

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:17.260 align:middle line:90%
right there.

01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And then take an aerial view
of it, and they have done this.

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And they've calculated this
carefully with computers.

01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:27.330 align:middle line:84%
The area of that
piece that's cut off,

01:02:27.330 --> 01:02:29.090 align:middle line:84%
this would be the
floor of the chamber,

01:02:29.090 --> 01:02:32.900 align:middle line:84%
is exactly one half
the area of the base.

01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:36.830 align:middle line:84%
One half the area of
the base is this image.

01:02:36.830 --> 01:02:41.890 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if they
were to rotate that,

01:02:41.890 --> 01:02:45.080 align:middle line:84%
around like that, it would
exactly hit the image.

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And you can see what
one half is, like this.

01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:51.380 align:middle line:84%
So you can you tell
without even measuring,

01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:52.460 align:middle line:90%
you know it's one half.

01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:55.270 align:middle line:84%
That diamond in a square
is always one half.

01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:57.770 align:middle line:84%
Because you know that
these are all equal.

01:02:57.770 --> 01:02:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is a
diagonal down here.

01:02:59.330 --> 01:03:02.120 align:middle line:84%
So this part is equal
to this part, right?

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:03.170 align:middle line:90%
So this is equal to this.

01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:04.270 align:middle line:90%
This is equal to this.

01:03:04.270 --> 01:03:06.390 align:middle line:84%
This is equal to this,
and this is equal to this.

01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:07.382 align:middle line:90%
It's one half.

01:03:07.382 --> 01:03:10.730 align:middle line:90%


01:03:10.730 --> 01:03:13.042 align:middle line:90%
This is going to be 1, 2, 3, 4.

01:03:13.042 --> 01:03:15.600 align:middle line:90%
5, 6, 7, 8 of them.

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:17.030 align:middle line:90%
And this is four of them.

01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And so it's one
half of the area.

01:03:19.770 --> 01:03:23.400 align:middle line:84%
That's without going through
any kind of mathematical way

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:24.280 align:middle line:90%
of doing it.

01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And so the very
placement of where

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:30.460 align:middle line:84%
the floor of the
King's Chamber was,

01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:35.260 align:middle line:84%
was another hidden
thing showing that it

01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:42.010 align:middle line:84%
was made for the second level
of consciousness, which he also

01:03:42.010 --> 01:03:44.870 align:middle line:84%
did the same thing in
here on the second level

01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:45.778 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

01:03:45.778 --> 01:03:49.410 align:middle line:90%


01:03:49.410 --> 01:03:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is that
relationship, the square.

01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:54.690 align:middle line:90%
This is the proportion here.

01:03:54.690 --> 01:03:57.620 align:middle line:84%
I could really go off on this
drawing right here right now.

01:03:57.620 --> 01:03:58.730 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if I will.

01:03:58.730 --> 01:04:01.050 align:middle line:84%
You've got all your square
root of 3, square root of 2,

01:04:01.050 --> 01:04:04.610 align:middle line:84%
square root of 5 lines just
by connecting them together,

01:04:04.610 --> 01:04:05.930 align:middle line:90%
and all these patterns.

01:04:05.930 --> 01:04:10.040 align:middle line:84%
This one coming down to here is
one square of a 64 square grid

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:12.480 align:middle line:90%
pattern.

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:14.915 align:middle line:84%
This one you can really extract
all kinds of information

01:04:14.915 --> 01:04:15.715 align:middle line:90%
from it.

01:04:15.715 --> 01:04:19.410 align:middle line:84%
But I'll just let
you guys do that.

01:04:19.410 --> 01:04:21.980 align:middle line:84%
It's really fun what can
be done from that drawing,

01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:28.900 align:middle line:84%
and what's possible if you ever
wanted to study this someday.

01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:31.170 align:middle line:84%
We've got four
minutes for questions.

01:04:31.170 --> 01:04:33.630 align:middle line:84%
>>One thing I wanted
to ask, you when

01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:37.330 align:middle line:84%
you're speaking about the
sacred geometry and shapes,

01:04:37.330 --> 01:04:39.205 align:middle line:84%
and I forget where it
was I had the question.

01:04:39.205 --> 01:04:40.329 align:middle line:90%
I had it written down here.

01:04:40.329 --> 01:04:41.280 align:middle line:90%
But my question was--

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:43.446 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm kind of sorry-- I
want to apologize in the way

01:04:43.446 --> 01:04:45.640 align:middle line:84%
that you guys can't get
your questions right

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:47.709 align:middle line:90%
when I'm doing them.

01:04:47.709 --> 01:04:49.000 align:middle line:90%
But I've got to do it this way.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.620 align:middle line:84%
>>It's the deal with the
architecture, what came to me,

01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:54.830 align:middle line:84%
my question was,
when we're dealing

01:04:54.830 --> 01:04:57.170 align:middle line:84%
with the sacred geometry
and we're building things

01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:59.950 align:middle line:84%
in the third dimension
based on sacred geometry,

01:04:59.950 --> 01:05:03.240 align:middle line:84%
that they're forming
these shapes of beauty.

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:05.720 align:middle line:84%
Do they only resonate
on the third dimension?

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:10.860 align:middle line:84%
Or do these shapes actually
because of their proportions,

01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:13.240 align:middle line:84%
do they exist on
other levels also?

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:14.040 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:14.840 align:middle line:90%
They do.

01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>>They extend out?

01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:19.154 align:middle line:84%
>>There is-- from another
point of view, anything--

01:05:19.154 --> 01:05:20.320 align:middle line:90%
we'll talk about this later.

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Anything that exists in
third dimension, first

01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:31.110 align:middle line:90%
existed in fourth, and higher.

01:05:31.110 --> 01:05:32.990 align:middle line:84%
But it had to have first
come through fourth

01:05:32.990 --> 01:05:34.680 align:middle line:90%
before it got to third.

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>>Even if it's not within ratio
of using pi and things of that

01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:39.440 align:middle line:90%
nature--

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:42.340 align:middle line:84%
>>Even [INAUDIBLE],
no matter what it is.

01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:46.640 align:middle line:84%
Everything that was
created synthetically, say,

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:49.860 align:middle line:84%
you made this thing,
was first created out

01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:53.555 align:middle line:84%
of your imagination, and brought
down through the causal planes,

01:05:53.555 --> 01:05:55.680 align:middle line:84%
and slowly brought down
through the various levels

01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:58.680 align:middle line:90%
until you manifested it.

01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And it had to pass through
the fourth dimensional level

01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:06.936 align:middle line:84%
of existence before-- which
would not look like this.

01:06:06.936 --> 01:06:07.800 align:middle line:90%
Because--

01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:10.720 align:middle line:84%
>>And my question
is, if it does have--

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:13.430 align:middle line:84%
if it is within sacred geometry
and is within proportion,

01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:16.435 align:middle line:84%
does it stay the same, or
does it also still continue

01:06:16.435 --> 01:06:17.560 align:middle line:90%
to shift on each dimension?

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:19.010 align:middle line:90%
Or does it stay the same shape?

01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

01:06:19.810 --> 01:06:23.160 align:middle line:84%
Shape from one place to the
next is utterly completely

01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:24.286 align:middle line:90%
totally utterly different.

01:06:24.286 --> 01:06:26.695 align:middle line:84%
Though there is a mathematical
relationship to it,

01:06:26.695 --> 01:06:29.030 align:middle line:90%
it is not the same.

01:06:29.030 --> 01:06:32.580 align:middle line:84%
Experientially if you were
to look at a cube here,

01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:36.620 align:middle line:84%
and to see a cube in
the fourth dimension,

01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:38.050 align:middle line:90%
you wouldn't recognize it.

01:06:38.050 --> 01:06:38.240 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:40.280 align:middle line:84%
So the mathematical--
the sequences and things

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:43.330 align:middle line:84%
of that nature shift also as
we move into another dimension.

01:06:43.330 --> 01:06:44.130 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, it does.

01:06:44.130 --> 01:06:44.520 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:45.978 align:middle line:84%
So all that you've
been teaching us

01:06:45.978 --> 01:06:47.720 align:middle line:84%
is the mathematical
proportions that

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:49.240 align:middle line:90%
exist on the third dimension?

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.130 align:middle line:84%
But it all applies
on all levels.

01:06:52.130 --> 01:06:52.930 align:middle line:90%
Everything keeps--

01:06:52.930 --> 01:06:53.870 align:middle line:84%
>>The Fibonacci and
things those apply?

01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:55.330 align:middle line:90%
>>Everything applies.

01:06:55.330 --> 01:06:58.810 align:middle line:90%
It just things will change.

01:06:58.810 --> 01:07:02.740 align:middle line:84%
But if there's a change, there
will be a mathematical reason

01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:04.200 align:middle line:90%
why they changed.

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:08.230 align:middle line:84%
There's a logical-ness to
everything all the way through.

01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:11.620 align:middle line:10%
There's no just something
that just happens.

01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:14.282 align:middle line:84%
Once you-- it all
comes out of a sphere.

01:07:14.282 --> 01:07:15.990 align:middle line:84%
Once you know the
sphere, everything else

01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:22.170 align:middle line:84%
will be generated and come back
to it in one way or another.

01:07:22.170 --> 01:07:26.027 align:middle line:84%
There's no surprises on
those kind of levels at all.

01:07:26.027 --> 01:07:28.610 align:middle line:84%
Eventually the mind, you've got
to get bigger and bigger heads

01:07:28.610 --> 01:07:34.420 align:middle line:84%
and skulls to comprehend
all this stuff.

01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:37.100 align:middle line:90%
But there's no changes.

01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And this thing of
objects having to first

01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:44.780 align:middle line:84%
come into fourth dimension
first, and then third,

01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:46.610 align:middle line:90%
is real important.

01:07:46.610 --> 01:07:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Because when we start looking
about the ancient civilizations

01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:52.880 align:middle line:84%
and what goes on with
the grid patterns that

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:54.410 align:middle line:84%
create these
civilizations, and what

01:07:54.410 --> 01:07:57.010 align:middle line:84%
happens when these
grid patterns are--

01:07:57.010 --> 01:07:59.820 align:middle line:90%
I'll just say it right now.

01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:04.820 align:middle line:84%
If you have a third
dimensional object,

01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:07.723 align:middle line:84%
even though it was created by
maybe one person or a series

01:08:07.723 --> 01:08:11.850 align:middle line:84%
or a group of people,
it's really just light.

01:08:11.850 --> 01:08:13.390 align:middle line:90%
It's just a thought pattern.

01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:16.510 align:middle line:90%
It's a standing wave form.

01:08:16.510 --> 01:08:19.010 align:middle line:84%
But it is maintained
in the reality

01:08:19.010 --> 01:08:20.990 align:middle line:84%
not by the person
who created it,

01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:25.080 align:middle line:84%
but by the grid that
we all have in common.

01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:29.390 align:middle line:84%
If the grid is
broken down, all the

01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:33.670 align:middle line:84%
thought patterns go
back into energy.

01:08:33.670 --> 01:08:38.470 align:middle line:84%
All synthetic objects
dissolve away.

01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And they return
back into elements.

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:44.899 align:middle line:84%
And they don't hold their
shape or their pattern.

01:08:44.899 --> 01:08:49.085 align:middle line:84%
And so when a consciousness
leaves, and it leaves

01:08:49.085 --> 01:08:51.441 align:middle line:84%
and it dissolves
its grid, and I'm

01:08:51.441 --> 01:08:52.899 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
grid that extends

01:08:52.899 --> 01:08:55.010 align:middle line:84%
around the entire
planet, like 50-60

01:08:55.010 --> 01:08:58.130 align:middle line:84%
miles up around the planet,
then all synthetic stuff

01:08:58.130 --> 01:09:00.370 align:middle line:90%
goes with it.

01:09:00.370 --> 01:09:04.950 align:middle line:84%
It's for this reason that a very
intelligent race, if they want

01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:10.040 align:middle line:84%
to leave something
on the planet that

01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:12.199 align:middle line:84%
is going to last for
a long time that's

01:09:12.199 --> 01:09:13.740 align:middle line:84%
going to go through
these dimensional

01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:16.689 align:middle line:84%
shifts that we go through,
and it's going to stay there,

01:09:16.689 --> 01:09:19.029 align:middle line:84%
then the only way that
they can do it-- well it's

01:09:19.029 --> 01:09:19.859 align:middle line:90%
not the only way.

01:09:19.859 --> 01:09:20.870 align:middle line:90%
There is other ways.

01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:23.670 align:middle line:84%
But it requires concentration
and a lot of energy.

01:09:23.670 --> 01:09:25.649 align:middle line:84%
The only way they
can do it easily

01:09:25.649 --> 01:09:30.910 align:middle line:84%
is to take matter that is of
the planet, which will naturally

01:09:30.910 --> 01:09:35.330 align:middle line:84%
move through the
dimensional levels, which

01:09:35.330 --> 01:09:38.870 align:middle line:90%
is not based upon a grid.

01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:41.310 align:middle line:84%
It's based upon the energies
of the planet itself.

01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:44.720 align:middle line:84%
So if you wanted to
build the Great Pyramid,

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:50.990 align:middle line:84%
you don't make it out of ABS
plastic or stainless steel.

01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Because when we went through
the first shift, it's gone.

01:09:55.330 --> 01:09:59.470 align:middle line:84%
So you use very hard materials
that are out of the Earth

01:09:59.470 --> 01:10:00.360 align:middle line:90%
itself.

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:02.370 align:middle line:84%
It isn't that they're
primitive in doing that.

01:10:02.370 --> 01:10:04.942 align:middle line:90%
They're just smart that's all.

01:10:04.942 --> 01:10:06.692 align:middle line:84%
They just know that
if they want something

01:10:06.692 --> 01:10:08.790 align:middle line:84%
to stay with that
planet for a long time,

01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:11.540 align:middle line:84%
you make it out of the natural
materials of that planet.

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:15.150 align:middle line:84%
You could make it out
of synthetic materials.

01:10:15.150 --> 01:10:17.110 align:middle line:84%
But they would have
to-- they would

01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:21.180 align:middle line:84%
have to set up Merkaba fields
or something around them.

01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
have to maintain them

01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:28.440 align:middle line:84%
in various ways, which
is difficult to do.

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And so it's easier to just
use something natural.

01:10:34.030 --> 01:10:36.430 align:middle line:84%
>>But everything is
natural, isn't it?

01:10:36.430 --> 01:10:37.230 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

01:10:37.230 --> 01:10:38.781 align:middle line:90%
Everything is not natural.

01:10:38.781 --> 01:10:40.406 align:middle line:84%
>>Even plastic is
made from oil, right?

01:10:40.406 --> 01:10:41.205 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:10:41.205 --> 01:10:42.120 align:middle line:90%
But we made it.

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:43.480 align:middle line:90%
We changed the molecules around.

01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:46.020 align:middle line:90%
We used thought to do it with.

01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:50.680 align:middle line:84%
We used thought to-- some
things you can make like clay.

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:54.770 align:middle line:84%
Now this whole thing
of synthetic materials

01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:57.820 align:middle line:84%
there is a spectrum
of stability.

01:10:57.820 --> 01:11:00.060 align:middle line:90%
So I'll put it that way.

01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:03.200 align:middle line:84%
Like glass, for example, is
just melted sand, you might say,

01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:04.480 align:middle line:90%
is silicon.

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:08.190 align:middle line:84%
Glass, but it's still
created by thought.

01:11:08.190 --> 01:11:10.650 align:middle line:84%
It won't happen in
the shape of a window

01:11:10.650 --> 01:11:15.390 align:middle line:84%
naturally without human
beings being around it.

01:11:15.390 --> 01:11:16.820 align:middle line:84%
Lightning might
come into the sand

01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:18.970 align:middle line:84%
and melt it and
turn it into glass.

01:11:18.970 --> 01:11:20.540 align:middle line:90%
You might get tektites.

01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:22.890 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds
of tektite materials

01:11:22.890 --> 01:11:24.522 align:middle line:90%
that are around the world.

01:11:24.522 --> 01:11:28.470 align:middle line:84%
But when you look back at
archeology, all you ever find

01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:33.740 align:middle line:84%
is clay pots, wooden
things, all this stuff.

01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:35.554 align:middle line:84%
It looks like that's
all they used.

01:11:35.554 --> 01:11:37.220 align:middle line:84%
You can't ever find
any of these things.

01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:41.846 align:middle line:84%
Though they have found
objects that defy all this.

01:11:41.846 --> 01:11:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Occasionally there have
been a few things found

01:11:44.230 --> 01:11:47.810 align:middle line:84%
that are ancient that are
made out of older materials.

01:11:47.810 --> 01:11:54.705 align:middle line:84%
And for example, Noah's ark, has
high-level sophisticated metals

01:11:54.705 --> 01:11:56.447 align:middle line:90%
in it.

01:11:56.447 --> 01:11:58.155 align:middle line:84%
They don't know how
they possibly did it.

01:11:58.155 --> 01:12:04.400 align:middle line:84%
Because the thing
is 13,000 years old.

01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:08.430 align:middle line:84%
None of this, long
before there was even

01:12:08.430 --> 01:12:10.870 align:middle line:84%
the different various
metal ages and things,

01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:12.400 align:middle line:90%
Noah's Ark's got metal.

01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:16.764 align:middle line:84%
There it is, fact,
real good stuff in it.

01:12:16.764 --> 01:12:19.230 align:middle line:90%
>>Was there gold?

01:12:19.230 --> 01:12:22.060 align:middle line:84%
>>One comment, weren't the
early Masons basically the stone

01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:22.860 align:middle line:90%
cutters?

01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And they were simply interested
in how to put a building up

01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:27.070 align:middle line:90%
that wasn't going to fall over.

01:12:27.070 --> 01:12:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And then as these other,
as hierarchical structures

01:12:30.670 --> 01:12:33.730 align:middle line:84%
came into it, and they got
off on other technologies,

01:12:33.730 --> 01:12:34.640 align:middle line:90%
and other--

01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>>I guess.

01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:37.210 align:middle line:84%
But this goes all the
way back into Egypt.

01:12:37.210 --> 01:12:40.030 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

01:12:40.030 --> 01:12:43.250 align:middle line:84%
One little detail that we've
discovered about the Mason

01:12:43.250 --> 01:12:48.270 align:middle line:84%
stone cutters, which is a
real interesting one, which

01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:51.830 align:middle line:84%
was another person who was
going to teach this class at one

01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:54.927 align:middle line:84%
point, but ended
up not doing it.

01:12:54.927 --> 01:12:56.510 align:middle line:84%
But he discovered
that-- have you ever

01:12:56.510 --> 01:13:00.200 align:middle line:84%
looked at the Mason signatures
that are in the cornerstone?

01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:01.690 align:middle line:84%
There'll be the
saying on the back.

01:13:01.690 --> 01:13:03.474 align:middle line:84%
And it will have these
little signatures,

01:13:03.474 --> 01:13:05.640 align:middle line:84%
which are all the people
who were the stone cutters,

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:07.520 align:middle line:84%
and people who built
the whole thing.

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever looked
at those signatures?

01:13:09.250 --> 01:13:12.160 align:middle line:90%
Has anybody seen those?

01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:13.260 align:middle line:90%
They look like this.

01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:14.420 align:middle line:90%
They look like this.

01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:26.610 align:middle line:84%
They are maybe things like
this, or things like this.

01:13:26.610 --> 01:13:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And we got about 30
or 40 of these things

01:13:29.190 --> 01:13:32.080 align:middle line:84%
and found out that
every single of them

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:34.700 align:middle line:84%
could be mapped over
the flower of life.

01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:35.660 align:middle line:90%
They're like keys.

01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:38.690 align:middle line:84%
They're signatures that
are just simply lines

01:13:38.690 --> 01:13:41.100 align:middle line:90%
that are on the flower of life.

01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:44.109 align:middle line:90%
They might be a complete circle.

01:13:44.109 --> 01:13:45.900 align:middle line:84%
It might come like
this, a complete circle,

01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:48.320 align:middle line:84%
and come down with another
line like that, or something.

01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:51.190 align:middle line:84%
But they're all--
every one of them,

01:13:51.190 --> 01:13:54.840 align:middle line:84%
right off the flower
of life, another proof

01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:55.980 align:middle line:90%
that they understood that.

01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:58.560 align:middle line:90%


01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:01.315 align:middle line:84%
OK, you've got more
than one question there.

01:14:01.315 --> 01:14:05.940 align:middle line:84%
But the grids are-- every
life form, every species,

01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:08.400 align:middle line:84%
even if there's only
two on the earth

01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:12.760 align:middle line:84%
can't exist without the
grid being there first.

01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:15.290 align:middle line:90%
The grid has to happen first.

01:14:15.290 --> 01:14:17.500 align:middle line:90%
And then the species is there.

01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:20.920 align:middle line:84%
So you've got--
like I said, you've

01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:23.240 align:middle line:84%
got grids that stretch
around the entire planet

01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:26.280 align:middle line:84%
from an average of
60 feet in the Earth,

01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:28.630 align:middle line:90%
to about 60 miles above it.

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:31.596 align:middle line:90%
And they're all superimposed.

01:14:31.596 --> 01:14:34.340 align:middle line:84%
So there are as many
grids as there are species

01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:36.570 align:middle line:90%
of things, which is a lot.

01:14:36.570 --> 01:14:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And so it looks like it's
just like the blue glow,

01:14:38.890 --> 01:14:41.590 align:middle line:84%
like a whitish blue glow
coming off the Earth.

01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:43.600 align:middle line:84%
Because they are
electromagnetic.

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And as a species becomes
extinct, that grid goes away.

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:53.690 align:middle line:90%
It leaves.

01:14:53.690 --> 01:14:54.840 align:middle line:90%
Which is what's happening.

01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:57.442 align:middle line:84%
We're getting--
how many species?

01:14:57.442 --> 01:14:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>>Again, 30 million,
we're down to [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:02.400 align:middle line:84%
>>30 million, and
we're down to how many?

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:03.960 align:middle line:90%
>>Down to 15 million?

01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:06.340 align:middle line:90%
And half of them are gone?

01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:08.340 align:middle line:90%
They're leaving.

01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:09.850 align:middle line:84%
But where they're
going, they're not

01:15:09.850 --> 01:15:12.330 align:middle line:84%
really-- there's no such
thing as extinction.

01:15:12.330 --> 01:15:17.190 align:middle line:84%
The form is just transmuting
up to the next level.

01:15:17.190 --> 01:15:21.530 align:middle line:84%
We all have certain
animal natures within us.

01:15:21.530 --> 01:15:23.560 align:middle line:84%
Some of us have
certain animal natures

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:27.250 align:middle line:90%
stronger than other one.

01:15:27.250 --> 01:15:29.846 align:middle line:84%
Though we don't think
of ourselves that way.

01:15:29.846 --> 01:15:37.080 align:middle line:84%
But the native peoples of
the world are more in tune

01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:38.404 align:middle line:90%
with this.

01:15:38.404 --> 01:15:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And I've had a lot of
experience with this myself,

01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:47.470 align:middle line:84%
not to the point of becoming
or turning from my body

01:15:47.470 --> 01:15:49.320 align:middle line:90%
into another animal.

01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:53.120 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of the work
that's happened here

01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:54.850 align:middle line:90%
has come from the animals.

01:15:54.850 --> 01:15:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And mostly for me it's
been with birds, like this.

01:15:58.300 --> 01:15:59.650 align:middle line:90%
The life forms are leaving.

01:15:59.650 --> 01:16:02.270 align:middle line:90%
They're going.

01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:05.080 align:middle line:84%
It's like 30 an
hour or something.

01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:07.142 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it is.

01:16:07.142 --> 01:16:11.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean life is
leaving here fast.

01:16:11.810 --> 01:16:15.090 align:middle line:90%
And like he said, 30 million--

01:16:15.090 --> 01:16:16.390 align:middle line:90%
>>30 million is [INAUDIBLE].

01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:20.170 align:middle line:90%
>>So we're down to 15 million?

01:16:20.170 --> 01:16:23.313 align:middle line:84%
And half the life of
the planet has left now.

01:16:23.313 --> 01:16:24.113 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot.

01:16:24.113 --> 01:16:27.400 align:middle line:90%


01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:28.769 align:middle line:90%
But they're not dying.

01:16:28.769 --> 01:16:31.060 align:middle line:84%
That's the thing you must
know, at least in your heart.

01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:35.000 align:middle line:90%


01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:35.800 align:middle line:90%
They're not dying.

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:38.420 align:middle line:84%
They are just
transmuting to another--

01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:41.710 align:middle line:84%
they're reforming the grids
at other dimensional level.

01:16:41.710 --> 01:16:45.000 align:middle line:84%
But what they do is they
reform those grids up to first.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.665 align:middle line:90%


01:16:47.665 --> 01:16:50.940 align:middle line:84%
The grids come from
fourth to third.

01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And then they move back
to the one on the fourth,

01:16:53.910 --> 01:16:56.480 align:middle line:84%
and then dissolve
the one on the third.

01:16:56.480 --> 01:16:59.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, it isn't really
leaving the Earth.

01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:02.000 align:middle line:84%
It's just on a different
wavelength of the Earth.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.750 align:middle line:84%
They're just in a different--
they're still on the Earth.

01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:06.249 align:middle line:84%
And in this other
wavelength they're

01:17:06.249 --> 01:17:08.460 align:middle line:84%
very healthy and
probably real happy.

01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Because it feels
like they're in tune

01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:11.890 align:middle line:90%
with that place a lot more.

01:17:11.890 --> 01:17:14.360 align:middle line:90%
And it feels a lot better.

01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And we're about to
do that same thing.

01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:19.690 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

01:17:19.690 --> 01:17:22.010 align:middle line:84%
This is a natural-- this
part of the whole thing

01:17:22.010 --> 01:17:25.060 align:middle line:90%
is a natural process.

01:17:25.060 --> 01:17:28.430 align:middle line:84%
It is not-- I mean
it looks real bad.

01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:29.330 align:middle line:90%
I know.

01:17:29.330 --> 01:17:29.780 align:middle line:90%
I understand it.

01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:30.820 align:middle line:90%
But that part is OK.

01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:32.780 align:middle line:84%
The part that's
unnatural is the speed

01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:35.030 align:middle line:90%
at which we're doing this at.

01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:36.780 align:middle line:90%
This is what's so extraordinary.

01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:37.580 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:41.480 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to look at these
internal structure rooms inside

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:43.191 align:middle line:90%
of the Great Pyramid.

01:17:43.191 --> 01:17:44.565 align:middle line:84%
The reason we're
going to do that

01:17:44.565 --> 01:17:48.930 align:middle line:84%
is because when Akhenaten
gave the Egyptian mystery

01:17:48.930 --> 01:17:52.586 align:middle line:84%
scroll-- Egyptian mystery scroll
of Akhenaten, the law of one.

01:17:52.586 --> 01:17:55.870 align:middle line:90%


01:17:55.870 --> 01:18:00.240 align:middle line:84%
In those last 5 and
1/2 years, the way

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:03.926 align:middle line:84%
that he trained the
people to go into

01:18:03.926 --> 01:18:09.530 align:middle line:84%
become-- to go into the
immortal state of awareness

01:18:09.530 --> 01:18:13.750 align:middle line:84%
of this, had to do
with these three

01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:16.982 align:middle line:90%
chambers in the Great Pyramid.

01:18:16.982 --> 01:18:18.440 align:middle line:84%
This is the King's
Chamber up here,

01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:23.370 align:middle line:84%
the Queen's Chamber, and what's
sometimes called as the well.

01:18:23.370 --> 01:18:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And those three places were the
primary places that were used.

01:18:29.550 --> 01:18:34.387 align:middle line:84%
Though there may have been
other places in there also.

01:18:34.387 --> 01:18:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And they're still discovering
more places in there

01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:37.270 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

01:18:37.270 --> 01:18:41.010 align:middle line:84%
They discovered three more
rooms in the Great Pyramid

01:18:41.010 --> 01:18:44.500 align:middle line:84%
just in the last
year, or maybe-- no,

01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:46.450 align:middle line:84%
more than that, two
or three years or so.

01:18:46.450 --> 01:18:49.360 align:middle line:90%


01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And John Anthony West just
discovered another big one

01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:54.956 align:middle line:90%
underneath the Sphinx.

01:18:54.956 --> 01:18:56.830 align:middle line:84%
Japanese discovered
another under the Sphinx.

01:18:56.830 --> 01:18:58.413 align:middle line:84%
It was discovered
that the tunnel that

01:18:58.413 --> 01:19:01.510 align:middle line:84%
is talked about in so many
of the ancient books that

01:19:01.510 --> 01:19:03.790 align:middle line:84%
goes from the Sphinx to
the Great Pyramid, in fact,

01:19:03.790 --> 01:19:05.170 align:middle line:90%
all three of the pyramids.

01:19:05.170 --> 01:19:08.450 align:middle line:84%
That tunnel was just
discovered by the Japanese,

01:19:08.450 --> 01:19:10.960 align:middle line:84%
a lot of new stuff that
are becoming aware of.

01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:13.950 align:middle line:90%


01:19:13.950 --> 01:19:18.550 align:middle line:84%
Very little of this has
been published at all.

01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:21.720 align:middle line:84%
The three rooms that they found
were off the Queen's Chamber.

01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:25.040 align:middle line:84%
They found three
rooms off three walls.

01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And one of the walls they
found was absolutely empty.

01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:30.840 align:middle line:84%
One of the walls was filled
from floor to ceiling

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:32.090 align:middle line:90%
with radioactive sand.

01:19:32.090 --> 01:19:34.890 align:middle line:90%


01:19:34.890 --> 01:19:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And the other one had a
solid gold life-sized statue

01:19:38.330 --> 01:19:39.465 align:middle line:90%
of somebody in it.

01:19:39.465 --> 01:19:42.050 align:middle line:90%
And the Japanese stole it.

01:19:42.050 --> 01:19:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And it caused a huge-- the
Egyptian Antiquities Minister

01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:49.480 align:middle line:90%
was fired.

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
worldwide FBI-type thing

01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:57.905 align:middle line:90%
trying to find it right now.

01:19:57.905 --> 01:20:00.360 align:middle line:90%
But I mean it was priceless.

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:01.229 align:middle line:90%
It was solid gold.

01:20:01.229 --> 01:20:05.630 align:middle line:90%


01:20:05.630 --> 01:20:06.780 align:middle line:90%
It's gone now.

01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:09.250 align:middle line:84%
It's probably sitting in some
rich guy's house somewhere.

01:20:09.250 --> 01:20:12.510 align:middle line:90%


01:20:12.510 --> 01:20:17.376 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I want to describe these
three rooms, and what they are.

01:20:17.376 --> 01:20:20.000 align:middle line:84%
This is not-- this is called the
King's Chamber and the Queen's

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:20.800 align:middle line:90%
Chamber.

01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:23.740 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to do
with kings and queens.

01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:26.079 align:middle line:84%
This is called-- it
was the Arabs who

01:20:26.079 --> 01:20:27.870 align:middle line:84%
called this the King's
and Queen's Chamber.

01:20:27.870 --> 01:20:31.030 align:middle line:84%
The Arabs bury their
men in flat roofs.

01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And they bury their
women in pitched roofs.

01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why
they were called--

01:20:34.850 --> 01:20:37.410 align:middle line:84%
it was called the King's
and Queen's Chamber.

01:20:37.410 --> 01:20:38.830 align:middle line:84%
If these had been
reversed around,

01:20:38.830 --> 01:20:41.760 align:middle line:84%
they would reverse
the names around.

01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And this was never a burial
chamber for a person.

01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:48.340 align:middle line:90%
That was not its purpose ever.

01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And you'll read about
many, many times.

01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:53.620 align:middle line:84%
But there is one
very definite proof

01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:57.635 align:middle line:84%
of that, which is
kind of undeniable.

01:20:57.635 --> 01:21:01.050 align:middle line:90%
Though they try to deny it.

01:21:01.050 --> 01:21:04.960 align:middle line:84%
Because they say that it was
designed originally for Cheops.

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:07.320 align:middle line:84%
But in every single
case in Egyptian history

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:10.900 align:middle line:84%
without exception
that I know of,

01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:13.302 align:middle line:84%
when they buried
someone of importance,

01:21:13.302 --> 01:21:14.760 align:middle line:84%
and it's not just
kings and queens.

01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:17.700 align:middle line:84%
But it was like the doctors
and a lot of other people

01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:20.165 align:middle line:84%
that were important in there,
and they were all buried.

01:21:20.165 --> 01:21:22.040 align:middle line:84%
They took their organs
out, and they put them

01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:26.910 align:middle line:90%
into these four clay jars.

01:21:26.910 --> 01:21:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And then they
mummified them, put

01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:35.730 align:middle line:84%
the body into a sarcophagus,
sealed the lid up.

01:21:35.730 --> 01:21:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And then they carried the
sarcophagus and the jars

01:21:38.810 --> 01:21:41.650 align:middle line:84%
to the place where the
person was to be buried.

01:21:41.650 --> 01:21:44.550 align:middle line:90%


01:21:44.550 --> 01:21:46.400 align:middle line:84%
But that would have
been impossible here.

01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:50.180 align:middle line:84%
Because the sarcophagus still
sits in the King's Chamber.

01:21:50.180 --> 01:21:51.380 align:middle line:90%
It's sitting right in there.

01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:52.500 align:middle line:90%
You can see it.

01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And so if you went in
there, first of all

01:21:53.570 --> 01:21:55.528 align:middle line:84%
you would say, well that's
where they buried it

01:21:55.528 --> 01:21:57.340 align:middle line:84%
and somebody stole
the body or something.

01:21:57.340 --> 01:22:01.210 align:middle line:84%
But the sarcophagus, and
this is the important part,

01:22:01.210 --> 01:22:05.020 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than the doorway
that leads into it.

01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:07.620 align:middle line:90%


01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:08.570 align:middle line:90%
You can't get it in.

01:22:08.570 --> 01:22:09.736 align:middle line:90%
That's why it's still there.

01:22:09.736 --> 01:22:11.430 align:middle line:90%
You can't get it in or out.

01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:12.840 align:middle line:90%
It's impossible.

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:15.000 align:middle line:84%
The lid could be
turned and taken out.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.610 align:middle line:90%
So somebody stole the lid.

01:22:16.610 --> 01:22:18.190 align:middle line:90%
The sarcophagus is still there.

01:22:18.190 --> 01:22:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And so they obviously
didn't ever mean for someone

01:22:22.050 --> 01:22:23.170 align:middle line:90%
to be buried there.

01:22:23.170 --> 01:22:25.180 align:middle line:90%
They would have carried it in.

01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:28.680 align:middle line:84%
So whoever built this thing
put the sarcophagus in the room

01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:30.120 align:middle line:90%
before they finished it.

01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:36.670 align:middle line:90%


01:22:36.670 --> 01:22:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And now there's another area
of this place up here called

01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:44.930 align:middle line:84%
the King's Chamber that
I want to talk about.

01:22:44.930 --> 01:22:45.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:47.695 align:middle line:84%
That's the side view
of the King's Chamber

01:22:47.695 --> 01:22:48.978 align:middle line:90%
which looks like this.

01:22:48.978 --> 01:22:55.830 align:middle line:90%


01:22:55.830 --> 01:22:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And again, the King's
Chamber is two squares.

01:22:57.900 --> 01:23:00.780 align:middle line:90%


01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And the diagonal of
that ceiling height

01:23:03.870 --> 01:23:06.074 align:middle line:90%
is exactly one half diagonal.

01:23:06.074 --> 01:23:07.740 align:middle line:84%
Which means that if
you're in that room,

01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:10.280 align:middle line:84%
by measuring the
diagonal half, it

01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:13.000 align:middle line:84%
folds down and marks
a very specific spot

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.090 align:middle line:84%
in the precise
center of the room.

01:23:15.090 --> 01:23:18.000 align:middle line:84%
There are two places of
initiation in this room.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.350 align:middle line:90%
One of them is right about here.

01:23:20.350 --> 01:23:23.399 align:middle line:84%
You come in over here, which
is where the sarcophagus sits.

01:23:23.399 --> 01:23:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And the other one is in the
precise center of the room.

01:23:25.690 --> 01:23:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Just to go through
the initiation spots,

01:23:27.270 --> 01:23:29.436 align:middle line:84%
you begin down here at the
end of this tunnel, which

01:23:29.436 --> 01:23:32.410 align:middle line:90%
we haven't talked about yet.

01:23:32.410 --> 01:23:34.995 align:middle line:84%
You then go to the
King's Chamber.

01:23:34.995 --> 01:23:36.550 align:middle line:90%
You first go into that tunnel.

01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:41.970 align:middle line:10%
You wait a few years, and then
go into the King's Chamber,

01:23:41.970 --> 01:23:44.830 align:middle line:10%
and you immediately go to
the Queen's Chamber, which

01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:46.760 align:middle line:10%
is where you get stabilized.

01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:49.520 align:middle line:10%
You wait a few years,
and then you come back,

01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:51.999 align:middle line:10%
and you finish, and
sometimes hundreds of years.

01:23:51.999 --> 01:23:54.165 align:middle line:84%
And then you come back and
complete it in the center

01:23:54.165 --> 01:23:55.660 align:middle line:90%
here is the final one.

01:23:55.660 --> 01:23:59.600 align:middle line:84%
This is where they tell you,
yes, you really did do it.

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:05.540 align:middle line:90%


01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:08.060 align:middle line:84%
So over the top of here,
there are these little

01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:12.290 align:middle line:84%
five little chambers over the
top of the King's Chamber.

01:24:12.290 --> 01:24:16.475 align:middle line:84%
Now what present day
Egyptian archaeologists say

01:24:16.475 --> 01:24:20.340 align:middle line:84%
is that those chambers are
there to relieve the weight

01:24:20.340 --> 01:24:22.560 align:middle line:84%
load or the pressure
off of that flat roof

01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:26.010 align:middle line:90%
so that it won't collapse.

01:24:26.010 --> 01:24:27.980 align:middle line:84%
That's the official
purpose of those chambers.

01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:30.960 align:middle line:90%


01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:34.420 align:middle line:84%
But you could say, well,
why don't they have

01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:35.590 align:middle line:90%
any chambers over this one?

01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:39.087 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a lot further
down, a lot more weight.

01:24:39.087 --> 01:24:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And they could say, well,
it's got a pitched roof on it,

01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:43.730 align:middle line:90%
and they don't need it as much.

01:24:43.730 --> 01:24:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Then you could say, well, what
about this one way down here.

01:24:47.710 --> 01:24:50.535 align:middle line:84%
It's got a flat roof on it,
and there's no chambers on it.

01:24:50.535 --> 01:24:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's got zillions and
billions and trillions

01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:55.232 align:middle line:90%
of more tons of weight on it.

01:24:55.232 --> 01:24:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And they'll just go,
well, I don't know.

01:24:59.250 --> 01:25:02.415 align:middle line:84%
There is a very specific reason
for these chambers up here.

01:25:02.415 --> 01:25:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
try to explain it.

01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:06.360 align:middle line:84%
But you can get a real
good idea when you look

01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:08.510 align:middle line:90%
at how they're constructed.

01:25:08.510 --> 01:25:11.250 align:middle line:84%
There are nine
super heavy stones,

01:25:11.250 --> 01:25:12.710 align:middle line:90%
one P stone is in the ceiling.

01:25:12.710 --> 01:25:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And again, like I said,
there's 100 stones

01:25:14.930 --> 01:25:18.070 align:middle line:84%
if you count every
stone in the room.

01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And over the top of
those nine stones,

01:25:22.050 --> 01:25:25.840 align:middle line:84%
there is this series
of stones that

01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:28.810 align:middle line:84%
look kind of like
this, where the bottom

01:25:28.810 --> 01:25:32.270 align:middle line:84%
of these series of stones
is polished like glass.

01:25:32.270 --> 01:25:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And the top of stones
is bumpy and uneven.

01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And then there is an air space
with another series of stones

01:25:40.890 --> 01:25:43.570 align:middle line:90%
that comes sort of like this.

01:25:43.570 --> 01:25:46.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put all
these in here first,

01:25:46.490 --> 01:25:49.815 align:middle line:90%
and then we'll talk about them.

01:25:49.815 --> 01:25:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>>How many stones [INAUDIBLE]

01:25:53.140 --> 01:25:54.798 align:middle line:90%
>>How many stones what?

01:25:54.798 --> 01:25:57.762 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

01:25:57.762 --> 01:25:59.283 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, that was six.

01:25:59.283 --> 01:26:00.898 align:middle line:90%
>>This is a side view?

01:26:00.898 --> 01:26:01.698 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:26:01.698 --> 01:26:06.540 align:middle line:90%


01:26:06.540 --> 01:26:07.470 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:26:07.470 --> 01:26:09.530 align:middle line:84%
Each one of these things
is polished like glass

01:26:09.530 --> 01:26:10.840 align:middle line:90%
with air underneath it.

01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And then on top of it is a
totally irregular bumpy surface

01:26:15.010 --> 01:26:18.581 align:middle line:84%
covered with about one
quarter inch of black foam.

01:26:18.581 --> 01:26:20.580 align:middle line:84%
It looks like it was
sprayed out of a spray can.

01:26:20.580 --> 01:26:29.572 align:middle line:90%


01:26:29.572 --> 01:26:32.155 align:middle line:84%
Just by looking at this, if you
know anything about reflection

01:26:32.155 --> 01:26:40.110 align:middle line:84%
and absorption, this is
reflecting something this way,

01:26:40.110 --> 01:26:44.810 align:middle line:84%
and absorbing something
that's coming from above.

01:26:44.810 --> 01:26:48.800 align:middle line:84%
It's a separator, a divider
of two different kinds

01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:49.724 align:middle line:90%
of energies.

01:26:49.724 --> 01:26:52.158 align:middle line:90%


01:26:52.158 --> 01:26:52.958 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:26:52.958 --> 01:27:01.010 align:middle line:84%
Now that you can see that,
what we're going to do now

01:27:01.010 --> 01:27:07.600 align:middle line:84%
is superimpose those three
sets of-- what Thoth says

01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:10.130 align:middle line:84%
is if you take those three
levels of consciousness,

01:27:10.130 --> 01:27:15.030 align:middle line:84%
the diagrams, superimpose them
over the diagram of the Earth

01:27:15.030 --> 01:27:18.150 align:middle line:84%
with the Great
Pyramid on it, you

01:27:18.150 --> 01:27:20.690 align:middle line:84%
can then begin to understand
what all these rooms are,

01:27:20.690 --> 01:27:23.692 align:middle line:84%
and why they are placed in
those particular positions,

01:27:23.692 --> 01:27:25.150 align:middle line:84%
and everything else
of that nature.

01:27:25.150 --> 01:27:27.840 align:middle line:90%


01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Now this one was the first
level of consciousness.

01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:35.440 align:middle line:84%
For those of you who know, the
pyramid is based on thirds.

01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:39.240 align:middle line:84%
That's the primary division
factor that is in there.

01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:42.880 align:middle line:90%


01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:45.840 align:middle line:84%
You'll see why they
chose thirds right now.

01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:49.170 align:middle line:84%
The pyramid is used for the
second level of consciousness

01:27:49.170 --> 01:27:51.420 align:middle line:84%
to go to the third
level of consciousness.

01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:55.230 align:middle line:84%
That's its whole soul
purpose and function

01:27:55.230 --> 01:27:57.015 align:middle line:90%
on a consciousness level.

01:27:57.015 --> 01:27:59.840 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of other--
lots and lots and lots

01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:01.336 align:middle line:90%
of other reasons why it exists.

01:28:01.336 --> 01:28:02.136 align:middle line:90%
Huh?

01:28:02.136 --> 01:28:03.360 align:middle line:90%
>>Could you repeat that?

01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>>It's for the
initiation process

01:28:05.620 --> 01:28:08.590 align:middle line:84%
that was designed in
there or tuned in there.

01:28:08.590 --> 01:28:11.340 align:middle line:84%
It was for us to go
Christ consciousness.

01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:14.550 align:middle line:84%
It was not for the aberrational
to come to us, or up there

01:28:14.550 --> 01:28:16.790 align:middle line:84%
for the first level, so
from the second level

01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:18.560 align:middle line:90%
to go to the third level.

01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And if you drew the pyramid
across the Earth right

01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:27.540 align:middle line:84%
here and up to the top,
which I don't have on here,

01:28:27.540 --> 01:28:30.760 align:middle line:84%
you would see that the steps
between the base of the Pyramid

01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:32.780 align:middle line:84%
and the top of the pyramid
would be into fifths.

01:28:32.780 --> 01:28:36.200 align:middle line:90%
It would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:38.590 align:middle line:90%
It's not divisible by 3.

01:28:38.590 --> 01:28:46.730 align:middle line:90%
However, here's the pyramid now.

01:28:46.730 --> 01:28:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And if you notice this
one is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:53.370 align:middle line:90%
which is divisible by 3.

01:28:53.370 --> 01:28:58.905 align:middle line:84%
And the Christ consciousness
one is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,

01:28:58.905 --> 01:29:05.450 align:middle line:84%
9; so also divisible by
3, which is the reason why

01:29:05.450 --> 01:29:06.310 align:middle line:90%
thirds were chosen.

01:29:06.310 --> 01:29:13.060 align:middle line:90%


01:29:13.060 --> 01:29:17.420 align:middle line:84%
Now coming back
to this one, look

01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:19.734 align:middle line:84%
at the black and
white spiraling energy

01:29:19.734 --> 01:29:20.900 align:middle line:90%
that comes out of this area.

01:29:20.900 --> 01:29:23.670 align:middle line:84%
That's why I chose the
square up here before.

01:29:23.670 --> 01:29:27.116 align:middle line:84%
You have a black light
spiral coming like this.

01:29:27.116 --> 01:29:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And you have a
white light spiral

01:29:28.490 --> 01:29:33.020 align:middle line:84%
that just happens to hit the
absolute apex of the pyramid

01:29:33.020 --> 01:29:34.180 align:middle line:90%
and leaves.

01:29:34.180 --> 01:29:35.520 align:middle line:90%
It comes up out there.

01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:41.560 align:middle line:90%


01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And supposing you
wanted to connect in

01:29:44.610 --> 01:29:48.980 align:middle line:84%
with just the
white light spiral.

01:29:48.980 --> 01:29:51.300 align:middle line:84%
These are very powerful
energy beams that are coming

01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:53.135 align:middle line:90%
in out of this massive energy.

01:29:53.135 --> 01:29:55.100 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason why
the mass is so great

01:29:55.100 --> 01:29:57.090 align:middle line:90%
that creates these fields.

01:29:57.090 --> 01:30:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And you want to connect in just
for the white light one, which

01:30:00.210 --> 01:30:03.970 align:middle line:84%
comes out of there and
spirals out, and reaches

01:30:03.970 --> 01:30:06.465 align:middle line:84%
deep, deep, deep,
deep into space.

01:30:06.465 --> 01:30:09.277 align:middle line:90%


01:30:09.277 --> 01:30:11.610 align:middle line:84%
He says it goes all the way
to the center of the galaxy.

01:30:11.610 --> 01:30:12.530 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:30:12.530 --> 01:30:13.450 align:middle line:90%
I guess so.

01:30:13.450 --> 01:30:18.720 align:middle line:90%


01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:21.470 align:middle line:84%
But you've got a certain
electrical problem

01:30:21.470 --> 01:30:24.810 align:middle line:84%
in that right above you, you
have the black light spiral

01:30:24.810 --> 01:30:27.380 align:middle line:90%
originating also.

01:30:27.380 --> 01:30:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And so you say you want to
separate those two things out.

01:30:32.750 --> 01:30:35.932 align:middle line:84%
This was-- the King's
Chamber was put-- here

01:30:35.932 --> 01:30:37.140 align:middle line:90%
is the center of the pyramid.

01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:38.530 align:middle line:90%
It was put off center.

01:30:38.530 --> 01:30:41.927 align:middle line:84%
Where they placed
it was right here.

01:30:41.927 --> 01:30:43.510 align:middle line:84%
They don't know why
it was off center.

01:30:43.510 --> 01:30:45.620 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't on center, because
they wanted to get in here.

01:30:45.620 --> 01:30:47.036 align:middle line:84%
They can't come
up here to get it.

01:30:47.036 --> 01:30:49.170 align:middle line:84%
They can't come down
here, because they

01:30:49.170 --> 01:30:50.340 align:middle line:90%
cross at this point.

01:30:50.340 --> 01:30:52.400 align:middle line:84%
So they came to this
place right here,

01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:54.820 align:middle line:90%
but then they had this problem.

01:30:54.820 --> 01:30:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And that was the reason for
all those chambers going

01:30:57.280 --> 01:31:01.130 align:middle line:84%
in there was to separate
the black from the white,

01:31:01.130 --> 01:31:04.370 align:middle line:84%
get them to two places, so
that when you were sitting

01:31:04.370 --> 01:31:08.090 align:middle line:84%
in the sarcophagus you could
tune into only this one

01:31:08.090 --> 01:31:08.890 align:middle line:90%
energy field.

01:31:08.890 --> 01:31:11.880 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise you'd have both
of them originating there.

01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:14.120 align:middle line:84%
You would be almost
impossible to distinguish one

01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:14.920 align:middle line:90%
from the other.

01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:18.386 align:middle line:90%


01:31:18.386 --> 01:31:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And it was the male energy lines
that they were concerned with,

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:26.146 align:middle line:90%
not the curving female one.

01:31:26.146 --> 01:31:31.500 align:middle line:84%
The curving female one has
no distinguishing mark on it.

01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:37.650 align:middle line:84%
But the male one is countable,
1, 2, 3 set at 90 degree turns.

01:31:37.650 --> 01:31:41.060 align:middle line:90%


01:31:41.060 --> 01:31:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, one more thing to notice
about this arrangement up here,

01:31:46.150 --> 01:31:51.798 align:middle line:84%
if this was the pyramid,
yes, the room is off-center.

01:31:51.798 --> 01:31:55.710 align:middle line:90%


01:31:55.710 --> 01:32:01.600 align:middle line:90%
It sets like that kind of.

01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:04.410 align:middle line:84%
But the sarcophagus
sits in a place

01:32:04.410 --> 01:32:09.148 align:middle line:84%
like this, which is in the
exact center of the pyramid.

01:32:09.148 --> 01:32:12.330 align:middle line:90%


01:32:12.330 --> 01:32:16.460 align:middle line:84%
So when you are laying down in
the sarcophagus with your head

01:32:16.460 --> 01:32:27.156 align:middle line:84%
facing toward the
center of the back wall,

01:32:27.156 --> 01:32:30.280 align:middle line:84%
you have the white light one,
the female one coming in too,

01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:34.469 align:middle line:84%
but they tune the
male one of the white.

01:32:34.469 --> 01:32:35.760 align:middle line:90%
And it would come in like this.

01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:39.240 align:middle line:84%
It would hit the very
center, and rise up,

01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:41.500 align:middle line:84%
come right up from
underneath, come right

01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:43.200 align:middle line:90%
through where the head is.

01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:46.360 align:middle line:84%
So that when you laid down
you could turn your head

01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:48.520 align:middle line:84%
and get it passing
right through the center

01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:50.930 align:middle line:90%
of your pineal gland.

01:32:50.930 --> 01:32:54.900 align:middle line:84%
That was the whole purpose
of what was going on.

01:32:54.900 --> 01:32:58.093 align:middle line:84%
Your head is toward
the door, the same wall

01:32:58.093 --> 01:33:01.573 align:middle line:84%
as the door, which is toward
the center of the-- huh?

01:33:01.573 --> 01:33:03.840 align:middle line:84%
>>Is it north,
south, east or west?

01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:05.840 align:middle line:84%
>>I believe it is
toward the north.

01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:09.870 align:middle line:84%
It's coming up at 45
degree angle right

01:33:09.870 --> 01:33:11.687 align:middle line:90%
through your pineal gland.

01:33:11.687 --> 01:33:16.580 align:middle line:90%


01:33:16.580 --> 01:33:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And there is a little
bit of proof in this

01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:20.700 align:middle line:90%
that that's how they used it.

01:33:20.700 --> 01:33:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Because recently they
have discovered that when

01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:30.980 align:middle line:84%
a person goes into theta
that there is a chemical that

01:33:30.980 --> 01:33:34.330 align:middle line:84%
is excreted from the pituitary
gland right in here, which

01:33:34.330 --> 01:33:36.000 align:middle line:90%
comes out as a sweat.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And then it crystallizes
into this white powder,

01:33:39.210 --> 01:33:43.040 align:middle line:84%
crystalline white powder, if
you stay in there for very long.

01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And when they first had
opened the sarcophagus,

01:33:50.190 --> 01:33:54.710 align:middle line:84%
they noticed all this
white powder at one end.

01:33:54.710 --> 01:33:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And they scooped
it all up and it

01:33:56.310 --> 01:33:57.810 align:middle line:84%
was put into a
little glass vile,

01:33:57.810 --> 01:33:59.860 align:middle line:84%
and it now sits in
the British Museum.

01:33:59.860 --> 01:34:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until just
recently that they discovered

01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:05.110 align:middle line:84%
that it was the same chemical
that's excreted when someone

01:34:05.110 --> 01:34:07.026 align:middle line:90%
is deeply into theta.

01:34:07.026 --> 01:34:10.490 align:middle line:90%


01:34:10.490 --> 01:34:13.480 align:middle line:90%
And it was a lot of powder.

01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:16.300 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just one guy
dying, and having a good time

01:34:16.300 --> 01:34:17.100 align:middle line:90%
dying in there.

01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:24.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean it was a lot of people
over a long period of time,

01:34:24.490 --> 01:34:26.240 align:middle line:84%
unless he had a real
sweaty gland I guess.

01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:30.370 align:middle line:90%


01:34:30.370 --> 01:34:33.650 align:middle line:84%
So, what they would
do is after going

01:34:33.650 --> 01:34:35.580 align:middle line:84%
through 12 years of
the left eye of Horus,

01:34:35.580 --> 01:34:37.070 align:middle line:84%
and 12 years of
the right of Horus,

01:34:37.070 --> 01:34:38.920 align:middle line:90%
and then you were all ready.

01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:41.410 align:middle line:84%
They took you, and they put
you into the sarcophagus.

01:34:41.410 --> 01:34:43.005 align:middle line:84%
They put the lid on,
and they left you

01:34:43.005 --> 01:34:45.340 align:middle line:84%
in there for approximately
three and a half days.

01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:48.380 align:middle line:90%


01:34:48.380 --> 01:34:51.870 align:middle line:84%
And then you would
tune to that field,

01:34:51.870 --> 01:34:57.120 align:middle line:84%
and you would follow the
energy out, to be turning.

01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:00.342 align:middle line:84%
If it was a logarithmic spiral
that they had taken off on,

01:35:00.342 --> 01:35:01.800 align:middle line:84%
if there's no
beginning and no end,

01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:05.140 align:middle line:84%
they would not know
how to come back.

01:35:05.140 --> 01:35:10.290 align:middle line:84%
But because it was Fibonacci,
and it has a starting point,

01:35:10.290 --> 01:35:13.548 align:middle line:90%
they can count the turns.

01:35:13.548 --> 01:35:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And they were
trained to do this.

01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:17.460 align:middle line:84%
They could count their
turns right back,

01:35:17.460 --> 01:35:22.770 align:middle line:84%
and come back at 5, 3, 2, 1,
1, and back in their body.

01:35:22.770 --> 01:35:24.912 align:middle line:84%
They could locate their
body in the spiral.

01:35:24.912 --> 01:35:28.340 align:middle line:90%


01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And that was all
part of the training.

01:35:30.030 --> 01:35:32.162 align:middle line:90%
This is according to Thoth.

01:35:32.162 --> 01:35:36.150 align:middle line:84%
It's so outrageous that how
could anybody ever-- anybody

01:35:36.150 --> 01:35:38.430 align:middle line:84%
ever just figure it
out, I don't know.

01:35:38.430 --> 01:35:42.660 align:middle line:90%
But that is what they did.

01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And then once they had
that, they got out of there.

01:35:45.210 --> 01:35:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And they were like totally
blown away from it all.

01:35:49.470 --> 01:35:54.928 align:middle line:10%
They were then brought down into
the Queen's Chamber, from which

01:35:54.928 --> 01:36:00.920 align:middle line:10%
in Queen's Chamber it was some
kind of stabilizing experience.

01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:05.070 align:middle line:10%
So that they wouldn't
lose the experience.

01:36:05.070 --> 01:36:09.090 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times you can have
a very powerful experience

01:36:09.090 --> 01:36:12.650 align:middle line:84%
in life, and then as you
start going through life,

01:36:12.650 --> 01:36:16.170 align:middle line:84%
it kind of fades
away and gets weaker.

01:36:16.170 --> 01:36:18.960 align:middle line:84%
They did something to them
in the Queen's Chamber

01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:20.580 align:middle line:90%
that would lock it in.

01:36:20.580 --> 01:36:22.515 align:middle line:84%
So they wouldn't
lose the experience.

01:36:22.515 --> 01:36:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not exactly
sure what that was.

01:36:25.340 --> 01:36:28.380 align:middle line:84%
But there was something that
leads into the Queen's Chamber,

01:36:28.380 --> 01:36:36.880 align:middle line:84%
a very little known
thing, which might

01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:38.920 align:middle line:90%
bring this home a little bit.

01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:42.520 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember the
Shroud of Turin, of Jesus,

01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:45.230 align:middle line:90%
and the face that was on there?

01:36:45.230 --> 01:36:49.870 align:middle line:84%
Recently they have discovered,
well that shroud they believe,

01:36:49.870 --> 01:36:53.100 align:middle line:84%
they don't know how
the image was created.

01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:56.070 align:middle line:84%
But through intense
analysis of it,

01:36:56.070 --> 01:37:00.170 align:middle line:84%
it appears to be made by
some intense blast of heat.

01:37:00.170 --> 01:37:01.260 align:middle line:90%
That's all they can say.

01:37:01.260 --> 01:37:03.250 align:middle line:84%
But they don't know
exactly how it happened.

01:37:03.250 --> 01:37:06.543 align:middle line:84%
And she has a
picture of it here.

01:37:06.543 --> 01:37:08.810 align:middle line:90%
>>This is positive image.

01:37:08.810 --> 01:37:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>>This is a positive
rather than the negative.

01:37:12.790 --> 01:37:16.520 align:middle line:84%
Well they have discovered
more or less recently

01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:24.090 align:middle line:84%
this same image leading into
the Queen's Chamber on the stone

01:37:24.090 --> 01:37:26.000 align:middle line:90%
by a process totally unknown.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.225 align:middle line:84%
It's only about this
big, and it's up high.

01:37:28.225 --> 01:37:32.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's right as
you go into it.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And it appears to be
the exact same image

01:37:34.270 --> 01:37:35.950 align:middle line:90%
as the Shroud of Turin.

01:37:35.950 --> 01:37:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And also as they've analyzed
that, it appears to be

01:37:38.570 --> 01:37:41.950 align:middle line:84%
have done by some kind
of intense blast of heat.

01:37:41.950 --> 01:37:46.748 align:middle line:84%
But they don't know what it
was or how it was created.

01:37:46.748 --> 01:37:52.656 align:middle line:84%
Which is hardly anyone knows
about that little thing.

01:37:52.656 --> 01:37:54.102 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

01:37:54.102 --> 01:37:56.512 align:middle line:84%
>>When I was in the King's
Chamber a year ago January,

01:37:56.512 --> 01:38:00.366 align:middle line:84%
in the sarcophagus,
there is no lid--

01:38:00.366 --> 01:38:02.115 align:middle line:84%
>>They took the lid
away as long time ago.

01:38:02.115 --> 01:38:03.570 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

01:38:03.570 --> 01:38:08.380 align:middle line:84%
>>The lid can be turned sideways
and it can go through easily.

01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:10.700 align:middle line:84%
It's only just about an
inch all the way around.

01:38:10.700 --> 01:38:12.470 align:middle line:90%
The lid can be turned.

01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:13.852 align:middle line:90%
The sarcophagus is that high.

01:38:13.852 --> 01:38:14.652 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

01:38:14.652 --> 01:38:16.540 align:middle line:90%
And you climb into it.

01:38:16.540 --> 01:38:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>>And the lid is
about this wide.

01:38:18.590 --> 01:38:21.260 align:middle line:84%
The lid could go out, and
that's why it's no longer there.

01:38:21.260 --> 01:38:23.730 align:middle line:84%
But the sarcophagus
can't go out.

01:38:23.730 --> 01:38:25.310 align:middle line:90%
This is the King's Chamber.

01:38:25.310 --> 01:38:26.980 align:middle line:90%
This is the Queen's Chamber.

01:38:26.980 --> 01:38:29.821 align:middle line:84%
And this is the well,
and this is the pit.

01:38:29.821 --> 01:38:31.070 align:middle line:90%
And this is the Grand Gallery.

01:38:31.070 --> 01:38:37.671 align:middle line:90%


01:38:37.671 --> 01:38:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Now the other-- that was
the middle initiation.

01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:46.310 align:middle line:84%
There's three
initiations altogether.

01:38:46.310 --> 01:38:53.100 align:middle line:84%
The first initiation
begins down here.

01:38:53.100 --> 01:38:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Now there's a room down
here with a tunnel that just

01:38:55.540 --> 01:38:58.202 align:middle line:90%
goes down and ends in nowhere.

01:38:58.202 --> 01:39:00.110 align:middle line:84%
They don't have any
idea of why it's there.

01:39:00.110 --> 01:39:01.670 align:middle line:90%
They don't know.

01:39:01.670 --> 01:39:04.262 align:middle line:84%
They've got a pretty good idea
now, because we told them.

01:39:04.262 --> 01:39:07.110 align:middle line:90%


01:39:07.110 --> 01:39:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And they sealed it
off with big bars

01:39:08.610 --> 01:39:11.060 align:middle line:84%
to make sure nobody
gets in there.

01:39:11.060 --> 01:39:15.370 align:middle line:10%
But they did know that
it was really strange.

01:39:15.370 --> 01:39:19.395 align:middle line:10%
Because when we first got
there they had barred it off up

01:39:19.395 --> 01:39:20.540 align:middle line:10%
at the top.

01:39:20.540 --> 01:39:22.040 align:middle line:10%
They just barred
the whole thing off

01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:23.498 align:middle line:10%
and made it illegal
to go in there.

01:39:23.498 --> 01:39:25.920 align:middle line:10%
I mean you went in
there, right to jail.

01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:28.389 align:middle line:10%
I mean they just even had a
guy with a machine gun sitting

01:39:28.389 --> 01:39:30.930 align:middle line:10%
there for a long time, to make
sure that no one messed around

01:39:30.930 --> 01:39:31.770 align:middle line:10%
with it.

01:39:31.770 --> 01:39:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And the reason was because so
many people that had went down

01:39:35.060 --> 01:39:39.980 align:middle line:84%
there had died, lots of
them or had been maimed

01:39:39.980 --> 01:39:42.980 align:middle line:84%
or had been poisoned,
or sent into hospitals.

01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And by means that no
one can understand,

01:39:46.910 --> 01:39:49.535 align:middle line:84%
they have found
poisonous snakes down

01:39:49.535 --> 01:39:51.900 align:middle line:84%
in there that don't
exist in Egypt,

01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:55.890 align:middle line:84%
or poisonous spiders that
don't exist in Egypt.

01:39:55.890 --> 01:39:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Poisonous gases have
just appeared out

01:39:58.470 --> 01:40:01.700 align:middle line:84%
of nowhere, on and on and
on with stuff like this.

01:40:01.700 --> 01:40:03.460 align:middle line:90%
And it's all documented.

01:40:03.460 --> 01:40:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And the government will clearly
admit to the whole thing.

01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:09.290 align:middle line:84%
They just don't know
what is going down there.

01:40:09.290 --> 01:40:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And so they just sealed
the whole thing off

01:40:11.490 --> 01:40:13.140 align:middle line:90%
and won't let you in there.

01:40:13.140 --> 01:40:16.370 align:middle line:84%
We have clearly shown to them
that that's not the problem.

01:40:16.370 --> 01:40:18.750 align:middle line:84%
The problem is at the
end of this tunnel.

01:40:18.750 --> 01:40:21.910 align:middle line:84%
And so since then they
have opened the doors up,

01:40:21.910 --> 01:40:23.550 align:middle line:90%
and you can now go down in here.

01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:25.600 align:middle line:84%
But the tunnel is
blocked off and sealed.

01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:27.200 align:middle line:90%
So you can't get inside of it.

01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:28.390 align:middle line:90%
There's big, heavy bars.

01:40:28.390 --> 01:40:30.732 align:middle line:90%
Did you have a quick question?

01:40:30.732 --> 01:40:31.532 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:40:31.532 --> 01:40:34.490 align:middle line:90%
What is the pit?

01:40:34.490 --> 01:40:36.300 align:middle line:90%
>>Who knows?

01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:38.666 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows what the pit is.

01:40:38.666 --> 01:40:40.960 align:middle line:84%
The pit is the mystery
of the pyramid for me.

01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:44.840 align:middle line:90%
The pit is a room.

01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:45.700 align:middle line:90%
It's a big pit.

01:40:45.700 --> 01:40:50.420 align:middle line:90%


01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:53.760 align:middle line:84%
But-- that's where
they put the workers.

01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:55.800 align:middle line:90%


01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:56.600 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:58.380 align:middle line:84%
But on the edge of
this pit, is what

01:40:58.380 --> 01:41:05.360 align:middle line:84%
looks like a golden
mean, a big, huge block,

01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:08.710 align:middle line:84%
polished clean
smooth of granite.

01:41:08.710 --> 01:41:10.450 align:middle line:90%
I think it's granite.

01:41:10.450 --> 01:41:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like you
can just push it over,

01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:15.450 align:middle line:90%
and it would fall.

01:41:15.450 --> 01:41:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And I've sat and thought
about this a long time.

01:41:18.060 --> 01:41:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure it's meant to
fall at the right moment.

01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:25.660 align:middle line:84%
It will, and probably it will
shake whole Earth somehow.

01:41:25.660 --> 01:41:27.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
it's meant to do.

01:41:27.900 --> 01:41:31.830 align:middle line:84%
But that block is ready
to go, and it isn't--

01:41:31.830 --> 01:41:34.710 align:middle line:90%
>>It looks like a womb.

01:41:34.710 --> 01:41:38.642 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, that isn't
the exact shape of it.

01:41:38.642 --> 01:41:39.570 align:middle line:90%
A womb?

01:41:39.570 --> 01:41:46.650 align:middle line:90%


01:41:46.650 --> 01:41:50.090 align:middle line:84%
Don't let that lady
see any ink blots.

01:41:50.090 --> 01:41:52.540 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:41:52.540 --> 01:41:55.480 align:middle line:90%


01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:57.930 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:41:57.930 --> 01:41:59.650 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I don't know
what the pit is.

01:41:59.650 --> 01:42:00.560 align:middle line:90%
I really don't know.

01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:01.360 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sorry.

01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:06.590 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know what it is, but
it is something very special.

01:42:06.590 --> 01:42:08.760 align:middle line:84%
It's like when Al
what's-his-name came in through

01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:09.920 align:middle line:90%
here.

01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:13.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't what his Muslim name
is, 300 or 400 years ago.

01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:15.000 align:middle line:90%
There was a door right here.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And the door was such that if
you just touched it just right,

01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:19.630 align:middle line:90%
it would open up.

01:42:19.630 --> 01:42:21.130 align:middle line:90%
And there were all the stories.

01:42:21.130 --> 01:42:23.505 align:middle line:84%
He had read all the stories
about how they could do that,

01:42:23.505 --> 01:42:24.820 align:middle line:90%
and had gone in there.

01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:27.350 align:middle line:84%
It would swing on
a hinge like this.

01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:28.960 align:middle line:90%
But he could ever find it.

01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:31.832 align:middle line:84%
I mean because the seams
are just sealed like,

01:42:31.832 --> 01:42:34.230 align:middle line:84%
you can't even get
paper between them.

01:42:34.230 --> 01:42:35.529 align:middle line:90%
So they dug in here.

01:42:35.529 --> 01:42:36.445 align:middle line:90%
They dug through here.

01:42:36.445 --> 01:42:38.230 align:middle line:84%
They dug through the whole
tunnel and everything

01:42:38.230 --> 01:42:39.030 align:middle line:90%
like that.

01:42:39.030 --> 01:42:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And when they were getting
down here, close to over

01:42:41.860 --> 01:42:46.270 align:middle line:84%
in this area over in
there, they suddenly

01:42:46.270 --> 01:42:52.110 align:middle line:84%
heard these huge sounds,
these giant massive blocks

01:42:52.110 --> 01:43:00.120 align:middle line:84%
were sliding down a thing,
sealing off the entryway

01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:01.450 align:middle line:90%
into the King's Chamber.

01:43:01.450 --> 01:43:05.197 align:middle line:84%
The pyramid knew
they were coming in.

01:43:05.197 --> 01:43:07.030 align:middle line:84%
But it was also the
downfall of the pyramid.

01:43:07.030 --> 01:43:08.410 align:middle line:90%
Because they heard the sound.

01:43:08.410 --> 01:43:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And they started digging
toward the sound,

01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:15.505 align:middle line:84%
and found this tunnel, and
then found their way back out.

01:43:15.505 --> 01:43:17.060 align:middle line:84%
If they hadn't have
heard the sound,

01:43:17.060 --> 01:43:18.050 align:middle line:84%
they would have just
kept going right

01:43:18.050 --> 01:43:20.283 align:middle line:84%
into the middle of this pyramid
and never probably would

01:43:20.283 --> 01:43:21.283 align:middle line:90%
have found their way in.

01:43:21.283 --> 01:43:23.420 align:middle line:90%


01:43:23.420 --> 01:43:26.490 align:middle line:90%
Did you have a quick question?

01:43:26.490 --> 01:43:30.294 align:middle line:84%
>>Where does that tunnel go,
the one that [INAUDIBLE]?

01:43:30.294 --> 01:43:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>>Where does this tunnel go?

01:43:31.460 --> 01:43:32.260 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:43:32.260 --> 01:43:33.290 align:middle line:90%
What's it all about?

01:43:33.290 --> 01:43:34.090 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, OK.

01:43:34.090 --> 01:43:36.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell
a story about it.

01:43:36.990 --> 01:43:39.375 align:middle line:84%
And it is a
fourth-dimensional tunnel.

01:43:39.375 --> 01:43:41.500 align:middle line:84%
This is why all these things
would appear in there.

01:43:41.500 --> 01:43:43.600 align:middle line:84%
You go into the
fourth dimension.

01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:46.490 align:middle line:84%
The end of it extends
into the fourth dimension.

01:43:46.490 --> 01:43:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And when you go in
there, whatever you think

01:43:49.100 --> 01:43:54.280 align:middle line:84%
and whatever you feel,
literally happens.

01:43:54.280 --> 01:43:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're uninitiated
and you go in there,

01:43:56.560 --> 01:44:00.560 align:middle line:84%
and you have any fears,
they become real.

01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:03.810 align:middle line:84%
If you're afraid of something
then that thing becomes real,

01:44:03.810 --> 01:44:06.080 align:middle line:90%
and it'll kill you.

01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:09.320 align:middle line:84%
If it's your fear, if your fear
is of drowning the whole place

01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:12.280 align:middle line:90%
would fill up with water.

01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:16.000 align:middle line:84%
You can't have any fears and
go into the fourth dimension,

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.526 align:middle line:90%
or they will become real.

01:44:18.526 --> 01:44:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk
about that a lot too.

01:44:21.390 --> 01:44:22.190 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:44:22.190 --> 01:44:23.690 align:middle line:84%
>>You were going
to tell us a story.

01:44:23.690 --> 01:44:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>>Did you just say this was
the first level of initiation?

01:44:27.050 --> 01:44:29.161 align:middle line:84%
>>This is the first
level of initiation.

01:44:29.161 --> 01:44:31.586 align:middle line:84%
>>Why did you have all your
fears manifest before you went

01:44:31.586 --> 01:44:32.250 align:middle line:90%
into--

01:44:32.250 --> 01:44:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>>You have to work
with those first.

01:44:33.810 --> 01:44:36.530 align:middle line:90%


01:44:36.530 --> 01:44:39.004 align:middle line:84%
The first 12 years
of training, which

01:44:39.004 --> 01:44:40.670 align:middle line:84%
we're going to show
you in a little bit,

01:44:40.670 --> 01:44:42.120 align:middle line:90%
was the left eye of Horus.

01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:44.381 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you
dealt with all your fears.

01:44:44.381 --> 01:44:45.880 align:middle line:84%
Once you got through
all your fears,

01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:47.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean you've got
to be in the place

01:44:47.380 --> 01:44:51.300 align:middle line:84%
where you can be so fearless
that if they said anything,

01:44:51.300 --> 01:44:54.504 align:middle line:84%
you'd be able to do it
without even a heartbeat,

01:44:54.504 --> 01:44:56.170 align:middle line:84%
and could not be
afraid of dying at all,

01:44:56.170 --> 01:45:00.140 align:middle line:84%
in any way, shape, or form,
or any of the other fears

01:45:00.140 --> 01:45:01.940 align:middle line:84%
that are associated
with humankind.

01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:03.147 align:middle line:90%
You could be fearless.

01:45:03.147 --> 01:45:04.730 align:middle line:84%
It's the only way
you can get through.

01:45:04.730 --> 01:45:08.516 align:middle line:84%
And all the world's
religions dealt with this.

01:45:08.516 --> 01:45:10.670 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were
incredible, the things

01:45:10.670 --> 01:45:15.230 align:middle line:84%
they would do to get you to
get into a fearless state.

01:45:15.230 --> 01:45:17.174 align:middle line:84%
And then the 12
years after that was

01:45:17.174 --> 01:45:18.590 align:middle line:84%
the training on
the mental planes,

01:45:18.590 --> 01:45:19.670 align:middle line:84%
and stuff like
the kind of things

01:45:19.670 --> 01:45:21.850 align:middle line:84%
that we're going through
to get the understanding.

01:45:21.850 --> 01:45:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And then once you had the
emotional and mental balance

01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:26.470 align:middle line:84%
in all this stuff,
then they would

01:45:26.470 --> 01:45:30.210 align:middle line:84%
have you begin in this
little chamber down here.

01:45:30.210 --> 01:45:32.875 align:middle line:84%
Let me show you why
the wall, this tunnel

01:45:32.875 --> 01:45:34.500 align:middle line:84%
just goes out in the
middle of nowhere.

01:45:34.500 --> 01:45:42.040 align:middle line:90%


01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:46.285 align:middle line:84%
Look what happens with
the black light spiral.

01:45:46.285 --> 01:45:49.050 align:middle line:90%
It comes right down here.

01:45:49.050 --> 01:45:52.110 align:middle line:84%
So what they did is they
had the room was right here.

01:45:52.110 --> 01:45:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And they dug the tunnel over
to where the black light spiral

01:45:58.220 --> 01:45:59.060 align:middle line:90%
arm was reached.

01:45:59.060 --> 01:46:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And they did it down
here and not up here,

01:46:02.020 --> 01:46:04.650 align:middle line:84%
because this goes
to a zero point.

01:46:04.650 --> 01:46:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't want to get
up in here, because whoever

01:46:07.550 --> 01:46:11.130 align:middle line:84%
got it up in here would have
to go through the great void.

01:46:11.130 --> 01:46:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to catch
it after it was outside

01:46:14.580 --> 01:46:17.690 align:middle line:84%
of the great void, after it
got outside of zero point,

01:46:17.690 --> 01:46:19.030 align:middle line:90%
and take it from there.

01:46:19.030 --> 01:46:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And that one wraps around,
and goes and connects in

01:46:21.450 --> 01:46:24.190 align:middle line:90%
with the center of the Earth.

01:46:24.190 --> 01:46:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And so it begins with the
experience that takes you

01:46:27.510 --> 01:46:29.820 align:middle line:84%
into the darkness, rather
than into the light,

01:46:29.820 --> 01:46:31.191 align:middle line:90%
or the Halls of Amenti.

01:46:31.191 --> 01:46:32.190 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's called.

01:46:32.190 --> 01:46:36.840 align:middle line:84%
It's literally an
infinite space.

01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And so the same way
there's this long tunnel.

01:46:41.700 --> 01:46:51.890 align:middle line:90%


01:46:51.890 --> 01:46:55.745 align:middle line:84%
There's this tunnel,
and you've got this--

01:46:55.745 --> 01:46:57.860 align:middle line:84%
I believe it actually
comes from this direction

01:46:57.860 --> 01:47:02.640 align:middle line:84%
now that I think
about it, like this.

01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And the person would
sit-- originally they

01:47:05.910 --> 01:47:08.630 align:middle line:84%
would sit with their
knees folded up like this.

01:47:08.630 --> 01:47:12.542 align:middle line:84%
But the tunnel is
only about that high.

01:47:12.542 --> 01:47:14.580 align:middle line:90%
And we can't do that.

01:47:14.580 --> 01:47:20.145 align:middle line:84%
So what I had to do was to lay
down with my body like this.

01:47:20.145 --> 01:47:23.220 align:middle line:90%


01:47:23.220 --> 01:47:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And the new line that beamed
up, you could feel it.

01:47:26.180 --> 01:47:30.179 align:middle line:84%
It feels like somebody's got
a-- it's real, real strong.

01:47:30.179 --> 01:47:31.220 align:middle line:90%
I mean you can't miss it.

01:47:31.220 --> 01:47:36.260 align:middle line:84%
There's no way could
possibly miss this one.

01:47:36.260 --> 01:47:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And we've got 2 and
1/2 million blocks

01:47:40.830 --> 01:47:45.300 align:middle line:90%
of mass forming this thing.

01:47:45.300 --> 01:47:46.950 align:middle line:90%
And then we all had to lay down.

01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:50.060 align:middle line:90%
There was five of us, like this.

01:47:50.060 --> 01:47:51.950 align:middle line:90%
But the hieroglyphics.

01:47:51.950 --> 01:47:55.050 align:middle line:84%
When you see the
hieroglyphics around this,

01:47:55.050 --> 01:47:59.998 align:middle line:84%
you'll see them like
this sitting like this.

01:47:59.998 --> 01:48:02.670 align:middle line:90%
And this will be Osiris.

01:48:02.670 --> 01:48:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And there will be like
40 or 50 of these guys

01:48:04.780 --> 01:48:05.580 align:middle line:90%
inside this tunnel.

01:48:05.580 --> 01:48:08.710 align:middle line:84%
This tunnel is 75
feet or 100 feet long.

01:48:08.710 --> 01:48:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And so Osiris will be sitting
here, facing that way,

01:48:11.990 --> 01:48:14.826 align:middle line:84%
and then all these other
people will be facing this way.

01:48:14.826 --> 01:48:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And he's taking them
into the Halls of Amenti.

01:48:18.290 --> 01:48:20.501 align:middle line:90%
