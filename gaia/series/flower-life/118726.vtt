00:00:00.994 --> 00:00:04.473 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.473 --> 00:00:17.420 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>>So another thing that
happens at these two poles,

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.120 align:middle line:84%
the two places on the
precession of the equinoxes,

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.750 align:middle line:84%
is that there tends to be
a shifting of the poles

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.729 align:middle line:90%
at the axis of the earth.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, it was Edgar Cayce
who first brought this

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.660 align:middle line:84%
to our attention
by his predictions.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And of course, when he
first brought that up

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.370 align:middle line:84%
in the predictions,
the belief at that time

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.110 align:middle line:84%
was that the poles never
shifted, except for maybe

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.500 align:middle line:90%
100 million years or something.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.230 align:middle line:84%
They figured it was sort of
fixed forever kind of thing

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.880 align:middle line:90%
and that never took place.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And it was probably
people who evolved

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.090 align:middle line:84%
in the ARE that begin to
do research to see what

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.850 align:middle line:90%
the truth of the matter was.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And they discovered that the
poles had shifted a mere 10,000

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.310 align:middle line:90%
BC, 10,500 BC.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.070 align:middle line:84%
When you look at when that
is, that's 12,500 years ago,

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.100 align:middle line:84%
which is right back under
the-- approximately,

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.170 align:middle line:84%
very close to the time
where we were exactly right

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.960 align:middle line:84%
on the other side of
the-- on the other point

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.360 align:middle line:90%
on the other side.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.470 align:middle line:84%
The way they did
that was they knew

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.220 align:middle line:84%
that there would be a lot of
volcanic action at the time.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.710 align:middle line:90%
They want to old volcano fields.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.670 align:middle line:84%
Lava tends to turn hard,
or iron pilings in the lava

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.780 align:middle line:84%
turn hard before
the lava solidifies.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.350 align:middle line:84%
And they are perfect
spheres, so they line up

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.780 align:middle line:84%
to the magnetic field, and
then the lava solidifies.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And so you can see
the magnetic lines

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.050 align:middle line:84%
where the-- all you can tell
is where the magnetic pole was

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.860 align:middle line:84%
rather than the actual
pole, which are usually

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:00.990 align:middle line:90%
relatively close together.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.270 align:middle line:90%


00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And so they went to three
of these old lava fields

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.800 align:middle line:84%
and crossed them
over, and then they

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.420 align:middle line:84%
could pinpoint where the
magnetic North Pole was.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And then they can carbon
date those things.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Though, there's
better procedures now.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.240 align:middle line:84%
Radiocarbon dating was the
best one they had at the time.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And they were able to get it to
this time of about 10,500 BC.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.390 align:middle line:90%
But where did this crossover?

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.740 align:middle line:90%
Almost dead center in Hawaii.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.150 align:middle line:90%


00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And then, they did
it one more time

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.920 align:middle line:84%
and found that the poles had
shifted one more time back,

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.252 align:middle line:90%
which is where we are right now.

00:02:48.252 --> 00:02:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And I don't remember where
they had found it at that time.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And when they found that
it had happened twice

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.560 align:middle line:84%
in a row in one cycle, then
they made a serious study.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.510 align:middle line:84%
Using a different system, they
went into the ocean floors

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.666 align:middle line:84%
and began to take these 6 inch
11 foot-long core samples out

00:03:07.666 --> 00:03:09.980 align:middle line:90%
of the floor of the ocean.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.530 align:middle line:84%
And they could read
the sediment in there.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And began to discover
that the poles have

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.480 align:middle line:90%
shifted millions of times.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And not only had they shifted
in moving around like this,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.400 align:middle line:84%
but many times had
switched like that.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.770 align:middle line:84%
North became the South and
South became the North.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.070 align:middle line:90%
North became the South.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.330 align:middle line:90%
The polarity actually shifted.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And this is out of the
Geographical Society of America

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.490 align:middle line:84%
where they have gone back for
hundreds of millions of years

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.020 align:middle line:84%
and discovered-- this is
the oldest time here--

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.390 align:middle line:84%
that for a long time, the North
Pole remained the North Pole.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.920 align:middle line:90%
And then one day, it switched.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.910 align:middle line:84%
In less than 20
hours, just like that.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.210 align:middle line:90%
One day it switched.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And then, it stayed that way
for a few thousands of years,

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.220 align:middle line:90%
and then switched again.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And then there was this pattern
of switching back and forth.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.730 align:middle line:84%
But as you can see,
here it was all North.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.554 align:middle line:84%
And now, there's a
long period where

00:04:18.554 --> 00:04:21.899 align:middle line:84%
it was primarily South with
little pieces in the middle.

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And then as we get more and more
into present-day time-- we're

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.910 align:middle line:84%
talking about long
periods of time

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.270 align:middle line:84%
here-- it kept switching back
and forth, back and forth,

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.390 align:middle line:90%
back and forth.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.480 align:middle line:84%
That's not talking
about meandering.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.730 align:middle line:84%
That's talking about actual--
doing this kind of thing

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.040 align:middle line:90%
as well as meandering.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And so they begin to
realize that there's

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.040 align:middle line:84%
been a lot of activity
in this pole thing.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And then, there's books
out there, by John White,

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.300 align:middle line:84%
for example, right now,
which is called "Pole Shift."

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.120 align:middle line:84%
Another ARE person,
who has researched just

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.840 align:middle line:84%
about everything on
the planet about that,

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.185 align:middle line:84%
going into all the
theories of John Brown

00:05:00.185 --> 00:05:02.820 align:middle line:90%
and all kinds of other people.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And the more you realize
and you start gathering up

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.500 align:middle line:84%
the data on this subject,
it's rather remarkable what's

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.220 align:middle line:84%
been going on on the planet
that's happened a lot of times.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And what they've discovered
is that when it does happen,

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.490 align:middle line:90%
it is just like that.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.250 align:middle line:90%
In less than one day, wham.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And many things have been
written about the triggers that

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:29.090 align:middle line:90%
cause this.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.750 align:middle line:84%
What is the trigger
that makes this happen?

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.670 align:middle line:84%
The John Brown theories,
and other people

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.570 align:middle line:84%
that are associated
with him and everything,

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.500 align:middle line:84%
think that it is the South
Pole or one of the poles,

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.730 align:middle line:84%
the ice forms off-center,
which is what's happening

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:43.896 align:middle line:90%
right now at the South Pole.

00:05:43.896 --> 00:05:45.900 align:middle line:90%
The ice cap is off-center.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And if that mass
keeps building up,

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.650 align:middle line:84%
which is building up
right now, and has

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.254 align:middle line:84%
been at a phenomenal rate--
it's about 2 and 1/2 or 3 miles,

00:05:54.254 --> 00:05:56.720 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it is, deep.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's building up just
phenomenally off-center.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, just like any
physical object,

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.190 align:middle line:84%
if you put a weight on a
spinning object off-center

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:09.240 align:middle line:84%
enough, it's going to find
a new center at some point.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.265 align:middle line:84%
And they believe that
that's what it is.

00:06:12.265 --> 00:06:14.640 align:middle line:84%
That the poles will build up
to a certain degree and that

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.730 align:middle line:90%
will happen.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And a real interesting
thing has happened today

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.500 align:middle line:84%
at this very minute in
the South Pole is a huge--

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.650 align:middle line:84%
and the satellites are-- there's
a lot of people concerned

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:28.620 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.535 align:middle line:84%
Not only is this mass built
up off-center and is huge

00:06:32.535 --> 00:06:35.820 align:middle line:84%
and is immense, but there's a
volcano going on underneath it

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:36.620 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.420 align:middle line:90%
>>Wow.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:38.870 align:middle line:90%
>>And it's glowing.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.710 align:middle line:84%
They can see from
the satellite space.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And these huge rivers are
spreading out from underneath,

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.070 align:middle line:84%
melting the ice
underneath the cap.

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.340 align:middle line:90%


00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.330 align:middle line:84%
If that cap breaks
loose, they calculate

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.040 align:middle line:84%
it will move at 1,700 miles
an hour toward the equator.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.690 align:middle line:90%


00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.940 align:middle line:84%
So if you could imagine
something the size

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.035 align:middle line:84%
of a continent moving
1,700 miles an hour

00:07:02.035 --> 00:07:03.454 align:middle line:90%
toward the equator.

00:07:03.454 --> 00:07:05.120 align:middle line:84%
If your imagination
can handle that one,

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.115 align:middle line:84%
you can imagine what that would
do to life on this planet.

00:07:08.115 --> 00:07:10.290 align:middle line:84%
It would not quite be
the same after that.

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:14.620 align:middle line:90%


00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.410 align:middle line:90%
That is one of the theories.

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.259 align:middle line:84%
They've now discovered
another one, though.

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:20.300 align:middle line:84%
Another trigger that could
happen that they never

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.626 align:middle line:90%
dreamed of before.

00:07:21.626 --> 00:07:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And that is a certain
distance down into the earth,

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.030 align:middle line:84%
there's a certain
kind of rock in there.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:29.306 align:middle line:84%
And the rock is held
together electronically.

00:07:29.306 --> 00:07:31.604 align:middle line:90%


00:07:31.604 --> 00:07:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And they've been
able to duplicate

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.210 align:middle line:84%
this in the labs, where
if the poles did--

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:41.470 align:middle line:84%
if the electronic nature of the
magnetic field were to stop,

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:44.040 align:middle line:84%
and we have-- the magnetic
field of the earth

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.047 align:middle line:84%
has been reducing dramatically
over the last 500 years,

00:07:47.047 --> 00:07:49.630 align:middle line:84%
getting weaker and weaker, and
weaker, and weaker, and weaker.

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:55.210 align:middle line:84%
If it did come to a place where
that stopped for even a second,

00:07:55.210 --> 00:08:02.120 align:middle line:84%
this rock turns to liquid,
like oil, rather than a solid.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.740 align:middle line:90%
And so we'd have a solid shell.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.165 align:middle line:84%
We'd have a solid shell
with oil in the middle.

00:08:06.165 --> 00:08:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And the outer surface could
move at phenomenal speeds.

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And they've been able to
duplicate this in there.

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:13.710 align:middle line:90%
And they said, holy cow.

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:15.797 align:middle line:84%
We're just sitting
on a time bomb.

00:08:15.797 --> 00:08:17.380 align:middle line:84%
If the electrical
nature of the planet

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:21.154 align:middle line:84%
were to change real
fast in some way,

00:08:21.154 --> 00:08:25.700 align:middle line:84%
that could also be one of
the triggering mechanisms.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.760 align:middle line:90%
So it's real interesting.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And you can see where there are
huge depressions in the earth,

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:31.020 align:middle line:90%
like in Hudson Bay.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.549 align:middle line:84%
And there's some
other places where

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:36.520 align:middle line:84%
they believe that
one of the poles

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.740 align:middle line:84%
was there with this
big ice cap that pushed

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:40.179 align:middle line:90%
the pressure of the earth.

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:42.500 align:middle line:90%
Because this ice is heavy.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.140 align:middle line:90%
You pick up a bucket of ice.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.310 align:middle line:84%
Imagine it being
2, 3 miles deep.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:50.120 align:middle line:90%
It's extremely heavy.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And in just a
moment, we're going

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.280 align:middle line:84%
to look at the John Hamaker
theories of the greenhouse

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.310 align:middle line:84%
effect and you can see how
that also affects other things.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:00.100 align:middle line:90%


00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:04.510 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, at the time that
these things take place,

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:08.860 align:middle line:84%
we usually have-- accompanied
with a dimensional

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:12.480 align:middle line:84%
or a consciousness change,
we have a very rapid change

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.400 align:middle line:84%
in the geography
of the planet. .

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And these changes just
show you how fast they are.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.400 align:middle line:84%
When you go up into Siberia
and you look into what

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.110 align:middle line:84%
happened in the
very, very last one.

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:27.660 align:middle line:84%
It's been carbon dated
to one 13,000 years ago.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:33.820 align:middle line:84%
You find animals, and trees, and
humans, and all these things,

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.440 align:middle line:90%
ripped apart.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.550 align:middle line:84%
Torn, and thrown,
and slammed together,

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:43.440 align:middle line:84%
and then frozen at some
unbelievable speed.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.660 align:middle line:84%
They've got all these theories
in how this could possibly

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:51.753 align:middle line:84%
take place, which are pretty
exciting when these gases go up

00:09:51.753 --> 00:09:55.130 align:middle line:84%
in the air and come back down
at amazing winds, hundreds

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:56.180 align:middle line:90%
of miles an hour.

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:59.643 align:middle line:84%
500, 600, 700 miles an hour
and freeze things up real fast.

00:09:59.643 --> 00:10:02.772 align:middle line:90%


00:10:02.772 --> 00:10:04.230 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it they
don't really know.

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:05.732 align:middle line:90%
They're guessing.

00:10:05.732 --> 00:10:07.690 align:middle line:84%
But all they know is they
look at the evidence.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:08.650 align:middle line:90%
And here's the stuff.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:12.090 align:middle line:84%
They found bison that
are tropical animals

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:14.100 align:middle line:84%
with tropical food
in their stomachs

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.640 align:middle line:84%
and in their mouths
that were walking around

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:21.470 align:middle line:84%
in a very hot place, about
120 or 130 above ground,

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:25.710 align:middle line:84%
and then frozen solid
right in their tracks.

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:32.434 align:middle line:84%
And there are 212 different
kinds of ice structure.

00:10:32.434 --> 00:10:34.100 align:middle line:84%
As you get colder and
colder and colder,

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.460 align:middle line:84%
the ice patterns will compact
into deeper and deeper freezing

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:38.400 align:middle line:90%
patterns.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.108 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
quicker and the deeper

00:10:40.108 --> 00:10:42.690 align:middle line:84%
you can get something frozen,
the longer it's going to last.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:47.940 align:middle line:84%
This bison meat is still
edible 13,000 years later.

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.600 align:middle line:90%
We can eat it.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.600 align:middle line:90%
It's still good.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.426 align:middle line:90%
People have done it.

00:10:52.426 --> 00:10:54.320 align:middle line:84%
I ate 13,000-year-old
bison meat.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:59.290 align:middle line:90%


00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:00.926 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:11:00.926 --> 00:11:01.725 align:middle line:90%
>>Bison burger.

00:11:01.725 --> 00:11:05.642 align:middle line:90%


00:11:05.642 --> 00:11:08.830 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, whatever did
it happened really fast.

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:12.490 align:middle line:90%
Really, really fast.

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:27.826 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, we'll look at-- I don't
know what I was going to say.

00:11:27.826 --> 00:11:29.200 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.650 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, the greenhouse effect.

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:32.570 align:middle line:84%
We haven't got to
all that stuff yet.

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:36.470 align:middle line:84%
But simply to say that there is
these incredible changes that

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:38.590 align:middle line:84%
take place around
this time, usually.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:43.820 align:middle line:84%
According to Thoth, the
degree that the poles shift

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:47.360 align:middle line:84%
will be in direct relationship
to how much the consciousness

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.730 align:middle line:90%
changes, positive or negative.

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:54.840 align:middle line:84%
That the orbital pattern and
its relationship to the sun,

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:58.010 align:middle line:84%
the angle to the
sun, is directly

00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:00.750 align:middle line:90%
tied to awareness of the planet.

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.770 align:middle line:90%


00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:06.300 align:middle line:84%
I could really get into that
on some of the stuff they say,

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.100 align:middle line:90%
but it's a lot.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:11.360 align:middle line:84%
The great pyramids had
a lot to do with that.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.550 align:middle line:84%
The reason the orbit
that we're in right now

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:17.830 align:middle line:84%
was calculated and
purposely built-- we

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:20.110 align:middle line:84%
were purposely put
into this orbit

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:22.700 align:middle line:84%
that we're in right now
of 365 and 1/4 days so

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.190 align:middle line:84%
that we would be where
we are right now.

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:27.350 align:middle line:84%
Because they knew that
that angle would produce

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:29.100 align:middle line:90%
the level that we're at.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.360 align:middle line:90%
They knew it in advance.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:36.130 align:middle line:84%
But the last time the poles were
in Hawaii, it shifted this way.

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:39.840 align:middle line:84%
It shifted like
90 degrees almost.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.580 align:middle line:84%
That's a big change because
usually the changes are just

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.042 align:middle line:90%
a little bit.

00:12:44.042 --> 00:12:45.310 align:middle line:90%
They're just a tiny bit.

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:48.135 align:middle line:84%
They're not these
things like this.

00:12:48.135 --> 00:12:49.490 align:middle line:90%
This is just a polarity.

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:52.190 align:middle line:84%
This is like a
male/female type change.

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:54.810 align:middle line:90%
This is--

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:56.600 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.602 align:middle line:90%
Don't get excited.

00:12:58.602 --> 00:13:01.578 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:01.578 --> 00:13:09.620 align:middle line:90%


00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:12.430 align:middle line:84%
>>Usually, they're just
a little, tiny bit.

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:14.130 align:middle line:90%
But this last one was a lot.

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:15.680 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't a positive change.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:16.990 align:middle line:90%
It was a fall.

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:18.045 align:middle line:90%
We dropped.

00:13:18.045 --> 00:13:21.090 align:middle line:84%
It was a great fall that's
referred to, even in the Bible.

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:27.530 align:middle line:84%
We fell down, down, down,
down, to where we are now.

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:30.570 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the
aspects of what's going on.

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:34.990 align:middle line:10%
Now, there's another thing.

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:38.256 align:middle line:90%


00:13:38.256 --> 00:13:40.710 align:middle line:10%
And this does not usually
happen in our case

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:45.370 align:middle line:10%
because we would normally be
where we're trying to get to.

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:47.940 align:middle line:84%
We would normally be in
Christ consciousness,

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.420 align:middle line:84%
which is the lowest
level that we get to.

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:53.935 align:middle line:84%
And we would not have the
kinds of problems on our earth

00:13:53.935 --> 00:13:55.620 align:middle line:90%
that we're now having.

00:13:55.620 --> 00:14:02.930 align:middle line:10%
However, because we fell,
and we had to move back up,

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:08.260 align:middle line:10%
and we're in this dis-harmonic
consciousness that we're in,

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:12.110 align:middle line:10%
our earth is being
threatened because

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:14.260 align:middle line:10%
of our level of awareness.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:19.210 align:middle line:10%
And I want to talk about this
threat to us for a little bit.

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:21.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to talk about it
for the purpose of creating

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:24.740 align:middle line:90%
fear in us.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:26.275 align:middle line:84%
Because there really
is no problem,

00:14:26.275 --> 00:14:29.080 align:middle line:90%
though it looks like a big one.

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:33.221 align:middle line:84%
And the more you know about
it, and the more you study it,

00:14:33.221 --> 00:14:34.720 align:middle line:84%
and the more you
get involved in it,

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.780 align:middle line:84%
the problem looks bigger
and bigger and bigger.

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:39.550 align:middle line:90%
And now looks insolvable.

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:42.290 align:middle line:84%
Our governments really don't
know what to do right now.

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:44.840 align:middle line:84%
They don't really see
an answer to anything.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.030 align:middle line:84%
There's I don't know how many
scenarios going on right now.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And if any one of these
scenarios falls apart,

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:54.940 align:middle line:90%
all life in the planet dies.

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:57.256 align:middle line:84%
And they're all about
ready to fall apart,

00:14:57.256 --> 00:15:00.090 align:middle line:84%
it's just a matter-- if you put
your money on there and say,

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:01.450 align:middle line:90%
which one's going to go first?

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:03.560 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to say.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I say to you,
there's no problem.

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:09.390 align:middle line:84%
Which seems sort
of inconsistent.

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:12.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, we'll talk about
the problem, what

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:13.720 align:middle line:90%
looks like a problem, first.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.365 align:middle line:84%
And as you study
this more, you'll

00:15:15.365 --> 00:15:19.550 align:middle line:84%
see there's really
no problem here.

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:22.770 align:middle line:90%
But it looks pretty hopeless.

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:27.254 align:middle line:84%
For a long time, we were
not aware of the situation.

00:15:27.254 --> 00:15:32.430 align:middle line:84%
Meaning "we" on a
daily basis down here.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:34.720 align:middle line:84%
The governments became
aware of it first.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.860 align:middle line:84%
The secret governments
became aware first,

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.470 align:middle line:84%
and then the outer governments
became aware second.

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:42.705 align:middle line:84%
And then, they didn't
tell us for a long time.

00:15:42.705 --> 00:15:44.330 align:middle line:84%
Though, they knew a
lot of the problems

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.730 align:middle line:84%
that were being
developed because they

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:47.690 align:middle line:90%
couldn't stop them.

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Because if they did, it would
cause another kind of problem

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:54.270 align:middle line:90%
called financial.

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's still the main
reason why they're not

00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:59.790 align:middle line:90%
stopping a lot of the things.

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:01.040 align:middle line:90%
They're not trying to kill us.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:05.950 align:middle line:84%
We have chosen a
lifestyle that ultimately

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:10.220 align:middle line:84%
will end up killing all of
us if we don't change it.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And yet, no one
knows how to stop it.

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:17.360 align:middle line:10%
They finally decided recently,
and I mean really recently.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:21.330 align:middle line:10%
This is "Time"
magazine January 1989.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:25.510 align:middle line:10%
It was really only about 1988
that the secret governments

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:31.630 align:middle line:10%
of the world-- not governments,
secret government of the world

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:35.650 align:middle line:10%
elected to allow
the information that

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:38.550 align:middle line:10%
was of the problem to go out.

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:42.355 align:middle line:84%
And only because of an
enlightening process

00:16:42.355 --> 00:16:45.210 align:middle line:90%
that took part on their part.

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:47.430 align:middle line:84%
As I'll explain later,
the secret government

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:50.767 align:middle line:84%
thought that they had it
made and didn't really care

00:16:50.767 --> 00:16:51.600 align:middle line:90%
what happened to us.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And now they find out that
they are intimately tied

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.580 align:middle line:90%
to us no matter what they do.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And so their attitude
has changed dramatically.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.800 align:middle line:90%


00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.530 align:middle line:84%
These things I'm
throwing out like this,

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:05.910 align:middle line:84%
I will come back and
clarify more later.

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:09.119 align:middle line:90%


00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:14.079 align:middle line:10%
So in 1988, they began
to allow the information

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:17.049 align:middle line:10%
of the problem, the big
environmental problem,

00:17:17.049 --> 00:17:18.700 align:middle line:10%
to come out.

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:20.575 align:middle line:10%
The hippies in the '60s
were talking about it

00:17:20.575 --> 00:17:21.640 align:middle line:10%
and everybody, just, nah.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.681 align:middle line:84%
Those guys don't know what
they're talking about.

00:17:23.681 --> 00:17:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And in the '70s, they kept
talking about it. [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:27.760 align:middle line:90%
no.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:34.820 align:middle line:84%
It took 20 years before it was
finally allowed to be released.

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:38.874 align:middle line:84%
And when the governments
finally said, OK, do it.

00:17:38.874 --> 00:17:40.540 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't just
[INAUDIBLE] everybody

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:41.986 align:middle line:84%
would just quit
their jobs and go

00:17:41.986 --> 00:17:43.235 align:middle line:90%
screaming through the streets.

00:17:43.235 --> 00:17:47.005 align:middle line:84%
So they had to tell you
little bits at a time.

00:17:47.005 --> 00:17:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And they've been telling
you little bits at a time,

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:54.040 align:middle line:84%
slowly letting you know the
truth about your situation.

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And we are like a cancer
patient that has a month left

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:02.650 align:middle line:84%
and we're now being told
that we've got a month left.

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:04.930 align:middle line:84%
Only they're first telling
us, oh, you got a few years

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:07.190 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to keep
cutting it down in time.

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.990 align:middle line:90%
Less and less.

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:10.281 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that we have
a month left on earth here.

00:18:10.281 --> 00:18:12.540 align:middle line:90%
I mean, as an analogy.

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.040 align:middle line:84%
I got to be real
careful what I say,

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:18.490 align:middle line:84%
I've realized people take
things literally sometimes.

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:22.030 align:middle line:10%
So in January, "Time"
put out this magazine

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:24.770 align:middle line:10%
called "The Planet of the
Year-- The Endangered Earth."

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.400 align:middle line:10%
And the entire thing was put
out to some of the problems

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.420 align:middle line:10%
that we were having.

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.630 align:middle line:10%
Just some of the major ones.

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:36.230 align:middle line:10%
And to begin to let us, though
they actually started in 1988.

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And one of them-- now,
this was August of 1988--

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:44.530 align:middle line:84%
they put out called
"Our Filthy Seas."

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to just talk about
a few of the different levels.

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:50.840 align:middle line:90%
So one of them is the oceans.

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.974 align:middle line:84%
And to begin with,
there was a book

00:18:54.974 --> 00:18:56.140 align:middle line:90%
written by Jacques Cousteau.

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:59.160 align:middle line:90%
You all know who he is, right?

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote this book,
maybe 12 years ago.

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And he said something in
there that nobody believed.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.260 align:middle line:84%
They just simply
didn't believe it.

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.120 align:middle line:10%
He said that the
Mediterranean Sea

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.930 align:middle line:10%
would be a dead body
with no life in it at all

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:16.950 align:middle line:10%
by the end of 1990.

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:19.250 align:middle line:10%
And that the
Atlantic Ocean would

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:24.430 align:middle line:10%
be a dead body with not a
thing in it by the year 2000.

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:26.664 align:middle line:90%
And they just thought, what?

00:19:26.664 --> 00:19:27.570 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:28.370 align:middle line:90%
No way.

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:30.190 align:middle line:90%
Impossible.

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:31.500 align:middle line:90%
Well, he wasn't exactly on.

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.770 align:middle line:84%
He was off by a
couple of years or so.

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:35.780 align:middle line:90%
Three years or so.

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:39.260 align:middle line:84%
It has gone a little bit
longer than he thought.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.400 align:middle line:84%
But the Mediterranean
Sea, as of this minute,

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:47.020 align:middle line:84%
is just about a totally
annihilated body of water.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.750 align:middle line:84%
There's hardly
anything in it at all.

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:53.380 align:middle line:84%
The entire sea at
the Mediterranean

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:55.610 align:middle line:90%
is 90-- who knows?

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:59.150 align:middle line:90%
95%, 96%, 97% completely gone.

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:01.820 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it will take
another couple of years.

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:05.100 align:middle line:84%
But within 2 years or 3
years, no life in there.

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.570 align:middle line:90%
Another dead sea of the planet.

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:10.240 align:middle line:84%
The Atlantic Ocean is
falling right behind it.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.085 align:middle line:84%
And he may not be
right at the year 2000.

00:20:12.085 --> 00:20:16.920 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's the year
2005, or '06, or '07.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.550 align:middle line:84%
But that's going
to be a dead body.

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:20.350 align:middle line:90%
It's dying.

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:22.070 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:25.580 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to imagine that that's
possible, but it really is.

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:26.959 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be dead.

00:20:26.959 --> 00:20:28.500 align:middle line:84%
If we just continue,
just at the rate

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.490 align:middle line:84%
we're going, without
even escalating at all.

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:34.250 align:middle line:84%
We've been continually
escalating everything.

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:37.488 align:middle line:84%
And there's whole areas
on the Atlantic Ocean,

00:20:37.488 --> 00:20:38.863 align:middle line:84%
from what I've
been reading, that

00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:43.310 align:middle line:84%
are as much as 3 to 5
feet thick of pure toxins.

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:45.590 align:middle line:84%
Patches that are 100
square miles around.

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:46.900 align:middle line:90%
No life can live on them.

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.870 align:middle line:90%
It's like cancer sores all over.

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:53.340 align:middle line:84%
There's mountains
of shit, literally.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:55.720 align:middle line:84%
Out in front of New York
Harbor, for example.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.490 align:middle line:84%
They've been pumping that
stuff out for 20 miles out.

00:20:58.490 --> 00:20:59.966 align:middle line:90%
And it's all coming back.

00:20:59.966 --> 00:21:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And this big mountains about
to enter the harbor now.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And they're all
going, what do we do?

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:09.940 align:middle line:90%
And the ocean is dying.

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:17.054 align:middle line:84%
And they never thought that that
could ever happen, but it is.

00:21:17.054 --> 00:21:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know
what to do about it.

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:22.645 align:middle line:84%
They just don't know
want to do about it.

00:21:22.645 --> 00:21:24.020 align:middle line:84%
They just don't
know where to go.

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:27.646 align:middle line:84%
This is the Pacific Ocean,
which he did not talk about,

00:21:27.646 --> 00:21:29.145 align:middle line:84%
which is a much
bigger body of water

00:21:29.145 --> 00:21:31.850 align:middle line:84%
and would probably take
much longer for it to do.

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:33.714 align:middle line:84%
But the same signs,
the beginning signs

00:21:33.714 --> 00:21:35.880 align:middle line:84%
that were happening in the
Atlantic a long time ago,

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:36.713 align:middle line:90%
are happening there.

00:21:36.713 --> 00:21:42.090 align:middle line:84%
These red tides are sweeping
throughout the Pacific.

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And nothing can live
in or under that.

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.629 align:middle line:90%
It takes all the oxygen out.

00:21:46.629 --> 00:21:49.170 align:middle line:84%
So when a fish swims in there,
there's no oxygen in the water

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:49.970 align:middle line:90%
and they die.

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:52.920 align:middle line:90%


00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:57.150 align:middle line:84%
It's just a sign of
a polluted planet.

00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's pretty horrible
what's happening, to watch this

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:02.740 align:middle line:90%
take place to Mother Earth.

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.760 align:middle line:90%
But it's going on.

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And these oil wrecks
that keep happening, just

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.220 align:middle line:90%
keep right on going.

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:10.320 align:middle line:84%
But we just keep
right on sending them.

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.690 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're not
going to stop our cars.

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:14.510 align:middle line:84%
We're totally addicted
to this technology.

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:16.640 align:middle line:90%
We can't stop.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And we'll go right to the
end, right to the very end,

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:20.980 align:middle line:90%
till we all drop dead.

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And we'll be in our cars
dropping dead, probably.

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:26.040 align:middle line:90%


00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:29.650 align:middle line:90%
I'll be with them, I'm sure.

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:31.355 align:middle line:84%
We're all addicted
to this stuff.

00:22:31.355 --> 00:22:35.630 align:middle line:90%


00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:38.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, the oceans are the
bottom of the food chain.

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:39.623 align:middle line:90%
The plankton are there.

00:22:39.623 --> 00:22:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Without the plankton,
we can't live.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.890 align:middle line:84%
We can go, maybe
a few more years.

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:47.440 align:middle line:90%
Then it's all over.

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.840 align:middle line:84%
We can't live
without our oceans.

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.090 align:middle line:84%
You may think you can stay
up here and just keep right

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:52.225 align:middle line:90%
on going, but you can't.

00:22:52.225 --> 00:22:54.730 align:middle line:90%
We'll die without those things.

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:56.270 align:middle line:90%
And that's a sure bet.

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:58.100 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of other problems.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:22:59.820 align:middle line:10%
That's only just one of them.

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:04.760 align:middle line:10%
This is a satellite
photograph of the South Pole.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.640 align:middle line:10%
This is a big-- the
ozone hole right in here.

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.170 align:middle line:10%
That's an old
photograph, actually.

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:13.520 align:middle line:10%
It's one of the first
ones that came out.

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.580 align:middle line:10%
And we didn't know
the hole was there

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:18.760 align:middle line:10%
because of a software
glitch in the way

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:21.840 align:middle line:10%
we designed the software,
in the computers that

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.950 align:middle line:10%
were now analyzing this.

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:28.761 align:middle line:10%
But when we finally did
figure out it was there,

00:23:28.761 --> 00:23:31.230 align:middle line:10%
and found out that it was
chlorine monoxide, which

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:37.070 align:middle line:10%
was the final end product in the
key, the chemical companies who

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:40.740 align:middle line:10%
were creating the CFCs that we
figured were destroying this.

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:43.990 align:middle line:10%
Of course, they all said,
well, we're not doing it.

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:46.100 align:middle line:10%
This is a natural phenomena.

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.910 align:middle line:10%
This naturally takes place.

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:50.810 align:middle line:10%
You guys just discovered it.

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:52.847 align:middle line:10%
The entire world cooperated.

00:23:52.847 --> 00:23:54.430 align:middle line:10%
This was the first
time in the history

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:57.300 align:middle line:10%
of the planet the entire
world of every single country

00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:00.350 align:middle line:10%
in the planet cooperated
on a single project.

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:01.660 align:middle line:10%
And that was to check this out.

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:05.280 align:middle line:10%
It took them two years
of high-altitude flights

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:08.290 align:middle line:10%
to see what the levels of
chlorine monoxide were.

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:14.085 align:middle line:84%
And when they
first were looking,

00:24:14.085 --> 00:24:16.010 align:middle line:84%
in their original
calculations, they

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:17.955 align:middle line:84%
thought that it would
be 30 times over normal.

00:24:17.955 --> 00:24:20.169 align:middle line:84%
And they were really
worried about that.

00:24:20.169 --> 00:24:21.710 align:middle line:84%
However, when their
results came back

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:25.870 align:middle line:84%
they were speechless because
it was 500 times over normal.

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:28.260 align:middle line:90%
And that may have been a lie.

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.420 align:middle line:84%
It may have been
much worse than that

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:33.130 align:middle line:84%
and they just couldn't
say the words.

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:34.930 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't say it.

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Because-- and I'll say
why in just a moment.

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:41.770 align:middle line:84%
This is the chain
reaction from the CFCs.

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:44.750 align:middle line:84%
This little molecule is the
culprit, the chlorine monoxide.

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:48.740 align:middle line:84%
This is what's been going--
this is what the EPA does here.

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:52.150 align:middle line:84%
They can't tell you
the truth directly.

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:54.400 align:middle line:84%
You could understand if
you were in their position.

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And so they tell you that, oh,
it's worse than we thought.

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:01.291 align:middle line:90%
It's 10 times worse.

00:25:01.291 --> 00:25:02.290 align:middle line:90%
That's in one statement.

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:04.840 align:middle line:84%
Then, a few months later, oh,
it's worse than we thought.

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:05.710 align:middle line:90%
It's 10 times worse.

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:09.090 align:middle line:84%
You have to keep adding
these 10 times up each time.

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:10.830 align:middle line:90%
Here's this one for example.

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:14.820 align:middle line:84%
The fatality rate will be 21
times what the EPA had earlier

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:17.170 align:middle line:90%
forecast.

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:19.920 align:middle line:84%
Two weeks later-- oh, I don't
have that slide anymore.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:20.820 align:middle line:90%
I forgot.

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:23.360 align:middle line:84%
Two weeks later, they came up
and they said a little thing.

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:28.400 align:middle line:84%
Their earlier forecast of three
weeks either, it's double that.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, that went from
21 times to 42 times.

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:34.710 align:middle line:90%
That's an enormous jump.

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And in words, it just
goes right over us.

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And they can just keep
right on doing that.

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:42.057 align:middle line:84%
Who knows what the
real situation is?

00:25:42.057 --> 00:25:44.140 align:middle line:84%
We now know that there's
a hole in the North Pole.

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:45.610 align:middle line:90%
There's one in the South Pole.

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:49.510 align:middle line:84%
That the rest of
thing is Swiss cheese.

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:52.390 align:middle line:84%
There was two people who-- and
I don't remember their names.

00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to have to
get people to figure out

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:58.550 align:middle line:90%
who these guys were.

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:03.490 align:middle line:84%
They wrote a book about
10, 12 years ago also,

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:07.040 align:middle line:84%
predicting that this
would happen in the ozone.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And it was a man and a wife team
predicting exactly everything

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:11.710 align:middle line:90%
that's going to occur.

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And then it started occurring
just like they said.

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And of course, nobody thought
that they were accurate

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.840 align:middle line:84%
until it started
getting to the levels

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.220 align:middle line:84%
where people started
getting afraid.

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:22.930 align:middle line:90%
People in the know, anyway.

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And then about two
years ago, there

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:27.740 align:middle line:84%
was a TV program on where
they brought in experts

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:31.000 align:middle line:90%
from all over the world.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.066 align:middle line:84%
All saying, well,
what can we do?

00:26:33.066 --> 00:26:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And they all have
all these ideas

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.120 align:middle line:84%
how they're going
to pump dust up

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:39.230 align:middle line:84%
into the atmosphere and various
things to try to fix it.

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:42.037 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it's all experimental
and nobody knows any idea

00:26:42.037 --> 00:26:43.495 align:middle line:84%
whether or not it
will work or not.

00:26:43.495 --> 00:26:48.550 align:middle line:90%


00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:51.300 align:middle line:84%
They finally got this man
and the wife team on the TV.

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.290 align:middle line:90%
And I sat there and watched it.

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:54.944 align:middle line:84%
they said to them,
well, you guys

00:26:54.944 --> 00:26:56.860 align:middle line:84%
know more about this
than anybody in the world

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:58.776 align:middle line:84%
because you were able
to actually predict this

00:26:58.776 --> 00:27:00.090 align:middle line:90%
and everything else like that.

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:01.665 align:middle line:84%
And the guy's a real optimist
and he says, well, what can

00:27:01.665 --> 00:27:02.470 align:middle line:90%
we do?

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And the guy, a part
of the team, says

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:08.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's
anything we can do.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:11.405 align:middle line:90%
I think it's just over.

00:27:11.405 --> 00:27:14.320 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to hear
those kind of things.

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.650 align:middle line:84%
He says, well, what
do you mean it's over?

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well, first of all,
we can't get the entire world

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:24.010 align:middle line:90%
to cooperate, which is true.

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:26.210 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's just impossible.

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:28.287 align:middle line:84%
We had this meeting
down in Rio, where we

00:27:28.287 --> 00:27:29.495 align:middle line:90%
tried to get the whole world.

00:27:29.495 --> 00:27:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And George Bush didn't
even want to go.

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And it was just all
a farce because we

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.620 align:middle line:84%
didn't have any internal
agreement with anyone.

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Money is more important than
the planet is what the truth is.

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:42.830 align:middle line:90%
And jobs.

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:44.690 align:middle line:84%
This kind of thing
is more important.

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:45.690 align:middle line:90%
Though, it is important.

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:48.660 align:middle line:84%
The money and the jobs
are important, of course.

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:52.600 align:middle line:84%
But it's not going to do
us any good if we all die.

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere, a balance
has to be found.

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And so anyway, they
said, well, what do

00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:59.870 align:middle line:90%
you mean we're in trouble here?

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, supposing
we got the whole world

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:07.220 align:middle line:90%
to cooperate today.

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:08.600 align:middle line:90%
Everybody stopped.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.280 align:middle line:90%
No more refrigerators.

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.900 align:middle line:90%
No more air conditioning.

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:15.750 align:middle line:84%
No more spray cans and
a lot of-- who knows?

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:19.280 align:middle line:84%
40 or 50 other
chemicals that do this.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:23.144 align:middle line:90%
And we stop all of this stuff.

00:28:23.144 --> 00:28:26.170 align:middle line:84%
He says, wouldn't do
him any good at all.

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:28.570 align:middle line:90%
The guy goes, what do you mean?

00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well, the spray
came you sprayed yesterday,

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:37.130 align:middle line:84%
depending on the calculations
and who you talked to,

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:40.370 align:middle line:84%
it takes anywhere from 15
to 20 years to get up there.

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:43.924 align:middle line:90%


00:28:43.924 --> 00:28:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And we've been using more
and more and more and more

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:47.640 align:middle line:90%
in more recent times.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:51.330 align:middle line:84%
So this slowly-rising
cloud going up there,

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:55.530 align:middle line:90%
it is eating up the atmosphere.

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:58.700 align:middle line:84%
It will continue to eat the
atmosphere for 15 to 20 years

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:01.560 align:middle line:84%
and at a faster and
faster rate because it's

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:04.830 align:middle line:84%
denser and denser and
denser in more modern times.

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:07.020 align:middle line:84%
What's eating right
up there now is

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:08.790 align:middle line:90%
what we did 15 or 20 years ago.

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:11.510 align:middle line:90%


00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:13.730 align:middle line:84%
Which wasn't nearly
what it is now.

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And he says, we won't even
have an ozone in 10 years.

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:19.680 align:middle line:90%
So what difference does it make?

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we don't have an
ozone-- and believe me,

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:25.340 align:middle line:84%
we almost don't have
an ozone in 1993.

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:27.306 align:middle line:90%
I did get it right this time.

00:29:27.306 --> 00:29:32.370 align:middle line:90%


00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:37.850 align:middle line:84%
If we don't have an ozone, we're
going to have real problems.

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:40.262 align:middle line:90%
They're very serious problems.

00:29:40.262 --> 00:29:42.220 align:middle line:84%
You won't be able to go
outside during the day.

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:47.650 align:middle line:84%
You'll have to wear
totally closed up,

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:51.040 align:middle line:84%
ultraviolet-- you can't have any
light hitting your skin at all,

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:52.050 align:middle line:90%
if you went outside.

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:54.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, not even a
little crack anywhere,

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:57.632 align:middle line:84%
because you would very
rapidly develop skin cancer.

00:29:57.632 --> 00:29:59.590 align:middle line:84%
In New Mexico and the
higher state levels right

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:03.490 align:middle line:84%
now, skin cancer is about 50%
of the population and growing

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:05.660 align:middle line:90%
rapidly.

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And Australia and New
Zealand, down in there,

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:10.640 align:middle line:84%
those people-- they're
really freaking out.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.220 align:middle line:84%
You can't even go
outside hardly at all.

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And we're just another year--
they think this year maybe,

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:19.850 align:middle line:84%
we're going to hit
the critical point.

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:21.970 align:middle line:84%
They thought it was going
to happen last year.

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:26.160 align:middle line:84%
But because of the freak nature
of ways the temperatures hit,

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.570 align:middle line:90%
it didn't happen.

00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:30.400 align:middle line:84%
It may be that there's going to
be spots, like shotgun effect,

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.040 align:middle line:84%
all over the world
in certain places.

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.296 align:middle line:90%
And it could be anywhere.

00:30:33.296 --> 00:30:37.540 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter, it
could be anywhere at all.

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:41.920 align:middle line:84%
If you're outside more than
15 or 20 minutes, that's it.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:42.870 align:middle line:90%
Throw your body away.

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:46.030 align:middle line:90%


00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And you'll go blind
also, very quickly.

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Even if we were able to
protect ourselves and we

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:54.500 align:middle line:90%
only went out at nighttime.

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:57.790 align:middle line:84%
We had spacesuits on to
go during the daytime,

00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:00.620 align:middle line:84%
all the animals of the world
are all going to go blind.

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:01.430 align:middle line:90%
It's inevitable.

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:03.200 align:middle line:90%
They're all going to go blind.

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:04.710 align:middle line:84%
All our animals
are going to die.

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:06.252 align:middle line:84%
We can't live
without our animals.

00:31:06.252 --> 00:31:11.010 align:middle line:90%


00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:11.810 align:middle line:90%
We're in it.

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:12.660 align:middle line:90%
We're in it now.

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:14.840 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be
in it this year,

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:18.470 align:middle line:84%
I think, to where
we're going to start

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:20.970 align:middle line:90%
feeling the effects of this.

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:23.771 align:middle line:84%
And by next year for sure,
and each year after this,

00:31:23.771 --> 00:31:26.020 align:middle line:84%
it's going to get worse and
worse and worse and worse.

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:27.930 align:middle line:84%
So we're right now
on the nice edge

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:31.720 align:middle line:84%
of where the true effects of
all this that's been going on

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:38.420 align:middle line:84%
is going to really start begin
to happen, start being felt.

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And there are so
many other things.

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:41.910 align:middle line:84%
You can just go
on and on and on.

00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:44.368 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of things
you guys don't even know about.

00:31:44.368 --> 00:31:46.478 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
them I don't know about.

00:31:46.478 --> 00:31:50.190 align:middle line:90%


00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:52.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm only going to mention
three other ones, though.

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:55.162 align:middle line:84%
I know there's lots
and lots and lots more.

00:31:55.162 --> 00:31:57.760 align:middle line:90%


00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:02.130 align:middle line:84%
When George Bush took
office in his first time

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:08.370 align:middle line:84%
there, within one week
after taking office,

00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:11.600 align:middle line:84%
700 environmental
agencies banned together

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:12.770 align:middle line:90%
to go talk to him.

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:16.989 align:middle line:84%
700 of them, to tell him that
the worst scenario of all

00:32:16.989 --> 00:32:18.030 align:middle line:90%
is the greenhouse effect.

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:20.620 align:middle line:84%
Worse than the ozone,
worse than the oceans,

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:23.090 align:middle line:84%
and worse than lots of other
things that are going on.

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:24.425 align:middle line:84%
That this was the worst
one they can think of.

00:32:24.425 --> 00:32:26.424 align:middle line:84%
It's not the worst one,
but it was the worst one

00:32:26.424 --> 00:32:27.930 align:middle line:84%
that they could
talk about anyway.

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:31.590 align:middle line:90%


00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:38.090 align:middle line:84%
He said that if we don't
stop the greenhouse effect,

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:41.120 align:middle line:84%
that we're basically
all going to die.

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And this is when
Gorbachev wanted

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:48.370 align:middle line:84%
to set up satellite
stations to monitor

00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:50.810 align:middle line:84%
all of the environmental
problems and everything.

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And they were all starting
to talk about all this stuff,

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:56.066 align:middle line:90%
and then just let it go again.

00:32:56.066 --> 00:32:59.790 align:middle line:84%
They just dropped the ball
and kept going for the jobs

00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:02.920 align:middle line:90%
rather than for the environment.

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:08.910 align:middle line:84%
But if you carefully read and
study the greenhouse effect

00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:14.810 align:middle line:84%
and what it means to
you, you will definitely

00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:16.810 align:middle line:84%
rather have the
greenhouse effect go away

00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:18.880 align:middle line:90%
than lose your job.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:26.670 align:middle line:84%
Because this heating up is
not going to keep heating up.

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:28.420 align:middle line:84%
I have studied this
pretty carefully,

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:31.290 align:middle line:84%
and so have a lot of the
people that I worked with.

00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:33.445 align:middle line:84%
Just look at the John
Hamaker theories.

00:33:33.445 --> 00:33:35.270 align:middle line:90%
And there's videos made on this.

00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And study the evidence
that he presents.

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's pretty
powerful evidence.

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:42.980 align:middle line:84%
He's shown that you
can go to lake beds

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:45.510 align:middle line:84%
and take samples out
of the lake bed floors.

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And you can see, first of
all, one thing undeniable.

00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:54.436 align:middle line:84%
Ice ages have been moving in a
sine wave effect over the earth

00:33:54.436 --> 00:33:55.236 align:middle line:90%
forever.

00:33:55.236 --> 00:33:57.740 align:middle line:90%


00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:59.470 align:middle line:84%
They can look at
the pollen count.

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:01.690 align:middle line:84%
That there are layers
where there is pollen,

00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:04.740 align:middle line:84%
and then there's long
layers in these ancient lake

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:06.440 align:middle line:90%
beds where there's no pollen.

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.300 align:middle line:90%
No life.

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:08.360 align:middle line:90%
And then, pollen.

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.460 align:middle line:90%
And then, no life.

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:10.260 align:middle line:90%
And then, pollen.

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:11.120 align:middle line:90%
And then, no life.

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And that the time
periods are-- there's

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:17.949 align:middle line:84%
90,000 years of ice
on the earth followed

00:34:17.949 --> 00:34:20.699 align:middle line:84%
by 10,000 years of
warmth, followed

00:34:20.699 --> 00:34:31.580 align:middle line:84%
by 90,000 years of ice, followed
by 10,000 years of warmth.

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:34.610 align:middle line:84%
What he was able to
distinguish from that

00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:37.449 align:middle line:84%
was that the length of--
they couldn't distinguish

00:34:37.449 --> 00:34:41.070 align:middle line:84%
for some reason until
about a few weeks ago,

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:46.388 align:middle line:84%
the length of time that it took
to go from the cold to the hot.

00:34:46.388 --> 00:34:48.429 align:middle line:84%
When he was making the
theories, they didn't know

00:34:48.429 --> 00:34:50.850 align:middle line:84%
and they thought that
that was a slow process.

00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:54.350 align:middle line:84%
But they did know that the time
that it goes from hot to cold,

00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:57.440 align:middle line:84%
which is what we're in, that
they were able to calculate

00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:00.960 align:middle line:84%
very carefully from the
data of these things,

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:03.020 align:middle line:90%
was 20 years long.

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:06.530 align:middle line:84%
The time it went from a
normal, warm, everyday life

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:11.740 align:middle line:84%
to solid ice, 50 below 0 average
on the planet and ice building

00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:14.450 align:middle line:84%
up rapidly to-- from
anywhere from a mile

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:18.810 align:middle line:84%
to 2 miles on the surface of the
earth above certain equators,

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:23.940 align:middle line:84%
certain places in the
earth, was 20 years long.

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And the people who have been
studying this for a long time,

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:29.910 align:middle line:84%
believe we are now
about 16 years,

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:31.940 align:middle line:84%
17 years into that
20-year cycle.

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:36.870 align:middle line:84%
They think it will hit
in the next 3 or 4 years.

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:42.360 align:middle line:84%
If it happens, what they say--
the whole cycle is simply this.

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:47.562 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing ties
into one word-- minerals.

00:35:47.562 --> 00:35:49.270 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't think
minerals have anything

00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:50.750 align:middle line:90%
to do with any of this stuff.

00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:55.280 align:middle line:84%
But it's a cycle that
keeps repeating itself.

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:57.530 align:middle line:84%
So it depends on where you
want to start in the cycle.

00:35:57.530 --> 00:36:01.980 align:middle line:84%
Let's start in the part where
the ice ages are receding.

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And so you've got total cloud
cover over the entire planet.

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:11.380 align:middle line:84%
It's 50 below 0
everywhere, or colder.

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:14.000 align:middle line:84%
But slowly, slowly, slowly,
slowly, after 90,000 years,

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.890 align:middle line:84%
it starts warming up and
the ice starts receding.

00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:20.780 align:middle line:84%
This 1, 2, 3-mile thick
ice thing as it recedes,

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:24.780 align:middle line:84%
obviously crushes up all the
rock that's underneath there

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:29.730 align:middle line:84%
and turns it into these
little 3 and 4 micron size

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:32.360 align:middle line:84%
pieces of rock, which are
called minerals, which

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:35.210 align:middle line:84%
get blown around the world
with the winds and things that

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:36.010 align:middle line:90%
are going on.

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And so the earth
gets mineralized.

00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And as it keeps warming up, the
mineralization and the warmth,

00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:45.980 align:middle line:84%
eventually the plant
growth starts catching on

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:47.940 align:middle line:90%
and it really takes off.

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:51.440 align:middle line:84%
It starts pulling 1
acre of average trees

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:56.370 align:middle line:84%
as 50,000 tons of
carbon dioxide in it.

00:36:56.370 --> 00:36:58.430 align:middle line:84%
So it starts pulling
us back out of the air.

00:36:58.430 --> 00:37:02.840 align:middle line:10%
And the faster the plant grows
grows, the shield is lifted.

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:07.230 align:middle line:84%
Until finally, the ice
really starts going away

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:08.690 align:middle line:90%
and everything is watered.

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And you have a situation
where we're back

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:16.030 align:middle line:84%
into the normal situation--
where we are now.

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And then about 10,000 years down
the line, the minerals run out.

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:22.370 align:middle line:84%
Just like if this
plant, if you just

00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:24.550 align:middle line:84%
keep watering it and watering
it and watering it and watering

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:26.550 align:middle line:84%
in it, you don't put any
minerals back in there,

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:28.740 align:middle line:84%
that eventually it's going
to die because there's

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:31.696 align:middle line:84%
no-- you go for so
long, and then it'll

00:37:31.696 --> 00:37:33.100 align:middle line:90%
just [SOUND EFFECT] do it.

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, because the
mineralization basically

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:36.870 align:middle line:84%
happens same time
all over the planet,

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:40.300 align:middle line:90%
the whole planet goes at once.

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:43.024 align:middle line:84%
And when the minerals
run out, all the trees

00:37:43.024 --> 00:37:44.440 align:middle line:84%
all over the planet
starts getting

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:46.270 align:middle line:90%
weak, which is now happening.

00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not talking
about one, little place.

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:49.980 align:middle line:84%
All over the globe
this is happening.

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:51.390 align:middle line:90%
All the trees are getting weak.

00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:53.130 align:middle line:90%
All the trees are getting sick.

00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And because they're
getting sick,

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:56.600 align:middle line:90%
the fires are beginning to burn.

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.455 align:middle line:84%
And we have these
incredible fires

00:37:58.455 --> 00:38:00.080 align:middle line:84%
that are all over
the planet right now.

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.530 align:middle line:84%
China has got huge
areas that are burning.

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And India and places
all over the world,

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:09.430 align:middle line:84%
these enormous-- huge,
enormous fires are burning.

00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:14.810 align:middle line:90%


00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:16.690 align:middle line:84%
This is just a natural
process, but we

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:19.370 align:middle line:84%
are adding to it
with our automobiles

00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:20.630 align:middle line:90%
and all these kinds of things.

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:23.895 align:middle line:84%
We are just throwing
gasoline on fire

00:38:23.895 --> 00:38:25.695 align:middle line:84%
and keeping it
going even faster.

00:38:25.695 --> 00:38:28.460 align:middle line:90%


00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And what they now have
just discovered, just

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.030 align:middle line:90%
in the last few weeks.

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:36.380 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it was just announced
in "Discovery" magazine

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:37.480 align:middle line:90%
of this month.

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:41.450 align:middle line:84%
They just found out that the
time that it goes from cold

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:48.190 align:middle line:90%
to hot is 1 to 3 days long.

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:50.850 align:middle line:84%
When the force
gets weak and they

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:53.960 align:middle line:84%
start burning and the greenhouse
effect starts happening,

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:55.320 align:middle line:90%
the oceans start warming up.

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And the ocean water
around the equator

00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:01.040 align:middle line:84%
starts getting very
hot, which is just

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.390 align:middle line:90%
what happened last year.

00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:06.610 align:middle line:90%


00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:10.070 align:middle line:84%
This spot here in the ocean
above Australia in here

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:11.720 align:middle line:84%
is the hottest
recorded temperature

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:14.530 align:middle line:84%
in the history
recorded of our earth.

00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:16.970 align:middle line:90%
86 degrees.

00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:21.260 align:middle line:84%
86 degrees in the
ocean water there.

00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:23.660 align:middle line:90%
This is last year.

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:26.580 align:middle line:90%
This is from the NASA reports.

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is
the water's heat up

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:34.780 align:middle line:84%
and these huge amounts
of water get pulled up

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:38.800 align:middle line:84%
into the atmosphere, which
then gets pulled by convection

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.600 align:middle line:84%
currents because
you got a hot middle

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:41.995 align:middle line:90%
and you got two frozen ends.

00:39:41.995 --> 00:39:45.060 align:middle line:84%
The convection currents
pull them over to the ends.

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And then, all this water dumps
on the two ends, the poles,

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:52.050 align:middle line:90%
and the poles build up faster.

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:54.470 align:middle line:84%
These incredible poles start
building up, which they are.

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:56.178 align:middle line:84%
They're just building
at phenomenal rates

00:39:56.178 --> 00:39:59.310 align:middle line:84%
right now, which
crushes the earth, which

00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:02.000 align:middle line:84%
causes all these volcanoes to
happen all over the planet.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.662 align:middle line:84%
Specifically, at the 19.5
North and South latitudes,

00:40:05.662 --> 00:40:06.870 align:middle line:90%
which we'll talk about later.

00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:09.400 align:middle line:90%


00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is going on
right now like crazy.

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.670 align:middle line:90%


00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:19.785 align:middle line:84%
And then, what happens
is it just keeps going,

00:40:19.785 --> 00:40:21.160 align:middle line:84%
and keeps going,
and keeps going.

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And then one day,
which they figure

00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:26.900 align:middle line:84%
takes about 20 years of
this process, the process

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:28.717 align:middle line:84%
of the water-- the
oceans heat up so much

00:40:28.717 --> 00:40:31.050 align:middle line:84%
that the water's coming out
so fast that the clouds just

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:34.480 align:middle line:90%
back over and that's it.

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:38.360 align:middle line:90%
90,000 years sealed tight.

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.770 align:middle line:84%
What was the sun getting
warm, goes [WHOOSH]

00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:42.690 align:middle line:90%
to an average of 50 below 0.

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:45.374 align:middle line:84%
And you don't see the sky
again for 90,000 years.

00:40:45.374 --> 00:40:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And there are people who
think we're just only

00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:48.570 align:middle line:90%
a few years away from this.

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:49.403 align:middle line:90%
And they're serious.

00:40:49.403 --> 00:40:51.780 align:middle line:90%


00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And so you could understand why
they may be a little concerned

00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:56.190 align:middle line:90%
about the greenhouse effect.

00:40:56.190 --> 00:41:00.830 align:middle line:90%


00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:03.690 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'll tell you what the
worst one is that I know of.

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:05.709 align:middle line:90%
This one's not out there.

00:41:05.709 --> 00:41:07.250 align:middle line:84%
But this is the work
of Adam Trombly.

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:10.070 align:middle line:90%


00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And Adam Trombly has
discovered that-- after having

00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:19.090 align:middle line:84%
a great deal of
research in this,

00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:24.440 align:middle line:84%
that atomic bombs have
an effect on our planet

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:27.490 align:middle line:84%
that we probably
didn't know about.

00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:30.110 align:middle line:90%


00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:32.667 align:middle line:84%
We used to blow up atomic bombs
and have people watch them,

00:41:32.667 --> 00:41:34.130 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:36.980 align:middle line:84%
It would become an x-ray
thing, and then they'd

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:38.330 align:middle line:90%
drop dead a few years later.

00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:39.770 align:middle line:90%
And we didn't know.

00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And we used to blow up bombs
and have the clouds drift over

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:43.555 align:middle line:90%
some of our Nevada cities.

00:41:43.555 --> 00:41:45.990 align:middle line:90%
And they're all dying.

00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:51.220 align:middle line:84%
We did a lot of things that
were wrong and out of stupidity.

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:56.320 align:middle line:84%
But we blew up 212
bombs above the surface

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.734 align:middle line:84%
until we got pressured
to do something else.

00:41:58.734 --> 00:41:59.900 align:middle line:90%
So we blew them underground.

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:01.770 align:middle line:84%
Figured that's OK to
blow them underground.

00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:04.520 align:middle line:90%
It's not OK.

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:07.700 align:middle line:84%
It's better to blow them above
ground than it is underground.

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:09.700 align:middle line:84%
According to Adam,
what happens is

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:14.380 align:middle line:84%
when you blow an atomic bomb
underground, the force of that

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:17.940 align:middle line:84%
gets shot into the earth and
it ricochets inside the earth,

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:20.470 align:middle line:84%
bouncing through the
plates for over 30 days

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:23.290 align:middle line:84%
with incredible impact,
moving through these things

00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:25.070 align:middle line:84%
for a month going
through this stuff,

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:26.730 align:middle line:90%
until the earth absorbs this.

00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:29.910 align:middle line:90%
Huge impact on there.

00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:34.294 align:middle line:84%
And you can do 1 of them, or 2
of them, or maybe 10 of them.

00:42:34.294 --> 00:42:36.210 align:middle line:84%
But we've been doing
these on a regular basis.

00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:38.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know how many
underground ones there

00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:40.606 align:middle line:90%
have been.

00:42:40.606 --> 00:42:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And so he wrote a paper in
recent past a couple of years

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:49.300 align:middle line:84%
ago suggesting that
if this continues,

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:52.350 align:middle line:90%
a very-- not very many more.

00:42:52.350 --> 00:42:54.012 align:middle line:84%
That certain
phenomenas are going

00:42:54.012 --> 00:42:55.810 align:middle line:84%
to start taking
place on the earth.

00:42:55.810 --> 00:42:57.310 align:middle line:90%
And they're all happening.

00:42:57.310 --> 00:42:59.101 align:middle line:84%
He said the first place
you're going to see

00:42:59.101 --> 00:43:01.620 align:middle line:84%
is the Indian Ocean dropping
by a remarkable amount.

00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:04.400 align:middle line:90%
It just dropped 25 feet.

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:08.390 align:middle line:84%
The whole Indian ocean just
went [SOUND EFFECT] 25 feet.

00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And there's places that
he talked about how

00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:14.000 align:middle line:90%
this was going to happen.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And he believes that
if we keep doing it,

00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:20.680 align:middle line:90%
the earth will just blow up.

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:21.820 align:middle line:90%
Just fall apart.

00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:24.600 align:middle line:90%


00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:26.160 align:middle line:90%
Pieces everywhere.

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:29.010 align:middle line:84%
So that's the worst case
scenario I could think of.

00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:32.224 align:middle line:84%
And when the Indian
Ocean dropped

00:43:32.224 --> 00:43:33.640 align:middle line:84%
and certain other
things happened,

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:37.100 align:middle line:84%
and it conformed exactly to what
he said, we were on red alert.

00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:40.200 align:middle line:84%
Military and government
levels were on red alert,

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:45.150 align:middle line:84%
and probably still are relative
to this whole situation.

00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:47.520 align:middle line:84%
But I would not be surprised
if they wouldn't go blow

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:51.110 align:middle line:84%
up another atomic bomb, even
though they know that it

00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:54.530 align:middle line:90%
may be the last one ever.

00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Because of some--
I don't even think

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:00.108 align:middle line:90%
I want to even talk about it.

00:44:00.108 --> 00:44:02.860 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:04.657 align:middle line:84%
There's some other
stupid stuff they're

00:44:04.657 --> 00:44:06.740 align:middle line:84%
doing that they really
want to blow these bombs up

00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:08.580 align:middle line:90%
for that are just stupid.

00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:12.432 align:middle line:90%
But anyway.

00:44:12.432 --> 00:44:13.850 align:middle line:90%
>>What's that?

00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:17.203 align:middle line:84%
>>There's something called
the flexion crystals.

00:44:17.203 --> 00:44:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that
was discovered in 1927.

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:29.245 align:middle line:84%
And the governments of the world
want to complete this project.

00:44:29.245 --> 00:44:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And it requires blowing
up atomic bombs.

00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:36.570 align:middle line:84%
Because whoever finishes the
project will kind of control

00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:40.290 align:middle line:84%
the earth, because the
technology will-- And it

00:44:40.290 --> 00:44:42.750 align:middle line:84%
comes so far along,
they're almost there.

00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:45.370 align:middle line:84%
The crystal place in
White Sands, New Mexico,

00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:48.710 align:middle line:84%
that's being built right now,
it's the primary purpose of it.

00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:52.200 align:middle line:84%
The flexion crystals-- if you
take a piezoelectric quartz

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:55.470 align:middle line:84%
crystal and you shoot
a protracted radio

00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:58.185 align:middle line:84%
beam of a very
specific frequency

00:44:58.185 --> 00:45:01.240 align:middle line:84%
and wavelength down the
c-axis of the crystal,

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:04.270 align:middle line:84%
it causes the crystalline--
the ions of the crystal

00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:05.630 align:middle line:90%
to begin to rotate.

00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And when they hit
a certain angle,

00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:10.310 align:middle line:84%
the crystalline lattice
structure breaks apart

00:45:10.310 --> 00:45:12.650 align:middle line:84%
and the crystal disappears
right before your eyes.

00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And the crystalline atoms
migrate into space and reform

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.370 align:middle line:90%
into a larger crystalline atom.

00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And so you get a little--
say, a 2 inch crystal suddenly

00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:32.854 align:middle line:84%
disappears and reforms a few
minutes later 2,000% bigger.

00:45:32.854 --> 00:45:36.040 align:middle line:84%
It would be 40 inches long,
I guess that's what it is.

00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:37.660 align:middle line:90%
Instead of 2 inches.

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And well, that
would be interesting

00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:41.840 align:middle line:90%
if it was just that.

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:45.235 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing is, is the
crystal lifts off the ground.

00:45:45.235 --> 00:45:47.070 align:middle line:90%
It levitates.

00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:50.635 align:middle line:84%
And it levitate with--
it will lift huge.

00:45:50.635 --> 00:45:53.290 align:middle line:84%
A 2 inch crystal will lift
5,000 or 10,000 pounds

00:45:53.290 --> 00:45:55.500 align:middle line:90%
off the ground.

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:57.402 align:middle line:84%
And not only is it
levitating and lift

00:45:57.402 --> 00:45:59.040 align:middle line:84%
a huge amount of
weight off the ground,

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:03.690 align:middle line:84%
but it moves in the force of
c-axis with tremendous speed

00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:05.880 align:middle line:90%
and force.

00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And so, obviously, if you
could get those things together

00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:13.120 align:middle line:84%
and control them, in
terms of what that means,

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:15.314 align:middle line:84%
in terms of space travel
and everything else,

00:46:15.314 --> 00:46:18.670 align:middle line:90%
it would be pretty good stuff.

00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:21.460 align:middle line:84%
But the one that they're mostly
concerned with, even more

00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:23.720 align:middle line:84%
than that, is that
a flexion crystal

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:28.670 align:middle line:84%
absorbs 100% of all energy
that passes through it.

00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And retains it in the
lattice structure somehow.

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:34.330 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows how.

00:46:34.330 --> 00:46:36.470 align:middle line:84%
You can blow up an
atomic bomb and it

00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:42.350 align:middle line:84%
will absorb an atomic bomb
and release it as electricity

00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:48.090 align:middle line:84%
through many different kinds of
means, even mechanical means.

00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:53.790 align:middle line:84%
Or, release the bomb just
by striking the crystal.

00:46:53.790 --> 00:47:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And so there's all kinds of
purposes and reasons for that.

00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
that's what's going on,

00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:07.154 align:middle line:84%
specifically since the Japanese
have gone around systematically

00:47:07.154 --> 00:47:08.570 align:middle line:84%
over the whole
world and bought up

00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:10.925 align:middle line:84%
all the piezoelectric crystals
on the planet just about.

00:47:10.925 --> 00:47:14.330 align:middle line:90%
There aren't any anywhere.

00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:16.670 align:middle line:84%
And you can't do it with
synthetic piezoelectric.

00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:19.863 align:middle line:84%
It has to be natural
for some reason.

00:47:19.863 --> 00:47:22.112 align:middle line:84%
And I think the-- I know
that the Russians, the United

00:47:22.112 --> 00:47:24.410 align:middle line:84%
States, and Japanese
were all working on this.

00:47:24.410 --> 00:47:26.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think the Japanese
have either figured it out

00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:28.487 align:middle line:84%
or are so close
to figuring it out

00:47:28.487 --> 00:47:31.070 align:middle line:84%
that they want to make sure they
had the world's supply of it.

00:47:31.070 --> 00:47:32.550 align:middle line:90%
So they bought it all.

00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:33.800 align:middle line:90%
They've got it all over there.

00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:35.426 align:middle line:84%
There's hardly
anything left anywhere.

00:47:35.426 --> 00:47:40.750 align:middle line:90%


00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:43.810 align:middle line:84%
>>Who has seen the
Strecker Memorandum here?

00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:45.840 align:middle line:90%
Quite a few people.

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:49.950 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Strecker was one
who has carefully

00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:54.260 align:middle line:90%
watched the AIDS epidemic.

00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And if you believe
his data, he says

00:47:59.450 --> 00:48:02.350 align:middle line:84%
that it was the United Nations
through the World's Health

00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:06.230 align:middle line:84%
Organization that
created the AIDS virus.

00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose and the
reason that they did it

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:12.130 align:middle line:84%
would be a pretty
obvious one, really.

00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And what you do if you
were in their place?

00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:17.170 align:middle line:84%
What if you were
on the world body

00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:20.150 align:middle line:84%
and you came to the realization
that the world's population was

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:24.286 align:middle line:90%
going to double in 10 years?

00:48:24.286 --> 00:48:29.770 align:middle line:84%
If the world's population
doubles, we're all dead.

00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:33.140 align:middle line:84%
We can barely handle it with
what we got here right now.

00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:35.690 align:middle line:90%


00:48:35.690 --> 00:48:40.090 align:middle line:84%
If you could imagine all the
cities and the whole thing

00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:41.990 align:middle line:90%
doubling in population.

00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:43.692 align:middle line:90%
And rapidly?

00:48:43.692 --> 00:48:44.900 align:middle line:90%
They're all going to be kids.

00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:49.990 align:middle line:90%


00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:52.730 align:middle line:84%
The only reason it slowed down
primarily is because of China.

00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:56.020 align:middle line:84%
Because China's realized
this and had the wisdom

00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:59.470 align:middle line:84%
to make a single-- you can
only have one baby in China,

00:48:59.470 --> 00:49:02.309 align:middle line:90%
and that's it.

00:49:02.309 --> 00:49:04.350 align:middle line:84%
Though, it's causes a lot
of weird stuff going on

00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:06.545 align:middle line:84%
because they all want
to have male babies.

00:49:06.545 --> 00:49:11.530 align:middle line:84%
So they kill the girls and
make sure they only have males.

00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And so you got all these males
growing up with no females.

00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:17.730 align:middle line:90%
It's really a weird situation.

00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:21.660 align:middle line:84%
But it's a synthetic situation
that's been developed there.

00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:23.870 align:middle line:84%
But if they had
not done that, we

00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:27.270 align:middle line:84%
would be hitting this doubling
process in about 7 years.

00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:30.890 align:middle line:84%
As it stands now, I think
we've got a little bit longer.

00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:32.825 align:middle line:84%
But either way, no matter
how you look at it,

00:49:32.825 --> 00:49:33.700 align:middle line:90%
it's going to happen.

00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:35.552 align:middle line:84%
And when it happens,
it's all over.

00:49:35.552 --> 00:49:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And then it's going
to double again

00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:40.310 align:middle line:84%
really quick after that, which
would even definitely do us in.

00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:44.590 align:middle line:84%
So the population itself
would annihilate us all

00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:46.520 align:middle line:84%
if we don't do
something about it.

00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:47.320 align:middle line:90%
We will.

00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:48.345 align:middle line:90%
We could not survive it.

00:49:48.345 --> 00:49:49.220 align:middle line:90%
It would be all over.

00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:51.838 align:middle line:90%


00:49:51.838 --> 00:49:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And so the United Nations,
through the Strecker

00:49:55.800 --> 00:50:00.940 align:middle line:84%
Memorandum, said that
they had to do something.

00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And so what they did was they--
and he showed the actual United

00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Nations documents
saying that they

00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:10.300 align:middle line:84%
needed to reduce the world's
population by three quarters.

00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:11.390 align:middle line:90%
That's reduce it.

00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:13.534 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
eliminating people.

00:50:13.534 --> 00:50:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And so according
to Strecker, they

00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:18.790 align:middle line:84%
took the virus from a sheep
and this virus of a cow

00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:22.770 align:middle line:84%
and blended them in a particular
way to create the AIDS virus.

00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:24.320 align:middle line:90%
But they already have the cure.

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:26.849 align:middle line:90%


00:50:26.849 --> 00:50:29.140 align:middle line:84%
But they'll wait until three
quarters of the population

00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:35.380 align:middle line:84%
is dead, then they'll say,
we just found the cure.

00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:38.100 align:middle line:90%
And that's the game plan.

00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:41.710 align:middle line:90%


00:50:41.710 --> 00:50:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And it was put into the
Hepatitis B injections, which

00:50:47.050 --> 00:50:49.601 align:middle line:84%
were given primarily
to the homosexuals,

00:50:49.601 --> 00:50:52.100 align:middle line:84%
because they were the ones that
had that particular problem.

00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:54.550 align:middle line:84%
Whoever did that consciously
tried to get to them.

00:50:54.550 --> 00:50:57.040 align:middle line:90%
In the United States, anyway.

00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And so it appeared to
be a homosexual disease.

00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:02.016 align:middle line:84%
But in the rest of
world, it was not.

00:51:02.016 --> 00:51:03.640 align:middle line:84%
Whoever tried to do
it tried to get rid

00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:05.140 align:middle line:84%
of the homosexuals
and the blacks.

00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:10.490 align:middle line:84%
This is pretty clear, because
it started in Haiti and Africa

00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:12.450 align:middle line:90%
and in the homosexual community.

00:51:12.450 --> 00:51:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And now, it's not a
homosexual disease.

00:51:20.770 --> 00:51:21.570 align:middle line:90%
That's clear.

00:51:21.570 --> 00:51:25.680 align:middle line:84%
Because all over the
world except for here,

00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:28.260 align:middle line:90%
it's almost equal amounts.

00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And in the United States, it's
rapidly becoming equal amount.

00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:34.960 align:middle line:84%
The numbers
responding back to it.

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:38.050 align:middle line:84%
It will be an equal
balance, males and females,

00:51:38.050 --> 00:51:40.470 align:middle line:90%
within a few more years.

00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:41.980 align:middle line:90%
This is what they calculated.

00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:45.640 align:middle line:84%
It's already rapidly
getting to that level.

00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't think
they're still doing that.

00:51:47.570 --> 00:51:50.468 align:middle line:84%
I think they did all at
one time pretty much.

00:51:50.468 --> 00:51:53.890 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have
to do it anymore.

00:51:53.890 --> 00:52:04.320 align:middle line:84%
But there's a cure for AIDS,
though you'll just have to see.

00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:07.050 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing-- what's
Strecker said at the very end

00:52:07.050 --> 00:52:12.440 align:middle line:84%
on there was he understood
that the answer lies in light.

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's the Royal Rife
frequencies, but not

00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:17.940 align:middle line:84%
the ones that are published
because those are wrong

00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:20.200 align:middle line:90%
and they cause cancer.

00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:23.061 align:middle line:84%
And they were also
purposely distorted.

00:52:23.061 --> 00:52:25.310 align:middle line:84%
Whoever wrote the books and
everything else like that,

00:52:25.310 --> 00:52:27.300 align:middle line:90%
they did not tell you the truth.

00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:29.170 align:middle line:84%
But if you can figure
out what they are--

00:52:29.170 --> 00:52:33.510 align:middle line:84%
and the answer lies in this
geometry relative to that,

00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:35.320 align:middle line:90%
even on a scientific level.

00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:36.810 align:middle line:90%
But what do we do?

00:52:36.810 --> 00:52:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Even if we find an answer,
then what do we do?

00:52:38.970 --> 00:52:41.790 align:middle line:84%
What do we do about
the population?

00:52:41.790 --> 00:52:43.480 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:44.810 align:middle line:90%
I just work here.

00:52:44.810 --> 00:52:47.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any
answers for you, guys.

00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:50.200 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.910 align:middle line:90%
It's an incredible situation.

00:52:51.910 --> 00:53:00.680 align:middle line:90%


00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing that
a lot of the doctors

00:53:04.310 --> 00:53:06.780 align:middle line:84%
have been very
afraid of with AIDS,

00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:10.710 align:middle line:84%
and also with cancer
and other diseases too,

00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:14.650 align:middle line:84%
is that with cancer, before
there ever even was AIDS,

00:53:14.650 --> 00:53:17.835 align:middle line:84%
doctors had this kind
of scenario going on

00:53:17.835 --> 00:53:21.070 align:middle line:84%
in their heads that they
never talked about too

00:53:21.070 --> 00:53:22.090 align:middle line:90%
much to other people.

00:53:22.090 --> 00:53:25.870 align:middle line:84%
But that was, what would happen
if cancer mutated and became

00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:27.910 align:middle line:90%
airborne like a cold?

00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:30.140 align:middle line:90%
Which it could do.

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:33.225 align:middle line:84%
It's a virus and it could mutate
so you caught it like a cold.

00:53:33.225 --> 00:53:38.005 align:middle line:84%
And cancer could spread through
the whole world really quickly.

00:53:38.005 --> 00:53:40.630 align:middle line:84%
It's never happened,
but it could.

00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:43.090 align:middle line:90%
Theoretically, it could.

00:53:43.090 --> 00:53:46.040 align:middle line:84%
But there aren't many
different kinds of cancer.

00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:48.210 align:middle line:84%
But when you have
AIDS, you've got 9,000

00:53:48.210 --> 00:53:51.920 align:middle line:84%
to the fourth power of
different kinds of AIDS viruses.

00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:53.620 align:middle line:84%
And every time
someone gets AIDS,

00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:56.610 align:middle line:90%
they get a brand new virus.

00:53:56.610 --> 00:53:59.390 align:middle line:90%
Mathematically, it's inevitable.

00:53:59.390 --> 00:54:00.680 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely inevitable.

00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:04.024 align:middle line:90%
AIDS will become like a cold.

00:54:04.024 --> 00:54:05.990 align:middle line:90%
It has to.

00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And it probably has
already happened according

00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:10.125 align:middle line:90%
to World Health Organization.

00:54:10.125 --> 00:54:14.900 align:middle line:84%
They're very concerned about it,
if they are concerned about it.

00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:16.520 align:middle line:84%
There's a tribe
in Africa that was

00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:19.715 align:middle line:84%
about-- I guess it's been
about a year and half now.

00:54:19.715 --> 00:54:22.170 align:middle line:84%
There's a tribe in
Africa with 1,400 members

00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:23.340 align:middle line:90%
and they came into it.

00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:25.810 align:middle line:84%
These are from little
babies to old men.

00:54:25.810 --> 00:54:28.540 align:middle line:84%
Every kind of sexual thing
you can think of in there.

00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And every single one of them
had AIDS without exception.

00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And they suspect
strongly that it somehow

00:54:37.090 --> 00:54:41.360 align:middle line:84%
became either waterborne,
or airborne, or something.

00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And that it's probably
already taken place.

00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the case,
it takes a few years

00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:51.590 align:middle line:84%
for that to actually get
going around the planet.

00:54:51.590 --> 00:54:55.480 align:middle line:90%
But anyway, are you nervous?

00:54:55.480 --> 00:55:01.054 align:middle line:90%


00:55:01.054 --> 00:55:02.394 align:middle line:90%
OK, here we go again.

00:55:02.394 --> 00:55:05.060 align:middle line:90%


00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:09.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, anyway, the bottom
line of all this stuff

00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:13.190 align:middle line:84%
is, is that we are in
extraordinary times,

00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:15.720 align:middle line:84%
not only for informational
levels that are coming in

00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:18.057 align:middle line:90%
and all kinds of things.

00:55:18.057 --> 00:55:20.390 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about informational
levels, and it's like--

00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:24.290 align:middle line:90%


00:55:24.290 --> 00:55:27.640 align:middle line:84%
Another one that you could
see in extraordinary times

00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:29.785 align:middle line:84%
is the spiritual
level of information.

00:55:29.785 --> 00:55:32.720 align:middle line:84%
Remember how secret all
that information was?

00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:37.355 align:middle line:84%
People would die before they
told you about certain secrets

00:55:37.355 --> 00:55:38.230 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And now you can go into
a metaphysical bookstore

00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:43.460 align:middle line:84%
and there it all is for
anybody who wants it.

00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:44.440 align:middle line:90%
It's all there.

00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:46.220 align:middle line:84%
Why did all these
spiritual groups

00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:49.450 align:middle line:84%
release all that information
at the same time?

00:55:49.450 --> 00:55:50.250 align:middle line:90%
Who told them?

00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:51.190 align:middle line:90%
Who's guiding it?

00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:53.610 align:middle line:84%
Who let that all
come out at once?

00:55:53.610 --> 00:55:54.805 align:middle line:90%
It was all secret.

00:55:54.805 --> 00:55:57.000 align:middle line:90%
It was buried down deep.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:07.260 align:middle line:90%


00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:12.000 align:middle line:84%
We're in a situation
now where we're not

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.370 align:middle line:90%
in an ordinary, everyday life.

00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And yet, most of us are going
on as though business as usual.

00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And we do have to have a certain
part of us that does that.

00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:26.360 align:middle line:84%
If we're going to survive
this or make it through,

00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:28.372 align:middle line:84%
we need to get through
the daily life.

00:56:28.372 --> 00:56:30.830 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we got to have
part of us that continues on

00:56:30.830 --> 00:56:35.170 align:middle line:84%
and pays the bills, and tries
to do it in the cleanest, best,

00:56:35.170 --> 00:56:37.770 align:middle line:90%
most sacred way they can.

00:56:37.770 --> 00:56:43.740 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, to live
only for that and for pleasure

00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:45.760 align:middle line:84%
and to keep going at
this point in the game

00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:51.930 align:middle line:84%
is really-- you're
just wasting your time.

00:56:51.930 --> 00:56:54.880 align:middle line:84%
If you think you're going to
get married and grow up and have

00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:58.060 align:middle line:84%
kids, and they're going to
grow up and go to college.

00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to watch
them grow and be-- I mean,

00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:03.960 align:middle line:90%
we're not going to be here.

00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:05.930 align:middle line:84%
We ain't going to
be here that long.

00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:08.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't care which one of these
scenarios take over eventually.

00:57:08.770 --> 00:57:10.680 align:middle line:84%
We've got all kinds
of things about ready

00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:12.250 align:middle line:90%
to crash down on us.

00:57:12.250 --> 00:57:13.640 align:middle line:90%
We're in the last days.

00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:17.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't care how you
want to look at this.

00:57:17.250 --> 00:57:19.640 align:middle line:84%
Whether you want to look
at the procession or any

00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:25.730 align:middle line:84%
of these other subjects, we're
in the final ends of this.

00:57:25.730 --> 00:57:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And yet, this is a
great gift to be here

00:57:28.550 --> 00:57:30.650 align:middle line:90%
at this particular moment, too.

00:57:30.650 --> 00:57:34.030 align:middle line:84%
Because we have the ability
now to take this time

00:57:34.030 --> 00:57:36.660 align:middle line:84%
to make certain changes
within ourselves.

00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And to be able to make this
transition out of this place

00:57:44.190 --> 00:57:48.236 align:middle line:84%
into a place that is clean
and healthy and ready.

00:57:48.236 --> 00:57:51.550 align:middle line:84%
The American Indians referred
to it as going from the fourth

00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:52.460 align:middle line:90%
to the fifth world.

00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:57.691 align:middle line:90%
They call it the day of-- Ah.

00:57:57.691 --> 00:58:00.650 align:middle line:90%


00:58:00.650 --> 00:58:03.290 align:middle line:90%
What'd they call it?

00:58:03.290 --> 00:58:06.116 align:middle line:84%
Aren't there any
American Indians in here?

00:58:06.116 --> 00:58:07.964 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:07.964 --> 00:58:10.370 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:58:10.370 --> 00:58:11.170 align:middle line:90%
>>Anyway.

00:58:11.170 --> 00:58:12.962 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:58:12.962 --> 00:58:14.807 align:middle line:90%
>>Day of purification, right.

00:58:14.807 --> 00:58:17.015 align:middle line:84%
But they speak about when
we would go from the fourth

00:58:17.015 --> 00:58:17.570 align:middle line:90%
to the fifth world.

00:58:17.570 --> 00:58:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And there's no difference
between their theories

00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:23.010 align:middle line:84%
of the fourth and fifth
world than the Melchizedek's

00:58:23.010 --> 00:58:24.620 align:middle line:90%
third and the fourth dimension.

00:58:24.620 --> 00:58:32.340 align:middle line:84%
They just count the great
void as 1, as the first world.

00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:34.320 align:middle line:90%
We count it as 0.

00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:36.076 align:middle line:90%
We don't think it's anything.

00:58:36.076 --> 00:58:38.680 align:middle line:90%


00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:42.610 align:middle line:84%
But we're both referring
to the same moment.

00:58:42.610 --> 00:58:46.300 align:middle line:84%
Boy, they're all
psyched out, all

00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:49.000 align:middle line:90%
across-- all over the place.

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.040 align:middle line:90%
They're all preparing.

00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:51.090 align:middle line:90%
They're all ready.

00:58:51.090 --> 00:58:52.440 align:middle line:90%
They know exactly what to do.

00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:54.981 align:middle line:84%
They know right where to go,
and right where their homes are,

00:58:54.981 --> 00:58:56.300 align:middle line:90%
and what to do and everything.

00:58:56.300 --> 00:58:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of us are just
sitting here out there,

00:58:59.730 --> 00:59:02.670 align:middle line:84%
just going on as if
nothing's going on.

00:59:02.670 --> 00:59:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And we'll finally
get to the place

00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:06.110 align:middle line:84%
where they'll be
announcing on TV.

00:59:06.110 --> 00:59:09.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, don't go outside
anymore and things like this.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.211 align:middle line:84%
And we'll just
keep right on going

00:59:11.211 --> 00:59:13.040 align:middle line:90%
as though nothing's happening.

00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:17.240 align:middle line:90%


00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Take it for what
you want, but this

00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:26.577 align:middle line:84%
is the time that we're either
going to do it or we're not.

00:59:26.577 --> 00:59:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Because you're not
going to stay here.

00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:31.050 align:middle line:84%
You may want to stay
here, but we're not

00:59:31.050 --> 00:59:33.210 align:middle line:84%
going to have this
third dimensional planet

00:59:33.210 --> 00:59:35.004 align:middle line:84%
to be able to play
around in much longer.

00:59:35.004 --> 00:59:37.690 align:middle line:90%


00:59:37.690 --> 00:59:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't believe
me, check it out.

00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:42.160 align:middle line:84%
Because the more
you check it out,

00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:45.540 align:middle line:84%
you'll realize that I'm playing
lightly on this subject.

00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:48.634 align:middle line:90%
