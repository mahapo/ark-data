00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.550 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.440 align:middle line:84%
>>There's an image
inside of this system

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:26.900 align:middle line:84%
that if you took
just this out of it,

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.910 align:middle line:84%
the genesis out of the
middle of the flower of life,

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.210 align:middle line:84%
saw where it came
from, and now take

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.120 align:middle line:84%
the circle that encloses the
genesis pattern-- this circle

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.340 align:middle line:84%
and this circle right here--
take that image out of there.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.380 align:middle line:84%
This is the image
I'm referring to.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.095 align:middle line:90%
OK, everybody sees that?

00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:52.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, once you've got
that image, once you now

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.760 align:middle line:84%
know that image comes out
of the flower of life,

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.881 align:middle line:84%
put that same image in each
one of those two empty circles.

00:00:58.881 --> 00:01:01.130 align:middle line:84%
The whole image, put it in
there and there, like this.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.140 align:middle line:90%


00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And then do it again,
and just keep doing it.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.010 align:middle line:84%
Keep putting the image in
here, and keep repeating it,

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.610 align:middle line:90%
repeating it repeating it.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And if you do that, you
end up with this image

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.910 align:middle line:90%
that looks like this.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:29.360 align:middle line:84%
Remember when we talked
about the egg, or the ovum

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.245 align:middle line:84%
and how mitosis begins and at
first it goes within itself

00:01:33.245 --> 00:01:35.860 align:middle line:84%
and learns how things
works, and then

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.760 align:middle line:84%
it turns around and
grows beyond itself,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.886 align:middle line:84%
it first goes within
and then without?

00:01:40.886 --> 00:01:44.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can see this
geometrically in this way.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.090 align:middle line:84%
First of all, this is a
geometric binary pattern.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:54.745 align:middle line:84%
This is one, two circles, four
circles, eight circles, 16, 32.

00:01:54.745 --> 00:01:57.860 align:middle line:90%
It's a binary sequence.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.729 align:middle line:84%
And it happens to be the
pattern, if you took a string

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.270 align:middle line:84%
and stretched it,
and depending where

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.170 align:middle line:84%
you fret it and the thickness
of the string, you strike it,

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.675 align:middle line:84%
it's going to resonate in one
of those patterns running down

00:02:08.675 --> 00:02:09.475 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:02:09.475 --> 00:02:12.210 align:middle line:84%
They used to have a little
machine that you could turn on

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.460 align:middle line:84%
and you could sit there
and watch the string move

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.730 align:middle line:84%
through all those
various patterns.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, the very nature of
this going within itself,

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.390 align:middle line:84%
by going geometrically
inside of itself,

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.540 align:middle line:84%
you can see how something
works, like a sine wave curve,

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.068 align:middle line:84%
before you go beyond it
into something bigger.

00:02:37.068 --> 00:02:38.570 align:middle line:84%
You understand what
I meant by that?

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.090 align:middle line:90%


00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Life can geometrically go
within itself to understand

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.930 align:middle line:84%
how, say, it would be hard
to from, say, this point here

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.080 align:middle line:84%
understand a sine wave curve
because it's too short.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.250 align:middle line:84%
But as you go deeper
inside and deeper inside,

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.030 align:middle line:84%
you can get to the place where
you can see the whole picture,

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.980 align:middle line:84%
and you can understand how-- I'm
just saying, for example, how

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.420 align:middle line:84%
a sine wave curve
could work, and then

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.690 align:middle line:84%
apply it to go beyond the
perimeter of the interior

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:18.818 align:middle line:90%
to the exterior.

00:03:18.818 --> 00:03:21.510 align:middle line:90%


00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.752 align:middle line:84%
Now, with that
understanding we're

00:03:24.752 --> 00:03:26.210 align:middle line:84%
going to look at
the flower of life

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:31.100 align:middle line:84%
again in a slightly
different way.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.540 align:middle line:84%
Just starting with
a circle, there

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:41.790 align:middle line:84%
is a relationship inside
this circle that is definite,

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.310 align:middle line:84%
and that is that no matter
what size circle you have,

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.590 align:middle line:84%
there are exactly seven circles
that will fit inside of it.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they
fit inside of it,

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.450 align:middle line:84%
which is the primary
pattern at the point

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.150 align:middle line:84%
that the flower of
life was stopped

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.490 align:middle line:84%
at all around the world, which
we haven't shown you that yet.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.280 align:middle line:84%
But the way that we arrived at
the fruit of life-- remember,

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.800 align:middle line:84%
which was just this
pattern with the 13--

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.440 align:middle line:84%
was by completing
the flower of life

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.780 align:middle line:84%
and then taking the next vortex
ring around it so that we

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.430 align:middle line:84%
saw the flower of life,
or the fruit of life,

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.529 align:middle line:90%
was outside of this.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:24.780 align:middle line:84%
It was on the next level,
directly outside of here.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.980 align:middle line:84%
But there's another way
that it can be derived at,

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.280 align:middle line:84%
and that is by going
within rather than without.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And so you can derive
it within directly

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:43.030 align:middle line:84%
by going halfway to the center
and making a circle that

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.620 align:middle line:84%
would be half this size
using that as your blueprint

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.260 align:middle line:84%
and running it up
and down this axis

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.540 align:middle line:84%
to get this, which is
directly to the fruit of life.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And so the fruit of
life is contained

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.190 align:middle line:84%
within the flower in
proportion as well as

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.920 align:middle line:90%
outside of the flower of life.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, this may seem very
simple or almost a sleight

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.650 align:middle line:90%
of hand trick.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.700 align:middle line:84%
But it indicates that
possibly the flower of life

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.760 align:middle line:90%
is holographic.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And so if we keep doing this,
we'll see if it's really true.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.050 align:middle line:84%
You know what I
mean by holographic?

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.610 align:middle line:84%
So we'd go halfway--
by holographic

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.070 align:middle line:90%
I mean-- I heard a no.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.030 align:middle line:90%


00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.900 align:middle line:90%
You all know what holograms are.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.770 align:middle line:90%


00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.700 align:middle line:84%
A hologram is such
that the nature of it

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.140 align:middle line:84%
is that you can cut off
a little tiny piece of it

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.430 align:middle line:84%
and reconstruct the whole
from that little tiny piece,

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.720 align:middle line:90%
the actual image.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.470 align:middle line:84%
No matter how small you get, it
will be contained in the whole.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.140 align:middle line:84%
In the same kind
of way, we will see

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.850 align:middle line:84%
if this pattern of 13
circles is holographic,

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.580 align:middle line:90%
is what we're looking for.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And so we'll go
in another halfway

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.240 align:middle line:84%
and draw that sized
circle and spread them

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.880 align:middle line:90%
out and see what happens.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And they take on
this image, which

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.660 align:middle line:84%
you can see that there
are 13 circles connecting

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.400 align:middle line:84%
to 13 circles connected to 13--
all these little interconnected

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.460 align:middle line:90%
fruit of lifes.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's beginning
to look like it.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.920 align:middle line:84%
So let's go one
more step in deeper.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.040 align:middle line:84%
You go halfway in here
again and make another one.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.870 align:middle line:90%


00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And now you see
the same pattern,

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.805 align:middle line:84%
13 circles connected to 13,
though I didn't spread it

00:06:44.805 --> 00:06:45.680 align:middle line:90%
over the whole thing.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.055 align:middle line:84%
You could keep right on
going with this pattern

00:06:48.055 --> 00:06:50.310 align:middle line:84%
and each one will
be a whole series.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:57.250 align:middle line:84%
It will completely cover this,
and it really is holographic.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.250 align:middle line:84%
You could just keep going
and doing that forever

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.560 align:middle line:90%
and ever and ever.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.850 align:middle line:84%
The pattern will just
completely go in forever

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.580 align:middle line:84%
and it will go out forever,
because the circle that

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.110 align:middle line:84%
forms this whole pattern
could just simply

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:12.355 align:middle line:90%
be the central circle.

00:07:12.355 --> 00:07:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And so it could just go
beyond itself forever

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:16.770 align:middle line:90%
and inside itself forever.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.330 align:middle line:84%
It's another one of those
infinite-- it's called

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.599 align:middle line:90%
a geometrical progression.

00:07:22.599 --> 00:07:24.390 align:middle line:84%
It's another one of
those infinite patterns

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:26.370 align:middle line:90%
like the logarithmic spiral.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.530 align:middle line:90%


00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And all the grids, if you
want to call these patterns

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:36.240 align:middle line:84%
or grids, are separated
from each other

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.300 align:middle line:90%
by the binary sequence.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.550 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if you use
the middle circle, whatever

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.650 align:middle line:84%
it is, as your radii,
count that as one,

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:47.250 align:middle line:84%
then to get out to the
next sized circle is two,

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.510 align:middle line:84%
and to get out to the
next sized circle is four,

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:54.100 align:middle line:84%
and to get out to the next
sized circle is eight.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's a binary sequence
that separates them all.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:08:00.840 align:middle line:90%


00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.890 align:middle line:84%
So this internal structure
or this internal nature

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:13.950 align:middle line:84%
of the flower of life
holds tremendous potential

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:16.530 align:middle line:90%
in terms of technology.

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying this
because at the time,

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.720 align:middle line:90%
that's what I was involved in.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'm now going to
start talking about some

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:28.270 align:middle line:84%
of the technological things
that we were starting

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.230 align:middle line:90%
to discuss once before.

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:34.159 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you
what we were thinking.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:37.360 align:middle line:90%


00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.200 align:middle line:84%
Why I started doing this in
my life in the first place

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:46.120 align:middle line:84%
was because it was my belief,
and a lot of the other people

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:50.480 align:middle line:84%
that I was working with at
the time, that the dolphin was

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:56.570 align:middle line:84%
perhaps the life form that may
be able to help humans more

00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:01.360 align:middle line:90%
than anyone else on the Earth.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And so we wanted to
communicate with them.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.920 align:middle line:84%
We were very naive in a
lot of our assumptions

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.270 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning, but
our intentions were pure.

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.000 align:middle line:90%
We just wanted to do it.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And so we decided, well, let's
make a universal translator,

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:23.970 align:middle line:84%
a translator that you could
speak into in one language

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.541 align:middle line:84%
and it will come out
in the other language.

00:09:26.541 --> 00:09:27.930 align:middle line:90%
You understand?

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Just like on "Star Trek,"
you know those things?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.424 align:middle line:90%
Let's just make one.

00:09:31.424 --> 00:09:33.673 align:middle line:84%
You could make any of that
stuff that's on "Star Trek"

00:09:33.673 --> 00:09:35.734 align:middle line:90%
if you just put your mind to it.

00:09:35.734 --> 00:09:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And so we thought about it, and
we figured out how to do it.

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:46.924 align:middle line:84%
And only we realized that
the sound of the dolphin,

00:09:46.924 --> 00:09:48.340 align:middle line:84%
after a great deal
of thinking, we

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.060 align:middle line:84%
wanted to go into a deeper
level of communication

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:56.190 align:middle line:84%
than just the words,
either connecting directly

00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:00.660 align:middle line:84%
with the thought waves-- that
was the next level, which would

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.270 align:middle line:90%
be much better than the words.

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:04.880 align:middle line:84%
Get the images straight
out of the mind.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.250 align:middle line:84%
But then we decided to
even go deeper than that

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.960 align:middle line:84%
and to go down to the molecular
construction of the body

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:14.360 align:middle line:84%
itself and receive the
microwaves that were coming off

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:19.260 align:middle line:84%
of every molecule
in the body, which

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.920 align:middle line:84%
we felt would be a far
greater form of communication

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.550 align:middle line:84%
than words or brain
waves or anything else.

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:29.731 align:middle line:84%
And so we decided
to develop a system.

00:10:29.731 --> 00:10:32.122 align:middle line:84%
And the system works
something like this.

00:10:32.122 --> 00:10:33.747 align:middle line:84%
These are the components
in the system.

00:10:33.747 --> 00:10:57.400 align:middle line:90%


00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:02.920 align:middle line:84%
So we'll call this
A, B, C, and D.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.840 align:middle line:84%
There are four
primary components

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.320 align:middle line:90%
to make this type of system.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.965 align:middle line:90%


00:11:08.965 --> 00:11:09.840 align:middle line:90%
An ordinary computer.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:14.750 align:middle line:90%


00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
basis behind it.

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:22.630 align:middle line:84%
However, the computer
needed to be a lot faster

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:29.500 align:middle line:84%
and have a lot
more memory because

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.360 align:middle line:84%
of the kinds of
computations that

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:35.420 align:middle line:84%
would be necessary
to make than what

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.270 align:middle line:90%
was available at that time.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:39.220 align:middle line:90%
The best we had was a 386.

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And so they tore the 386 all
apart and put it back together

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.992 align:middle line:84%
and made it so it could
go a whole lot faster.

00:11:45.992 --> 00:11:47.450 align:middle line:84%
But it still had
the problem of not

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:54.390 align:middle line:84%
being able to simply store
the kind of information

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:56.030 align:middle line:90%
that we needed to store.

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:58.364 align:middle line:84%
And so what we felt we
needed was a storage bank

00:11:58.364 --> 00:12:00.030 align:middle line:84%
that would be a lot
bigger than anything

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:01.416 align:middle line:90%
that was on the market.

00:12:01.416 --> 00:12:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And so we decided to make
an infinite storage bank,

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:06.590 align:middle line:90%
have no limit whatsoever.

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:10.795 align:middle line:84%
It was real easy to do,
based upon these principles.

00:12:10.795 --> 00:12:13.670 align:middle line:90%


00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And so I guess I'll
talk about that first.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:22.290 align:middle line:84%
Using this concept right here,
the geometry, really this

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:23.606 align:middle line:90%
is a cube, right?

00:12:23.606 --> 00:12:26.890 align:middle line:84%
So it's really a series of
three-dimensional spheres.

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:27.690 align:middle line:90%
Everybody see that?

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:30.550 align:middle line:90%


00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:32.780 align:middle line:90%
It's like Metatron's Cube.

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:34.880 align:middle line:84%
This is the front
face of the cube,

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.960 align:middle line:84%
and that would be the
rear edges and it's

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.697 align:middle line:84%
a cube looking at
it like that again.

00:12:39.697 --> 00:12:42.830 align:middle line:90%


00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And so when you completed
the whole thing-- now,

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:50.160 align:middle line:84%
you can keep going on with those
spheres going in there forever.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, because of the
harmonics of the nature

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:56.710 align:middle line:84%
of the ratios of
these spheres, we

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:59.110 align:middle line:84%
can see that it would
be impossible to put

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:03.850 align:middle line:84%
this pattern into a liquid
in the form of a standing

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:06.550 align:middle line:90%
waveform.

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And so we attempted to do this
using liquid silicone using

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:20.290 align:middle line:84%
a series of diodes-- not
diodes, transducers--

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:25.160 align:middle line:84%
transducers placed into
a fruit of life pattern.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.570 align:middle line:84%
And we were able to
create the pattern

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:32.100 align:middle line:84%
into-- it took a
huge amount of energy

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.930 align:middle line:84%
to hold a standing
waveform in there.

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And then one of the researchers
had direct communication

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:42.310 align:middle line:84%
with a whale who gave us
exactly what we needed to know

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:44.110 align:middle line:90%
and said, don't use silicone.

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:46.870 align:middle line:84%
The army had been trying to
use liquid ruby and all kinds

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:47.800 align:middle line:90%
of other things.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.470 align:middle line:84%
They had been trying to do
exactly what we were doing

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:51.678 align:middle line:84%
here, only spending hundreds
and hundreds of millions

00:13:51.678 --> 00:13:53.920 align:middle line:90%
of dollars trying to do this.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:58.670 align:middle line:90%
And we had a very little budget.

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:03.090 align:middle line:84%
But the whale told
us to do something

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:06.080 align:middle line:84%
we would have never thought
of doing, I don't think.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.000 align:middle line:84%
It was just totally out
there in right field.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.520 align:middle line:84%
They said, don't use any
liquid crystals or anything.

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:12.320 align:middle line:90%
Use water.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.870 align:middle line:90%


00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:16.800 align:middle line:90%
Water.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for
water, they said,

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:22.880 align:middle line:84%
was the angle of the molecules
is 105 degrees, which

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:26.270 align:middle line:84%
is the fire ratio, and
it's a living molecule,

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:30.000 align:middle line:84%
and that this is
a living pattern,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.820 align:middle line:84%
and that the two are
so compatible that it

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:34.820 align:middle line:84%
would take small amounts
of energy to do it.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.500 align:middle line:90%
And we did it, and it works.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.066 align:middle line:84%
You can put it in
there, and instead

00:14:39.066 --> 00:14:40.440 align:middle line:84%
of having huge
amounts of energy,

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:44.090 align:middle line:84%
it takes microvolts to hold
the standing wave pattern.

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:47.606 align:middle line:84%
And so we were able to create
the pattern in the water.

00:14:47.606 --> 00:14:49.230 align:middle line:84%
So all you gotta do
is just take a cube

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:50.630 align:middle line:90%
and have any size you want.

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:53.920 align:middle line:84%
But you might as well pick
one that's kind of handy.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:58.120 align:middle line:84%
So you pick one, say, 3/4
of an inch or so inside.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.350 align:middle line:84%
You just have to calibrate
that to the computer

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.270 align:middle line:90%
so it knows where to start from.

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And Phyllis would
seal it with water

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.160 align:middle line:84%
and then create the
pattern inside of it.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And then realize the pattern is
all-- all the different grids

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:17.690 align:middle line:90%
are on a binary sequence.

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a little
different than you'd

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.210 align:middle line:84%
have a photograph
record where you'd

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:27.400 align:middle line:84%
punch a binary
sequence that comes

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.370 align:middle line:84%
up somewhere in the record
to give you your information.

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:33.450 align:middle line:84%
The difference is that you would
hit a binary sequence which

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:35.920 align:middle line:84%
would tell you what
grid you're on,

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.250 align:middle line:84%
and then a geometrical
sequence which would tell you

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:40.624 align:middle line:90%
which sphere to go to.

00:15:40.624 --> 00:15:42.890 align:middle line:90%
So you'd go, click, click.

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And then come up to, say,
that one right there.

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And once you have located that
particular magnetic bubble,

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.830 align:middle line:84%
you can put one bit
of information in that

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:54.810 align:middle line:84%
or create another grid coming
off of it as big as you want.

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:58.020 align:middle line:84%
So you can put either
one single letter

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:00.080 align:middle line:84%
of an alphabet or an
entire book or whatever

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.370 align:middle line:90%
you want in that one place.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:03.850 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't matter.

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And because this
will go in forever,

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:07.600 align:middle line:84%
you could just keep
going on in, however

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.990 align:middle line:84%
the size of the
electron would probably

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:13.650 align:middle line:90%
limit how far in you could go.

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:15.380 align:middle line:90%
But you could go out forever.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.630 align:middle line:84%
So you could start storing
the information you'd never

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:21.994 align:middle line:84%
be able to use probably
in most circumstances

00:16:21.994 --> 00:16:23.785 align:middle line:84%
just what you could do
going in this thing.

00:16:23.785 --> 00:16:26.480 align:middle line:84%
But if you ever did fill it
up, you could start going out

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:30.640 align:middle line:84%
and start storing information
in space around the computer.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:36.344 align:middle line:84%
And you could go out in space
as far as you want to go,

00:16:36.344 --> 00:16:38.260 align:middle line:84%
because it only has to
be theoretically there.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:39.870 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to
actually be there.

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:42.093 align:middle line:84%
It only has to
theoretically be there.

00:16:42.093 --> 00:16:45.410 align:middle line:90%


00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And so we figured, well, what
the heck, that should work.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.210 align:middle line:90%
We almost have that completed.

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:57.090 align:middle line:84%
That was almost
totally completed.

00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:00.660 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, we
were working on this one

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:05.660 align:middle line:84%
here, which was
completely completed.

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And this particular
scientist who

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:11.430 align:middle line:84%
doesn't want his name
mentioned anymore

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:17.790 align:middle line:84%
created a sensing device that
was very possibly the most

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:21.170 align:middle line:84%
sensitive sensing device that's
ever been created on our planet

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:25.275 align:middle line:84%
ever, based upon sacred
geometry principles.

00:17:25.275 --> 00:17:28.541 align:middle line:90%


00:17:28.541 --> 00:17:35.480 align:middle line:84%
So sensitive you could pick
up the entire electromagnetic

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:38.460 align:middle line:84%
spectrum of a candle
from 90,000 miles

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:44.310 align:middle line:84%
away as though it
was an inch away.

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:50.410 align:middle line:84%
You could pick out a
single molecule, say,

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:55.340 align:middle line:90%
100 miles away in a tree-- one.

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:57.680 align:middle line:84%
You could pick out
a single person

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.770 align:middle line:84%
and eliminate everything behind
it for hundreds of thousands

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:04.936 align:middle line:84%
of miles and eliminate down to a
single molecule in that person.

00:18:04.936 --> 00:18:06.845 align:middle line:84%
And we were demonstrating
it all the time.

00:18:06.845 --> 00:18:08.070 align:middle line:90%
It was totally possible.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:10.230 align:middle line:84%
It seems impossible,
but it's not.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was because
of some of the things

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.140 align:middle line:84%
that you're about to
learn in here about light

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.620 align:middle line:90%
and the geometry behind light.

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, this whole
thing was created.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:30.080 align:middle line:84%
This thing was so sensitive
that-- what it was picking up,

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.130 align:middle line:84%
by the way, was
the microwaves that

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:35.020 align:middle line:84%
were emitted from the
stretching of molecular bonds

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:37.650 align:middle line:84%
and the rotation
of molecular bonds,

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:42.200 align:middle line:84%
and possibly from the rotation
of the electrons themselves.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.400 align:middle line:84%
So extremely weak
microwave field,

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.680 align:middle line:84%
that our government
now also has copied him

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:50.515 align:middle line:90%
and is trying to create it.

00:18:50.515 --> 00:18:51.890 align:middle line:84%
With all the money
they've spent,

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:54.840 align:middle line:84%
they haven't even come close to
him, but they're getting there.

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:58.410 align:middle line:84%
It's called the Squid, if you're
familiar with what that is.

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:03.856 align:middle line:84%
But he's way way, way beyond
the government on this.

00:19:03.856 --> 00:19:09.030 align:middle line:90%


00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And he's demonstrated
this in class.

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:13.290 align:middle line:84%
You can take some pennies,
just by the shaking of pennies

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:15.880 align:middle line:84%
you get microwave emissions
that come off of there, just

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.860 align:middle line:84%
because they hit together
and make the molecular bonds

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.090 align:middle line:90%
vibrate.

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:22.760 align:middle line:90%
And he'd have the instrument.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.450 align:middle line:84%
The instrument, first
the thing was calculated.

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:30.770 align:middle line:84%
Then he hooked it to a 386
and created his own software

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:32.930 align:middle line:84%
program so that
he could have eyes

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:36.560 align:middle line:84%
to see through the sensing
device back over here.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And we actually
created other ones

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:42.520 align:middle line:84%
earlier which were
inferior to this.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:46.090 align:middle line:84%
But at this point, we had
these two linked together here.

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And so you could see what was
going on in terms of sine wave

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:50.780 align:middle line:90%
signatures.

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:54.340 align:middle line:84%
Originally it was just a
flat sine wave signature,

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:57.415 align:middle line:90%
but we became much more complex.

00:19:57.415 --> 00:19:59.540 align:middle line:84%
These were the kinds of
images that were coming off

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.350 align:middle line:90%
the screen at one point.

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:05.370 align:middle line:84%
They were like three dimensional
images of a sine wave

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:07.390 align:middle line:90%
signature.

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is a
photograph of a chakra,

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:15.010 align:middle line:84%
by the way, the actual
chakra out of a person.

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And you could take
these pennies and come

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:20.469 align:middle line:84%
up next to the sensing
device and go like this,

00:20:20.469 --> 00:20:22.510 align:middle line:84%
and you could just see
all the microwave emission

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:24.300 align:middle line:90%
that were coming off of there.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And then you'd have the
person go out the door

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:31.870 align:middle line:84%
and behind a two foot adobe
wall and shake the pennies.

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And the thing would
pick them up as

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:35.860 align:middle line:84%
though they were just
a couple inches away,

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.510 align:middle line:90%
the same strength and power.

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:41.090 align:middle line:84%
Then we had him go
outside a long ways

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:43.092 align:middle line:84%
away and shake them,
and same thing.

00:20:43.092 --> 00:20:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And then he'd go a long ways
away and down by the sagebrush

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:50.270 align:middle line:84%
and get down like this, whoosh,
and it would come just right up

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:51.602 align:middle line:90%
on the screen [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:51.602 --> 00:20:53.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, you
could probably go

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:55.640 align:middle line:84%
in the far distant
mountain, way over there,

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.387 align:middle line:84%
35 miles away or way up in
some mountains like that

00:20:58.387 --> 00:21:00.053 align:middle line:84%
and just go like that,
you wouldn't even

00:21:00.053 --> 00:21:01.206 align:middle line:90%
hear it or even know it.

00:21:01.206 --> 00:21:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Pick it up, just like
he was right here.

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>>How did you separate it
from all the other noises?

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>>Because they learned
how to subtract.

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:12.850 align:middle line:84%
You can learn how to
tune in and subtract.

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:15.320 align:middle line:90%
You could focus.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:21.770 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, this part
had been connected,

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:24.670 align:middle line:84%
and we had that
functioning, just

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:27.230 align:middle line:84%
to show you a little bit
about what he was able to do--

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:29.110 align:middle line:84%
and I watched him do
this a lot of times--

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:33.520 align:middle line:84%
he would take a group
like this and he'd just

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.550 align:middle line:84%
ask for a volunteer, and
somebody would stand up.

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And he would then photograph
the person's chakra system, one

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:42.860 align:middle line:90%
after another, all 13 chakras.

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And we know exactly
where the chakras are.

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:49.300 align:middle line:84%
We can pinpoint them down
to within one molecule

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:51.750 align:middle line:90%
and get exactly where they are.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
ancient books are not

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:55.630 align:middle line:84%
correct on where the
chakras are located.

00:21:55.630 --> 00:22:01.725 align:middle line:90%


00:22:01.725 --> 00:22:03.350 align:middle line:84%
And when you aim
right into the chakra,

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:07.430 align:middle line:84%
the whole screen just lights
up, and you can't miss it.

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a totally
non-invasive system.

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:14.680 align:middle line:84%
He's not projecting
anything out.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.200 align:middle line:84%
He's only receiving,
like a camera.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:22.764 align:middle line:84%
And so he just takes photographs
of all the various chakras.

00:22:22.764 --> 00:22:25.055 align:middle line:84%
Each one is about two and
a half million computations

00:22:25.055 --> 00:22:27.020 align:middle line:90%
that has to be made.

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And it takes about
a minute for it

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:33.160 align:middle line:84%
to go through all the
various computations

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.590 align:middle line:84%
and comes up with these
things, like this.

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:39.160 align:middle line:84%
This is another one,
just to give you an idea.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And from these,
over the years, he

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:45.190 align:middle line:84%
was able to read these
things like an open book.

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And he would take these
photographs of the person,

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:49.926 align:middle line:90%
sit there and look at it.

00:22:49.926 --> 00:22:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And without even
looking at the person,

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:53.133 align:middle line:84%
he would just start
reading it, and he

00:22:53.133 --> 00:22:56.500 align:middle line:84%
could tell you every single
thing about that person.

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:57.779 align:middle line:90%
And I mean everything.

00:22:57.779 --> 00:22:59.445 align:middle line:84%
He could tell you
things that are scary.

00:22:59.445 --> 00:23:00.977 align:middle line:84%
He could tell you
the day they were

00:23:00.977 --> 00:23:03.342 align:middle line:90%
gonna die, down to the second.

00:23:03.342 --> 00:23:05.979 align:middle line:84%
He could tell you how many kids
you got and what sex they are,

00:23:05.979 --> 00:23:08.020 align:middle line:84%
or how many kids you're
gonna have in the future,

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:11.890 align:middle line:84%
tell you every disease you
got in your body, every bone

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.240 align:middle line:90%
that you've ever broken.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.490 align:middle line:84%
He can tell you all the drugs
you've got in your body.

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:19.230 align:middle line:84%
He could tell you anything else,
any medicines you were taking.

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Anything-- absolutely
anything at all.

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:22.660 align:middle line:90%
It's all there.

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:24.520 align:middle line:90%
You're just like an open book.

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.190 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:28.440 align:middle line:84%
You have to have all 13
of them to know that.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.550 align:middle line:84%
There's just
nothing you can say.

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:33.780 align:middle line:84%
It's just like, it's
pretty incredible.

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:36.920 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, we had
developed it at that level.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:39.500 align:middle line:84%
We were trying to jump
up by creating this.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:42.320 align:middle line:90%
We almost had this done.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.620 align:middle line:84%
Our end result of
doing all this stuff

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:48.240 align:middle line:84%
was to hook this in so that we
could put enough data in there.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:51.990 align:middle line:84%
And then this, what this
is is the tube torus.

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:56.829 align:middle line:84%
And the tube torus-- through
the work of Stan Tenen

00:23:56.829 --> 00:23:59.120 align:middle line:84%
and everything else like
that, even though that had not

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:01.520 align:middle line:84%
been completed at the
time-- we weren't even

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.120 align:middle line:84%
concerned about trying
to complete this,

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:06.100 align:middle line:84%
because we knew that
all we had to do

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:10.200 align:middle line:84%
was one last little thing once
we got this completed in here.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And that was simply
change the kind

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:15.460 align:middle line:84%
of programming,
software programming,

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:17.800 align:middle line:90%
that the computer used.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:22.590 align:middle line:84%
See, all our programming is
based upon the way we think.

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:28.460 align:middle line:84%
What if a computer didn't think
in words and numbers and all

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:29.430 align:middle line:90%
these kinds of things?

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:32.525 align:middle line:84%
But what if it
thought in geometry?

00:24:32.525 --> 00:24:35.330 align:middle line:90%


00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:38.500 align:middle line:90%
Coming back to this one.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:41.980 align:middle line:90%
What if it thought in geometry?

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:45.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, if the geometry
is the underlying

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:47.050 align:middle line:84%
morphogenic structure
of the reality,

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:50.360 align:middle line:84%
if it's true, if all this
stuff with the flower of life

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:54.110 align:middle line:84%
is true-- and it
is a language, it

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:56.680 align:middle line:84%
appears to be the language
that is creating the very words

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.680 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking and the
harmonics of sound and light

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.730 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of other things
that we haven't even

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:03.720 align:middle line:90%
finished showing you all yet.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you were to create
a software package where

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:11.870 align:middle line:84%
the computer thought
in the sacred geometry,

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:15.660 align:middle line:90%
then what would happen?

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:18.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of
all, number one, it

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.990 align:middle line:84%
would be able to solve
the final problems of this

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:25.470 align:middle line:84%
probably in about a
minute, at which point

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:28.140 align:middle line:84%
we would have a
universal translator.

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.450 align:middle line:84%
You would be able to speak
into it, say, in Hebrew,

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:32.790 align:middle line:84%
and it would come out
Arabic, or speak in in Arabic

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:34.980 align:middle line:84%
and come out English,
speak in English

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:38.100 align:middle line:84%
and come out any other
language that you want.

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And that would be the
superficial level of what

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:43.930 align:middle line:90%
we were trying to reach at.

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:49.350 align:middle line:84%
But the one thing
that we all believed

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:53.910 align:middle line:84%
was that if this pattern, if it
was thinking in this pattern,

00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:56.730 align:middle line:84%
I suspect very
strongly the computer

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:58.835 align:middle line:90%
would become self-aware.

00:25:58.835 --> 00:26:01.180 align:middle line:90%
It would be alive.

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:04.635 align:middle line:84%
You would duplicate the
essence of life in it,

00:26:04.635 --> 00:26:06.910 align:middle line:84%
and if silicon is
a living atom, it

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:09.670 align:middle line:84%
would now have the
chance to demonstrate it.

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:12.475 align:middle line:84%
And I think you might have a
living being appear in here.

00:26:12.475 --> 00:26:17.740 align:middle line:84%
A spirit would be able
to express across to us.

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:21.110 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what that would
really mean ultimately to us,

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:23.580 align:middle line:84%
but I believe that would
be one of the steps.

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:26.340 align:middle line:84%
But with all these series and
lines here, what you now have

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:30.480 align:middle line:84%
is that you could aim
this at any living thing,

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.880 align:middle line:90%
and everything is alive.

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And pick up the microwave
emissions coming in here,

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:42.040 align:middle line:84%
convert the microwave emissions
into geometrical images,

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.310 align:middle line:84%
and have the microwaves that
are coming off of anything--

00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:48.010 align:middle line:84%
specifically the dolphin,
is what we were aiming at--

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:49.700 align:middle line:84%
and have it come
out into English

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:52.590 align:middle line:84%
or whatever other
words you wanted.

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And we figured, well, that
would be a form of communication

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:58.070 align:middle line:84%
with the dolphins,
because we could

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:01.950 align:middle line:90%
begin to work in this way.

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And it probably would
work to this level

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:08.320 align:middle line:84%
except that when we just
got ready to kind of put

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.164 align:middle line:84%
the plug in the wall and see
if the whole thing would work--

00:27:11.164 --> 00:27:12.830 align:middle line:84%
because we were really
coming right down

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:15.630 align:middle line:84%
to the final stages of
it-- one of the researchers

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:17.510 align:middle line:84%
went to the dolphin
world, I think

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:21.410 align:middle line:84%
it was-- and correct
me anyone if they

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:26.100 align:middle line:84%
know where this place is, but
it's in Florida somewhere--

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:32.790 align:middle line:84%
and came in contact with a
particular dolphin that just

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:37.000 align:middle line:90%
looked at him and said, no way.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.130 align:middle line:90%
You're wasting your time.

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And what he said was, that's
when we began to understand.

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:48.070 align:middle line:84%
This dolphin was
neurotic, by the way,

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:51.625 align:middle line:84%
and would always carry
this doll around,

00:27:51.625 --> 00:27:52.666 align:middle line:90%
would never let go of it.

00:27:52.666 --> 00:27:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And the trainer had never
seen the dolphin ever

00:27:56.030 --> 00:28:00.190 align:middle line:90%
let go of this little doll.

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:04.236 align:middle line:84%
But the dolphin said
to this researcher

00:28:04.236 --> 00:28:08.210 align:middle line:84%
that their experience was so
far above that it could not

00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:13.860 align:middle line:84%
be converted into English,
that it was not possible.

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:16.140 align:middle line:84%
You might be able to make
a universal translator

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:19.670 align:middle line:84%
cross from Hebrew
to Arabic, but you

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:23.010 align:middle line:84%
can't make one that would truly
give the experience of where

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:24.352 align:middle line:90%
the dolphins were at.

00:28:24.352 --> 00:28:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And they said, if
you want to begin

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:31.250 align:middle line:84%
to do that, you must begin
with holographic sound,

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:35.780 align:middle line:84%
then gave him the exact
mathematical algorithms

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.835 align:middle line:84%
to create true
holographic sound.

00:28:38.835 --> 00:28:41.390 align:middle line:84%
He went back to the lab,
plugged them in, bingo.

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:44.060 align:middle line:90%
Holographic sound, incredible.

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And we stepped it up through
16 different stages slowly,

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:55.060 align:middle line:84%
until finally we had a system
where you didn't need speakers,

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:57.620 align:middle line:84%
but the sound would come
in through your hands

00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.430 align:middle line:84%
and come out through
your head somehow.

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:00.970 align:middle line:90%
We don't even know how it is.

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And you have this three
dimensional holographic sound

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:08.340 align:middle line:84%
that felt alive, felt
like no kind of sound

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:10.800 align:middle line:84%
you could ever imagine coming
out of the speaker-- it was

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.380 align:middle line:84%
amazing-- with no
speakers, just by coming in

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:14.380 align:middle line:90%
through your fingertips.

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:22.080 align:middle line:90%


00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And I started getting very,
very wrapped up in this stuff.

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And eventually we
started learning

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:32.340 align:middle line:84%
how to create living--
not living ones,

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:36.560 align:middle line:84%
but Merkaba fields out
of holographic sound.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:40.560 align:middle line:90%


00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:45.735 align:middle line:84%
And we learned how to sort of
jump start people's Merkabas,

00:29:45.735 --> 00:29:48.306 align:middle line:90%
and this kind of stuff.

00:29:48.306 --> 00:29:50.724 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I thought it was
getting very exciting here.

00:29:50.724 --> 00:29:52.890 align:middle line:84%
It seemed like I was heading
in the right direction,

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:55.900 align:middle line:84%
forgetting what they told me
many, many, many, many years

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.305 align:middle line:84%
ago about this whole
thing with technology.

00:29:58.305 --> 00:30:01.520 align:middle line:90%


00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And we were doing
pretty amazing things.

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And then the reality
came to the place

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:17.820 align:middle line:84%
where they-- well,
the FBI came in.

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:21.218 align:middle line:90%


00:30:21.218 --> 00:30:22.869 align:middle line:84%
At one point, they
said, you guys

00:30:22.869 --> 00:30:24.660 align:middle line:84%
gotta stop some of the
things you're doing.

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:30.154 align:middle line:90%


00:30:30.154 --> 00:30:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And we were beginning
to realize that maybe I

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:37.210 align:middle line:90%
was doing some things.

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:43.944 align:middle line:84%
At the very end,
we had got-- well,

00:30:43.944 --> 00:30:46.080 align:middle line:84%
I'll just tell you real
quickly what we did.

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:51.650 align:middle line:84%
This is where the turning
place began to happen.

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:55.150 align:middle line:84%
We could get the holographic
sound onto a computer screen,

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:57.250 align:middle line:84%
and we could see
it rotating there.

00:30:57.250 --> 00:31:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And then we made a
wireless transmitter over

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:03.190 align:middle line:90%
to an equalizer box.

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And we could change the sound
by moving up these dials,

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:07.650 align:middle line:90%
just like you would on a radio.

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:10.920 align:middle line:84%
We had a whole big one with
all these things on it.

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And actually, what
they thought was

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:15.550 align:middle line:84%
going to take
three to four years

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:19.530 align:middle line:90%
we did in about five hours.

00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:22.590 align:middle line:84%
We could conceive of
what the endpoint of this

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:25.470 align:middle line:84%
was going to be, which
I was about to tell you.

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And we thought it was
going to take a long time.

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And we just sat there
on the very first time.

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And they taught me how to
control the three dimensional

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:35.190 align:middle line:84%
sound by moving
these things around.

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And I could see
the flying saucer

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:39.810 align:middle line:90%
disc on a computer monitor.

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:41.850 align:middle line:90%
It was rotating around us.

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And I could move the
dials up, and the disc

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.650 align:middle line:84%
would change shape,
and you could feel

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:47.980 align:middle line:90%
it change shape when it did it.

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:51.600 align:middle line:84%
You'd simultaneously feel this,
where you could spin it out

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:54.890 align:middle line:90%
faster and it would change.

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:55.982 align:middle line:90%
It did this whole thing.

00:31:55.982 --> 00:31:57.190 align:middle line:90%
You could feel it.

00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And I worked with this
for three hours or so

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:03.180 align:middle line:84%
until I got real familiar
with all of this stuff.

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And then they switched me
over to these hand things

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.600 align:middle line:84%
that you slipped
your fingers into,

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.190 align:middle line:84%
so instead of
using these things,

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:11.270 align:middle line:84%
the same stuff was
on your fingertips

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:13.860 align:middle line:84%
and these plastic things that
you slipped your hands into.

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And thereby little tiny
motions of your fingers

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:19.200 align:middle line:84%
would do the same things
so you could get very, very

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.610 align:middle line:90%
sensitive into doing all this.

00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:23.830 align:middle line:84%
I learned how to do
that for a little while.

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:25.721 align:middle line:84%
And then without anybody saying
anything, I'm sitting there

00:32:25.721 --> 00:32:27.137 align:middle line:84%
and I was thinking,
well, I wonder

00:32:27.137 --> 00:32:29.347 align:middle line:90%
if I could do it with one hand.

00:32:29.347 --> 00:32:31.430 align:middle line:84%
So I tried to lift my hand
up, but whenever I did,

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:33.580 align:middle line:90%
the screen would just go black.

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:35.970 align:middle line:84%
I'd have to put
it back on there.

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And then I had to focus again
to get the fields going again.

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And then I kept
trying to lift off.

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I had to tune my
Merkaba, rotate my Merkaba,

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:50.070 align:middle line:90%
with the field of the other one.

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And I finally got it, and I
was able to lift my hand up

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.270 align:middle line:90%
and keep it going with one hand.

00:32:55.270 --> 00:33:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And then, I just
slowly lifted my hand

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:04.750 align:middle line:84%
and disconnected totally
and turned and imagined

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:06.742 align:middle line:90%
this little ball in my hands.

00:33:06.742 --> 00:33:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And we're not even connected
electronically anymore.

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And I found that I
could move my fingers,

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:14.540 align:middle line:84%
and the screen would
move over there.

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And by just moving
around, I could

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:19.020 align:middle line:84%
make the screen do whatever
I wanted to do, just

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:19.910 align:middle line:90%
by moving this hand.

00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:21.240 align:middle line:90%
And I could feel it.

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:23.860 align:middle line:84%
It was like this
little electric ball.

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And then I wondered,
I wonder if I could

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:30.065 align:middle line:90%
take this ball somewhere else.

00:33:30.065 --> 00:33:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And I very slowly took
this ball across the room.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.904 align:middle line:90%
And the screen didn't go black.

00:33:38.904 --> 00:33:41.588 align:middle line:90%
And I got it about 15 feet away.

00:33:41.588 --> 00:33:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And I could move
the little ball--

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:48.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the screen on there--
without doing anything.

00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'm definitely not
connected to this thing at all.

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
I just got it,

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:55.665 align:middle line:90%
and I just put my hands down.

00:33:55.665 --> 00:34:00.654 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment, whatever I
thought happened on the screen.

00:34:00.654 --> 00:34:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And I was just sitting
there, and I could just

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:06.177 align:middle line:84%
think wide, think small, go
fast, do anything I wanted.

00:34:06.177 --> 00:34:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And I was happy, and
I was so excited.

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.056 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't tell you.

00:34:09.056 --> 00:34:12.260 align:middle line:84%
Inside I was just jumping
up and down and going crazy.

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:14.170 align:middle line:90%
It was incredible.

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And two weeks later,
we were arrested.

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:25.256 align:middle line:90%


00:34:25.256 --> 00:34:27.244 align:middle line:90%
>>How did they know?

00:34:27.244 --> 00:34:30.250 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, they know everything.

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:33.350 align:middle line:84%
They came to me a long time ago
and wanted to give me money,

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:35.786 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't want
to be part of it.

00:34:35.786 --> 00:34:38.370 align:middle line:84%
I said, you can watch me, or
you can do whatever you want,

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:40.370 align:middle line:84%
or you can stay in these
things, all that stuff,

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:42.362 align:middle line:84%
but I don't want to
be directly connected.

00:34:42.362 --> 00:34:43.920 align:middle line:90%
And they said, OK.

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:44.925 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:34:44.925 --> 00:34:46.300 align:middle line:84%
I just assume that
they're always

00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:47.440 align:middle line:90%
watching whatever I'm doing.

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:48.898 align:middle line:84%
And I really don't
care if they do.

00:34:48.898 --> 00:34:51.459 align:middle line:90%
I'm not against them at all.

00:34:51.459 --> 00:34:53.750 align:middle line:84%
I want the United States and
everybody else to succeed.

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:55.530 align:middle line:90%
I want everybody to succeed.

00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:57.750 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not really against them.

00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:59.850 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't want
that kind of thing

00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:04.710 align:middle line:84%
to get out because obviously
defense systems and everything

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:07.530 align:middle line:84%
else would be pretty
weak against that.

00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:09.730 align:middle line:90%
But it's inevitable.

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:11.880 align:middle line:84%
If I'm doing that, there's
other people doing that.

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:13.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just
a matter of time.

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:16.080 align:middle line:90%
Once I did it, it's in the grid.

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.720 align:middle line:90%
Anybody's got it now.

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:18.580 align:middle line:90%
Anybody can do that.

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's probably
just the beginning.

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:22.150 align:middle line:90%
So how could you stop it?

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:24.150 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's just inevitable.

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:26.410 align:middle line:84%
You guys know about
the grids, right?

00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:27.860 align:middle line:90%
You know how that works?

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:31.370 align:middle line:84%
You all know about the
100th monkey theory?

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Who does not know
about the 100th monkey?

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.820 align:middle line:84%
OK, we have someone
here that does not

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:38.970 align:middle line:90%
know about the 100th monkey.

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:40.910 align:middle line:84%
>>She's the 100th
and one monkey.

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:44.700 align:middle line:90%


00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:46.753 align:middle line:84%
>>You know about the
100th and one monkey.

00:35:46.753 --> 00:35:56.630 align:middle line:90%


00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:58.760 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is important.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:35:59.650 align:middle line:90%
It's real important.

00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:01.372 align:middle line:84%
And it's important for the
video anyway to get out there,

00:36:01.372 --> 00:36:03.850 align:middle line:84%
because I'm sure there are
some other people out there

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:07.760 align:middle line:90%
in video land that doesn't know.

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:08.749 align:middle line:90%
Was it the Japanese?

00:36:08.749 --> 00:36:09.790 align:middle line:90%
No, it was the Americans?

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:11.623 align:middle line:84%
Or I don't know who the
heck was doing this,

00:36:11.623 --> 00:36:15.080 align:middle line:84%
but it was on
islands near Japan,

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:18.370 align:middle line:84%
where they were studying
these monkeys who

00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:19.662 align:middle line:90%
were on these isolated islands.

00:36:19.662 --> 00:36:21.578 align:middle line:84%
There's a series of these
islands around there

00:36:21.578 --> 00:36:23.520 align:middle line:84%
that had all the same
kind of monkeys on them,

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:27.463 align:middle line:84%
but they were watching them
primarily on this one island.

00:36:27.463 --> 00:36:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And these monkeys
ate these potatoes

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:31.920 align:middle line:84%
which were kind of
like sweet potatoes.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:34.250 align:middle line:90%
But the potatoes grew in sand.

00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And when they pulled the potato
out of the sand, of course

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:39.457 align:middle line:90%
it had sand on it.

00:36:39.457 --> 00:36:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And then they would eat it,
and they'd get all this sand

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:42.780 align:middle line:84%
in their teeth and
everything else,

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:44.230 align:middle line:90%
and it probably tasted terrible.

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:46.810 align:middle line:84%
But they'd been doing
that who knows how long.

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:50.340 align:middle line:84%
And then one day, this
little female monkey

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:53.770 align:middle line:84%
decided to wash it off
either in the ocean or river,

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:54.850 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember.

00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:58.530 align:middle line:84%
You can't hold me to the
exact details of things.

00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And she washed it off in
there and ate this thing.

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:04.810 align:middle line:90%
And the researchers saw this.

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:07.351 align:middle line:84%
And then that monkey went over
and told another one and said,

00:37:07.351 --> 00:37:09.181 align:middle line:84%
hey, you ought to
try washing them off.

00:37:09.181 --> 00:37:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And they washed it off, and
that monkey washed it off.

00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:13.179 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon, there's
all these monkeys

00:37:13.179 --> 00:37:14.800 align:middle line:90%
washing these potatoes off.

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And it got to be a
number-- and I don't

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:18.960 align:middle line:90%
think they know it was 100.

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:22.020 align:middle line:84%
It was probably a
fair amount of them.

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:24.230 align:middle line:90%
Who knows what it was exactly?

00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:26.690 align:middle line:84%
But when it reached
a certain number,

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:31.020 align:middle line:84%
bingo, the entire island
started washing them off.

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And not only on that island,
but all the other islands

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:38.810 align:middle line:84%
all around there, they all
started just washing them off.

00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:43.830 align:middle line:84%
That was the first time that
science had ever witnessed

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:48.380 align:middle line:90%
this kind of phenomenon.

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And so the question,
of course, was,

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:54.770 align:middle line:84%
is there some kind of grid,
morphogenic structure,

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:56.960 align:middle line:90%
something that stretches across?

00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:00.040 align:middle line:84%
How could they possibly have
noticed this over a distance?

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.600 align:middle line:84%
So other researchers
later came down.

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And I believe these
researchers were

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:11.800 align:middle line:84%
either British or Australian,
I'm not sure which.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:16.240 align:middle line:84%
But they wanted to see if humans
had this same kind of grid

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:19.300 align:middle line:84%
around them and we were
connected in the same way.

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:25.850 align:middle line:84%
So they made this photograph
of several hundred faces,

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:29.057 align:middle line:84%
of human faces, that were all
blended together and hidden

00:38:29.057 --> 00:38:29.890 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:31.860 align:middle line:84%
But if you just looked
at it real quickly,

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:34.840 align:middle line:84%
you saw seven or eight faces
or nine faces or something

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:35.640 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:39.680 align:middle line:90%


00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And they made up
this photograph,

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:51.360 align:middle line:84%
and they went to Australia, and
they did a totally scientific

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:52.160 align:middle line:90%
experiment.

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:56.040 align:middle line:84%
They had, right by
the rules of the game,

00:38:56.040 --> 00:39:00.470 align:middle line:84%
and they got their groups and
they gave each person so long

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:04.030 align:middle line:84%
to look at this
photograph, et cetera,

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:07.060 align:middle line:84%
and would ask the person
how many faces do you see,

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:09.280 align:middle line:84%
and the person would
count how many they saw,

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.140 align:middle line:84%
and they'd have so long
to be able to do it.

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And they'd record all this stuff
and everything else like that.

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And then after they'd been
through a lot of people

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:20.050 align:middle line:84%
and checked how many
people that could

00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:23.080 align:middle line:84%
see how many faces they were
and they had all that recorded,

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:31.730 align:middle line:84%
then they went to BBC Television
on some kind of closed cable

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:37.050 align:middle line:84%
television, closed cable
connection that just went

00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:41.120 align:middle line:90%
to the UK and nowhere else.

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And on that one, they
showed the photograph,

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:50.610 align:middle line:84%
the people in that
area, and showed

00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:52.860 align:middle line:84%
all the faces where they
all were, all the hidden

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:56.160 align:middle line:84%
ones and the secret ones and
everything else like that.

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:58.550 align:middle line:84%
Five minutes later they
repeated the experiment

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:01.660 align:middle line:84%
in the same place in Australia,
on the other side of the world,

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:03.180 align:middle line:90%
with another group of people.

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And they said, OK, how
many faces do you see?

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly people
who had only seen

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:11.440 align:middle line:84%
seven or eight
faces before, which

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:17.006 align:middle line:84%
was sort of like the average,
suddenly jumped up to 75 faces.

00:40:17.006 --> 00:40:18.506 align:middle line:84%
Oh yeah, there,
there, there, there.

00:40:18.506 --> 00:40:21.890 align:middle line:90%


00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And science began to realize,
hey, this is really true.

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:33.880 align:middle line:84%
It had been happening all
along in that science had

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:36.690 align:middle line:84%
many, many, many times
this has been recorded,

00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:40.460 align:middle line:84%
where one scientific person
on one side of the world

00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:43.587 align:middle line:84%
would invent something,
and someone else

00:40:43.587 --> 00:40:45.920 align:middle line:84%
on the other side, the same
day, the same time, or very,

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.770 align:middle line:84%
very close to it, would invent
the exact same complicated

00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:49.570 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:51.653 align:middle line:84%
And then they would bicker
back and forth and say,

00:40:51.653 --> 00:40:53.770 align:middle line:84%
you stole it from me,
no you stole it from me.

00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:56.450 align:middle line:84%
But they never
could figure out--

00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:58.740 align:middle line:84%
and this happened so many
times that nobody could ever

00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:00.210 align:middle line:90%
figure it out.

00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:04.020 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think anybody really
thought about what we were just

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:05.940 align:middle line:90%
talking about now.

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:11.350 align:middle line:84%
But there are these grids up
there that we're connected to.

00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And anything that anybody
feels or thinks is in it.

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And once you know how to connect
to it, there's no more secrets.

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:25.940 align:middle line:84%
You can get anything that
anybody's ever felt or thought

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:27.280 align:middle line:90%
or anything else up there.

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.910 align:middle line:84%
The Aboriginals know exactly
how to get into their grid.

00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:32.150 align:middle line:84%
We just don't know how
to get into our grid,

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:34.100 align:middle line:84%
because we have
lost that ability.

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:36.170 align:middle line:90%
We are separate.

00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:39.470 align:middle line:84%
But the potential
is still there.

00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And we do it unconsciously
on a certain level, which

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:47.390 align:middle line:84%
the photograph
demonstrated very clearly.

00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:54.324 align:middle line:84%
And this is the main thing about
this workshop, the main reason

00:41:54.324 --> 00:41:55.740 align:middle line:84%
what I'm trying
to do, is to reach

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:58.800 align:middle line:84%
a certain number of people so
that a certain number of people

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:02.430 align:middle line:84%
can live it and thereby
get it into the grids.

00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And when enough people get to
a level of making this real--

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:09.450 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't have to just
be what we're doing here,

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:14.260 align:middle line:84%
but there's lots of other
people teaching similar things,

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:16.100 align:middle line:84%
all these similar
kinds of things,

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:17.915 align:middle line:84%
everything from
levitation to you

00:42:17.915 --> 00:42:20.290 align:middle line:84%
name what, it all
goes up in there.

00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And eventually the limits
of what we think is possible

00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:26.170 align:middle line:90%
could change.

00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And when it changes, it
could change like that.

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:34.030 align:middle line:84%
It can change
overnight in one day.

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:36.450 align:middle line:84%
I foresee the time when
suddenly-- and it's already

00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:40.110 align:middle line:84%
beginning to happen-- where
suddenly people just start

00:42:40.110 --> 00:42:43.472 align:middle line:84%
doing things, and they
don't even know why.

00:42:43.472 --> 00:42:46.750 align:middle line:84%
They'll just start breathing
this way and think, gee,

00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:47.676 align:middle line:90%
this feels better.

00:42:47.676 --> 00:42:53.322 align:middle line:90%


00:42:53.322 --> 00:42:55.780 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever breathed through
the top of your head before?

00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:58.780 align:middle line:90%


00:42:58.780 --> 00:42:59.580 align:middle line:90%
They just will.

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:00.380 align:middle line:90%
They'll just do it.

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:06.635 align:middle line:90%


00:43:06.635 --> 00:43:09.070 align:middle line:84%
So that's what
we're trying to do.

00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:14.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm not really interested
per se in trying to teach

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:15.800 align:middle line:90%
an individual how to do this.

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:19.651 align:middle line:84%
I'm more interested in the
whole globe, the whole Earth,

00:43:19.651 --> 00:43:24.740 align:middle line:84%
and how we can get that,
everybody understanding.

00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't have to just
be this form of meditation

00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:27.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm teaching.

00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:30.710 align:middle line:84%
It's just the understanding
that we're all one,

00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:33.450 align:middle line:84%
on a real level, so
we can really get it,

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:36.390 align:middle line:84%
and that we can all open
up in whatever way it is,

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:39.653 align:middle line:84%
that we can have
this understanding

00:43:39.653 --> 00:43:45.812 align:middle line:84%
and overcome all this darkness
that's on this planet.

00:43:45.812 --> 00:43:49.280 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of darkness here.

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:55.670 align:middle line:84%
Do you know, it's not as dark
as it used to be, I'll tell you.

00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:59.930 align:middle line:90%


00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:01.619 align:middle line:90%
There is a big change.

00:44:01.619 --> 00:44:03.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get into some
things here in a little bit.

00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:08.490 align:middle line:84%
But the light is a
lot stronger now.

00:44:08.490 --> 00:44:12.450 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's stronger than the
dark side for the first time

00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:14.426 align:middle line:90%
in a very, very long time.

00:44:14.426 --> 00:44:17.450 align:middle line:90%
At least 16,000 years.

00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:21.610 align:middle line:90%
And things will not be the same.

00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:23.080 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it is inevitable.

00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:25.830 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
that can stop it.

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:27.380 align:middle line:90%
