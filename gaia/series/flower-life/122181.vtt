00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:17.350 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.930 align:middle line:84%
>>The next subject
is kind of important.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.840 align:middle line:84%
There's some important
issues in all of this.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And that is the signs
and experiences,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.290 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, of what happens in
the very last, in the end time.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Let's say we're actually
approaching the time when

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.628 align:middle line:84%
the poles are going to shift
and the real thing's going

00:00:40.628 --> 00:00:41.974 align:middle line:90%
to happen.

00:00:41.974 --> 00:00:43.390 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
have to implement--

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.350 align:middle line:84%
whatever we're
going to implement

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.544 align:middle line:90%
is going to have to happen.

00:00:45.544 --> 00:00:48.717 align:middle line:90%


00:00:48.717 --> 00:00:50.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all,
all I can tell you

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.460 align:middle line:90%
is what normally happens.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And since we're not
a normal situation,

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what's
going to happen.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.200 align:middle line:84%
That's the truth, I
really don't know.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.240 align:middle line:84%
But there are certain
things that I'm

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.400 align:middle line:84%
pretty sure will occur, because
of the nature of the reality.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.900 align:middle line:84%
The ones that I don't know
about is-- what usually happens

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.660 align:middle line:84%
is the magnetic
field of the Earth

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.350 align:middle line:84%
begins to decrease in value
for hundreds of years prior

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.610 align:middle line:90%
to the event taking place.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.990 align:middle line:90%
And you can actually map it.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.490 align:middle line:84%
If you want to look
at it over time,

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.030 align:middle line:84%
it'll just keep going down and
down and down and down and down

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.300 align:middle line:84%
and it will get weaker and
weaker and weaker and weaker

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.630 align:middle line:90%
and weaker and weaker.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.560 align:middle line:84%
In this case, the magnetic field
of the Earth-- in our Earth,

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.530 align:middle line:84%
today, 1993, has been
dropping for over 500 years.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.760 align:middle line:90%
And they know that for sure.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's been getting weaker
and weaker and weaker.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.153 align:middle line:84%
However, it will eventually
get to the place where

00:01:39.153 --> 00:01:41.700 align:middle line:84%
it will get so unstable,
and then at the end,

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.400 align:middle line:84%
it begins to go
all over the place.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.320 align:middle line:84%
It begins to wander,
which is what's

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.017 align:middle line:84%
now occurring and has been
occurring for a few years now.

00:01:48.017 --> 00:01:49.975 align:middle line:84%
This is why the whales
are beaching themselves,

00:01:49.975 --> 00:01:52.642 align:middle line:84%
because the whales follow
these ancient magnetic lines.

00:01:52.642 --> 00:01:55.350 align:middle line:90%


00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And these magnetic lines have
now turned into land masses,

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.700 align:middle line:84%
and they just follow them
right into land masses.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.000 align:middle line:84%
There's not supposed
to be any land there.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's the problem
that's been going on.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.410 align:middle line:84%
Magnetic field is the
key to a lot of this.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.550 align:middle line:90%


00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.980 align:middle line:84%
So this field gets
weaker and weaker,

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.530 align:middle line:84%
and then usually about
three months to six months

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.350 align:middle line:84%
before, the field
begins to truly distort.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.100 align:middle line:90%


00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.920 align:middle line:84%
A real distortion that you could
actually measure carefully,

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.500 align:middle line:84%
easily, with any kind of
instruments that we have now,

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.450 align:middle line:90%
will begin to take place.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.520 align:middle line:84%
When this happens, the
world will totally lose it.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.030 align:middle line:90%
We will be in a big banana zoo.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.630 align:middle line:84%
All the social systems
would break down.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.630 align:middle line:84%
Usually what happens
towards the end of a system

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.230 align:middle line:84%
like this, the very, very end
days, is it goes into chaos.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.510 align:middle line:90%


00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.820 align:middle line:84%
What I mean by that specifically
is that the emotional body is

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.560 align:middle line:84%
tied to not your mental
patterns that we talked about,

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.190 align:middle line:84%
how your mind can
be erased, not only

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.740 align:middle line:84%
is your mental patterns tied
to the magnetic field-- which

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.910 align:middle line:84%
we're not real clear
about in this thing.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.040 align:middle line:84%
But so are the
emotional patterns.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And those we are
more clear about.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:34.660 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the moon
affects the magnetic field.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.090 align:middle line:84%
When it's full and it
comes in close like that,

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.610 align:middle line:84%
the magnetic field of the
Earth takes a slight bubble

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:49.160 align:middle line:84%
in the area it moves across
as the full moon comes in.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And you can just go to any
police blotter in United

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.810 align:middle line:84%
States-- or in the world,
really-- to any major city,

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.310 align:middle line:84%
and look what happens the day
before, the day of, and the day

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.240 align:middle line:90%
after the full moon.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.240 align:middle line:84%
There's more murders,
and rapes, and killings,

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.440 align:middle line:84%
and weird stuff going on at that
time than at any other time.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is because
if you are emotionally

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.570 align:middle line:84%
imbalanced-- if you're on the
edge-- and the full moon comes,

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:15.535 align:middle line:90%
that's all it takes.

00:04:15.535 --> 00:04:17.490 align:middle line:84%
It's just enough to
throw you over the edge.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.320 align:middle line:84%
So you get more
people then than ever.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.860 align:middle line:84%
Imagine what would happen when
the magnetic field of a planet

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:31.300 align:middle line:84%
just starts going
all over the place.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.360 align:middle line:90%
It just starts going crazy.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.320 align:middle line:90%
So does the people.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.720 align:middle line:90%
They just go crazy.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.690 align:middle line:90%
They emotionally go crazy.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as that happens, all
your social systems break down.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.004 align:middle line:84%
Your financial systems,
your everything.

00:04:45.004 --> 00:04:46.960 align:middle line:84%
Da da da, all the
way down there.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:53.570 align:middle line:84%
They all are on the emotional
system, first, of the humans.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And if that breaks down,
everything else breaks down.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.610 align:middle line:84%
All your food chains
are going to break down.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:58.410 align:middle line:90%
Everything else.

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.483 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's going to work and
everything falls apart.

00:05:01.483 --> 00:05:03.152 align:middle line:90%
Now, that may not happen.

00:05:03.152 --> 00:05:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And There's a good chance
that it won't happen.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm only saying that's
what usually takes place.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.471 align:middle line:90%


00:05:11.471 --> 00:05:13.220 align:middle line:84%
That's usually three
to six months before.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.260 align:middle line:90%


00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And then the thing that
probably will happen,

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.280 align:middle line:84%
and you'll probably
understand in a minute

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.270 align:middle line:84%
why this will almost
sure for sure take place,

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.510 align:middle line:84%
is about five to
six hours before

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.360 align:middle line:84%
the actual dimensional
shift begins to occur

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.210 align:middle line:84%
and the poles begin to
shift-- and usually,

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.960 align:middle line:84%
by the way, the
shifting of the poles

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.350 align:middle line:84%
and the consciousness change are
simultaneous and interconnected

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.520 align:middle line:84%
on magnetic and
electromagnetic levels.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.374 align:middle line:90%


00:05:48.374 --> 00:05:49.790 align:middle line:84%
The third and the
fourth dimension

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:54.030 align:middle line:84%
begin to-- if you want to
look at it as a membrane,

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.840 align:middle line:84%
though they're not
really that way.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.040 align:middle line:84%
Each one passes through
each one already.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.190 align:middle line:84%
But the third and fourth
dimension begin to interface.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And when they do, two things
happen almost every time.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:08.720 align:middle line:90%
It's almost unavoidable.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.020 align:middle line:84%
I can't see how this
one would not happen.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.390 align:middle line:84%
That is that something
that I talked about before,

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:22.590 align:middle line:84%
where I said that these
synthetic objects, things--

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.435 align:middle line:84%
I don't have too many synthetic
objects-- but like this bar

00:06:25.435 --> 00:06:27.810 align:middle line:84%
of metal and stuff like this,
all these synthetic things,

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.000 align:middle line:90%
remember we talked about them?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.700 align:middle line:90%
Did I say that?

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>>The last class.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.580 align:middle line:84%
>>Coming in, all that stuff
came out of the causal plane.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:39.224 align:middle line:84%
Well, all those things, the
grid starts breaking down.

00:06:39.224 --> 00:06:41.140 align:middle line:84%
When the conscious level
starts breaking down,

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.980 align:middle line:84%
the whole grid
that people are on

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.170 align:middle line:84%
begins to degenerate
and break down.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And when it does, all this
stuff, and those things,

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:55.310 align:middle line:84%
and all those things, start
going unstable and start

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.500 align:middle line:84%
disappearing right
before your eyes.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.930 align:middle line:90%
Turning into their elements.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.700 align:middle line:84%
Exactly what that looks
like, I don't know.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.590 align:middle line:84%
The atoms aren't
going to go away,

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.140 align:middle line:84%
they're just going to return
to their natural state.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't exactly know what
that means, precisely.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.850 align:middle line:90%
I don't have that in my memory.

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:13.810 align:middle line:90%
>>Excuse me?

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:15.540 align:middle line:84%
What's the five
or six hours mean?

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.960 align:middle line:90%
>>That's when it will begin.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Five or six hours before the
actual shifting of the axis.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:26.170 align:middle line:84%
Before the actual going from
third to fourth dimension.

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:30.770 align:middle line:84%
Before the actual thing happens,
which [INAUDIBLE] talked about,

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:34.550 align:middle line:84%
that's when you'll begin to
see synthetic objects begin

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.880 align:middle line:90%
to disappear.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And there's an entire
spectrum of stability.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.540 align:middle line:84%
Like I said before, some
things are very unstable,

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.100 align:middle line:84%
and some things are
not as unstable.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.130 align:middle line:84%
So you're not going to
have everything go proof

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.230 align:middle line:90%
like that at once.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.420 align:middle line:84%
It's just going to
start happening.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.571 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be
a very obvious event.

00:07:51.571 --> 00:07:52.404 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Plus, if you're
already unstable.

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:08.222 align:middle line:84%
Then that'll tend to slingshot
you into goo-goo-ville.

00:08:08.222 --> 00:08:09.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

me of like [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:14.742 --> 00:08:16.718 align:middle line:84%
It's like the Earth
is healing itself,

00:08:16.718 --> 00:08:17.718 align:middle line:90%
I imagine at that point.

00:08:17.718 --> 00:08:19.950 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's what
it means, it goes

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:21.700 align:middle line:90%
back to where it was before.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:22.830 align:middle line:90%
>>In a way, that's true.

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:25.259 align:middle line:84%
That's what it's doing,
it's returning the dream.

00:08:25.259 --> 00:08:27.050 align:middle line:84%
Because it's just light,
it's just a dream,

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:30.325 align:middle line:84%
returning it back to
its initial state.

00:08:30.325 --> 00:08:32.200 align:middle line:84%
These are the same old
atoms we've been using

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.595 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:08:33.595 --> 00:08:37.609 align:middle line:84%
They've been here for
from the beginning.

00:08:37.609 --> 00:08:38.409 align:middle line:90%
Recycle them.

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:42.580 align:middle line:90%


00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:46.670 align:middle line:84%
It's for this reason that the
native peoples of the world--

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:47.630 align:middle line:90%
at least most of them.

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:49.070 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if this is true.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Is this true, in Hawaii,
do you know this?

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.890 align:middle line:84%
What I'm about to
say, answer this.

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:57.520 align:middle line:84%
My connection is
with the Taos Pueblo,

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.960 align:middle line:84%
I have a strong
connection with them.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And they've been
there for 1,400 years.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.190 align:middle line:84%
They knew this was
coming a long time.

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:09.210 align:middle line:84%
They were told, even
up until right today,

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:13.230 align:middle line:84%
that this day, the day of
purification would occur.

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And that in their
buildings and everything,

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.839 align:middle line:84%
they're not allowed to use
any synthetic things at all.

00:09:17.839 --> 00:09:19.336 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:09:19.336 --> 00:09:22.080 align:middle line:84%
People thought that
that was because they

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.380 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to be connected
with white man kind of stuff.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.000 align:middle line:90%
It had nothing to do with that.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.560 align:middle line:84%
They only have mud and sticks,
mud floors, wood doors,

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.970 align:middle line:90%
and things like this.

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:36.760 align:middle line:84%
They're not even
allowed, by law,

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.320 align:middle line:84%
to have anything
synthetic in them.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.810 align:middle line:84%
Because they know it won't
be there in the end times.

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And in the end
times, they're told--

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.920 align:middle line:90%
they know what the signs are.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:47.910 align:middle line:84%
These signs that
I'm talking about,

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.576 align:middle line:84%
they already know
what these things are.

00:09:49.576 --> 00:09:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And when they see
these things happen,

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.605 align:middle line:84%
when they see that society's
starting to go totally crazy

00:09:53.605 --> 00:09:55.180 align:middle line:84%
and all these
things happen, they

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:58.960 align:middle line:84%
are told to go into their-- even
though they have modern homes

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.000 align:middle line:84%
out around places, called
their summer homes,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.314 align:middle line:90%
they have out there.

00:10:03.314 --> 00:10:04.630 align:middle line:90%
They live in them a lot.

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:07.940 align:middle line:84%
They all have their own room in
place to go when the time has.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.770 align:middle line:84%
Each family has
their place to go.

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:12.690 align:middle line:84%
When the time is, they're all
to go back to the old pueblo,

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:17.100 align:middle line:84%
go into the rooms, cover up the
windows so you don't look out.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.534 align:middle line:84%
Not to look out,
because there would

00:10:20.534 --> 00:10:22.730 align:middle line:84%
be so many unusual
things going out there

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:25.095 align:middle line:90%
that it would just cause fear.

00:10:25.095 --> 00:10:27.940 align:middle line:84%
So they're told not to
look outside, to sit down,

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:31.139 align:middle line:90%
and to pray.

00:10:31.139 --> 00:10:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And to remain inside
their buildings.

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:38.150 align:middle line:90%


00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:41.270 align:middle line:84%
So there's another thing that
will occur, or could occur

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:44.640 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously, depending on
where you are geographically

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.620 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:47.910 align:middle line:84%
This may happen,
it may not happen.

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:52.120 align:middle line:84%
The other one will
happen for sure, I think.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:57.170 align:middle line:84%
This one, you've got about--
I would say a 20%, 80% chance.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:01.700 align:middle line:84%
There's about an 80% chance it
will happen, 20% it may not.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.490 align:middle line:84%
And that is that a
fourth dimensional object

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:08.520 align:middle line:84%
may appear into your
space before you actually

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.672 align:middle line:90%
go into the fourth dimension.

00:11:10.672 --> 00:11:15.960 align:middle line:84%
If that happens, there won't
be any doubt whatsoever

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.940 align:middle line:90%
that that's taken place.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Because it will be
the weirdest thing

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.470 align:middle line:84%
you've ever experienced
ever in your entire life,

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:25.720 align:middle line:90%
since you were a baby.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.170 align:middle line:84%
It will be colors that
are coming to you that you

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:33.730 align:middle line:84%
didn't-- that register in your
mind in ways you've never seen.

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:37.420 align:middle line:84%
Just the phenomena of seeing
colors you didn't know existed

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:41.330 align:middle line:84%
will definitely alert
you to, this is it.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.490 align:middle line:84%
But it'll also be
colors that-- you

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:46.010 align:middle line:84%
remember when you all
looked at the-- you

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:49.216 align:middle line:90%
took the piece of paper away?

00:11:49.216 --> 00:11:52.960 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:57.269 align:middle line:84%
You took the piece
of paper away, and--

00:11:57.269 --> 00:12:01.910 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:06.144 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's my belt or something.

00:12:06.144 --> 00:12:07.780 align:middle line:84%
You took the--
remember when we had

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:09.196 align:middle line:84%
those things--
took the paper away

00:12:09.196 --> 00:12:12.420 align:middle line:84%
and you saw how that light was
kind of glowing off of stuff.

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.680 align:middle line:84%
They have kind of
that-- they have

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.440 align:middle line:84%
colors that glow on their
own, only a lot brighter.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And they're just
new and different.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And objects don't have
these flat kind of things.

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Everything glows
on its own kind,

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:30.500 align:middle line:90%
I can't explain it to you.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.790 align:middle line:90%
It's very beautiful.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:33.340 align:middle line:90%
But shape is another thing.

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:35.440 align:middle line:84%
The shape is such that
you can't possibly imagine

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.370 align:middle line:90%
what the heck the shape is.

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:39.410 align:middle line:90%
So when you see it, you'll know.

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:42.014 align:middle line:84%
There won't be any
doubt, you'll go, a-ha.

00:12:42.014 --> 00:12:43.280 align:middle line:90%
There won't be a doubt.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:48.812 align:middle line:84%
But my advice to you on this
is if you can at all help it--

00:12:48.812 --> 00:12:50.270 align:middle line:84%
and you may not be
able to help it.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:54.660 align:middle line:84%
But if you can at all
help it, don't touch it.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.140 align:middle line:84%
Because if you do,
it will throw you,

00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:00.066 align:middle line:84%
it will slam you, into
the fourth dimension.

00:13:00.066 --> 00:13:03.760 align:middle line:84%
It will suck you out of
here and throw you in there

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.070 align:middle line:90%
very quickly.

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And if you like to go
fast, that's a way.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:12.380 align:middle line:84%
But it's better if you go
a little slower right now.

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:13.970 align:middle line:90%
And just--

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:15.770 align:middle line:90%
>>What would the danger be?

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:17.580 align:middle line:84%
>>I don't know if
it's a danger or not,

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:20.560 align:middle line:84%
but probably the main danger
would be going so fast is fear.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.950 align:middle line:90%


00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.418 align:middle line:90%
Fear's a real big danger.

00:13:26.418 --> 00:13:28.763 align:middle line:84%
>>Drunvalo, will everybody
[? pull? ?] Everyone

00:13:28.763 --> 00:13:30.640 align:middle line:90%
on the planet?

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, normally.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:33.484 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk about
that in just a second.

00:13:33.484 --> 00:13:37.200 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can hold that
off just for a moment.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:41.140 align:middle line:84%
The next thing that
happens after that is very,

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.720 align:middle line:84%
very quickly, five to
six hours after that,

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:47.460 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
see this shifting

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.560 align:middle line:84%
in colors I talked about from
red, orange, yellow, green,

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.190 align:middle line:90%
blue, purple, flash of white.

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Everything turning
gold, going to black.

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to find
yourself in a great void.

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be in the great
void for about three days.

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, in an instant,

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:08.650 align:middle line:84%
you will find yourself in this
beautiful, highly unusual,

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:10.910 align:middle line:90%
new world.

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Not having the slightest
idea what's going on.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:17.030 align:middle line:84%
But just have a good time,
and don't worry about a thing.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:19.100 align:middle line:84%
Really, there's
nothing to worry about.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.590 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely nothing.

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:22.396 align:middle line:90%
It's just fine.

00:14:22.396 --> 00:14:24.560 align:middle line:90%
You're just a baby, that's all.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:25.360 align:middle line:90%
There's no problem.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.060 align:middle line:90%
Not any problem at all.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:28.260 align:middle line:90%
It's totally covered.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.350 align:middle line:90%
You'll understand as it goes on.

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:33.826 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the more fun you
have, the better it will be.

00:14:33.826 --> 00:14:39.540 align:middle line:90%


00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:43.660 align:middle line:84%
There is a problem
with some people,

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:47.840 align:middle line:84%
and this has in to what she
just said, will everybody go?

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.940 align:middle line:84%
In the normal scenario,
what usually happens

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:54.110 align:middle line:84%
in a normal situation
like this is only a few

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.800 align:middle line:90%
people make it through.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.520 align:middle line:84%
This is what Jesus was
referring to, many are called,

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.720 align:middle line:90%
few are chosen.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.300 align:middle line:90%
This is what usually happens.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:04.940 align:middle line:84%
Not very many people
of a planet can

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:08.710 align:middle line:84%
get through to the higher
levels on the first time around.

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:11.070 align:middle line:84%
But once those few
people get through, then

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:13.140 align:middle line:84%
over a long period of
time, those few people

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:16.130 align:middle line:84%
slowly bring through
the rest of the plant.

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:19.880 align:middle line:84%
But it takes a long time,
that's what normally happens.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.030 align:middle line:84%
In this case, I don't think
that's what's going to happen.

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:25.700 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going to see
every single last person

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.840 align:middle line:84%
on the planet go through,
without exception.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.300 align:middle line:84%
That's what we think
is going to happen.

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.545 align:middle line:84%
And very quickly, and
very sophisticatedly.

00:15:32.545 --> 00:15:35.800 align:middle line:90%


00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.773 align:middle line:84%
In some kind of really
extraordinary way.

00:15:38.773 --> 00:15:41.147 align:middle line:90%


00:15:41.147 --> 00:15:42.980 align:middle line:84%
But I can't talk about
that, because I don't

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:43.900 align:middle line:90%
know if that's going to happen.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:46.400 align:middle line:84%
So all I can talk about is
what will probably happen.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.540 align:middle line:90%
What usually happens.

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And so-- this many are
called and finny-- finny.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:56.930 align:middle line:90%
Finny are called--

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.990 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:02.600 align:middle line:84%
Good thing we're
near the end here.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Many are called
and few are chosen

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:13.826 align:middle line:84%
because what usually happens
is if you go through,

00:16:13.826 --> 00:16:15.700 align:middle line:84%
and then a few more go
through that shouldn't

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:20.660 align:middle line:84%
have gone through, and then
most of them don't go through.

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And so part of them end up
on one dimensional level

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:25.810 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth or the planet.

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:28.260 align:middle line:84%
A few of them end up on
the other dimensional end

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:29.310 align:middle line:90%
in a planet.

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that weren't
supposed to go through

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.150 align:middle line:90%
have an interesting experience.

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And this relates to-- this is
a real important point, what

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:41.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm about to say.

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:44.286 align:middle line:84%
You might underline this on
your pages, if you're writing.

00:16:44.286 --> 00:16:49.470 align:middle line:90%


00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:59.300 align:middle line:84%
You see, Jesus gave a
parable about this time.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:03.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't think most people really
knew what he was talking about.

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:09.020 align:middle line:84%
He talked about this farmer
who was growing wheat.

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:14.369 align:middle line:84%
And his helpers came
in and said that there

00:17:14.369 --> 00:17:18.890 align:middle line:84%
was weeds growing in the
wheat, and asked what to do.

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And the farmer said to let
them grow with the wheat,

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.140 align:middle line:84%
and that they would
separate the shaft?

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:26.205 align:middle line:90%
>>Wheat from the chaff.

00:17:26.205 --> 00:17:27.280 align:middle line:90%
>>From the shaft.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.300 align:middle line:90%
Afterwards.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, as I understand it, that
is not what most farmers do.

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:33.850 align:middle line:84%
They usually try to
get rid of those weeds

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:36.460 align:middle line:84%
before they turn into
these giant weeds,

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:39.160 align:middle line:84%
and then the whole
thing is mixed up.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.390 align:middle line:84%
So what he was
really talking about

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:50.000 align:middle line:84%
was an unusual
situation, which is

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.010 align:middle line:84%
the wheat are the people
that are prepared.

00:17:54.010 --> 00:18:01.332 align:middle line:84%
And being prepared, I mean
their emotional bodies

00:18:01.332 --> 00:18:03.290 align:middle line:84%
and their minds and their
hearts and everything

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:05.490 align:middle line:84%
are clean, and
have done the work,

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:08.560 align:middle line:84%
and are ready to
make that transition.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:12.160 align:middle line:84%
But there may be somebody who
is almost ready, but not quite

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:12.960 align:middle line:90%
ready.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.075 align:middle line:84%
Because hadn't had certain--
wasn't quite finished

00:18:16.075 --> 00:18:17.790 align:middle line:90%
in the whole thing.

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:20.952 align:middle line:84%
And so that person
might have learned

00:18:20.952 --> 00:18:22.910 align:middle line:84%
enough to be able to get
over to the other side

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:24.840 align:middle line:90%
when it all happens.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.000 align:middle line:84%
But what happens to
that person is, is they

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.260 align:middle line:84%
get on the other side, and
here they're now in a world

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.280 align:middle line:84%
that they're not
quite ready for.

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:39.060 align:middle line:84%
And everything is totally
unusual and a little scary.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:42.320 align:middle line:90%
And their fears come up.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:46.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, you see, the nature the
fourth dimension is-- it's

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:49.020 align:middle line:84%
similar to what it
is here, actually.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:50.395 align:middle line:90%
It's true everywhere.

00:18:50.395 --> 00:18:53.646 align:middle line:90%
Only a difference in timing.

00:18:53.646 --> 00:18:55.461 align:middle line:84%
On the third dimension,
whatever you think

00:18:55.461 --> 00:18:57.335 align:middle line:84%
and whatever you feel
is creating the reality

00:18:57.335 --> 00:18:58.610 align:middle line:90%
you're around.

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:01.360 align:middle line:84%
It just usually
isn't instantaneous.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:04.130 align:middle line:84%
It's usually-- there's
a little time lag.

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes so
much of a time lag,

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:09.116 align:middle line:84%
you don't even know that it's
really you that's doing it.

00:19:09.116 --> 00:19:10.490 align:middle line:84%
But in the fourth
dimension, it's

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:13.520 align:middle line:84%
absolutely instantaneous
with each breath.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:17.840 align:middle line:84%
So whatever you're thinking
and feeling happens now.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:18.640 align:middle line:90%
Right now.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.330 align:middle line:90%


00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And so if you come over
there and suddenly you're

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.260 align:middle line:84%
in a strange world,
then what people

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:32.120 align:middle line:84%
tend to do in the
beginning, since it's

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:38.150 align:middle line:84%
kind of like a mental
and emotional mirror,

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:42.037 align:middle line:84%
they begin to try to create the
third dimensional world back

00:19:42.037 --> 00:19:44.260 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:46.520 align:middle line:84%
But in the process
of doing that,

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:50.030 align:middle line:90%
they usually become fearful.

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:51.420 align:middle line:90%
The fears come up.

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And whatever the fears are,
the fears begin to manifest 3D

00:19:57.910 --> 00:19:59.640 align:middle line:90%
in their life.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And so if they are
afraid of whatever it

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:06.000 align:middle line:84%
is-- if they feel like they
need to protect themselves--

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.607 align:middle line:90%
I always use this one.

00:20:07.607 --> 00:20:09.940 align:middle line:84%
Trying to protect themselves,
they start getting afraid,

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:13.720 align:middle line:84%
they start seeing people that
they're actually creating.

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And they see these things and
it all looks scary to them.

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:18.380 align:middle line:84%
They think they need
to protect themselves.

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:21.640 align:middle line:84%
They say, I need a sword, I
need a knife, I need a gun.

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.500 align:middle line:90%
I've got to protect myself.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:24.850 align:middle line:90%
They look down, here's this gun.

00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:26.070 align:middle line:90%
They grab this, oh, there's one.

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:28.528 align:middle line:84%
They grab a gun and they shoot
at this person that's coming

00:20:28.528 --> 00:20:30.090 align:middle line:90%
at them, so they shoot back.

00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:31.940 align:middle line:84%
They find themselves
in a battle,

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:35.370 align:middle line:84%
and the battle devours them and
kills them and throws them back

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:37.180 align:middle line:90%
into the third dimension.

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:40.025 align:middle line:90%
Spits them out.

00:20:40.025 --> 00:20:41.720 align:middle line:90%
Because they had a fear.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:51.440 align:middle line:90%


00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Jesus had talked
about this, also.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And he said, if you
live by the sword,

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:00.482 align:middle line:90%
you will die by the sword.

00:21:00.482 --> 00:21:02.285 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly what
he was referring to.

00:21:02.285 --> 00:21:03.625 align:middle line:90%
This time that was coming.

00:21:03.625 --> 00:21:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Much of what he
was talking about

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.982 align:middle line:84%
was preparing for after the
resurrection, not before.

00:21:08.982 --> 00:21:11.440 align:middle line:84%
He says, if you live by the
sword, you'll die by the sword.

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.440 align:middle line:90%
He also said something else.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.490 align:middle line:84%
The meek would
inherit the Earth.

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:19.334 align:middle line:84%
So if you're sitting there
having a good old time

00:21:19.334 --> 00:21:20.750 align:middle line:84%
and you're just
saying to yourself

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:25.710 align:middle line:84%
love and truth and beauty and
trust and harmony and peace,

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:28.840 align:middle line:84%
then that is exactly what
manifests in your reality.

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.740 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what's
coming out of your thoughts.

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And you manifest
a stable reality.

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And the reality embraces
you and keeps you.

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Or, in other words,
you keep yourself.

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:43.570 align:middle line:90%
You create it yourself.

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:50.675 align:middle line:84%
And so you end up being the
inheritors of the Earth, only

00:21:50.675 --> 00:21:53.510 align:middle line:90%
on another dimensional level.

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And so the greatest
thing that I can

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:03.920 align:middle line:84%
see to do at this time,
other than the schooling,

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:07.110 align:middle line:84%
the learning, and
opening the heart,

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:14.440 align:middle line:84%
is try to improve upon all those
things of spirit and character

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:22.580 align:middle line:84%
so that you don't
do all those things,

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:25.765 align:middle line:84%
like killing and stealing
and beating and hurting.

00:22:25.765 --> 00:22:28.140 align:middle line:84%
All those other things, because
they will wrap right back

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.595 align:middle line:90%
at you on the other plane.

00:22:30.595 --> 00:22:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And it will be instantly,
absolutely instant.

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:38.130 align:middle line:84%
We have all this time
now, a little bit.

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:41.090 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:45.590 align:middle line:84%
So we could-- and each
moment is an opportunity

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:51.670 align:middle line:84%
to try to improve upon
that aspect of ourselves.

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Become less afraid, become more
loving, become more trusting,

00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:00.250 align:middle line:90%
and to start living.

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:01.840 align:middle line:84%
We've got a perfect
example here.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.260 align:middle line:90%
We've got other ones, too.

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:04.940 align:middle line:90%
But a real good one is Jesus.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:09.234 align:middle line:84%
He led a life that if you
can even live close to that,

00:23:09.234 --> 00:23:10.150 align:middle line:90%
will probably be fine.

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:12.742 align:middle line:90%


00:23:12.742 --> 00:23:13.950 align:middle line:90%
>>I thought 3D would be over?

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:15.190 align:middle line:90%
>>Huh?

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>>I thought 3D would
be over for everyone?

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>>What I'm talking about now
is what normally happens,

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.660 align:middle line:90%
not what will happen.

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:29.910 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you what will
happen, because I don't know.

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:34.508 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about what is the
standard, normal thing that

00:23:34.508 --> 00:23:37.190 align:middle line:90%
normally occurs.

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:39.620 align:middle line:84%
But in the understanding
of what normally happens,

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:42.090 align:middle line:84%
you can see the
importance of how

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:45.320 align:middle line:84%
the purification of our
thoughts and feelings--

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.309 align:middle line:84%
you can see why the
American Indians call

00:23:47.309 --> 00:23:50.150 align:middle line:90%
it the day of purification.

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:53.385 align:middle line:84%
So it's making a
whole lot more sense.

00:23:53.385 --> 00:23:54.870 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:57.840 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, it sure is.

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:05.070 align:middle line:84%
>>Sometimes you speak in
terms of the dimensional shift

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:08.402 align:middle line:84%
possibly happening any moment
from this point forward,

00:24:08.402 --> 00:24:11.110 align:middle line:84%
and at other times
you speak in terms

00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:13.602 align:middle line:84%
of things like
developing silicon carbon

00:24:13.602 --> 00:24:17.046 align:middle line:84%
lifeforms and things that might
have this sort of technology

00:24:17.046 --> 00:24:18.030 align:middle line:90%
that continues.

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:21.711 align:middle line:90%
And so you can't [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:21.711 --> 00:24:22.510 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>>I have both sides
going at once.

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:27.610 align:middle line:90%
That's how I survive here.

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:30.205 align:middle line:84%
I have part of me going
on and doing a job

00:24:30.205 --> 00:24:32.190 align:middle line:84%
and working, and
doing everything

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:34.300 align:middle line:84%
I can to help the
world, do everything

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.580 align:middle line:84%
I can to heal the third
dimension in every way I can.

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:41.050 align:middle line:84%
To make it as healthy as it
can, last as long as it can,

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:44.090 align:middle line:84%
and to pay all my bills
and be responsible

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:46.550 align:middle line:90%
and all that kind of stuff.

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm willing to think along
the lines of technology that

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:52.475 align:middle line:84%
will help the planet, love
the planet, things like that.

00:24:52.475 --> 00:24:54.932 align:middle line:84%
But I got this other--
I'm real schizophrenic.

00:24:54.932 --> 00:24:56.390 align:middle line:84%
I've got this other
side of me that

00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:59.270 align:middle line:84%
is aware of the situation
on the other levels

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:03.490 align:middle line:84%
and is preparing for that
side at the same time.

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:06.945 align:middle line:84%
To me, there needs to be
this balance in the situation

00:25:06.945 --> 00:25:08.610 align:middle line:90%
that we're in right now.

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:16.000 align:middle line:84%
If you get too much into
not taking care of yourself

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:22.000 align:middle line:84%
as a body, then that's not going
to help the situation, either.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time, you get too

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:25.460 align:middle line:84%
much of taking care
of the body and not

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:31.732 align:middle line:84%
caring about the other thing,
that's going to also-- you're

00:25:31.732 --> 00:25:34.920 align:middle line:90%
not going to make it that way.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:37.660 align:middle line:90%
It's this type of balance.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And so depending on how the
question and what you're

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:43.450 align:middle line:84%
talking, where you're coming to
the from, how you talk to me,

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:46.300 align:middle line:84%
will depend on how I answer
that, what you're saying.

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And we come from all
different levels here.

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:53.140 align:middle line:84%
So I'm switching back and
forth, it's true, a lot.

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:55.669 align:middle line:90%
Does that help?

00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:56.469 align:middle line:90%
Kind of?

00:25:56.469 --> 00:26:00.450 align:middle line:90%


00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Do we have the-- we're
going to do this.

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:08.240 align:middle line:90%


00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:13.230 align:middle line:84%
Actually, let me get
the information out.

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:15.150 align:middle line:84%
Because we've only
got 15 more minutes.

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:19.480 align:middle line:84%
Let me get it out and then I'll
stay here as long as you want.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.380 align:middle line:90%
And then we can ask questions.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:30.614 align:middle line:90%


00:26:30.614 --> 00:26:33.760 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that you will
discover after you stay there

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:38.410 align:middle line:84%
for a while-- again, we're in
the usually happens mode, what

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:41.750 align:middle line:84%
normally occurs,
is that the person,

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:44.250 align:middle line:84%
when they get into the fourth
dimension for the first time--

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:47.210 align:middle line:84%
which is an exhilarating
experience because

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:51.430 align:middle line:84%
of being light and
realizing that it's light.

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:54.490 align:middle line:84%
It's like watching that computer
when it could think and see

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:55.490 align:middle line:90%
and it was happy.

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:58.540 align:middle line:84%
It's like watching reality
conform to what you're

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:02.730 align:middle line:84%
thinking and feeling, and the
freedom and the incredibleness

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:03.580 align:middle line:90%
of what it means.

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:07.045 align:middle line:84%
At first, you usually put a
lot of limitations on yourself

00:27:07.045 --> 00:27:07.920 align:middle line:90%
like you've got here.

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.710 align:middle line:84%
You assume the rules
are kind of the same.

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:15.920 align:middle line:84%
Slowly, you begin to realize
the rules are real different.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.620 align:middle line:84%
And that a lot of things do
not have to be the same way.

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And you realize you can start
shaping things with your mind

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:23.925 align:middle line:84%
and you can lift
things off the ground

00:27:23.925 --> 00:27:25.860 align:middle line:84%
and you can do all
kinds of things

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.500 align:middle line:90%
that would seem impossible.

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:31.709 align:middle line:84%
And then almost inevitably,
because you're a baby, still,

00:27:31.709 --> 00:27:33.000 align:middle line:90%
so you start playing with toys.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And one of the toys then is
that you look down at your body

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:39.330 align:middle line:90%
and you go, oh yeah.

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And you realize that you
can change your body.

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:46.250 align:middle line:84%
So you usually heal
everything real quick,

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:47.802 align:middle line:84%
and then that's
usually not enough.

00:27:47.802 --> 00:27:48.760 align:middle line:90%
That's the first thing.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:49.820 align:middle line:84%
You get rid of all
that stuff and make

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:51.130 align:middle line:90%
everything work real good.

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And then you usually change
yourself to the ideal

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.990 align:middle line:90%
that you've always wanted to be.

00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:00.448 align:middle line:84%
That's sort of a
kid thing to do.

00:28:00.448 --> 00:28:02.620 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And so you make yourself real
tall and handsome or real

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.985 align:middle line:84%
beautiful, and become what
you've always wanted to be.

00:28:07.985 --> 00:28:10.859 align:middle line:90%


00:28:10.859 --> 00:28:12.400 align:middle line:84%
But you can get
pretty tired of that.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.680 align:middle line:84%
But that's usually one
of the things you'll do.

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And then after a while, you'll
think, well, what's next.

00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:18.900 align:middle line:84%
If you go to the fourth
dimensional world,

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:22.070 align:middle line:84%
you will notice that they
are awfully beautiful.

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:24.270 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:25.329 align:middle line:90%
Almost all of them.

00:28:25.329 --> 00:28:27.120 align:middle line:84%
They're all young and
they're all beautiful

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:30.190 align:middle line:84%
and they're just incredibly--
and everything else like that.

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:31.565 align:middle line:84%
They have their
own personalities

00:28:31.565 --> 00:28:33.610 align:middle line:84%
on how they want to
look, but they're usually

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:34.650 align:middle line:90%
always real beautiful.

00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:44.600 align:middle line:90%


00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:48.140 align:middle line:84%
Then you begin to notice, you
begin to learn other things.

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:51.210 align:middle line:84%
At one point there, you're
going to become aware

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:55.120 align:middle line:84%
that something is moving
around in all of this light.

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And inevitably you
assume, become aware,

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:03.240 align:middle line:84%
that there's these
very big beings there.

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:06.810 align:middle line:84%
Relative to you, they'll
be 10 to 16 feet tall.

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:09.996 align:middle line:90%
They'll have these big heads.

00:29:09.996 --> 00:29:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
at them, you'll

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:14.070 align:middle line:84%
have this uncanny feeling
of love toward them.

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:18.240 align:middle line:90%


00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.030 align:middle line:90%
Because it's mommy and daddy.

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:23.360 align:middle line:84%
There is mommy and daddy
on the fourth dimension.

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.050 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the last kind
of mommy and daddy things,

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:27.300 align:middle line:90%
in a way.

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.660 align:middle line:84%
But there will be mommy and
daddy in this next world

00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:31.330 align:middle line:90%
where you're going to.

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:35.225 align:middle line:84%
You're going into a high
level fourth dimension,

00:29:35.225 --> 00:29:38.590 align:middle line:84%
but a low level of what's
possible in other levels.

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:40.010 align:middle line:90%
You're still in body form.

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:41.530 align:middle line:84%
Your body will
still look the same,

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:43.600 align:middle line:90%
it will still feel the same.

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:47.660 align:middle line:84%
Though it'll be-- basically,
it won't be nothing to you.

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:49.030 align:middle line:90%
It will almost be pure energy.

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:51.110 align:middle line:84%
There won't be hardly
any atoms at all.

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:52.816 align:middle line:90%
But there will be atoms.

00:29:52.816 --> 00:29:54.940 align:middle line:84%
A different kind of atoms,
but there will be atoms.

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:56.747 align:middle line:84%
The atoms will be
a different kind.

00:29:56.747 --> 00:30:09.010 align:middle line:90%


00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:11.200 align:middle line:90%
They're there to help you.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.747 align:middle line:90%
They'll take care of you.

00:30:12.747 --> 00:30:14.830 align:middle line:84%
They were there all along,
you just didn't notice.

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:16.038 align:middle line:90%
You won't notice it at first.

00:30:16.038 --> 00:30:18.660 align:middle line:84%
At one point, though, down
the line, you'll notice it.

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:21.755 align:middle line:84%
But what this is called on the
fourth dimension is a baby.

00:30:21.755 --> 00:30:24.860 align:middle line:90%


00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:30.520 align:middle line:84%
An adult human being
there is a baby.

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Whereas it takes about 21
years for a little baby

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:37.550 align:middle line:84%
here to grow up to
be an adult here,

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:41.060 align:middle line:84%
it takes about two years
there, experientially,

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:46.290 align:middle line:84%
for the baby to
metamorphosize and grow up.

00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:48.630 align:middle line:84%
You'll realize you'll begin
growing and getting taller

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:49.430 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:55.370 align:middle line:84%
And changing to grow up to
be an adult in that world.

00:30:55.370 --> 00:30:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And then slowly, everything
will start making sense.

00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.700 align:middle line:84%
The colors will make sense,
those forms will make sense.

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:05.940 align:middle line:84%
But your mind has to--
you have to re-orientate

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:09.310 align:middle line:90%
everything inside of you.

00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:12.447 align:middle line:84%
Once we normally-- originally,
we thought that that was it.

00:31:12.447 --> 00:31:14.780 align:middle line:84%
That was probably where we
were going to go for a while.

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And originally it was conceived
of that we would be there

00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:21.270 align:middle line:90%
for about 1,000 years.

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:23.860 align:middle line:90%
At this point, I don't think so.

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:25.740 align:middle line:84%
I think that we'll
be there, I think

00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:28.410 align:middle line:84%
that we will make adulthood
of about two years,

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:31.960 align:middle line:84%
because we do need to get
to that stage of development

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.050 align:middle line:90%
to make the next jump.

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:37.102 align:middle line:84%
But then we will immediately
go into the fifth dimension.

00:31:37.102 --> 00:31:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And from there on
in, I don't know.

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:42.740 align:middle line:84%
All I know is it should be or
probably will be very rapid.

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:43.992 align:middle line:90%
Extremely, extremely rapid.

00:31:43.992 --> 00:31:45.950 align:middle line:84%
All the way up into the
next dimensional level.

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:52.569 align:middle line:90%


00:31:52.569 --> 00:31:55.870 align:middle line:84%
OK, some of the questions
that are usually asked

00:31:55.870 --> 00:32:02.690 align:middle line:84%
are, what we do about
mates, children, dogs, pets,

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:04.120 align:middle line:90%
things of this nature here.

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:08.420 align:middle line:84%
Can you take them with you
and these kinds of things.

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:13.260 align:middle line:84%
There is a way that is
possible for two mates

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:17.870 align:middle line:84%
to bring-- for you to
help other life forms.

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:21.190 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know if that's
going to be your way or not.

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:23.540 align:middle line:84%
Though the information
is in the grids, and I

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:25.640 align:middle line:84%
can't give that
to you right now.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:27.360 align:middle line:84%
But what Jesus
said about this was

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:31.670 align:middle line:84%
that he said, if there would
be two of you in bed-- meaning

00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:34.900 align:middle line:84%
the married couple-- and one of
you I will take and one of you

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:36.220 align:middle line:90%
I will not.

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:38.290 align:middle line:84%
But he was referring
to the many are called,

00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:40.440 align:middle line:90%
few are chosen scenario.

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, I
think we're all going.

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:46.150 align:middle line:90%


00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And I really don't know-- you
can't take someone with you

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:55.190 align:middle line:84%
in this Merkaba that
you're learning here.

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:59.220 align:middle line:90%
It's only a one seater.

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:01.870 align:middle line:90%
It won't take anybody else.

00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:03.770 align:middle line:84%
There is a possibility,
though, of making

00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:08.270 align:middle line:90%
one that is 150,000 seater.

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:09.312 align:middle line:90%
Which is two people.

00:33:09.312 --> 00:33:10.112 align:middle line:90%
>>Wow.

00:33:10.112 --> 00:33:13.314 align:middle line:90%


00:33:13.314 --> 00:33:14.230 align:middle line:90%
>>That's in the grids.

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if you're
the one to do that or what.

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:22.250 align:middle line:90%
We'll see what's happening.

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:25.427 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot will
change through next year.

00:33:25.427 --> 00:33:26.802 align:middle line:84%
I think by next
year, we're going

00:33:26.802 --> 00:33:30.194 align:middle line:84%
to know a lot more than we
do now, about everything.

00:33:30.194 --> 00:33:31.360 align:middle line:90%
Because it's moving so fast.

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:32.330 align:middle line:90%
>>Who put that one in the grid?

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:33.300 align:middle line:90%
>>Huh?

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:35.730 align:middle line:90%
>>Who put that one in the grid?

00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>>Thoth was-- 32
ascended masters

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:40.470 align:middle line:90%
were the first ones to use it.

00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:41.760 align:middle line:90%
I got it from Thoth.

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Right before he
left, he came down

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:47.200 align:middle line:84%
and he said that they
had finally given him--

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:52.930 align:middle line:84%
the higher consciousness
had given the proportions

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:55.650 align:middle line:84%
and speeds and all the
various things of how

00:33:55.650 --> 00:33:58.390 align:middle line:90%
to do this special Merkaba.

00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And that they were going
to do it, or try it.

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:06.370 align:middle line:84%
He said that my work with
him was over and completed.

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:07.900 align:middle line:90%
We said goodbye and everything.

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:10.469 align:middle line:84%
He told me how to
do it, and told me

00:34:10.469 --> 00:34:11.989 align:middle line:84%
that I would teach
it at one point.

00:34:11.989 --> 00:34:17.122 align:middle line:90%


00:34:17.122 --> 00:34:18.330 align:middle line:90%
He told me some other things.

00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:21.130 align:middle line:90%
And then they left that evening.

00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And they made it,
from what I feel.

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:28.340 align:middle line:90%


00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And so the ascended
masters know what it is.

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:34.040 align:middle line:84%
They all know what
this new thing is now.

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And it requires the
spine of one person,

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.679 align:middle line:84%
and one more person
connecting to that one person.

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And that the love
between the two of them,

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:51.000 align:middle line:84%
and certain fields, can
create a Merkaba that extends

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.520 align:middle line:90%
in the space 1.6 million miles.

00:34:54.520 --> 00:35:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And has the potential,
as a vortex, of 531 feet.

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:03.780 align:middle line:84%
Which is about the size
of two football fields.

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:07.566 align:middle line:84%
So two people can take
as many people with them

00:35:07.566 --> 00:35:11.066 align:middle line:84%
as can get in two
football fields.

00:35:11.066 --> 00:35:11.940 align:middle line:90%
Which is pretty good.

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:16.120 align:middle line:90%


00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:17.690 align:middle line:90%
So it changes the whole rules.

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:23.200 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, it isn't
limited to this octave.

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:26.115 align:middle line:90%
It's not limited to any octave.

00:35:26.115 --> 00:35:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>>Does that mean you can
make the planet a spaceship?

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:31.120 align:middle line:90%
>>You absolutely can, yes.

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:33.040 align:middle line:84%
>>With enough people, you
can take the planet with you.

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:33.890 align:middle line:90%
>>That's right.

00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And that happens to be what
the prophecy of the American

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Indians all over the North
American continent say.

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:42.610 align:middle line:90%
Didn't know that?

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:45.470 align:middle line:84%
>>If you read Ken
Carey's work on Starseed,

00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:47.390 align:middle line:84%
the spirit speaks
through that way, too.

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:48.780 align:middle line:84%
They make an image
that way, they

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:50.030 align:middle line:90%
describe it in the [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:54.120 align:middle line:84%
>>That's the ancient image
of all the tribes of Canada,

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:57.320 align:middle line:84%
the United States, Mexico,
and down in the Yucatan

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:58.840 align:middle line:90%
and all down there.

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:05.050 align:middle line:84%
If you take the prophecy that
is in common with all of them,

00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:08.740 align:middle line:84%
they say that there will
be three waves of people.

00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Huge masses of
people that will die.

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:13.810 align:middle line:84%
I think it's beginning
right about this time.

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:17.170 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember the
dates, but it's about 1993.

00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:21.250 align:middle line:84%
This huge mass of people dies
all at once on the planet.

00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And this group of people,
their spirits merge together,

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.990 align:middle line:90%
and they leave.

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:28.150 align:middle line:90%
They go away.

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:30.020 align:middle line:84%
Leave the evolutionary
pattern of the Earth,

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:32.036 align:middle line:84%
and they go to another
planet, and they

00:36:32.036 --> 00:36:34.020 align:middle line:84%
merge with another
evolutionary pattern.

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:39.567 align:middle line:84%
Then a year or so later, another
huge wave dies, and goes.

00:36:39.567 --> 00:36:41.400 align:middle line:84%
They all planned it,
they all worked it out.

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:42.430 align:middle line:90%
They all planned it.

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:46.537 align:middle line:84%
And they leave at this time and
go to another planet and leave.

00:36:46.537 --> 00:36:48.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, the third planet--
if I got this right.

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:50.494 align:middle line:84%
It's been a while since
I've read these prophecies.

00:36:50.494 --> 00:36:54.160 align:middle line:84%
The third one dies, and
they all blend together.

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:59.100 align:middle line:84%
But they go out into space,
all the dimensional levels,

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:03.050 align:middle line:84%
they leave without
any particular place

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:04.342 align:middle line:90%
where they're going.

00:37:04.342 --> 00:37:05.800 align:middle line:84%
They're [? Vinca ?]
type, they want

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:09.430 align:middle line:84%
to just travel and find
out what looks good.

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And so they take off,
and they're in Merkaba.

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:13.730 align:middle line:90%
A living Merkaba.

00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Who's ever left over,
the entire earth

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:23.270 align:middle line:84%
goes into unity, into
unity consciousness.

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:25.110 align:middle line:90%
And we all become one.

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:27.300 align:middle line:84%
The rainbow tribes
all become one.

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:30.780 align:middle line:84%
All the different
colors of the world

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:33.200 align:middle line:84%
become brothers
and sisters again.

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:38.537 align:middle line:84%
And the whole planet becomes
what they say is a spaceship.

00:37:38.537 --> 00:37:39.870 align:middle line:90%
They don't say the word Merkaba.

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:43.050 align:middle line:84%
They say it becomes a
spaceship, and that we agree,

00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:46.700 align:middle line:84%
and then we take it out of orbit
and fly it away to a new place.

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:51.056 align:middle line:90%


00:37:51.056 --> 00:37:51.930 align:middle line:90%
That's what they say.

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:53.305 align:middle line:84%
That's not me
saying that, that's

00:37:53.305 --> 00:37:55.650 align:middle line:90%
what the American Indians say.

00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's not one tribe
saying that, it's hundreds.

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:02.190 align:middle line:90%
They all say that.

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:03.680 align:middle line:84%
When I first heard
that, I couldn't

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:04.910 align:middle line:90%
think of how that could be.

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:06.370 align:middle line:90%
Now I know how it can be.

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:08.204 align:middle line:84%
I can see how that's
actually possible.

00:38:08.204 --> 00:38:10.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that's
what we're going to do.

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:11.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying that.

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:12.780 align:middle line:90%
Don't get me wrong.

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:15.550 align:middle line:84%
All I know is that
is very possible.

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And the direction
we're heading right now

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:20.710 align:middle line:84%
does look like whoever's
on this Earth when

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:24.200 align:middle line:84%
this thing takes place is going
to go into unity consciousness.

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And we are going to
go to a unique place.

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And if we did join together
in a massive Merkaba-- which

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:34.515 align:middle line:84%
is possible-- on Earth, if
we linked with the Earth's

00:38:34.515 --> 00:38:37.550 align:middle line:84%
own Merkaba field
and activated, we

00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:41.930 align:middle line:84%
could take our Earth
with us all the way

00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:43.645 align:middle line:90%
through to the other level.

00:38:43.645 --> 00:38:45.710 align:middle line:84%
We could actually
take it with us.

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:47.260 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what that means.

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:48.760 align:middle line:84%
Don't ask me, I
don't have any idea.

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:50.599 align:middle line:84%
But I know we could
do it if that's

00:38:50.599 --> 00:38:51.640 align:middle line:90%
what we were called upon.

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:56.030 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know,
really, what it means.

00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:58.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in a way, it kind
of looks a giant attachment.

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:02.293 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:02.293 --> 00:39:03.949 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE] on the other side.

00:39:03.949 --> 00:39:04.990 align:middle line:90%
>>But, see, I don't know.

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:07.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm not saying
it's going to happen.

00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:10.164 align:middle line:84%
But that is what the
America Indians say.

00:39:10.164 --> 00:39:11.965 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:39:11.965 --> 00:39:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>>Let me just say
one more thing.

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:14.839 align:middle line:84%
We've got two
minutes, let me think.

00:39:14.839 --> 00:39:16.240 align:middle line:90%
Is there anything else?

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.990 align:middle line:90%
>>Children [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.965 align:middle line:90%
>>What?

00:39:18.965 --> 00:39:21.173 align:middle line:84%
>>The children, you said
there was a special children

00:39:21.173 --> 00:39:22.340 align:middle line:90%
of the light or something?

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:23.140 align:middle line:90%
>>The children?

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:27.465 align:middle line:84%
>>They say there's
a new [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:27.465 --> 00:39:29.340 align:middle line:84%
>>Oh, about taking
children-- a lot of people

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:30.923 align:middle line:84%
want to know about
their kids, if they

00:39:30.923 --> 00:39:32.270 align:middle line:90%
can take their kids with them.

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>>No, no, no.

00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:35.700 align:middle line:84%
Two or three days ago, you
said that there was another--

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:37.414 align:middle line:84%
like the children being born
are a new race or something

00:39:37.414 --> 00:39:38.247 align:middle line:90%
like that, of light?

00:39:38.247 --> 00:39:40.110 align:middle line:90%
Or something coming?

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>>Well there's millions
of kids right now

00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:47.510 align:middle line:84%
that are on the planet, right
now, that are very highly

developed beings.

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:50.180 align:middle line:90%
