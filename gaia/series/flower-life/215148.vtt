00:00:15.552 --> 00:00:17.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And then after
the chakra systems,

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.730 align:middle line:84%
we're going to start looking at
the energy fields of the body.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And then from the immediate
ones, such as the etheric body

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.090 align:middle line:84%
and what is often
called the aura, which

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.050 align:middle line:84%
is simply your thoughts and your
feelings and your emotional--

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, your physical
body also emits light.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.430 align:middle line:84%
That sometimes is
mistaken for auras.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.760 align:middle line:84%
It's usually a disease
when it does that.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And we'll look at those
which are enclosed.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.158 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll go to
the fields like that,

00:00:53.158 --> 00:00:54.950 align:middle line:84%
the crystalline structure
fields out there.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.825 align:middle line:84%
Because that's where I
really want to get to.

00:00:56.825 --> 00:00:58.850 align:middle line:84%
But we'll start in
and go out from there.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.380 align:middle line:84%
But we'll start with
this aspect by talking

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.650 align:middle line:90%
about the inner chakras.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And to understand the
inner chakras that

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.310 align:middle line:84%
run inside the body, we'll look
at first just the eight chakra

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.110 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.110 align:middle line:90%
It's the simpler one.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see what's
the origin of that.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And in order to look at
the eight chakra system,

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.040 align:middle line:84%
it's easiest to compare
it to sound and music.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.200 align:middle line:84%
We've already seen how
music and organic structure

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.470 align:middle line:90%
are interrelated.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.210 align:middle line:90%
We saw that with the bees.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And we saw that
in the spine, how

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.470 align:middle line:84%
the spinal column
and the weights of it

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.370 align:middle line:84%
were equivalent to the
differences in cycles

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.470 align:middle line:90%
per second in music.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And so in order to
talk about the way

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.980 align:middle line:84%
that energy flows through
the octave in terms of music

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.700 align:middle line:84%
and just the way you
play music, play it

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.200 align:middle line:84%
between the steps
and the half steps

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.590 align:middle line:84%
and all these things in
music is identical to the way

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.950 align:middle line:90%
energy flows up the spine.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.300 align:middle line:90%
It's exactly the same.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.310 align:middle line:84%
So if you can
understand it in music,

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.040 align:middle line:90%
you can understand the body.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the Sufi groups are
going through this, especially

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.425 align:middle line:90%
Gurdjieff.

00:02:18.425 --> 00:02:21.080 align:middle line:90%


00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.160 align:middle line:84%
For those of you who
are studying Gurdjieff,

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.222 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give you an image
that he didn't know about,

00:02:29.222 --> 00:02:33.140 align:middle line:84%
that he searched for, I
believe, most of his life, which

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.110 align:middle line:84%
is the sacred image that
was behind the Enneagram

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.350 align:middle line:84%
and behind the work
that he was doing.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.760 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, to start with, we'll
look at the octave up here.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.400 align:middle line:90%
Just Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.440 align:middle line:84%
Between the third
and the fourth note--

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.300 align:middle line:84%
this is a whole
step, a whole step.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.020 align:middle line:10%
But between the third and the
fourth note, between Me and Fa,

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.570 align:middle line:10%
there is a half step.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.250 align:middle line:10%
There's also a half
step between Ti and Do,

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.480 align:middle line:10%
between the seventh and
eighth note, those two places.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Now in musical
instruments that's

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.660 align:middle line:84%
built in, like in
a flute, the way

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.900 align:middle line:84%
they arrange the holes
is such that it's already

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.280 align:middle line:84%
built into there so you
don't have to work it out.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.290 align:middle line:84%
If you play something
like a violin,

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.360 align:middle line:84%
whether you've got a
fretless situation,

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.170 align:middle line:84%
then you have to
know how to do that.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.482 align:middle line:84%
Well, you haven't--
it's not built in.

00:03:23.482 --> 00:03:25.190 align:middle line:84%
Or a guitar, it's
built in because you've

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.348 align:middle line:90%
got the frets in there.

00:03:26.348 --> 00:03:28.806 align:middle line:84%
Because if you look at the
spacings of them and everything.

00:03:28.806 --> 00:03:32.210 align:middle line:90%


00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.070 align:middle line:84%
So it goes between
those two places.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.690 align:middle line:10%
And if you look at
it, it goes into--

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.610 align:middle line:10%
there's two patterns in
there that repeat themselves.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.110 align:middle line:90%
It goes 1, 2 and 3.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.910 align:middle line:90%
Half step 4.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.035 align:middle line:90%
1, 2, 3.

00:03:45.035 --> 00:03:47.060 align:middle line:90%
Half step 4.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.300 align:middle line:90%
There's two sets of patterns.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And one of them,
you can call female.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And one of them,
you can call male,

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.150 align:middle line:84%
though it's debatable which
way you want to do that.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And that there is a difference
between this male or female

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.480 align:middle line:90%
pattern.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.840 align:middle line:10%
And this male
pattern is between Fa

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.180 align:middle line:10%
and So are the fourth
and the fifth note.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.300 align:middle line:90%
Right there.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.140 align:middle line:84%
It's the differences between
male and female notes.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And Gurdjieff used to
talk about this place

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.170 align:middle line:84%
and how if this
was a cosmic scale,

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.839 align:middle line:84%
that a tiny, tiny,
itty-bitty change that

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:25.350 align:middle line:84%
was made between the
fourth and the fifth note

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.150 align:middle line:84%
would affect the whole cosmos
dramatically in a big way.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.110 align:middle line:10%
And so you got real
three places here--

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.850 align:middle line:10%
these two half
steps and this place

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.740 align:middle line:10%
between the fourth
and the fifth that we

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.610 align:middle line:10%
need to identify in
terms of shape and form.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.190 align:middle line:84%
This is the Enneagram
that Gurdjieff used.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:51.300 align:middle line:84%
It was a two-dimensional
representation of this.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And both of these are
two-dimensional representations

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.960 align:middle line:84%
of something that is
an actual sacred form.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Neither one of these
are sacred geometry.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Gurdjieff didn't know
about sacred geometry,

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:10.970 align:middle line:84%
but this is a pattern
that is one step removed.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.880 align:middle line:84%
This is the work
of Walter Russell.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.980 align:middle line:84%
His work was one step
removed from sacred geometry.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.258 align:middle line:90%


00:05:20.258 --> 00:05:25.210 align:middle line:84%
But it has a lot
of similarities.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.400 align:middle line:84%
They've discovered that there is
a flow in here inside of here.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And that flow in the Enneagram
goes from 1 to 4 to 2 to 8 to 5

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.610 align:middle line:90%
to 7 to 1 again.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.470 align:middle line:90%
And those are called the wings.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.057 align:middle line:84%
And there's another flow that
goes from 3, 6, 9 in here.

00:05:41.057 --> 00:05:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to
get into the Enneagram.

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:44.480 align:middle line:90%
That's not my real purpose here.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.020 align:middle line:10%
But except to say that
the reason that there

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.550 align:middle line:10%
are nine points
in the Enneagram--

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.430 align:middle line:10%
and there's really a tenth one
in the center, which is seldom

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.360 align:middle line:10%
talked about, which the
way these two things

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.515 align:middle line:10%
relate together, why
there's nine points on here

00:05:58.515 --> 00:06:00.390 align:middle line:10%
and there's eight notes
up there, the first--

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.070 align:middle line:10%
it doesn't look like
they correspond.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.590 align:middle line:10%
And that's because
the two halves

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.420 align:middle line:10%
steps are considered
as important

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.520 align:middle line:10%
as the rest of the pattern.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.100 align:middle line:10%
So it really goes 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.820 align:middle line:10%
10th one or the retreat
is the one in the middle.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:22.160 align:middle line:10%
And this pattern can be applied
to just about everything that

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.830 align:middle line:10%
has a sound implication,
which is everything.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And people like-- if you
remember Oscar Ichazo--

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.080 align:middle line:90%
you might remember him, Arica.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And his work, he had 12 men
who came around him also.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:48.350 align:middle line:84%
And they began to teach
a geometrical means

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:49.940 align:middle line:90%
of enlightenment.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And one of those, which
was one of his teachers

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:57.520 align:middle line:84%
was Claudio Naranjo, who
is a really good teacher--

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.530 align:middle line:84%
and he discovered how
personality types are associated

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.510 align:middle line:84%
with this and that there
are 27 primary personality

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:10.060 align:middle line:84%
types that once you
know the formula,

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.460 align:middle line:84%
you can just look at a person,
and you know everything

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.980 align:middle line:90%
about them really, really fast.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's far more accurate
than the 12 personality

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.760 align:middle line:90%
types of astrology.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:33.480 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, that's not my job
here to get into all that stuff.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.190 align:middle line:84%
This is mostly what
I want you to see up

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:36.880 align:middle line:90%
here is how this works.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.390 align:middle line:10%
Now the chakra system, the--

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:42.150 align:middle line:10%
well, first of all, the
hidden sacred form that

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:46.510 align:middle line:10%
is behind it, which
only makes sense anyway,

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:50.730 align:middle line:10%
since you've got biology and
sound that are interlinked

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:53.770 align:middle line:10%
is the same one that
creates the biological life

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:55.390 align:middle line:10%
forms, the egg of life.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:08:00.250 align:middle line:84%
These are the notes of
the eight-note scale.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And you can even identify these
two half steps in the fourth--

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.870 align:middle line:84%
it's placed between the male
and the fourth and the fifth.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'm going to do
is show you how this works.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And though it's intuitive in
what you're going to see here,

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.000 align:middle line:84%
this is really a
lattice or a grid.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.815 align:middle line:90%
And there is a one below.

00:08:24.815 --> 00:08:25.940 align:middle line:90%
And there's a one we're in.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.280 align:middle line:90%
There's a one above there.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.040 align:middle line:84%
In terms of the
chakras also, there's

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.990 align:middle line:90%
a set of chakras below you.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And there's a set of
chakras that you are in.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And there's a set of
chakras above you.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.730 align:middle line:84%
The set of chakras below
you are compressed.

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And they are in the
ratio of the phi ratio,

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.690 align:middle line:84%
meaning that if this was the
length of the set of chakras

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:50.170 align:middle line:84%
below you, that
the one you're in

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:59.030 align:middle line:84%
would be approximately that high
and the ones that go above you

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:06.590 align:middle line:84%
would be approximately
that high.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:09.750 align:middle line:84%
They are much farther
stretched out above you.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And they're super
compressed below you.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.948 align:middle line:90%
This is where you came from.

00:09:14.948 --> 00:09:17.365 align:middle line:84%
This is where you are now, and
this is where you're going.

00:09:17.365 --> 00:09:22.292 align:middle line:90%


00:09:22.292 --> 00:09:27.260 align:middle line:84%
But just to look at music,
first of all, this here,

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:32.270 align:middle line:84%
and to see what sound
does, when it moves

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.700 align:middle line:90%
through this basic structure.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.710 align:middle line:84%
Sound comes in from
below at this first note,

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:42.680 align:middle line:84%
from what was below, which
is the first note of Do.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.650 align:middle line:84%
It's now entered into
this white tetrahedron.

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I should do
it the other way

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.500 align:middle line:84%
around, since I've got that
one arranged like that.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And I'll come in-- it comes in
first as this black tetrahedron.

00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:00.000 align:middle line:84%
Now there's three places
that it could go to.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.390 align:middle line:90%
It's in the black tetrahedron.

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:05.040 align:middle line:84%
It has to move to one
of these three places.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.573 align:middle line:84%
For our purposes,
it doesn't matter.

00:10:06.573 --> 00:10:08.490 align:middle line:84%
Experientially, it might
matter because that's

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:10.050 align:middle line:90%
mother, father, child.

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:12.200 align:middle line:90%
But male, female, and neutral.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.090 align:middle line:90%


00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:17.385 align:middle line:84%
But for our purposes,
it has to go somewhere.

00:10:17.385 --> 00:10:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And we're just
going to pick one.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.170 align:middle line:90%
So say it goes here.

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:24.070 align:middle line:84%
So now this is Do
and Re on here.

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:25.630 align:middle line:90%
It now has two left over.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:26.590 align:middle line:90%
It's got to pick one.

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:28.482 align:middle line:84%
So we'll pick this
one over here.

00:10:28.482 --> 00:10:29.440 align:middle line:90%
So it goes to this one.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.080 align:middle line:90%
This is Do, Re, and Mi.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.500 align:middle line:84%
No matter how it
did it, it moved

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.040 align:middle line:90%
in an equilateral triangle.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.230 align:middle line:90%
Do, Re, Mi.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.170 align:middle line:90%
Equal spaces between them.

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:45.150 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:48.100 align:middle line:90%
But now it has to change--

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.010 align:middle line:84%
it either went in this
equilateral triangle,

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:55.250 align:middle line:84%
this equilateral triangle, or
this one, one of the three.

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Or it could have went
this way or this way.

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.100 align:middle line:90%
There's only six possibilities.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.750 align:middle line:90%
But now it has to get back here.

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:06.290 align:middle line:84%
It has to change direction
from this flat plane

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:09.610 align:middle line:84%
that it's moving in, which
is the first three notes.

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:13.760 align:middle line:84%
It has to changed direction
and come back here to this one.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.350 align:middle line:90%
And all I can do is--

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:19.550 align:middle line:84%
remember how shadow
forms are the key.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:23.390 align:middle line:84%
And I can only give you a right
brain explanation of this.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:24.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go in here.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:29.186 align:middle line:90%


00:11:29.186 --> 00:11:32.150 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:33.985 align:middle line:90%


00:11:33.985 --> 00:11:35.960 align:middle line:90%
You've got this little rod.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And this would be the whole note
step between the Do, Re, and Mi.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:47.350 align:middle line:84%
But then when it has to turn
and go out of the plane,

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:51.043 align:middle line:84%
look what happens to a
shadow form of a turn.

00:11:51.043 --> 00:11:51.843 align:middle line:90%
It shortens.

00:11:51.843 --> 00:11:56.930 align:middle line:90%


00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:57.730 align:middle line:90%
It gets shorter.

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:05.420 align:middle line:90%


00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:10.460 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, the length
between this one and this one

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:12.680 align:middle line:90%
and this one is a whole note.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.230 align:middle line:84%
But when it turns and
goes back to the other one

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:18.770 align:middle line:84%
to get back to here,
the experience of it

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:23.000 align:middle line:90%
is that it's shorter.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And so you have Do, Re,
Mi, half step to Fa.

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:31.940 align:middle line:84%
It's now completed
the black tetrahedron.

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And in order to continue on,
it has to change polarity

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.710 align:middle line:90%
from female to male.

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And there's only one
way it can do that.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:50.310 align:middle line:84%
It goes right through 0 point
from square 4 to 5 over here,

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:54.930 align:middle line:84%
right through the
center, through the womb.

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And it passes right
through the middle,

00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:00.160 align:middle line:84%
over to the opposite
polarity, from 4 to 5.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Gurdjieff
was really talking about.

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:07.740 align:middle line:84%
It's in 0 point between 4
and 5, between Fa and So.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And so a little tiny
change in the great void

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:14.940 align:middle line:84%
will make a huge change
out in the reality.

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.880 align:middle line:90%
So now it gets over here onto--

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.830 align:middle line:90%
they went into cascade 4.

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:21.820 align:middle line:90%
Came over here to 5.

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:22.720 align:middle line:90%
Say like this.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.160 align:middle line:90%
It's now here.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And it moves for the next
three in a flat plane.

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Whichever way it wants
to go, it'll come around.

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:31.950 align:middle line:90%
And it goes for So, La, and Ti.

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:33.000 align:middle line:90%
Up like this.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.910 align:middle line:90%
Again, whole step notes.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:38.590 align:middle line:84%
Because it's all in
one plane of movement.

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:41.970 align:middle line:84%
But then it has to
make another half step,

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:46.830 align:middle line:84%
another angular change away from
the plane to get up to the top.

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:50.085 align:middle line:84%
And so you end up with another
half step between Do and Ti.

00:13:50.085 --> 00:13:52.990 align:middle line:90%


00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Now your chakra system is one
of these things opened up.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.750 align:middle line:90%


00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:04.450 align:middle line:90%
Running up your spine.

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And so you have the
same things going on

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.320 align:middle line:90%
between your eight chakras.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:14.230 align:middle line:10%
You have blocks, changes
of angles between 3 and 4

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:17.590 align:middle line:10%
and 7 and 8.

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:22.480 align:middle line:10%
You also have a very special
place between 4 and 5,

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.470 align:middle line:10%
between the heart
and between sound.

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:30.370 align:middle line:10%
So in the eight-point
chakra, you have one

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:31.470 align:middle line:10%
at the base of the spine.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:35.530 align:middle line:90%


00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:43.600 align:middle line:10%
You then have a second one which
is just a little bit higher

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.250 align:middle line:10%
up in there.

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:48.265 align:middle line:10%
You have another one up here.

00:14:48.265 --> 00:15:04.816 align:middle line:90%


00:15:04.816 --> 00:15:05.983 align:middle line:90%
You got these eight chakras.

00:15:05.983 --> 00:15:10.160 align:middle line:90%


00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.810 align:middle line:84%
This one really is the pineal
gland in the center of the head.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:17.810 align:middle line:90%
Here, this one's above the head.

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:19.528 align:middle line:90%
This one doesn't sit here.

00:15:19.528 --> 00:15:20.820 align:middle line:90%
It sits over here in the front.

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.195 align:middle line:84%
Let me show you
this in a moment.

00:15:22.195 --> 00:15:23.690 align:middle line:84%
But in the first
point, I just want

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:27.710 align:middle line:84%
to show them as a straight
line, but not exactly that way.

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And so energy comes in from
another dimensional level.

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:36.530 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you get
born here into this world.

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:39.810 align:middle line:84%
You came from some other
well, some other place.

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:42.965 align:middle line:10%
And when you do, you
have three chakras--

00:15:42.965 --> 00:15:46.620 align:middle line:90%


00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.630 align:middle line:10%
the first, second, and third--

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:53.650 align:middle line:10%
that become your
domain of expression.

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Or they become like lenses to
interpret the reality through.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And you can't get up any
higher because there's

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:04.380 align:middle line:90%
this half step here.

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:05.200 align:middle line:10%
There's a block.

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:09.060 align:middle line:10%
There's a wall right
here that God put there.

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:15.660 align:middle line:10%
And so let me go to
the body here a moment.

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Same thing is true
with color here.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.370 align:middle line:90%


00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:28.150 align:middle line:84%
This cube, the color wavelengths
correspond to the sound

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:30.750 align:middle line:84%
In the same way,
though many people

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:37.120 align:middle line:84%
have tried to take the seven
notes of sound and correspond--

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.760 align:middle line:84%
see, there's only three
primary and three secondary.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And they tried to
add another color

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:47.030 align:middle line:84%
to get the color
linked in with that.

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:49.730 align:middle line:84%
But really, what it is,
it comes in as white.

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:52.450 align:middle line:84%
It then goes up to the
three primary colors,

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:53.950 align:middle line:84%
goes across the
other side and comes

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:57.260 align:middle line:84%
with three secondary colors,
turns and becomes black.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:01.360 align:middle line:84%
But then black becomes
white on to the next grid.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really a
combination of three primary,

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:09.700 align:middle line:84%
three secondary black and white
that are the key to all of that.

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.869 align:middle line:84%
I really need to
redo this drawing.

00:17:11.869 --> 00:17:17.560 align:middle line:84%
But these are-- and this
is much more complicated.

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:21.500 align:middle line:84%
There's actually a rotational
motion going up the spine.

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And females rotate up one
way and males rotate up

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:26.950 align:middle line:90%
the other way up the spines.

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I've got
this first division

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.030 align:middle line:84%
here showing this
rotational energy.

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And the one for the
male is actually

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.410 align:middle line:90%
in space for the sexual energy.

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:37.090 align:middle line:90%
The penis goes up to.

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:38.810 align:middle line:84%
Female when it's not
back there, though.

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:40.160 align:middle line:90%
It's actually in here further.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.000 align:middle line:84%
But I've divided them further so
you can see there's a division.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.550 align:middle line:90%


00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:47.950 align:middle line:10%
And there's a half step
in between here that

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:52.300 align:middle line:10%
blocks these, a wall that keeps
anything from consciousness

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.010 align:middle line:10%
from moving higher.

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And then there is
another wall back here,

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:59.230 align:middle line:84%
which is at the
back of the head.

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:03.040 align:middle line:84%
This is why the Egyptians used
that 45-degree thing on the back

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.300 align:middle line:90%
of the head.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:08.108 align:middle line:84%
The chakra, the half-step chakra
is this little bump that's

00:18:08.108 --> 00:18:09.150 align:middle line:90%
on the back of your head.

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:22.570 align:middle line:90%


00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:26.170 align:middle line:84%
Just to give you an idea,
this is what happens.

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:30.880 align:middle line:10%
Life comes in here.

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.040 align:middle line:10%
It comes into a brand
new reality, which

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.460 align:middle line:10%
is what we're all about to do.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:37.150 align:middle line:10%
We're all about to die
here, you might say, and be

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:39.280 align:middle line:10%
born into another reality.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And when you go into
this new reality,

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:50.180 align:middle line:84%
it's new, meaning you don't
know anything about anything.

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:53.330 align:middle line:84%
Nothing corresponds
with anything you know.

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:54.780 align:middle line:90%
The colors aren't the same.

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:56.780 align:middle line:90%
Shapes don't make sense.

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:59.450 align:middle line:90%
You don't know what anything is.

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And you're just-- when
you were a little baby,

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:04.765 align:middle line:84%
when you came in
here, you might have--

00:19:04.765 --> 00:19:06.740 align:middle line:84%
you didn't know
what anything was.

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:09.230 align:middle line:84%
It takes a while to
understand what it is.

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:14.767 align:middle line:84%
So you only have really
one thing on your mind.

00:19:14.767 --> 00:19:16.350 align:middle line:84%
You're not interested--
at that point,

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:18.642 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to be
interested in how much money you

00:19:18.642 --> 00:19:20.610 align:middle line:84%
got in your bank account
or anything else.

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:23.310 align:middle line:84%
You're going to only be
interested in one thing,

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:24.860 align:middle line:90%
and that's the survival.

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:26.660 align:middle line:90%
That's staying there.

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:30.350 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be your total,
absolute, complete focus

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:32.040 align:middle line:90%
of you're in this world.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to try
to do everything you

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:38.480 align:middle line:90%
can to stay in this new world.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:42.290 align:middle line:84%
But at some point,
you will master that

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:48.540 align:middle line:84%
and you will figure it
out how to be there.

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And then once that
gets mastered,

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:57.570 align:middle line:84%
you will then become aware of
the next chakra or lens, which

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:00.000 align:middle line:84%
is you'll be aware
that there are

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.160 align:middle line:84%
other beings here or
other aspects of yourself,

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.980 align:middle line:84%
depending on what you
want to look at it.

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And it will become a natural
desire, though that desire is

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:11.070 align:middle line:84%
totally different
from place to place,

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:middle line:84%
to make contact, physical
contact with the life

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:18.510 align:middle line:90%
or consciousness that is there.

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And so the second one in terms
of third dimensional world

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:24.270 align:middle line:90%
is called sexual.

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:28.380 align:middle line:10%
And so the sexual chakra
lies on the next one.

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:32.460 align:middle line:10%
Once you've usually made
those two connections,

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.628 align:middle line:10%
the next one that
follows after that,

00:20:34.628 --> 00:20:35.920 align:middle line:10%
which is sitting at the navel--

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:39.780 align:middle line:10%
and by the way, the third
chakra is exactly at the navel.

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.400 align:middle line:10%
This whole thing
where the Hindus say

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.980 align:middle line:10%
that it's one or
two fingers below

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.640 align:middle line:10%
and even a lot of the martial
arts that say the center's

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.250 align:middle line:10%
down there, if it's
there, there ain't

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:50.360 align:middle line:10%
anything that shows up
on the computer screens.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.580 align:middle line:90%
Not a thing.

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:53.573 align:middle line:84%
And we can go right
into the center of it.

00:20:53.573 --> 00:20:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And we were kept--
that's because we all

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.040 align:middle line:90%
had that training.

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And we started looking
in there and go, God,

00:20:58.610 --> 00:20:59.500 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing here.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:00.710 align:middle line:90%
Where's the third chakra?

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:02.170 align:middle line:90%
It's not here.

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:03.160 align:middle line:90%
And so we just went up.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:03.960 align:middle line:90%
And bingo.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, you take
the belly button.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And you go right
down the center.

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And I really think
that the ancients

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:15.820 align:middle line:90%
were trying to hide that.

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.510 align:middle line:90%
They did so many secret things.

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's one of those
things that we thought was true.

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:22.310 align:middle line:84%
But just I can tell,
that isn't true.

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:24.680 align:middle line:84%
It is right where you
think it would be.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:30.190 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:36.890 align:middle line:10%
And so the third one that
comes into your existence

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:45.440 align:middle line:10%
has to do with ego and
controlling the environment,

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.140 align:middle line:10%
mastering the
environment itself,

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.660 align:middle line:10%
being able to work with
these new shapes and forms

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:54.320 align:middle line:10%
and learning how to move and
all this kind of stuff, which

00:21:54.320 --> 00:22:02.030 align:middle line:10%
ultimately turns into, in this
world, anyway, the control

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:03.950 align:middle line:10%
and the power and all
these kinds of things

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:06.905 align:middle line:10%
that it leads to the
distortions of it.

00:22:06.905 --> 00:22:08.190 align:middle line:90%
But then you have a wall.

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:09.770 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
spirit won't even

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:13.340 align:middle line:84%
know that there's
anything more than that.

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:17.990 align:middle line:10%
And so in the beginning stages
of going into a new dimension,

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:23.540 align:middle line:10%
you become totally involved in
survival, sexual energy or sex,

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:26.660 align:middle line:10%
and power.

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:31.820 align:middle line:10%
And if you take a-- this is
true of a person or a country

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:34.830 align:middle line:10%
or a planet or a
galaxy for that matter.

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And so in terms of a country,
you could take like the United

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:47.020 align:middle line:84%
States back in, say, the
late '40s or early '50s.

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:49.050 align:middle line:84%
That's a real good
time in there.

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And we had not discovered that
there was anything above that

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:56.010 align:middle line:90%
yet.

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And almost everybody
in the United States

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:00.840 align:middle line:84%
during that period
of time was totally

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:04.080 align:middle line:84%
involved in the first three
things of survival, sex,

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:08.880 align:middle line:84%
and power and control
or combinations of it

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:09.970 align:middle line:90%
in one way or another.

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:11.680 align:middle line:90%
That was materialism.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:14.910 align:middle line:84%
That falls in the thing of
getting money and houses

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:17.940 align:middle line:84%
and making sure you
got lots of food,

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:19.620 align:middle line:84%
whether all these
kinds of things

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:21.760 align:middle line:84%
are all following these
kinds of categories.

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:24.660 align:middle line:90%


00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:28.000 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, in
the early '40s and 1950s,

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.770 align:middle line:84%
you could have gone
to another country,

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:34.360 align:middle line:84%
any of the older countries
and certain areas of China.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.000 align:middle line:84%
A good one is
India, because we're

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.780 align:middle line:84%
more familiar with
that one, or Tibet.

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:39.850 align:middle line:90%
But India would be a good one.

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:44.290 align:middle line:84%
In India, they had
long ago found out

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:52.175 align:middle line:84%
about this as a country and
went up into these setup here.

00:23:52.175 --> 00:23:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And in the fourth, fifth,
sixth, and seventh,

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:56.110 align:middle line:90%
there was another wall up here.

00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:59.510 align:middle line:84%
So when you find out
where this doorway is,

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:01.190 align:middle line:90%
then you come up into here.

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And so India wasn't
really concerned so much

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:10.000 align:middle line:84%
anymore about materialism
or all that kind of stuff.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.330 align:middle line:84%
They were concerned about
love and sound, music,

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:19.900 align:middle line:84%
causal playing of how
things are together

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.750 align:middle line:84%
and the final spiritual
realms up in here.

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:24.940 align:middle line:84%
They were concerned
about other things that

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:29.030 align:middle line:84%
were more important
at the same time

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:32.560 align:middle line:84%
while the United States was
down here really putting

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:39.590 align:middle line:84%
all their energy into getting
the physical planes together.

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And there are people
that are the same way.

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:48.710 align:middle line:84%
So this doorway
here is one that--

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:50.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all you guys
have one way or another

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.540 align:middle line:84%
found this doorway
here, as you've all

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:55.080 align:middle line:90%
discovered this up in here.

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:58.437 align:middle line:84%
What you're now looking
for, is this doorway.

00:24:58.437 --> 00:25:00.020 align:middle line:84%
You're now becoming
aware that there's

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:04.550 align:middle line:84%
another doorway, that there's
something else even above that.

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:08.520 align:middle line:84%
We have built in to
our physical body--

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.360 align:middle line:84%
and why we didn't,
I don't know--

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.120 align:middle line:90%
another angle in here.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:12.960 align:middle line:90%
We put this.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.130 align:middle line:90%
This is the pituitary gland.

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:15.330 align:middle line:90%
This is the pineal gland.

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:20.000 align:middle line:84%
This is-- what you call it--
the medulla at the back.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.100 align:middle line:84%
You got to do is take this spot
right here and go straight back.

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:24.440 align:middle line:90%
It's in a straight line.

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:27.830 align:middle line:84%
From your third
eye, straight back.

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:29.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Where is it?

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:32.150 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] Right here.

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:34.550 align:middle line:90%
OK, OK.

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:37.236 align:middle line:90%
Now, is that even?

00:25:37.236 --> 00:25:38.640 align:middle line:90%
>> A little--

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>> How's that?

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Slight angle.

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Slight angle.

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:46.840 align:middle line:90%
OK, whatever.

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:47.830 align:middle line:90%
This is on me.

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:48.700 align:middle line:90%
This is where it is.

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.300 align:middle line:90%
I've got my finger right on it.

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.657 align:middle line:90%
It's right there on me.

00:25:54.657 --> 00:25:55.990 align:middle line:90%
So that's the place where it is.

00:25:55.990 --> 00:26:00.840 align:middle line:84%
So maybe there's a little
bit lower down in there.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:01.710 align:middle line:90%
It is in a plane.

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:03.340 align:middle line:90%
There's another angle in there.

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:07.660 align:middle line:84%
We put this angle in
there for some reason.

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:09.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure why we did it.

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:12.450 align:middle line:84%
But it is really caused
an interesting situation

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:14.170 align:middle line:90%
where the ascended masters--

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:16.350 align:middle line:84%
because when they went
through the chakra

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:20.370 align:middle line:84%
systems of their own cells
and they got up to here,

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:23.760 align:middle line:84%
they had a real hard time
finding the seventh one.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened is all
the ascended masters went--

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:30.090 align:middle line:84%
in terms of it and looking at
it in terms of the chakra system

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:33.960 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth, they went up to
the 12th overtone of the sixth

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.070 align:middle line:90%
dimension.

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And you got about almost 8,000
ascended masters as of just

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:41.030 align:middle line:90%
recently.

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And only three or
four of them were

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:46.813 align:middle line:84%
able to figure out where
the seventh dimension was.

00:26:46.813 --> 00:26:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't find the
doorway through.

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:50.500 align:middle line:90%
There's just a few.

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Because all it really
takes is just one.

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:56.200 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, those three or four
are training the rest of them.

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:57.790 align:middle line:90%
And they're now getting it.

00:26:57.790 --> 00:26:59.990 align:middle line:84%
In the last couple of
years, they got it.

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:04.180 align:middle line:84%
They're all flowing over now
into the pineal gland area

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:07.480 align:middle line:84%
of the seventh
dimension of the Earth,

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:12.610 align:middle line:84%
which is really the 12th
dimension of in term-- or no.

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:14.890 align:middle line:90%
I said 12.

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:23.000 align:middle line:90%
No, that would be 10 or 11.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:23.800 align:middle line:90%
Not sure.

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:27.430 align:middle line:84%
10 or 11, which is the 12th
dimension is actually a crown

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:28.850 align:middle line:90%
on top of it.

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:29.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:31.760 align:middle line:84%
There are different ways
of approaching this.

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:36.840 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Anunnaki didn't do
this system that we're doing.

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:40.190 align:middle line:84%
They did go back here
first and came out

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:42.780 align:middle line:84%
this way to a chakra
that's in front of you.

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:45.590 align:middle line:84%
There's another one out here
in space, out in front of you,

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:47.040 align:middle line:90%
in front of your third eye.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And they projected their
consciousness that way and then

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:52.190 align:middle line:84%
made a 90-degree
turn straight up.

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And it was through
that particular way

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.630 align:middle line:84%
that they were able
to find the doorway

00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:59.340 align:middle line:90%
to the next dimensional level.

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And so it was like this L
shape and this 90-degree L.

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And they became
known as the "Ls"

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.730 align:middle line:84%
for a long time because
of its meditation.

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And later because they
were the old ones,

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.688 align:middle line:84%
that's where the
word elder came from.

00:28:12.688 --> 00:28:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And knowing what that
was, they were called

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:17.510 align:middle line:90%
the elders and the elder race.

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:21.170 align:middle line:84%
Because of the meditation
practice that they used to make

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:23.180 align:middle line:90%
this 90-degree turn.

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:24.920 align:middle line:84%
From what I'm being
told, we're not

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:27.450 align:middle line:84%
going to go that direction
that you're talking about.

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:31.440 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to come from
here to here first as a race,

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.940 align:middle line:90%
though, that is a possibility.

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:34.340 align:middle line:90%
Now, you may do that.

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:37.330 align:middle line:84%
But as an overall
planet, we have, I guess,

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:40.840 align:middle line:84%
already decided that we're
going to go up to here,

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.960 align:middle line:84%
shoot back over
here, and then out.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.600 align:middle line:90%
And I'll give the pattern.

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:49.210 align:middle line:84%
Again, I'm not saying
you have to do this.

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:52.720 align:middle line:84%
This is just what I believe
that we're going to do.

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:56.920 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
concepts on these chakras,

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:58.870 align:middle line:84%
and I'm only giving
one idea about them.

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to give a very
complex one in a minute,

00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:04.890 align:middle line:84%
more complex than what you're
probably just about ever

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:06.130 align:middle line:90%
used to seeing.

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And the energy flows
also have other channels.

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.588 align:middle line:84%
There's a spiraling energy
connections and things

00:29:11.588 --> 00:29:12.880 align:middle line:90%
that are connected to them too.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.280 align:middle line:84%
But I'm only going to
be looking at one way.

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:16.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Could you please name--

00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:19.570 align:middle line:84%
you named the first
three chakras,

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:21.810 align:middle line:90%
but you skipped up to the head.

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:25.680 align:middle line:84%
>> In terms of the octave,
we skipped from the navel up

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:27.150 align:middle line:90%
to here.

00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:28.860 align:middle line:90%
Now we're going to go--

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:30.840 align:middle line:90%
this is the heart chakra.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.870 align:middle line:84%
But this is not the heart
chakra from my point of view

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:35.390 align:middle line:90%
of universal consciousness.

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:38.900 align:middle line:84%
This is the heart chakra
of an individual portion

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:42.170 align:middle line:84%
or, in other words, of love
from one person to another

00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:47.260 align:middle line:84%
or love for music or love for
something, but not everything.

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:49.910 align:middle line:84%
Love for everything is
on the pentatonic scale,

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:51.940 align:middle line:90%
which is a more primary scale.

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:54.440 align:middle line:84%
There's five notes
in the black notes.

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:57.680 align:middle line:84%
What we're talking about here
is the white notes of the piano.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And so that fourth
one relative of that

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:06.400 align:middle line:84%
is up here, whereas the one that
we're wanting to actually focus

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.640 align:middle line:90%
on is lower than that.

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:10.130 align:middle line:84%
So from my point of
view, we have two hearts.

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:13.160 align:middle line:84%
We have a heart connection
on the pentatonic scale.

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And we have a heart
connection on the octave.

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And they're 7.23
centimeters apart.

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:24.280 align:middle line:10%
I always found them.

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:25.850 align:middle line:10%
So this is the heart.

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:31.330 align:middle line:10%
The next one is if you were
male, it's the Adam's apple.

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:33.800 align:middle line:10%
If you're female, you
don't have an Adam's apple.

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:36.120 align:middle line:10%
And it's right in there.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.170 align:middle line:10%
And that's the fifth one.

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:38.810 align:middle line:10%
And that's the sound current.

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:43.740 align:middle line:84%
In terms of the octave, the next
one is up here between the brow.

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:48.690 align:middle line:84%
But there's really-- from
my way of putting here,

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:50.100 align:middle line:90%
you got three in there.

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:52.857 align:middle line:84%
But really, there's
five in there.

00:30:52.857 --> 00:30:53.690 align:middle line:90%
There's these three.

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:54.600 align:middle line:90%
But there's one on this side.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And there's also another
one in the back of that

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.460 align:middle line:90%
one out in space behind it.

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:02.263 align:middle line:84%
And the pituitary
gland is up here.

00:31:02.263 --> 00:31:03.180 align:middle line:90%
It's the one in front.

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And usually, people talk
about the pituitary gland

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:06.990 align:middle line:90%
as being the third eye.

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Not from my point of view
It's not third eye at all.

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:14.270 align:middle line:84%
To me, this is the causal
plane that hinders--

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:20.390 align:middle line:84%
it's where the geometries
and the mental understandings

00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:22.950 align:middle line:90%
of the reality are held.

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:25.220 align:middle line:84%
But you got to go back
into the pineal gland

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:26.460 align:middle line:90%
in the center of the head.

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And that is literally
the third eye.

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:32.760 align:middle line:84%
The pineal gland, You remember
that picture of an eye

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:34.560 align:middle line:90%
that I showed at one point?

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.360 align:middle line:90%
Was a round ball.

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:38.860 align:middle line:84%
The pineal gland
looks just like that.

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:39.850 align:middle line:90%
It is an eye.

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:41.020 align:middle line:90%
It's an eyeball.

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:42.580 align:middle line:90%
It is round.

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:46.090 align:middle line:84%
It has a lens on it for
receiving light through.

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:47.050 align:middle line:90%
It's hollow.

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:50.950 align:middle line:84%
It has color receptors on it in
the inside, just like an eye.

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:53.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:55.860 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's to receive
light from above.

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:58.420 align:middle line:84%
Just as these eyes
can see out this way,

00:31:58.420 --> 00:31:59.740 align:middle line:90%
they can't see that way.

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:04.110 align:middle line:84%
The pineal gland can see
up but can't see down.

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And so it receives
light from above.

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:10.140 align:middle line:84%
But these eyes see
a certain portion

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:11.770 align:middle line:90%
of the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:17.160 align:middle line:84%
These eyes see a
fourth-dimensional prana.

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.980 align:middle line:90%
It's a different kind of light.

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:23.680 align:middle line:84%
But the eye, I believe, the
pineal gland can look around.

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.440 align:middle line:90%
It has a movement.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:31.690 align:middle line:84%
And if the pineal gland looks
through the pituitary gland,

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:35.530 align:middle line:84%
that's when the psychic
energy is fully turned on.

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:39.920 align:middle line:84%
But if it's looking up, it's
receiving the prana from above.

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:42.400 align:middle line:84%
Like if you look at a
bird, their pineal gland

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:46.750 align:middle line:84%
sits on the top of their head
with a thin, no more thicker

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:49.670 align:middle line:84%
than your eyelid
over the top of it

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:54.322 align:middle line:84%
so that it's receiving the
light from above as it's moving.

00:32:54.322 --> 00:32:57.400 align:middle line:90%
>> A baby's soft spot is--

00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:01.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Soft spot, that's
where you breathe through.

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:03.590 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
tube comes through.

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:06.080 align:middle line:90%
It's right on top of your head.

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.530 align:middle line:90%
So when a baby--

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:12.190 align:middle line:84%
this is an important thing
I don't think I said.

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:16.010 align:middle line:84%
Remember I said that
13,000 years ago, we fell.

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And when we did, we started
breathing like this.

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't take the
prana in here anymore.

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:25.090 align:middle line:84%
So when a woman has a baby,
she's still breathing like this.

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:27.970 align:middle line:84%
Baby's breathing
in the proper way.

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:30.470 align:middle line:84%
All the way through the
nine months and all the way

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:32.540 align:middle line:84%
after it comes out,
it's breathing in a way

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:34.290 align:middle line:84%
that we're trying
to teach right now.

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And so you can look at the
top of the baby's head.

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see this pulsing
in and out, in and out.

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.340 align:middle line:90%
It's bringing the prana in.

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to look
underneath the perineum--

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:51.420 align:middle line:84%
perineum is like in a female's,
between the vagina and the anus,

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:53.100 align:middle line:90%
that soft spot in the middle.

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:55.950 align:middle line:84%
That's where the tube also
runs up through here also.

00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:59.037 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like a solid spot
also, just like this does.

00:33:59.037 --> 00:34:00.620 align:middle line:84%
But if you really
check a baby, you'll

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:03.380 align:middle line:84%
see that that in
is also pulsing.

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:05.400 align:middle line:84%
There's a pulsing
from both ends.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's breathing
from the both ends.

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:12.270 align:middle line:84%
>> If a mother is practicing
the prana breathing,

00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:15.870 align:middle line:84%
will the baby be able to stay
doing the prana breathing?

00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:16.670 align:middle line:90%
Or is it--

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:19.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, we've been able to
demonstrate this when Machi,

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:24.460 align:middle line:84%
when she had Elena, who
was now four years old.

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:27.055 align:middle line:90%


00:34:27.055 --> 00:34:29.850 align:middle line:84%
Machi at the time-- now,
Machi is not doing this.

00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:31.540 align:middle line:84%
We went through an
interesting change,

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:35.219 align:middle line:84%
which I'm willing to share
with you at one time.

00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:38.199 align:middle line:84%
But for a long time, Machi
was doing the breathing.

00:34:38.199 --> 00:34:43.418 align:middle line:84%
At this point, she's now become
a Baptist because of her father.

00:34:43.418 --> 00:34:44.710 align:middle line:90%
I can't explain all this stuff.

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:50.550 align:middle line:84%
But while she was doing the
breathing, when Elena was born,

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:55.620 align:middle line:84%
Elena's soft spot, it took
almost nine months before she

00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:57.690 align:middle line:90%
was influenced by other people.

00:34:57.690 --> 00:34:59.920 align:middle line:84%
So when she was eight
or nine months old,

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:02.190 align:middle line:90%
this thing was still pulsing.

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:03.510 align:middle line:90%
It was still going on.

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And these guys really
had the right idea.

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:11.496 align:middle line:84%
They just put the hole where
you breathe on top of the head--

00:35:11.496 --> 00:35:13.800 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:18.090 align:middle line:84%
--make sure that he
never does what we do.

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:20.380 align:middle line:84%
So you can't even
possibly bypass.

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:24.145 align:middle line:84%
So they take their prana
and their air right through.

00:35:24.145 --> 00:35:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And it goes right through
their pineal gland.

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:27.480 align:middle line:90%
And so they don't ever--

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:30.620 align:middle line:90%
they can't make that mistake.
