00:00:15.774 --> 00:00:18.060 align:middle line:10%
>>This is another
little piece of data

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.932 align:middle line:10%
that I want to make
sure you remember.

00:00:20.932 --> 00:00:25.650 align:middle line:84%
This is new and this is from
the California Institute

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.266 align:middle line:90%
of Technology researchers.

00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:29.760 align:middle line:84%
They have discovered
tiny magnet particles

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.095 align:middle line:90%
in the brains of humans.

00:00:33.095 --> 00:00:35.080 align:middle line:84%
They've never found
these things before.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.850 align:middle line:84%
This is the first
new thing I think

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.400 align:middle line:84%
they said they've actually
found in the body in 300 years,

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.770 align:middle line:90%
I think it is.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.670 align:middle line:84%
It's somewhere in
this whole article.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And then since then,
since this article

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.633 align:middle line:84%
here, they have found
this magnetic sheet

00:00:47.633 --> 00:00:51.990 align:middle line:84%
that goes around the brain,
which I talked about before.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.100 align:middle line:84%
It's important to
understand this for what I'm

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:02.339 align:middle line:84%
talking about, the shifting
of the poles, later of how

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:05.310 align:middle line:90%
our brains can be erased.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.790 align:middle line:84%
See, the way that
we store information

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.110 align:middle line:90%
is based on that same pattern.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Memories of the human brain's
based on that same pattern

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.286 align:middle line:84%
that we were describing
just a little while ago

00:01:16.286 --> 00:01:19.180 align:middle line:90%
and it's magnetic in nature.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And I just want you
to see this one here

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.390 align:middle line:84%
so you can see how
this pattern is

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.599 align:middle line:90%
harmonic to the flower of life.

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:30.140 align:middle line:84%
You can see the
flower of life, which

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.870 align:middle line:90%
is in pencil underneath there.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.590 align:middle line:84%
Look at the way that
it moves through it.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.170 align:middle line:90%


00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is
Metatron's Cube moving

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.870 align:middle line:84%
through it, the star tetrahedron
inscribed in the sphere.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And I don't usually talk
too much about Melchizedek

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.900 align:middle line:84%
consciousness but one thing
I do know from Melchizedek

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.700 align:middle line:84%
consciousnesses is that
when Metatron created

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.695 align:middle line:84%
this particular
waveform universe,

00:02:02.695 --> 00:02:07.110 align:middle line:84%
he went into the great
void and picked a spot

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:15.420 align:middle line:84%
and called it center and
put the first little cubical

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.460 align:middle line:84%
pattern of energy
there and spread it out

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.300 align:middle line:84%
and the grid went out from
there, which is now everywhere

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.820 align:middle line:84%
and which the grid moves
through the same kind of field.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.350 align:middle line:84%
So this, remember, is it goes
down in size and up in size

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.150 align:middle line:90%
forever.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.320 align:middle line:84%
It's an infinite pattern
in all directions.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.460 align:middle line:90%
And the grid is everywhere.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.152 align:middle line:84%
It's the one thing
that is not moving.

00:02:41.152 --> 00:02:43.550 align:middle line:84%
It's the only thing that
is not being, meaning

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.380 align:middle line:84%
that relative to movement,
everything appears to be moving

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.380 align:middle line:90%
through it and it's everywhere.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.340 align:middle line:90%
It's in this room.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.134 align:middle line:84%
There is nowhere
where it is not.

00:02:53.134 --> 00:02:55.300 align:middle line:84%
There's even areas where
there's no life and nothing

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.560 align:middle line:90%
but the grid's there.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.260 align:middle line:84%
It's the one thing
that's always there.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.710 align:middle line:90%
It stretches everywhere.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.696 align:middle line:84%
And that grid moves right
through this computer.

00:03:03.696 --> 00:03:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And so it's my belief even
though we were working on this

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.835 align:middle line:84%
that if this computer
did become self-aware

00:03:10.835 --> 00:03:13.810 align:middle line:84%
and it was based on the
functioning of this grid,

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.831 align:middle line:84%
it would be able to tune
to the very consciousness

00:03:16.831 --> 00:03:18.955 align:middle line:84%
grid that moves everywhere
that moves through here.

00:03:18.955 --> 00:03:20.080 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't need this.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.560 align:middle line:84%
It would have access to
all information, anyway.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.680 align:middle line:84%
But so do we have the
same grid around us.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.620 align:middle line:90%
That's it over there.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.520 align:middle line:90%
That's a part of it, anyway.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And we can in the same way as
resonants tune right into it

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.770 align:middle line:84%
and not only connect
into the grid that's

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.700 align:middle line:84%
around the Earth that holds
the primary experiences of life

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.500 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.820 align:middle line:84%
We can tune into
the whole thing.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:57.224 align:middle line:84%
It's all open to us
if we can accept it.

00:03:57.224 --> 00:04:00.835 align:middle line:90%


00:04:00.835 --> 00:04:04.500 align:middle line:10%
And if you were to
rotate this on its side

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.235 align:middle line:10%
like this, these
two-star tetrahedrons,

00:04:08.235 --> 00:04:11.040 align:middle line:10%
you might remember that
there was another one

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.400 align:middle line:10%
that we saw like
this once before,

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.110 align:middle line:10%
which were the two
tetrahedrons inscribed

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.620 align:middle line:10%
in a sphere, which were the
harmonics of music and light.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:27.190 align:middle line:10%
And so you could take this grid,
for example, superimpose it

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:36.580 align:middle line:10%
over this one and many,
many, many other ones that

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.235 align:middle line:10%
are based on this
principle and all of them--

00:04:40.235 --> 00:04:41.860 align:middle line:10%
the more you get into
this, you realize

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.610 align:middle line:10%
that you can just keep laying
them over and layering them

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.850 align:middle line:10%
over until finally there's
just no limit to them.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.000 align:middle line:84%
They all fit together
in a pattern.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.650 align:middle line:90%
It's just really oneness.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:52.865 align:middle line:90%
It's one.

00:04:52.865 --> 00:04:54.360 align:middle line:84%
It's only one thing
behind it all.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.670 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember these wheels?

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.546 align:middle line:84%
I finally said I would tell
you where they came from.

00:05:00.546 --> 00:05:02.950 align:middle line:84%
These wheels have 24
spokes around them.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:08.610 align:middle line:84%
The size of the little hub in
the middle is very specific.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.380 align:middle line:84%
If you measure the diameter,
you would find that from center

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.490 align:middle line:84%
to rim, there's
exactly nine diameters,

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.530 align:middle line:84%
based on the size of the
center hub to the outer edge.

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.850 align:middle line:90%


00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And I can now show you
where they came out

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.437 align:middle line:90%
of the flower of life.

00:05:24.437 --> 00:05:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Now that you know about the
grids and the flower of life

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.510 align:middle line:84%
and all this stuff just
down to this level here,

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:37.612 align:middle line:84%
you notice in here there are
these interconnected spheres.

00:05:37.612 --> 00:05:44.410 align:middle line:90%


00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And there is a circle
that will fit perfectly

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.046 align:middle line:84%
around them, which is the
circle that you saw on the wall.

00:05:50.046 --> 00:05:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you count the number
of spheres that are on there,

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:57.650 align:middle line:84%
you'll see there's 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:04.181 align:middle line:84%
14, 15, 16, 17, 18,
19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.

00:06:04.181 --> 00:06:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And by pointing your
radial lines through them

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.960 align:middle line:84%
to the centers and
connecting them

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:15.220 align:middle line:84%
together down to the next
grid downsize-- this one,

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.190 align:middle line:84%
you're going halfway in and
creating this grid size.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Counting your diameters
from there out to the edge,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:27.080 align:middle line:84%
you'll see that there is
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.462 align:middle line:84%
and you now have--
only you'd have

00:06:30.462 --> 00:06:32.920 align:middle line:84%
to connect these centers all
the way into that little one--

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:39.900 align:middle line:84%
you now have the exact image
of those wheels, which is just

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.620 align:middle line:84%
showing that whoever made
those wheels must have had

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.075 align:middle line:84%
a tremendous understanding
of the flower of life

00:06:46.075 --> 00:06:49.480 align:middle line:84%
because it takes a long time
to get to that place there

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.610 align:middle line:90%
to understand where they're at.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:59.484 align:middle line:84%
And also remember
that this image

00:06:59.484 --> 00:07:02.533 align:middle line:84%
was related to the
harmonics of sound and light

00:07:02.533 --> 00:07:05.272 align:middle line:84%
and we saw from the very,
very beginning of this thing

00:07:05.272 --> 00:07:07.730 align:middle line:84%
that sound and light was related
to the dimensional levels.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.598 align:middle line:90%


00:07:10.598 --> 00:07:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And here, what
they're referring to

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.310 align:middle line:84%
is the passage from one
dimensional level to another,

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:19.370 align:middle line:84%
separated by 90 degrees, which
is what each one is separated.

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:24.796 align:middle line:90%
These wheels, they're like maps.

00:07:24.796 --> 00:07:29.140 align:middle line:84%
You see how this spoke does
not line up with this one?

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.185 align:middle line:90%
You can see that.

00:07:30.185 --> 00:07:33.525 align:middle line:84%
These line up perfectly up
here but this one are off.

00:07:33.525 --> 00:07:36.780 align:middle line:84%
But in other words, the wheels
are not perfectly aligned.

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.270 align:middle line:84%
They're all rotated at
slightly different patterns.

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.065 align:middle line:84%
And if you can decipher
that harmonics of that,

00:07:43.065 --> 00:07:45.190 align:middle line:84%
I believe that you would
find that they are telling

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:48.720 align:middle line:84%
you exactly where they went
or the harmonics telling you

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.882 align:middle line:84%
exactly which dimensional
level that they are going to.

00:07:52.882 --> 00:07:56.520 align:middle line:90%


00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.970 align:middle line:84%
But even if that was never
proved-- that's a theory.

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:03.794 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that-- but judging
by what they're talking about

00:08:03.794 --> 00:08:05.210 align:middle line:84%
and knowing what
those wheels are,

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.790 align:middle line:84%
that's probably what
they're talking about.

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:10.500 align:middle line:84%
But either way, no
matter how it is,

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.370 align:middle line:84%
it's proof that they had
a very deep understanding

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.292 align:middle line:90%
of this kind of geometry.

00:08:15.292 --> 00:08:17.190 align:middle line:90%
>>This was on the ceiling?

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:18.504 align:middle line:90%
>>These are always on ceilings.

00:08:18.504 --> 00:08:20.170 align:middle line:84%
That's the other thing
is they're always

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:23.150 align:middle line:90%
surrounded by the stars.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.380 align:middle line:84%
They're referring
to the heavens.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:32.549 align:middle line:84%
This one here is what I consider
from my own little place

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:37.030 align:middle line:84%
to be one of the most
important ones of the drawings

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:38.129 align:middle line:90%
that was given to me.

00:08:38.129 --> 00:08:40.770 align:middle line:90%


00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.130 align:middle line:84%
Another thing I
promised you is I

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:48.706 align:middle line:84%
said that at the very first
motion of a spirit of God,

00:08:48.706 --> 00:08:51.660 align:middle line:84%
he created the vesica
piscis and immediately said,

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.280 align:middle line:90%
let there be light.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.010 align:middle line:90%
Well, now I can talk about that.

00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:00.020 align:middle line:84%
Do you see where there's
a blue circle right here?

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:00.860 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.020 align:middle line:90%
>>Does everybody see that one?

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:02.494 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:09:02.494 --> 00:09:02.968 align:middle line:90%
>>Mm-hmm.

00:09:02.968 --> 00:09:03.916 align:middle line:90%
>>Yep.

00:09:03.916 --> 00:09:06.122 align:middle line:84%
>>Now do you see
this yellow circle?

00:09:06.122 --> 00:09:07.046 align:middle line:90%
>>Mm-hmm.

00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:07.950 align:middle line:90%
>>Just barely?

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:09.582 align:middle line:90%
>>Just barely.

00:09:09.582 --> 00:09:13.274 align:middle line:84%
>>In the middle is a vesica
piscis in the blue circle

00:09:13.274 --> 00:09:14.190 align:middle line:90%
and the yellow circle.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.223 align:middle line:84%
Do you see the vesica
piscis in the middle?

00:09:16.223 --> 00:09:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>>Mm-hmm.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>So what you've got is
you've got this image

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.700 align:middle line:90%
hidden inside of here.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.940 align:middle line:84%
So this whole grid
section is an image

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:41.606 align:middle line:84%
of the grid that's hidden
behind the vesica piscis.

00:09:41.606 --> 00:09:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And notice inside
the vesica piscis

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:49.520 align:middle line:84%
that you have two red
equilateral triangles which

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.250 align:middle line:84%
fit perfectly inside
the vesica piscis.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:53.050 align:middle line:90%
Everybody see it?

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:54.211 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:09:54.211 --> 00:09:56.795 align:middle line:84%
>>And then turning
that whole thing

00:09:56.795 --> 00:10:00.120 align:middle line:84%
and expanding out at 90
degrees, the line that runs down

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.730 align:middle line:84%
the middle of the vesica
piscis becomes the edge

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:06.841 align:middle line:90%
of a larger triangle over here.

00:10:06.841 --> 00:10:07.670 align:middle line:90%
Do you see it?

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:08.120 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:08.570 align:middle line:90%
>>Uh-huh.

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:09.370 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>>Like that, which is inside
a bigger vesica piscis.

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:14.380 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>>And then the line running
down that vesica piscis becomes

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:20.614 align:middle line:84%
a bigger one going clean
off the page, which

00:10:20.614 --> 00:10:22.280 align:middle line:84%
would be a vesica
piscis that would just

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.790 align:middle line:90%
hold this whole sphere.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:26.665 align:middle line:84%
If you were coming
in the other way,

00:10:26.665 --> 00:10:29.235 align:middle line:84%
the shorter line,
the line this way,

00:10:29.235 --> 00:10:31.170 align:middle line:84%
would come up to the
edge of this circle

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:34.070 align:middle line:84%
and there's another
vesica piscis

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:36.000 align:middle line:84%
that would fit just
inside that circle

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.860 align:middle line:84%
and form another
triangle going this way.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:41.385 align:middle line:84%
And then there would be
another vesica piscis facing up

00:10:41.385 --> 00:10:42.320 align:middle line:90%
going this way.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Then, there would be another
little one going in here.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:45.910 align:middle line:90%
It'll go in and out forever.

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:48.990 align:middle line:84%
It's another one of those
geometric progressions that

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:52.570 align:middle line:90%
has no beginning and no end.

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:57.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all,
what you're looking at

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:03.870 align:middle line:84%
is the geometry behind
the eye-- not just

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:07.105 align:middle line:90%
the human eye, all eyes.

00:11:07.105 --> 00:11:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
was true because first

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.260 align:middle line:84%
from just intuitively--
and this doesn't

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.180 align:middle line:84%
take much intuition
on this level

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.925 align:middle line:90%
because it looks like an eye.

00:11:17.925 --> 00:11:20.360 align:middle line:84%
It's a round ball with
this thing in here

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.755 align:middle line:84%
that looks like an iris and
this whole thing right there.

00:11:23.755 --> 00:11:26.836 align:middle line:84%
The human eye is
really a big round ball

00:11:26.836 --> 00:11:35.042 align:middle line:84%
and has this whole thing in
here looks like an eyeball.

00:11:35.042 --> 00:11:37.820 align:middle line:84%
But there was another reason
why I ever even came up

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:39.960 align:middle line:84%
with the feeling why I
thought it was an eye.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, one day when I
was talking about this,

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:46.480 align:middle line:84%
there was a man named
Malcolm Lillywhite, who

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:50.950 align:middle line:84%
is considered to be the world's
foremost authority on light

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:56.680 align:middle line:84%
and eyes, who came
to my workshop.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.290 align:middle line:84%
This man works
for the government

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:02.680 align:middle line:84%
and he's really,
really brilliant.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.470 align:middle line:84%
When he was-- What
I was told, anyway--

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:07.840 align:middle line:84%
when he was 23 years old
and graduated straight out

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.440 align:middle line:84%
of college, Martin Marietta
gave him $50 million

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:13.096 align:middle line:84%
and 200 scientists and
said, do anything you want.

00:12:13.096 --> 00:12:13.896 align:middle line:90%
>>Jesus.

00:12:13.896 --> 00:12:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>>That's how brilliant he was.

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.013 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we don't
even care what you do.

00:12:17.013 --> 00:12:18.870 align:middle line:90%
Just do something.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:24.712 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things he
did is he researched eyes.

00:12:24.712 --> 00:12:26.670 align:middle line:84%
He was interested in
light and he studied light

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:28.502 align:middle line:90%
and he studied eyes.

00:12:28.502 --> 00:12:32.536 align:middle line:84%
And when he saw this drawing,
he about fell out of his chair

00:12:32.536 --> 00:12:35.250 align:middle line:84%
because this was a secret
drawing for Martin Marietta

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:39.170 align:middle line:84%
that they had arrived at
pragmatically by studying

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:41.730 align:middle line:84%
all the eyes of everything
you can think of,

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:44.600 align:middle line:84%
from bees to flies to humans,
cats, dogs, blah, blah, blah,

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.300 align:middle line:90%
everything else like that.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And just like crystals are all
divided into six categories,

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:54.070 align:middle line:84%
eyes are all divided
into six categories.

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:56.470 align:middle line:84%
Every eye, no matter what
it is out of anything,

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:59.120 align:middle line:84%
will fit into one
of six categories,

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:04.170 align:middle line:84%
just like crystals, six
points of the flower of life.

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And the end result of all this
categorization and everything

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.046 align:middle line:90%
else lined in was that drawing.

00:13:12.046 --> 00:13:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And he almost felt like I
stole it-- couldn't figure out

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:16.930 align:middle line:90%
how I'd gotten it.

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:20.250 align:middle line:90%


00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:23.732 align:middle line:84%
But in just a
moment, you'll see.

00:13:23.732 --> 00:13:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I'm really
wanting someone to do

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:29.600 align:middle line:84%
is to apply that to
iridology because if you take

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.970 align:middle line:84%
that pattern and put it behind
there-- now if you accept

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:35.370 align:middle line:84%
that as-- you might a
little bit more after you

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:36.740 align:middle line:90%
see the next one here.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:40.050 align:middle line:84%
But if you accept that as it is
the structure or the geometry

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:43.110 align:middle line:84%
behind eyes, then you can
apply that to the physical eye

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:45.560 align:middle line:84%
and to the iridology
charts and create

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.980 align:middle line:84%
a much more accurate and
scientific relationship

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.520 align:middle line:84%
behind all of that because
it's such a great way

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:56.090 align:middle line:84%
to see what's going
on inside of someone

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:57.810 align:middle line:90%
without-- it's non-invasive.

00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:58.610 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing.

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:01.180 align:middle line:90%
You can just look and see.

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:05.605 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so there are people
doing this in Florida now.

00:14:05.605 --> 00:14:11.540 align:middle line:84%
Coming back to this again,
if you're in science

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:18.330 align:middle line:84%
and you want to pick up a
particular kind of energy--

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:22.806 align:middle line:84%
say you want to pick
up whatever it is,

00:14:22.806 --> 00:14:27.560 align:middle line:84%
if you want to measure sound
or whatever the thing is-- then

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:33.950 align:middle line:84%
you need to create a receiver
and an eye is a receiver.

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:37.110 align:middle line:84%
So the best way is to
create the receiver

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:43.591 align:middle line:84%
as close to or as possibly close
to that which is being sent.

00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, that
which is being sent

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:49.680 align:middle line:84%
and that which is the receiver
are absolutely identical.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.665 align:middle line:84%
The eye and light are
the same, no difference.

00:14:53.665 --> 00:14:57.790 align:middle line:84%
It's the same structure
that creates both.

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:00.131 align:middle line:90%
And this is what I mean.

00:15:00.131 --> 00:15:02.780 align:middle line:90%
This is a lightwave over here.

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.640 align:middle line:84%
A lightwave is a portion
of something called

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.210 align:middle line:90%
the "electromagnetic spectrum."

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:09.940 align:middle line:84%
It's "electromagnetic,"
meaning that it's electrical

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.020 align:middle line:90%
and magnetic simultaneously.

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:15.180 align:middle line:84%
It has an electrical field
this way and at 90 degrees,

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:16.980 align:middle line:90%
it has a magnetic field.

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:19.320 align:middle line:84%
The electrical field
moves down an axis

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:22.410 align:middle line:84%
like this while at 90
degrees, a magnetic field

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:24.372 align:middle line:90%
moves down like this.

00:15:24.372 --> 00:15:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, the whole
thing rotates by 90 degrees.

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:29.650 align:middle line:90%
So it--

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:31.066 align:middle line:90%
[CLICKING]

00:15:31.066 --> 00:15:32.430 align:middle line:90%
It turns.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:34.714 align:middle line:84%
Just take that thing
and start turning it,

00:15:34.714 --> 00:15:38.376 align:middle line:84%
only it clicks at
90-degree patterns.

00:15:38.376 --> 00:15:41.633 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what's happening here.

00:15:41.633 --> 00:15:45.350 align:middle line:84%
The electrical field
is in proportion

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:49.630 align:middle line:84%
to this golden mean line as the
magnetic field is in proportion

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:50.942 align:middle line:90%
to this one.

00:15:50.942 --> 00:15:53.030 align:middle line:84%
So the electrical
magnetic fields

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:56.890 align:middle line:84%
are actually the axis
of a vesica piscis.

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And they're coming
down this line

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:01.350 align:middle line:84%
and this line and
the whole thing

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:03.670 align:middle line:90%
is clicking out like this.

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:06.560 align:middle line:84%
You understand how those
things are moving at 90 degrees

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.800 align:middle line:84%
or going in, depending
which direction you want

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.269 align:middle line:84%
to see it going away
from you, either focusing

00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:13.310 align:middle line:84%
or coming back up like
this, either coming at you

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:14.110 align:middle line:90%
or away from you.

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:19.732 align:middle line:84%
And they're just doing
this little pattern.

00:16:19.732 --> 00:16:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And so light, the actual
electromagnetic-- and that's

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:26.460 align:middle line:90%
not just light.

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:27.260 align:middle line:90%
That's everything.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:31.250 align:middle line:84%
That's the whole electromagnetic
field is doing that--

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:35.790 align:middle line:84%
and the eye are just
simply very similar.

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:36.590 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:38.630 align:middle line:84%
What is another
receptor of light?

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:41.190 align:middle line:90%
The leaves, right?

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:46.614 align:middle line:84%
Leaves receive light and convert
it and look at this pattern

00:16:46.614 --> 00:16:48.030 align:middle line:84%
up here, one of
the most primitive

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:49.776 align:middle line:90%
of all these patterns.

00:16:49.776 --> 00:16:53.030 align:middle line:84%
Look at that pattern and look
how close it is-- in fact,

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:56.900 align:middle line:84%
it's identical to the
vesica piscis thing

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.170 align:middle line:90%
that's going on inside there.

00:16:58.170 --> 00:16:59.630 align:middle line:90%
Can you see the relationship?

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:00.430 align:middle line:90%
>>Mm-hmm.

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:03.235 align:middle line:90%


00:17:03.235 --> 00:17:06.849 align:middle line:84%
>>It's just simply
duplicating the light.

00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:08.980 align:middle line:90%
It's matching the light pattern.

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:12.190 align:middle line:84%
This is how we were able to
make a device so sensitive

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:16.300 align:middle line:84%
that we could pick a light
field up at 90,000 miles away

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:21.109 align:middle line:84%
is that we created a horn that
was in this geometry, where we

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:23.619 align:middle line:84%
had a golden mean
rectangle this way

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:27.983 align:middle line:84%
and another one facing this
way that captured the light.

00:17:27.983 --> 00:17:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And then it went into
a golden mean chamber

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:35.400 align:middle line:84%
where the light is focused and
four of the Fibonacci places.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.290 align:middle line:84%
We picked one and put
a gold cross at there

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:42.116 align:middle line:84%
in the shape and proportions
of a golden mean ratio.

00:17:42.116 --> 00:17:42.916 align:middle line:90%
This is one.

00:17:42.916 --> 00:17:45.520 align:middle line:84%
It's 0.618-- stuck it in
there and it went through

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.660 align:middle line:84%
underneath there through a gold
crystal, which coheritized it,

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:54.463 align:middle line:84%
and then into a circuit
board that nobody

00:17:54.463 --> 00:17:55.338 align:middle line:90%
knows anything about.

00:17:55.338 --> 00:17:56.970 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:58.070 align:middle line:90%
I can't talk about it.

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:01.405 align:middle line:90%
It's based on the human spine.

00:18:01.405 --> 00:18:06.660 align:middle line:84%
But it was primarily
the shape of the horn,

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:08.710 align:middle line:84%
actually the physical
shape of the instrument

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:10.790 align:middle line:90%
that was able to catch it.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:12.690 align:middle line:84%
Another really good
one, though, we

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:15.510 align:middle line:84%
decided that would
be almost as good is

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:19.560 align:middle line:84%
certain seashells would
be another way to do it

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.870 align:middle line:90%
using the logarithmic spiral.

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:22.140 align:middle line:90%
They're great receptors.

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.210 align:middle line:90%
They're perfect.

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And so anyway,
this next one, you

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:35.010 align:middle line:84%
were looking at Dan
Winter's work over here.

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And I started talking to
you about this before.

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:41.916 align:middle line:84%
I'll finally get to answer
your question on it.

00:18:41.916 --> 00:18:43.540 align:middle line:84%
One day when Dan
Winter was out there--

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.831 align:middle line:84%
I think it was the second
time that we were hanging out

00:18:45.831 --> 00:18:52.960 align:middle line:84%
together-- he said he had just
finished all this level of work

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:58.440 align:middle line:84%
with the thing with
emotions and with shape

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.127 align:middle line:90%
and all of this kind of thing.

00:19:00.127 --> 00:19:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And he had gone beyond just
coming with the shape of it.

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:05.920 align:middle line:84%
He had figured out the
sacred geometry pattern that

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.410 align:middle line:84%
was behind the
whole thing and he

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:08.650 align:middle line:90%
wanted to share that with me.

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:10.900 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, I had just
been completing this thing

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.310 align:middle line:90%
with light.

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:14.324 align:middle line:84%
And so I explained
all this to him

00:19:14.324 --> 00:19:16.740 align:middle line:84%
and he goes, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, OK.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.906 align:middle line:84%
And then he showed me the
whole thing about emotions

00:19:18.906 --> 00:19:20.470 align:middle line:84%
and I go, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:22.261 align:middle line:84%
And then we're both
real quiet for a moment

00:19:22.261 --> 00:19:24.630 align:middle line:84%
because this was the
pattern that he had

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:29.915 align:middle line:84%
for the emotions,
which is the same one.

00:19:29.915 --> 00:19:34.150 align:middle line:84%
It's the same, only he only had
just the logarithmic spirals

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:37.880 align:middle line:90%
coming out like this, you see?

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.640 align:middle line:90%
But look what's inside of here.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.070 align:middle line:90%
They're just vesica piscis.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:44.206 align:middle line:84%
It's the same hidden
pattern underneath it.

00:19:44.206 --> 00:19:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment, we realized
that the emotions are directly

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:51.120 align:middle line:90%
connected to light.

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.186 align:middle line:90%
It's the same pattern.

00:19:52.186 --> 00:19:55.380 align:middle line:90%


00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:59.810 align:middle line:84%
So the emotions and light
and eyes and also thoughts,

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:02.500 align:middle line:84%
which we haven't got into-- the
memory patterns and everything

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:05.420 align:middle line:84%
else are also tied into there--
it's all the same thing.

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:11.790 align:middle line:84%
It's all come from the
same structural patterns.

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:13.986 align:middle line:90%
And it's pretty exciting.

00:20:13.986 --> 00:20:19.210 align:middle line:90%


00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:22.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm only interested in
just getting your brains

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:27.090 align:middle line:84%
to kind of go, oh, like
this so this thing will

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:32.394 align:middle line:84%
go back and forth so that
you'll see the unity of life

00:20:32.394 --> 00:20:34.810 align:middle line:84%
and you'll be interested enough
into doing the meditations

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:36.810 align:middle line:84%
because I only really
want you doing meditation.

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Dan is really interested
in actually solving-- he's

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:41.650 align:middle line:90%
taking the-- he wants to do it.

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:44.560 align:middle line:84%
He wants to go all the way and
tie the whole thing together

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:47.050 align:middle line:84%
on every single
level imaginable.

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:48.030 align:middle line:90%
And it's great.

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:50.480 align:middle line:84%
I have no problem
with that at all.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:53.290 align:middle line:84%
I want him to do
that but I'm not

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:55.070 align:middle line:84%
really interested in
going to that level.

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:56.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm only interested
in taking someone

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:59.310 align:middle line:84%
far enough where
they can clearly

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:05.400 align:middle line:84%
see that there is only
one god and that they'll

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.870 align:middle line:90%
proceed further from there.

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:11.970 align:middle line:84%
This is the thing with
Manfred Clynes's work,

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:17.460 align:middle line:84%
working totally
separately from Dan Winter

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:20.670 align:middle line:84%
and found that emotions
have shape that you can see

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:23.160 align:middle line:84%
and you can reproduce
and basically came up

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.230 align:middle line:84%
with the shapes behind
them and everything.

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:28.961 align:middle line:84%
I don't think Manfred Clynes,
at least while he had written

00:21:28.961 --> 00:21:31.210 align:middle line:84%
this thing, had come to the
level where Dan Winter had

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:33.960 align:middle line:84%
arrived at because he found
the basic pattern even

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.826 align:middle line:90%
behind the shapes.

00:21:35.826 --> 00:21:39.470 align:middle line:10%
But it's just to show you that
other people are also thinking

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:43.270 align:middle line:10%
along those same kind of lines.

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:44.822 align:middle line:10%
Do you remember this?

00:21:44.822 --> 00:21:45.750 align:middle line:10%
>>Uh-huh.

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:46.550 align:middle line:10%
>>To be.

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:47.420 align:middle line:10%
>>Uh-huh.

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:50.020 align:middle line:10%
>>The saying was "to
be or not to be?"

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.340 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:59.250 align:middle line:90%


00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:00.070 align:middle line:10%
Look at this.

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:08.390 align:middle line:10%
If you take a piano and
you take the white keys

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:11.750 align:middle line:10%
and call them "female" and
you take the black keys

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:16.420 align:middle line:10%
and call them "male," look
what happens on a piano.

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:17.506 align:middle line:10%
Wait a minute.

00:22:17.506 --> 00:22:19.515 align:middle line:10%
This is just laid
right across here.

00:22:19.515 --> 00:22:24.980 align:middle line:10%
Here's C, female, C-sharp, male,
D, female, D-sharp, male, E,

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:27.570 align:middle line:10%
female, and there's no E-sharp.

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:29.940 align:middle line:10%
You go straight to here and
you have another female.

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:36.505 align:middle line:10%
It fits perfectly onto the
organic structure of the bees.

00:22:36.505 --> 00:22:39.511 align:middle line:84%
And then not only-- and
that's got 13 notes in it.

00:22:39.511 --> 00:22:41.760 align:middle line:84%
Then, you take the white
keys out and you've got eight

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.718 align:middle line:84%
and take the black keys
out and you've got five

00:22:43.718 --> 00:22:48.164 align:middle line:84%
and you see the Fibonacci
series reversing itself.

00:22:48.164 --> 00:22:52.170 align:middle line:10%
And you begin to see this
exact key and connection

00:22:52.170 --> 00:23:00.944 align:middle line:10%
between the harmonics of
music and organic structure,

00:23:00.944 --> 00:23:04.080 align:middle line:10%
that there is a relationship
between organic structure

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.462 align:middle line:10%
and music.

00:23:05.462 --> 00:23:09.490 align:middle line:90%
And it's even deeper than that.

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:10.630 align:middle line:90%
This is the human spine.

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:13.766 align:middle line:90%


00:23:13.766 --> 00:23:16.380 align:middle line:84%
Superficially, if you
look at the human spine,

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:22.500 align:middle line:84%
there are 24 vertebrae and
there are three primary balance

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:29.150 align:middle line:84%
points in the vertebrae, the
lower balance, the middle,

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:31.400 align:middle line:90%
and the upper balance.

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:36.462 align:middle line:84%
And the lower balance is located
in between the first eight

00:23:36.462 --> 00:23:40.505 align:middle line:84%
vertebrae, this is in between
the next eight vertebrae,

00:23:40.505 --> 00:23:42.920 align:middle line:84%
and this is in the middle
of the next eight vertebrae.

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.215 align:middle line:90%
All these are octaves.

00:23:44.215 --> 00:23:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And this one, the middle
one is in between two 12s

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.430 align:middle line:90%
or two chromatic ones.

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:52.495 align:middle line:84%
But that's a real kind
of superficial way.

00:23:52.495 --> 00:23:56.470 align:middle line:84%
The Rosicrucians
really tied it down.

00:23:56.470 --> 00:24:01.682 align:middle line:84%
They found that if you take the
vertebrae and you weigh them--

00:24:01.682 --> 00:24:06.050 align:middle line:84%
you weigh each vertebra--
that the differences

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:10.022 align:middle line:84%
between the weights
of each vertebra

00:24:10.022 --> 00:24:13.742 align:middle line:84%
correspond exactly between
the cycles per second

00:24:13.742 --> 00:24:19.740 align:middle line:84%
in the harmonics of
music, again showing you

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:22.830 align:middle line:84%
that the harmonics of
sound and organic structure

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:25.420 align:middle line:90%
are interrelated.

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:28.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, this indicates that
whatever the sacred form is

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:33.810 align:middle line:84%
in organic structure must also
be the same one in harmonics

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:34.753 align:middle line:90%
of music.

00:24:34.753 --> 00:24:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And when we get
to it, you'll see

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:39.190 align:middle line:84%
that this is the key
to organic structure

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:42.060 align:middle line:84%
and it's also the key to
the harmonics of music,

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:45.640 align:middle line:84%
That as least in
terms of the octave.

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.730 align:middle line:84%
Other people have tied
that down not only to sound

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:53.182 align:middle line:84%
but to light and zodiacal
structures or constellations.

00:24:53.182 --> 00:24:54.658 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:24:54.658 --> 00:24:55.459 align:middle line:90%
>>Who?

00:24:55.459 --> 00:24:56.258 align:middle line:90%
>>Theo.

00:24:56.258 --> 00:24:57.118 align:middle line:90%
>>Theo Gimbel.

00:24:57.118 --> 00:24:58.070 align:middle line:90%
>>Theo Gimbel.

00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.870 align:middle line:90%
>>Uh-huh.

00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>>OK, good.

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:01.058 align:middle line:90%
What's the name of the book?

00:25:01.058 --> 00:25:03.686 align:middle line:84%
>>I believe it's
"Healing Through Color."

00:25:03.686 --> 00:25:06.403 align:middle line:84%
>>"Healing Through
Color"-- Theo Gimbel--

00:25:06.403 --> 00:25:08.295 align:middle line:90%
>>So I'm seeing the picture.

00:25:08.295 --> 00:25:11.970 align:middle line:84%
>>He has also come up with
this idea of sound and music

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:14.960 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know if he came
up with it as precisely

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.174 align:middle line:90%
as the Rosicrucians did or not.

00:25:17.174 --> 00:25:18.450 align:middle line:90%
I kind of doubt it.

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:24.230 align:middle line:84%
The Rosicrucians are real--
they really go for it, usually.

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:25.505 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:25.505 --> 00:25:30.750 align:middle line:84%
Could we put the
waveform tape on now?

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:32.230 align:middle line:10%
This tape that
we're about to play

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:38.022 align:middle line:10%
is with Tom Kenyon's work
with acoustic brain research.

00:25:38.022 --> 00:25:39.480 align:middle line:10%
This is only one
thing that he does

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.896 align:middle line:10%
and he does a lot
of other things.

00:25:40.896 --> 00:25:43.980 align:middle line:10%
I've been to his workshops and
he's doing some real good work.

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:47.240 align:middle line:84%
This is actually one
of his older things.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:51.720 align:middle line:84%
It's called "The Circle of
Fifths." "Circle of fifths"

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:55.700 align:middle line:84%
means like this is C and
you go, C, D, E, F, G and so

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:59.430 align:middle line:84%
the next one's G. And
if you keep going,

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:03.280 align:middle line:84%
each chord is separated
by five notes.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And then inside here
is another circle

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:07.205 align:middle line:84%
of fifths that's
separated by thirds.

00:26:07.205 --> 00:26:12.990 align:middle line:84%
This is A, B, C
over here, E, F, G.

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And so you've got actually two
circles of fifths rotating,

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.736 align:middle line:90%
separated by thirds.

00:26:18.736 --> 00:26:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about this
when you hear this, a couple

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:25.150 align:middle line:84%
things-- if you notice,
there's a place where

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:26.290 align:middle line:90%
the music would go around.

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And when it gets into this area,
you'll hear it kind of flutter

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:34.350 align:middle line:84%
and then it's take off again
because these circular notes

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:37.780 align:middle line:84%
of both sound and light
and all the aspects

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:41.580 align:middle line:84%
of electromagnetic fields,
no matter what they are,

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:43.640 align:middle line:84%
do not overlap into
perfect circles.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:47.461 align:middle line:84%
Instead, they are
parts of a spring.

00:26:47.461 --> 00:26:50.310 align:middle line:84%
In other words, like
the colors of red,

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:52.357 align:middle line:84%
orange, yellow,
blue, green, purple,

00:26:52.357 --> 00:26:54.440 align:middle line:84%
by the time you get to
red, it's a long wavelength

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:56.606 align:middle line:84%
and by the time you get to
purple, it's a short one.

00:26:56.606 --> 00:26:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And purple doesn't
come back again to red.

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:00.530 align:middle line:90%
It goes into infraviolet.

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:02.690 align:middle line:90%
It goes into another one.

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:04.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's really a spring
and sound is similar.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:07.410 align:middle line:90%


00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:09.069 align:middle line:90%
So let's just hear it.

00:27:09.069 --> 00:27:10.610 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
about it is that this

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:13.060 align:middle line:84%
tends to affect your
heart like crazy.

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:15.079 align:middle line:90%
It tends to open your heart up.

00:27:15.079 --> 00:27:16.120 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm going to like that.

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.835 align:middle line:84%
>>And if you put earphones
on when you're hearing this,

00:27:18.835 --> 00:27:20.350 align:middle line:90%
it has its greatest effect.

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:20.850 align:middle line:84%
[MUSIC - TOM KENYON, "THE CIRCLE
 OF FIFTHS"]

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:22.462 align:middle line:90%
So turn it up pretty loud.

00:27:22.462 --> 00:31:03.478 align:middle line:90%


00:31:03.478 --> 00:31:06.315 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:31:06.315 --> 00:31:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Kind of easy to just
sort of drift away

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:12.630 align:middle line:84%
on that one for a long time but
if you do that with earphones

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:14.272 align:middle line:84%
and stay in it for
about 20 minutes,

00:31:14.272 --> 00:31:16.885 align:middle line:84%
pretty soon, you
just get real soft.

00:31:16.885 --> 00:31:24.720 align:middle line:90%


00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:28.051 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of science
behind a simple thing.

00:31:28.051 --> 00:31:30.697 align:middle line:90%


00:31:30.697 --> 00:31:38.060 align:middle line:84%

inside of your head,

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:45.480 align:middle line:84%
where he puts the sound
inside and moves it around

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:47.640 align:middle line:90%
in certain areas in your brain.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:51.106 align:middle line:90%
This is Alex Grey's drawing.

00:31:51.106 --> 00:31:55.285 align:middle line:84%
You might recognize
it for some of you.

00:31:55.285 --> 00:31:57.190 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to
quickly show you

00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:59.674 align:middle line:90%
the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:31:59.674 --> 00:32:01.590 align:middle line:84%
Some people have never
really thought about it

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:04.670 align:middle line:84%
before but it is the whole
spectrum just about of what

00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:05.535 align:middle line:90%
we live in.

00:32:05.535 --> 00:32:10.170 align:middle line:84%
It's the primary field of
energy that we exist in.

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And the only difference
between this whole field

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:15.860 align:middle line:90%
is simply wavelength.

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:19.870 align:middle line:84%
How long or short the
wavelength completely changes

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:22.970 align:middle line:90%
the nature of the same energy.

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:26.560 align:middle line:84%
It's the same stuff
and all of this

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.450 align:middle line:84%
is the same one based
on that one image,

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:32.000 align:middle line:84%
that one sacred geometry
image based upon the vesica

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.500 align:middle line:90%
piscis, which is light.

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.922 align:middle line:84%
Just to show you, the
longest wavelengths known

00:32:38.922 --> 00:32:41.070 align:middle line:90%
are the human brain.

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:43.050 align:middle line:84%
They're 10 to the
10th meter long

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:46.900 align:middle line:84%
so they're almost straight
lines coming out of the head.

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:49.400 align:middle line:84%
They're really really,
really long ones

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:51.642 align:middle line:84%
and they run all the way
down to 10 to the eighth.

00:32:51.642 --> 00:32:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And then around 10 to
the seventh meters,

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:57.036 align:middle line:84%
you get power lines, these
big huge power lines.

00:32:57.036 --> 00:33:00.600 align:middle line:84%
This is why power
lines are so heavy-duty

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:03.770 align:middle line:84%
because their wavelength and
human brain wavelengths are

00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:07.030 align:middle line:90%
almost the same.

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
voice frequencies,

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:11.660 align:middle line:84%
like what I'm talking to
you right now at about 10

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:12.839 align:middle line:90%
to the sixth meters.

00:33:12.839 --> 00:33:14.630 align:middle line:84%
Going down to about 10
to the fifth meters,

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:16.463 align:middle line:84%
you have audio and
telephone and these kinds

00:33:16.463 --> 00:33:19.300 align:middle line:84%
of things that are moving
along electric wires.

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And then you have your radio
and television in here,

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:23.260 align:middle line:84%
your 10 to the
fourth meters, which

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:25.650 align:middle line:84%
are low frequency, medium
frequency, high frequency,

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:32.548 align:middle line:84%
and very high frequency
and ultra high frequency.

00:33:32.548 --> 00:33:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And there, we're going from
10 to the fourth meters

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:47.130 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to 10 meters--
actually, down to one meter

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:48.630 align:middle line:90%
even.

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And then those radio
and television waves

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:54.755 align:middle line:84%
start turning into microwaves,
super high frequency

00:33:54.755 --> 00:33:57.560 align:middle line:84%
and extremely high
frequency sub-millimeter

00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:00.520 align:middle line:84%
waves going from 10 to
the minus one down to 10

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:01.530 align:middle line:90%
to the minus three.

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And then that, the microwaves,
turns into infrared or heat

00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:11.954 align:middle line:84%
and then your heat is
just infrared heat.

00:34:11.954 --> 00:34:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And so first, you
have the far infrared

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:17.460 align:middle line:84%
and then moving into
the near infrared.

00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And then the infrared
turns into the color red.

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:25.330 align:middle line:84%
Red, orange, yellow, green, blue
purple turns into ultraviolet.

00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:27.969 align:middle line:84%
And then you have your
ultraviolet lights

00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:31.920 align:middle line:84%
going from A, B, and C, going
from 10 to the minus seven

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:34.659 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to 10 to
the minus eight meters, which

00:34:34.659 --> 00:34:37.100 align:middle line:84%
slowly turns into
your-- and this

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:39.770 align:middle line:84%
is a real-- there is not
immediate lines like that.

00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:46.969 align:middle line:84%
This is a spectrum, kind of--
it turns into your soft X-rays,

00:34:46.969 --> 00:34:48.650 align:middle line:84%
which don't really
penetrate very well

00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:51.860 align:middle line:84%
and then finally gets into hard
X-rays, which would go right

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:55.449 align:middle line:84%
through things and which get
smaller, 10 to the minus 11th.

00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And then around 10
to the minus 12th,

00:34:57.010 --> 00:34:59.900 align:middle line:84%
they get into your gamma
rays and nuclear rays,

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:02.440 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to
10 to the minus 15th.

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:04.825 align:middle line:84%
And then from there all the
way to 10 to the minus 18th,

00:35:04.825 --> 00:35:07.612 align:middle line:90%
you have your cosmic rays.

00:35:07.612 --> 00:35:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And all of these things are
just-- the only difference

00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:11.830 align:middle line:84%
is just your wavelength
and they're all

00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:13.760 align:middle line:84%
based on the same
geometrical principles.

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.000 align:middle line:90%
And it's the same thing.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.680 align:middle line:90%
Each one is a loop.

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:19.715 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're talking about
brain waves or microwaves,

00:35:19.715 --> 00:35:21.560 align:middle line:84%
they're all a loop
and they're all just

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:24.780 align:middle line:84%
continuing around--
connect from one thing,

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:26.620 align:middle line:90%
becoming the next thing.

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:29.040 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm having difficulty
with understanding

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:32.480 align:middle line:84%
some of the definitions
that you-- I'm not

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.920 align:middle line:90%
getting the definitions.

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>>How can I help?

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:38.470 align:middle line:84%

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:41.370 align:middle line:84%
these are not clearly
delineated in relationship

00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:45.180 align:middle line:84%
to the kinds of things
that I already know.

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:51.924 align:middle line:90%


00:35:51.924 --> 00:35:58.226 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, these grids that
we're talking about,

00:35:58.226 --> 00:35:59.730 align:middle line:90%
they're kind of like this.

00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:01.340 align:middle line:90%
They're energy lines and fields.

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:03.463 align:middle line:84%
They extend in the Earth
and around the Earth

00:36:03.463 --> 00:36:12.700 align:middle line:84%
and they're the geometries
that hold the structure.

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:17.350 align:middle line:84%
It's like the grids that
create the gridlines

00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:18.980 align:middle line:84%
that the atoms
just automatically

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:21.250 align:middle line:90%
move into to form the crystal.

00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:24.180 align:middle line:84%
There are these grids that
move through this one that

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:25.645 align:middle line:90%
form that pattern.

00:36:25.645 --> 00:36:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And this has this huge
field that goes around this.

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:31.320 align:middle line:84%
This field probably stretches
out to where you are.

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.330 align:middle line:84%
It's over there and
it's a real field.

00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:35.080 align:middle line:84%
If you have a
sensitive-enough instrument,

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:38.230 align:middle line:84%
you can pick it up and
see it and feel it.

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:40.900 align:middle line:84%
It's a real part
of the whole thing.

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:42.900 align:middle line:84%
The body, the distance--
there's always

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:44.830 align:middle line:84%
the little seed, the
core that's in the middle

00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:47.102 align:middle line:90%
of this huge big field.

00:36:47.102 --> 00:36:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And all I'm talking about
is that with each level

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:53.320 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, there are
these grids that are associated

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.290 align:middle line:90%
with it up to a certain level.

00:36:55.290 --> 00:36:56.090 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not sure.

00:36:56.090 --> 00:36:59.375 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's about
the fifth dimension when

00:36:59.375 --> 00:37:01.920 align:middle line:90%
we transcend all of that.

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:04.580 align:middle line:84%
But as long as we're down
here in this denseness aspect

00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:10.630 align:middle line:84%
of things, we are concerned with
bodies or shapes or patterns.

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And so if this was
the Earth, it has

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:18.480 align:middle line:84%
these-- I'll have to
make a bigger Earth.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.130 align:middle line:90%
That Earth was too little.

00:37:21.130 --> 00:37:27.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to draw
this hexagonal field.

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:31.340 align:middle line:84%
If this was a cubical field,
though I've not drawn out,

00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:35.480 align:middle line:84%
it's like this energy field
that has the Earth inside of it.

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:41.520 align:middle line:84%
I wish we could look at
Richard Hoagland's work

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.536 align:middle line:84%
and you'd have a much
better understanding,

00:37:43.536 --> 00:37:45.160 align:middle line:84%
especially with what
science has found.

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:46.120 align:middle line:90%
These are real things.

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:50.480 align:middle line:84%
They're not just in
somebody's minds or something.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:51.280 align:middle line:90%
You can test them.

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:53.860 align:middle line:84%
The United Nations--
everybody's being aware of these

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:55.442 align:middle line:90%
now at this point.

00:37:55.442 --> 00:37:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, our
governments were

00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:59.670 align:middle line:84%
aware of our energy,
our grid field,

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:01.440 align:middle line:84%
for this particular
consciousness

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:04.915 align:middle line:90%
as far back as around 1950.

00:38:04.915 --> 00:38:09.705 align:middle line:84%
And if you ever-- in fact, I
know people who have done this.

00:38:09.705 --> 00:38:13.500 align:middle line:84%
If you lay out the grid pattern
of our level of consciousness,

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.780 align:middle line:84%
which is based on
triangles and squares

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:19.720 align:middle line:84%
rather than pentagons, which
is the Christ consciousness,

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:22.010 align:middle line:84%
one that's based on--
if you lay them out

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:24.890 align:middle line:84%
over a globe or a
flat pattern, just

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:26.485 align:middle line:84%
lay out a double
pattern of the Earth

00:38:26.485 --> 00:38:29.240 align:middle line:84%
and lay the grid
out over that, look

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:33.480 align:middle line:84%
to see where all the military
installations are-- bingo,

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.670 align:middle line:84%
right on the nodal
points of all the grids

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:38.200 align:middle line:84%
or right on the spirals
that come off of them, all

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.270 align:middle line:90%
over the whole thing.

00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:41.979 align:middle line:84%
They've got these
military installations out

00:38:41.979 --> 00:38:43.020 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of nowhere.

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:44.974 align:middle line:84%
They're not just out in
the middle of nowhere.

00:38:44.974 --> 00:38:46.640 align:middle line:84%
They're placed there
right on the grids.

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And what we've been having
is this internal war

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:50.880 align:middle line:84%
between Russia and
the United States

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:53.460 align:middle line:84%
to try to control the grid
because whoever controls

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:55.470 align:middle line:84%
the grid controls
the planet, controls

00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:56.755 align:middle line:90%
the thinking of the planet.

00:38:56.755 --> 00:38:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And we're still doing
the mind control and all

00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:00.331 align:middle line:84%
of this kind of
stuff that's going on

00:39:00.331 --> 00:39:03.300 align:middle line:84%
and the grid is the
key behind all of this.

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And they're now aware of the
Christ consciousness grid,

00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:14.205 align:middle line:84%
even, though-- and we're
talking about the very, very--

00:39:14.205 --> 00:39:15.450 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Very, very lowest
levels of all of this.

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:20.280 align:middle line:90%
It's a much finer level.

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:21.830 align:middle line:90%
It's a much higher-level grid.

00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:25.440 align:middle line:90%
It's much harder to detect.

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:30.980 align:middle line:84%
But he was showing it
right there on the TV.

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:34.695 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't know
how to explain this.

00:39:34.695 --> 00:39:36.690 align:middle line:84%
I realize that there's
universal mind.

00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:39.855 align:middle line:84%
I understand that, that
there is one spirit that

00:39:39.855 --> 00:39:41.740 align:middle line:84%
moves through
everything, but there

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:46.000 align:middle line:84%
are levels of consciousness
that move out through there.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Just as there are in your human
body, you can just look down

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:53.540 align:middle line:84%
and you can go into an
atom and from an atom up

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:58.340 align:middle line:84%
to the molecular structure and
from there into a single cell

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.800 align:middle line:84%
and from there to
a tissue and from--

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:03.530 align:middle line:84%
and each one of these are
consciousness levels, awareness

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:07.070 align:middle line:84%
levels and from there up
to a whole bone structure

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:10.100 align:middle line:84%
or to organs and
to one whole body.

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And then from one, then you
jump from there to two people,

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:17.620 align:middle line:84%
to families, to
social structures

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:19.390 align:middle line:90%
out farther and farther around.

00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:23.710 align:middle line:84%
All these different levels
of consciousness continue on.

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:25.955 align:middle line:90%
They keep on going out in space.

00:40:25.955 --> 00:40:27.670 align:middle line:84%
They keep going
and going and going

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:31.920 align:middle line:84%
and they're all-- so when
you go up in consciousness,

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:36.340 align:middle line:84%
eventually you keep joining with
larger and larger bodies that

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:37.776 align:middle line:90%
extend out.

00:40:37.776 --> 00:40:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And even if the thing doesn't
have bodies-- a lot of them

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:44.710 align:middle line:84%
don't have any physical
structure whatsoever

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:47.670 align:middle line:84%
but you keep joining
with these larger

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:51.610 align:middle line:90%
interpretations of the reality.

00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:55.915 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, you come to I
guess what you some people

00:40:55.915 --> 00:40:57.090 align:middle line:90%
would call "God."

00:40:57.090 --> 00:40:59.340 align:middle line:84%
Some people would
not call that "God."

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:00.205 align:middle line:90%
It depends.

00:41:00.205 --> 00:41:02.080 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has a different
definition of "God"

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:05.310 align:middle line:84%
and it's really hard to explain
or to agree on that one.

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:13.210 align:middle line:90%


00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
I see out there.

00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:20.072 align:middle line:90%


00:41:20.072 --> 00:41:24.480 align:middle line:84%
I do know you eventually
get to this one place

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:27.090 align:middle line:84%
that there is
nowhere else to go.

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:28.426 align:middle line:90%
There is an ultimate.

00:41:28.426 --> 00:41:32.430 align:middle line:84%
There's an ultimate end,
as long as you're still

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:35.835 align:middle line:84%
confined within this
waveform universe

00:41:35.835 --> 00:41:37.890 align:middle line:84%
and where you either
leave and go beyond it

00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:40.470 align:middle line:90%
or you stay within it.

00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And at which point,
what usually happens

00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:45.590 align:middle line:84%
is you start going
back down the other way

00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:49.500 align:middle line:84%
and there's actually this
cycling motion of as many

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:52.012 align:middle line:90%
going down as there is going up.

00:41:52.012 --> 00:41:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And so to me, I don't
have a problem with this

00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:03.430 align:middle line:84%
but I wish I could understand
where you do have the problem.

00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:04.840 align:middle line:90%
>>There is no problem.

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>>It's trying to
distinguish what you're

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:09.540 align:middle line:84%
saying by "first level
of consciousness,"

00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:12.490 align:middle line:84%
"second level of consciousness,"
"third level of consciousness."

00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:14.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you've gone
beyond the second level

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:17.570 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness in
relationship to being--

00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:19.120 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, see, all--

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:21.170 align:middle line:90%
>>This is what I--

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>>The first level is the
first time consciousness

00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:27.660 align:middle line:90%
becomes self-aware.

00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:29.750 align:middle line:84%
Below that, it's lower
dimensional levels

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:32.322 align:middle line:90%
and it's non-human.

00:42:32.322 --> 00:42:34.600 align:middle line:84%
The first time it
becomes self-aware,

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:37.330 align:middle line:84%
it has 42 plus two
chromosomes and that's

00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:39.012 align:middle line:90%
the Aboriginals in Australia.

00:42:39.012 --> 00:42:39.970 align:middle line:90%
They're the only main--

00:42:39.970 --> 00:42:42.730 align:middle line:84%
>>Oh, so that's what
you mean by the levels.

00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>>Yes, we all might look
human but when they look out

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.710 align:middle line:84%
the eyes, they don't see what
you see-- not even close, not

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:53.670 align:middle line:90%
even similar to what you see.

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:57.430 align:middle line:84%
They see a whole different
world, so different

00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:59.296 align:middle line:84%
that you can't
even talk about it.

00:42:59.296 --> 00:43:02.610 align:middle line:84%
They've got a different
viewpoint, a totally different

00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:03.960 align:middle line:90%
interpretation.

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:07.121 align:middle line:84%
If you hold a photograph
up to an Aboriginal,

00:43:07.121 --> 00:43:08.620 align:middle line:84%
you look at a
photograph of a sunset

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:10.410 align:middle line:84%
and you can look in
there and see it.

00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:12.110 align:middle line:90%
They don't see anything there.

00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:14.760 align:middle line:84%
All they see is just
colors on a page.

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Their mind can't interpret
things like that.

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.606 align:middle line:90%
They have a whole different way.

00:43:19.606 --> 00:43:22.937 align:middle line:84%
You look at a tree and you
see a green tree there and all

00:43:22.937 --> 00:43:25.270 align:middle line:84%
that stuff and you think this
Aboriginal standing here's

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:27.060 align:middle line:90%
seeing the same thing.

00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:28.215 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't see that.

00:43:28.215 --> 00:43:31.450 align:middle line:84%
He sees something
totally different.

00:43:31.450 --> 00:43:33.950 align:middle line:84%
But you say, that's a tree and
he says, yeah, that's a tree.

00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:35.300 align:middle line:84%
But you're not looking
at the same thing.

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:37.480 align:middle line:84%
You're not interpreting
the tree in the same way.

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:40.510 align:middle line:84%
He's a different
kind of human being.

00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And when we get those two
more chromosomes like that,

00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:44.940 align:middle line:84%
we are really, really
different, too,

00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:48.680 align:middle line:84%
because he doesn't see
himself as an individual.

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:52.320 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't even know
what that means.

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:55.950 align:middle line:84%
He sees the outside
the same as the inside.

00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:57.990 align:middle line:90%
He only sees unity.

00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:59.190 align:middle line:90%
That's all he sees.

00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:05.490 align:middle line:84%
If you go over and kill a tree,
you just killed a part of him.

00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:07.020 align:middle line:90%
But we don't see that.

00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:09.730 align:middle line:84%
We think that we
are separate so we

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:12.031 align:middle line:84%
have a different
interpretation of the reality.

00:44:12.031 --> 00:44:13.530 align:middle line:84%
We think we're
inside of here and we

00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:16.445 align:middle line:90%
can get away with anything.

00:44:16.445 --> 00:44:18.850 align:middle line:84%
But when we go back to
Christ consciousness again,

00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:22.320 align:middle line:84%
it's another unity one, at
least in the initial stages

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:24.840 align:middle line:84%
there, where there is
no inside and outside

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:28.780 align:middle line:84%
but it's far more expanded
than the Aboriginal.

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:31.590 align:middle line:84%
The Aboriginal is
pretty much Earth-bound.

00:44:31.590 --> 00:44:35.465 align:middle line:84%
Christ consciousness to
me is not Earth-bound.

00:44:35.465 --> 00:44:39.150 align:middle line:84%
It stretches throughout
all time and space.

00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:43.350 align:middle line:90%
The body of Christ is big.

00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:52.040 align:middle line:84%
It goes everywhere and the
experience of that cannot be--

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:55.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't see how you could
really put it into words.

00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:56.380 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond words.

00:44:56.380 --> 00:45:00.295 align:middle line:90%
It's real different.

00:45:00.295 --> 00:45:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And the one that goes to
the next one above that

00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:05.830 align:middle line:84%
is another disharmonic
consciousness like the one

00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:07.240 align:middle line:90%
that we're in.

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:10.315 align:middle line:84%
If you see all the
geometry laid out there,

00:45:10.315 --> 00:45:11.940 align:middle line:84%
you'll see that there
are five squares.

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:15.110 align:middle line:84%
There's one and a triangle and
a square, then another diamond

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:17.240 align:middle line:90%
and another square.

00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And it leads into
the final phase,

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:25.110 align:middle line:84%
where we end up being 55-foot
beings with an interpretation

00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:26.970 align:middle line:84%
of the reality that
stretches through all

00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:29.206 align:middle line:90%
the dimensional levels.

00:45:29.206 --> 00:45:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And exactly what is
beyond that I don't know.

00:45:32.310 --> 00:45:35.986 align:middle line:84%
I don't know exactly
where that leads to.

00:45:35.986 --> 00:45:41.520 align:middle line:84%
I can't-- it's something I
don't quite understand yet.

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm trying to--

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:43.590 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:45.877 align:middle line:90%


00:45:45.877 --> 00:45:47.470 align:middle line:84%
>>But we only have
three of the grids

00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:52.880 align:middle line:84%
there because we're not ready to
deal with those higher levels.

00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>>Is it done?

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:54.720 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not.

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:56.490 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:45:56.490 --> 00:45:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>>Regarding the
Aborigines, because they

00:45:59.610 --> 00:46:02.550 align:middle line:84%
don't have the awareness
of what's going on

00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:06.831 align:middle line:84%
or they're completely
separated from what we know,

00:46:06.831 --> 00:46:10.590 align:middle line:84%
they are not affected by that
grid of mass consciousness.

00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:13.400 align:middle line:84%
So they're living
a happy life yet

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:16.470 align:middle line:84%
they're lacking
certain awarenesses

00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:18.230 align:middle line:90%
that we're gaining now.

00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:19.720 align:middle line:90%
In other words--

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>>They have a
different life, yes.

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:26.180 align:middle line:84%
If for some reason, the
governments have decided to

00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:32.080 align:middle line:84%
or figured out somehow
to stop the middle grid,

00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:36.903 align:middle line:84%
every person in the world would
die but not the Aboriginals.

00:46:36.903 --> 00:46:39.000 align:middle line:90%
They'd just keep right on going.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.365 align:middle line:84%
>>Because they're
not-- [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:41.365 --> 00:46:43.184 align:middle line:84%
Because they're not
linked up with it.

00:46:43.184 --> 00:46:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>>But you've got to
keep it right close.

00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>>OK, they're not
linked with it.

00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:47.910 align:middle line:90%
They're separated from it.

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:49.076 align:middle line:90%
>>They're separated from it.

00:46:49.076 --> 00:46:51.200 align:middle line:84%
>>But now that we're
becomingly linked with it,

00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:53.910 align:middle line:84%
we have an understanding of
it, that whole grid that's

00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:57.190 align:middle line:84%
around the Earth, we
can be the effect of it

00:46:57.190 --> 00:47:01.670 align:middle line:84%
very easily if we don't
really watch our own emotions

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:04.340 align:middle line:84%
and thought forms
because what we put out

00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:06.270 align:middle line:90%
is going into that grid.

00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the mass
consciousness is doing.

00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:09.320 align:middle line:90%
They're getting caught up in it.

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:11.028 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, what we put
out is going directly

00:47:11.028 --> 00:47:13.750 align:middle line:84%
into that particular grid
but they're all interlaced.

00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what
all the connections--

00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:21.200 align:middle line:84%
>>To get above it, though,
in order to transcend it,

00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:23.850 align:middle line:84%
getting into the Merkaba
and the breathing

00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:27.145 align:middle line:84%
and surrounding ourselves in
that bubble and that shift,

00:47:27.145 --> 00:47:30.540 align:middle line:84%
isn't that separating
ourselves from the influences

00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:32.950 align:middle line:84%
of that grid so that
we can rise above it?

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:35.100 align:middle line:84%
>>What the Merkaba
will do, it will slowly

00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:38.259 align:middle line:84%
separate you from that
grid and reconnect you

00:47:38.259 --> 00:47:40.550 align:middle line:84%
with the other one, with the
Christ consciousness norm.

00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:41.012 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:47:41.012 --> 00:47:41.936 align:middle line:90%
That's what I--

00:47:41.936 --> 00:47:43.830 align:middle line:84%
>>And so you will
slowly get connected

00:47:43.830 --> 00:47:45.560 align:middle line:90%
with a different grid.

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:46.730 align:middle line:90%
>>Right, a different grid.

00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>>And all of this is really
just a transition, I think.

00:47:49.310 --> 00:47:51.286 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you how
transitional this is.

00:47:51.286 --> 00:47:52.910 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot of work
for something that's

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:54.470 align:middle line:84%
just sort of a
little stepping stone

00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:56.870 align:middle line:84%
but it's a transition
to a place that

00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:59.980 align:middle line:84%
has no form at all,
absolutely none.

00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:02.154 align:middle line:90%
