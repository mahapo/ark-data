00:00:01.473 --> 00:00:04.419 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:18.658 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.658 --> 00:00:21.113 align:middle line:10%
>>The information that
you're about to-- most

00:00:21.113 --> 00:00:23.077 align:middle line:10%
of the information,
especially with having

00:00:23.077 --> 00:00:26.950 align:middle line:10%
to do with history and these
kinds of things-- a lot

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.690 align:middle line:10%
of the stuff comes
from this man.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.090 align:middle line:10%
Now the things I'm
about to tell you

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.970 align:middle line:10%
are fantastic by normal
ways of thinking.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.324 align:middle line:10%
Again, you'll have to see for
yourself, if what I'm saying

00:00:40.324 --> 00:00:41.862 align:middle line:10%
is true or not.

00:00:41.862 --> 00:00:47.079 align:middle line:84%
But listen, this is
hieroglyphics here.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.245 align:middle line:84%
It's written on papyrus
paper, which is, supposedly,

00:00:49.245 --> 00:00:50.940 align:middle line:90%
the first paper.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.445 align:middle line:84%
He was the person, according
to Egypt, that introduced

00:00:54.445 --> 00:00:57.410 align:middle line:90%
writing into the world.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Egypt, supposedly, started
approximately 500 years later.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.510 align:middle line:90%
It's not true.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.978 align:middle line:84%
It started simultaneously
with Sumeria

00:01:04.978 --> 00:01:10.430 align:middle line:84%
and that will, eventually,
be proven here real soon.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.952 align:middle line:84%
But right now, I'll explain
why there's this 500 year

00:01:13.952 --> 00:01:15.830 align:middle line:90%
difference at the right moment.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.475 align:middle line:84%
But both Sumeria and Egypt
start at the same time,

00:01:19.475 --> 00:01:22.260 align:middle line:84%
but they were started from
two different sources.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.476 align:middle line:84%
One was called mommy, the
other was called daddy.

00:01:25.476 --> 00:01:27.970 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.100 align:middle line:84%
That which created
us as a race before,

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.192 align:middle line:84%
came back to start
unfolding who we are.

00:01:35.192 --> 00:01:39.230 align:middle line:84%
But this whole thing,
the hieroglyphics--

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.350 align:middle line:90%
it's a form of writing.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.350 align:middle line:84%
Hieroglyphics
means holy writing.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.100 align:middle line:90%
And it's all hieroglyphics.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.300 align:middle line:84%
Not just this, up
here, but this, too.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.880 align:middle line:84%
This is a symbol, which
means a very specific person.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And in Egypt, his
name was Thoth.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.590 align:middle line:90%
Spelled T-H-O-T-H.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.470 align:middle line:90%
And he doesn't look like that.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.870 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't have a bird
head on his-- probably

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.520 align:middle line:84%
that's the hieroglyphic
that represents him.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.644 align:middle line:84%
He looks very much like--
he would look Egyptian,

00:02:10.644 --> 00:02:13.500 align:middle line:90%
if you would see him today.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.626 align:middle line:84%
And he's holding two
leaves in his hand, which

00:02:15.626 --> 00:02:16.880 align:middle line:90%
are the papyrus roots.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.012 align:middle line:84%
And he's holding
a ankh, which is

00:02:20.012 --> 00:02:26.528 align:middle line:84%
one of these, which is a symbol
that represents eternal life.

00:02:26.528 --> 00:02:28.460 align:middle line:84%
In any of the
hieroglyphics, when

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.920 align:middle line:84%
a man is holding that or a
woman is holding that, it means

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.588 align:middle line:84%
they've reached
immortality, they're

00:02:32.588 --> 00:02:35.008 align:middle line:90%
no longer ever going to die.

00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:41.574 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, immortality
has a definition,

00:02:41.574 --> 00:02:42.570 align:middle line:90%
from our point of view.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.855 align:middle line:84%
It does not mean someone
who lives in the same body

00:02:45.855 --> 00:02:47.702 align:middle line:90%
forever, and ever, and ever.

00:02:47.702 --> 00:02:49.646 align:middle line:84%
That's called a
trap or something.

00:02:49.646 --> 00:02:52.562 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:52.562 --> 00:02:54.020 align:middle line:90%


00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.740 align:middle line:84%
Immortality means
that your memory

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.672 align:middle line:84%
pattern and your consciousness
has no more break in it

00:02:59.672 --> 00:03:01.363 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:03:01.363 --> 00:03:06.676 align:middle line:84%
You have total memory, going
back at least to the moment

00:03:06.676 --> 00:03:08.608 align:middle line:90%
that you began immortality.

00:03:08.608 --> 00:03:11.192 align:middle line:84%
And your memory and
your consciousness

00:03:11.192 --> 00:03:13.150 align:middle line:84%
has no break, no matter
where you pass through.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.730 align:middle line:90%
There's no loss.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.970 align:middle line:84%
Right now, we die, we got
into a particular overtime

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:19.970 align:middle line:90%
in the fourth dimension.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.840 align:middle line:84%
We forget that we're
here, once we're there.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And then when we
come back this way,

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.942 align:middle line:84%
we forget that we came from
there, going back over here.

00:03:26.942 --> 00:03:28.900 align:middle line:84%
We keep making the cycle,
forgetting each time,

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.772 align:middle line:84%
though it's accessible because
it's magnetically held.

00:03:32.772 --> 00:03:36.748 align:middle line:84%
So it's possible to reach
into these ancient memories,

00:03:36.748 --> 00:03:40.724 align:middle line:84%
old memories, but
we keep forgetting.

00:03:40.724 --> 00:03:43.209 align:middle line:84%
But once you reach immortality,
there's no more forgetting.

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.226 align:middle line:84%
So you can leave and you can
die at will, when you want to.

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:47.222 align:middle line:90%
You can leave a body.

00:03:47.222 --> 00:03:50.185 align:middle line:84%
You can go into others
because as you go on,

00:03:50.185 --> 00:03:52.095 align:middle line:84%
you will find that
there's other bodies that

00:03:52.095 --> 00:03:54.870 align:middle line:84%
are more appropriate for
higher levels of consciousness

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:55.842 align:middle line:90%
than this one.

00:03:55.842 --> 00:03:58.272 align:middle line:84%
And at certain
points, you'll realize

00:03:58.272 --> 00:04:02.646 align:middle line:84%
that you don't need
any body at all,

00:04:02.646 --> 00:04:07.510 align:middle line:84%
but the consciousness
continues on.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.370 align:middle line:84%
But this person
here, he considers

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.955 align:middle line:90%
himself an earth person.

00:04:10.955 --> 00:04:14.234 align:middle line:84%
And in truth, we're all
from somewhere else other

00:04:14.234 --> 00:04:15.034 align:middle line:90%
than earth.

00:04:15.034 --> 00:04:17.870 align:middle line:90%


00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.236 align:middle line:84%
We're all from somewhere,
not necessarily from earth.

00:04:21.236 --> 00:04:23.905 align:middle line:84%
And he considers himself
that because that's where

00:04:23.905 --> 00:04:24.988 align:middle line:90%
he gained his immortality.

00:04:24.988 --> 00:04:25.788 align:middle line:90%
It was here.

00:04:25.788 --> 00:04:28.984 align:middle line:90%


00:04:28.984 --> 00:04:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And he gained it during
the time of Atlantis,

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.106 align:middle line:90%
approximately 52,000 years ago.

00:04:34.106 --> 00:04:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And he has remained in the
same body for 52,000 years.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.454 align:middle line:84%
And he has walked on
earth for 52,000 years.

00:04:42.454 --> 00:04:43.861 align:middle line:90%
Walking around.

00:04:43.861 --> 00:04:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And he could have
left here and gone on

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.150 align:middle line:84%
with one of the past cycles,
if he really wanted to,

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.760 align:middle line:90%
but he chose to stay here.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:58.470 align:middle line:84%
For you Hindus out there, very
much like a bodhisattva, where

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.840 align:middle line:84%
he realized that we
were all connected.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.661 align:middle line:84%
And he decided to stay
back, even though he

00:05:04.661 --> 00:05:08.120 align:middle line:84%
could go on, and be
a teacher and to help

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.412 align:middle line:90%
the lower aspect come up.

00:05:10.412 --> 00:05:14.636 align:middle line:90%
And he just left though.

00:05:14.636 --> 00:05:18.740 align:middle line:90%


00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.960 align:middle line:84%
He was part of
[INAUDIBLE], and then he

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.714 align:middle line:84%
made his transition
over this [INAUDIBLE],

00:05:24.714 --> 00:05:27.124 align:middle line:90%
along with 31 other beings.

00:05:27.124 --> 00:05:32.185 align:middle line:84%
He made it for the first time
ever of this consciousness

00:05:32.185 --> 00:05:35.330 align:middle line:84%
level with the
other higher levels.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.529 align:middle line:84%
And so anyway, a
lot of this is going

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:40.404 align:middle line:84%
to be coming from this
one particular person.

00:05:40.404 --> 00:05:44.770 align:middle line:84%
A ratio of about 50% or
more is coming from there.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And when I got here, one
of the first things I did

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:50.870 align:middle line:90%
was connect with him.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.885 align:middle line:84%
And then, at the
right time, when

00:05:53.885 --> 00:05:55.905 align:middle line:84%
I needed to know the
histories of the earth,

00:05:55.905 --> 00:05:59.650 align:middle line:84%
he gave me the histories because
he had such a long memory.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.808 align:middle line:90%
His mom is 200,000 years old.

00:06:01.808 --> 00:06:03.296 align:middle line:90%
She's still walking around.

00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:06.272 align:middle line:90%
She's also on the earth.

00:06:06.272 --> 00:06:12.224 align:middle line:84%
And so he has a long
memory pattern, going back,

00:06:12.224 --> 00:06:14.208 align:middle line:90%
pretty much, to the beginning.

00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:18.672 align:middle line:84%
Though he says that something
happened 5.5 million years ago

00:06:18.672 --> 00:06:19.670 align:middle line:90%
that was really big.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And he could never explain
to me exactly what it was

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.437 align:middle line:84%
or I couldn't
understand what it was.

00:06:24.437 --> 00:06:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And something, big
time, hit the earth

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:33.460 align:middle line:84%
because we can't get through
to the ancient memories

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.602 align:middle line:90%
before that.

00:06:34.602 --> 00:06:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And I don't understand--
from my point of view,

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.970 align:middle line:84%
where I am right now, I don't
understand how it's possible

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.410 align:middle line:84%
because once you create an
action or something happens,

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:46.310 align:middle line:84%
it goes into what's called
the Akashic records.

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.120 align:middle line:84%
Mathematically, if
you strike a bell,

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.230 align:middle line:90%
that bell will never go away.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.659 align:middle line:84%
It's called [? asatomically ?]
reaching a limit.

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:59.870 align:middle line:84%
Mathematically, it will,
theoretically, exist forever.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:04.357 align:middle line:84%
And it should still
be attainable,

00:07:04.357 --> 00:07:06.440 align:middle line:84%
if you would track down
to the golden main spiral,

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.933 align:middle line:84%
to the place where
it was started.

00:07:09.933 --> 00:07:11.430 align:middle line:90%
But something happened.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.930 align:middle line:90%
It must have been really big.

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And they can't get through
and so none of the ancients

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.754 align:middle line:90%
can get through this.

00:07:20.754 --> 00:07:22.910 align:middle line:84%
They can't consciously
go back, though there

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.638 align:middle line:90%
are records that go back.

00:07:25.638 --> 00:07:30.066 align:middle line:84%
But they still can't
consciously go back.

00:07:30.066 --> 00:07:32.034 align:middle line:84%
They can't-- the first
5.5 million years,

00:07:32.034 --> 00:07:34.010 align:middle line:90%
according to him.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.992 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, this is his symbol,
which is an ibis bird.

00:07:36.992 --> 00:07:39.404 align:middle line:84%
I think there are several
reasons why they chose that,

00:07:39.404 --> 00:07:41.028 align:middle line:84%
but one of them is
because it hangs out

00:07:41.028 --> 00:07:42.810 align:middle line:90%
in the reeds for a long time.

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:45.880 align:middle line:84%
The second time
I was in Egypt, I

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.880 align:middle line:84%
went all over, looking
for all these ibis birds.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And I went through
all the reeds.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:55.370 align:middle line:84%
I must have went through about
5 miles going through reeds

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.329 align:middle line:84%
and I never could find
one of these guys.

00:07:57.329 --> 00:07:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And I never did see
them anywhere, not even

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.260 align:middle line:90%
from a distance.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.057 align:middle line:84%
I had to wait until I got
back to the Albuquerque Zoo.

00:08:03.057 --> 00:08:04.567 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:05.400 align:middle line:90%
That's an ibis bird.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.861 align:middle line:90%
Right there.

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:10.840 align:middle line:84%
They look like little sort
of pink, short storks.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.990 align:middle line:90%


00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.680 align:middle line:90%
And there's the writing.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.960 align:middle line:90%


00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.550 align:middle line:84%
This is an actual
hieroglyph of him

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:27.490 align:middle line:84%
writing along the walls in Egypt
and laying down the writing.

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:30.126 align:middle line:84%
We didn't need writing
until a certain point.

00:08:30.126 --> 00:08:32.250 align:middle line:84%
When the consciousness got
to a certain level, then

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:33.600 align:middle line:90%
we had to use writing.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Before that, we had 100%,
absolute, total holographic

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:39.299 align:middle line:90%
memory.

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:41.409 align:middle line:90%
There was no reason to do it.

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:44.920 align:middle line:84%
Anything that any
person ever experienced,

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:49.132 align:middle line:84%
anybody else could re-experience
at anytime that they wanted to.

00:08:49.132 --> 00:08:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And we still have people like
that on your the earth, right

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:52.982 align:middle line:90%
now, today.

00:08:52.982 --> 00:08:54.190 align:middle line:90%
There's whole groups of them.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.950 align:middle line:84%
One of them is the
Aboriginals in Australia.

00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Those people are
all linked together

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.840 align:middle line:84%
in a very specific
level of consciousness.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:07.000 align:middle line:90%


00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.380 align:middle line:84%
If one of them were here,
in this room, right now,

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:13.330 align:middle line:84%
then, in essence, I would
be giving it to all of them.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:17.120 align:middle line:84%
They can go into what they
call dream time and come in.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.010 align:middle line:84%
As a holographic
world, they would

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:23.070 align:middle line:84%
be able to walk around in here
and look at this happening.

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.990 align:middle line:84%
They could experience the
whole five days, as many

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:28.460 align:middle line:90%
as they wanted to.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:29.860 align:middle line:90%
But it would not be real.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.055 align:middle line:90%
It would be like a hologram.

00:09:31.055 --> 00:09:32.380 align:middle line:90%
It would be like like.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:35.473 align:middle line:90%
It would not be real.

00:09:35.473 --> 00:09:40.716 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't remove
things or use things,

00:09:40.716 --> 00:09:42.204 align:middle line:90%
but it would be a hologram.

00:09:42.204 --> 00:09:44.170 align:middle line:90%
But it's a perfect memory.

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:44.970 align:middle line:90%
They could smell.

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:46.125 align:middle line:90%
They could hear the sounds.

00:09:46.125 --> 00:09:48.621 align:middle line:84%
It would be just like being
here, but it wouldn't be real.

00:09:48.621 --> 00:09:51.543 align:middle line:90%


00:09:51.543 --> 00:09:54.952 align:middle line:84%
So we, obviously,
didn't need writing when

00:09:54.952 --> 00:09:56.430 align:middle line:90%
we got that kind of memory.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.650 align:middle line:84%
It was only when we jumped
up to the next level

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:00.233 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness,
which is where we're

00:10:00.233 --> 00:10:04.539 align:middle line:84%
in now, which is a stepping
stone from one Unity

00:10:04.539 --> 00:10:06.122 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness, which
is the first one,

00:10:06.122 --> 00:10:08.607 align:middle line:84%
to the next Unity
Consciousness, which

00:10:08.607 --> 00:10:10.110 align:middle line:90%
we call Christ Consciousness.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Both of those also have
Unity Consciousness,

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:15.270 align:middle line:84%
only Christ
Consciousness is memory.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.650 align:middle line:84%
Memory is the key
to all of this.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:20.495 align:middle line:84%
The memory of the Christ
Consciousness body

00:10:20.495 --> 00:10:21.495 align:middle line:90%
is much greater.

00:10:21.495 --> 00:10:27.816 align:middle line:90%


00:10:27.816 --> 00:10:30.039 align:middle line:84%
The Aboriginal could
come into this room

00:10:30.039 --> 00:10:35.643 align:middle line:84%
and they would be remembering
it, but from a light field.

00:10:35.643 --> 00:10:41.975 align:middle line:84%
If the Christ Conscious
being remembered the room,

00:10:41.975 --> 00:10:46.965 align:middle line:84%
they would, literally, be
here in time and space.

00:10:46.965 --> 00:10:49.959 align:middle line:90%
It's a little different.

00:10:49.959 --> 00:10:50.957 align:middle line:90%
They would just appear.

00:10:50.957 --> 00:10:52.454 align:middle line:90%
They would be here.

00:10:52.454 --> 00:10:56.945 align:middle line:84%
If they remember an orange--
if an Aboriginal remembers

00:10:56.945 --> 00:10:59.440 align:middle line:84%
an orange, then
he's got an orange,

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.937 align:middle line:84%
but he can't do
anything with it.

00:11:00.937 --> 00:11:03.432 align:middle line:84%
If a Christ Conscious
being remembers an orange,

00:11:03.432 --> 00:11:04.430 align:middle line:90%
he's got a real orange.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:05.680 align:middle line:90%
He can pick it up and peel it.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.695 align:middle line:90%


00:11:09.695 --> 00:11:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And his memory extends
through all time, and space,

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:15.240 align:middle line:84%
and everything
that's ever occurred.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.456 align:middle line:90%
So all things are possible.

00:11:17.456 --> 00:11:18.914 align:middle line:90%
It's a whole other level.

00:11:18.914 --> 00:11:20.858 align:middle line:90%
And there's levels beyond that.

00:11:20.858 --> 00:11:23.740 align:middle line:84%
Our memory really are
in a separate state.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.510 align:middle line:90%
This is the stepping stone.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:27.974 align:middle line:84%
We have, contained
within us, the parameters

00:11:27.974 --> 00:11:30.894 align:middle line:84%
of Christ Consciousness,
which I'll geometrically be

00:11:30.894 --> 00:11:32.220 align:middle line:90%
able to show you before I go.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.290 align:middle line:84%
But we are not
Christ Consciousness.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:37.880 align:middle line:90%


00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:42.505 align:middle line:84%
We are stepping
stone, in that someone

00:11:42.505 --> 00:11:45.439 align:middle line:84%
from the first level
of consciousness steps

00:11:45.439 --> 00:11:47.884 align:middle line:84%
into this level
of consciousness.

00:11:47.884 --> 00:11:50.818 align:middle line:84%
And he gets out of it,
as quick as possible,

00:11:50.818 --> 00:11:52.285 align:middle line:90%
and into the third one.

00:11:52.285 --> 00:11:53.996 align:middle line:84%
You have to pass
through here, but you

00:11:53.996 --> 00:11:56.686 align:middle line:84%
don't want to hang out here
because we are not a harmonic

00:11:56.686 --> 00:11:59.260 align:middle line:84%
consciousness and we will
destroy any place that we

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:03.124 align:middle line:90%
are in, i.e, look at the earth.

00:12:03.124 --> 00:12:04.540 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:08.080 align:middle line:84%
Just give us enough time
and we will completely

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.565 align:middle line:90%
kill this planet.

00:12:09.565 --> 00:12:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's just where we are
because we are not harmonic.

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:16.446 align:middle line:84%
And I have to explain a lot
to explain what that means,

00:12:16.446 --> 00:12:18.836 align:middle line:90%
before I can get to that place.

00:12:18.836 --> 00:12:24.580 align:middle line:90%


00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.327 align:middle line:90%
And the writing is the key.

00:12:26.327 --> 00:12:28.895 align:middle line:84%
That's how you take someone
from the first level

00:12:28.895 --> 00:12:32.398 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness and get them
out, into the second level.

00:12:32.398 --> 00:12:36.270 align:middle line:84%
You introduce writing-- where
they no longer access memory

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.874 align:middle line:84%
directly from within
themselves, but they

00:12:38.874 --> 00:12:44.110 align:middle line:84%
have to go through a symbol, or
a word, or a color, or a form,

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:46.980 align:middle line:84%
or a shape, which is
how our memory-- we

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:48.760 align:middle line:90%
have to access something.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.350 align:middle line:84%
We can't even remember
something unless we check.

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:54.830 align:middle line:84%
Our eyes have to move at
very specific angles even

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:59.731 align:middle line:84%
to remember things, which is
connected to shape and form.

00:12:59.731 --> 00:13:01.930 align:middle line:90%
And we don't have that ability.

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:06.244 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you do that,
then that is part of-- there

00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:07.910 align:middle line:84%
is something else
that changes, which is

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:10.190 align:middle line:90%
the breathing pattern itself.

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And we result in this separate
state that we perceive.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And all we see is
ourselves, inner body.

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:20.144 align:middle line:84%
Everything out there feels
to be separate from us.

00:13:20.144 --> 00:13:23.126 align:middle line:84%
We think that we could have
thoughts, and feelings,

00:13:23.126 --> 00:13:24.914 align:middle line:84%
and that, somehow,
doesn't affect any

00:13:24.914 --> 00:13:26.164 align:middle line:90%
of that, which is an illusion.

00:13:26.164 --> 00:13:29.190 align:middle line:84%
It isn't true at all because
our thoughts and our feelings

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:31.130 align:middle line:84%
dramatically effect
what's happening.

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:36.950 align:middle line:90%


00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:39.375 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these things, I'm
just lightly touching on

00:13:39.375 --> 00:13:41.740 align:middle line:84%
and I'll go over,
later, in detail.

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:45.540 align:middle line:90%


00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:48.330 align:middle line:84%
So writing is the
key in all of this.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.840 align:middle line:90%


00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:55.720 align:middle line:84%
This was his wife, Seshat, who
was also one of my teachers.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:59.106 align:middle line:84%
She was the one that brought
me here, in the first place,

00:13:59.106 --> 00:14:01.476 align:middle line:90%
about 3,500 years ago.

00:14:01.476 --> 00:14:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And she's also a
recorder, recording

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.970 align:middle line:84%
from the feminine view
rather than the male view.
