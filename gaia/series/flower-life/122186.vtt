00:00:18.377 --> 00:00:20.612 align:middle line:84%
>>Have pets-- can
they make the shift?

00:00:20.612 --> 00:00:22.650 align:middle line:90%
Do they go with you?

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>>The animals have no
problem at this point.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.588 align:middle line:90%
That's all been solved.

00:00:28.588 --> 00:00:31.930 align:middle line:84%
The natural animals
never did have a problem.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.405 align:middle line:84%
And the animals that have
been close to us and they're

00:00:35.405 --> 00:00:37.580 align:middle line:84%
synthetically breathing--
those problems

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.040 align:middle line:90%
were solved a long time ago.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.168 align:middle line:90%
They don't have any problem.

00:00:42.168 --> 00:00:44.816 align:middle line:90%
It's only humans.

00:00:44.816 --> 00:00:46.710 align:middle line:84%
It's totally left
just to humans.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.770 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.225 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:00:50.225 --> 00:00:54.590 align:middle line:84%
>>When you said that there
would be incredible chaos--

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>>I said that's what
usually happens.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.600 align:middle line:90%
There may be no chaos at all.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.200 align:middle line:90%
You may get no warning at all.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.560 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the better we
get, the less warning we get.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.730 align:middle line:90%


00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:22.281 align:middle line:84%
>>That's what [INAUDIBLE] people
that would die at that time.

00:01:22.281 --> 00:01:23.190 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, could be.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.860 align:middle line:90%


00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.870 align:middle line:84%
Well no, but that
couldn't coincide

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.325 align:middle line:84%
with the American
Indian prophecy though.

00:01:30.325 --> 00:01:32.450 align:middle line:84%
Because there was a year
or so between each one

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.920 align:middle line:90%
of these waves.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And the chaos aspect happens
at the very, very end,

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.420 align:middle line:90%
few months before.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.390 align:middle line:90%


00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.122 align:middle line:84%
>>With what the
prediction uses, it

00:01:45.122 --> 00:01:47.845 align:middle line:84%
sounds as though
there are going to be

00:01:47.845 --> 00:01:49.825 align:middle line:84%
different galactic
systems [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:49.825 --> 00:01:53.290 align:middle line:90%


00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.170 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, what the American
Indians are saying

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.670 align:middle line:84%
is that, if we're talking about
that, that these waves leave

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.580 align:middle line:84%
prior to the chaos and prior
to the shift in the axis.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.039 align:middle line:84%
Because it would have to
be, considered how much time

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.344 align:middle line:84%
is between each
one of these waves.

00:02:11.344 --> 00:02:15.136 align:middle line:84%
>>So they say that
they're dying and wending

00:02:15.136 --> 00:02:16.915 align:middle line:90%
round and ascending, right?

00:02:16.915 --> 00:02:17.715 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:02:17.715 --> 00:02:21.630 align:middle line:84%
They are dying, merging
as one over us all

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.139 align:middle line:84%
and then flying
away, taking off,

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:25.930 align:middle line:84%
which is kind of like
what the Hebrides did

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:26.763 align:middle line:90%
when they came here.

00:02:26.763 --> 00:02:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And they came here as a
oversoul from another place,

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.057 align:middle line:84%
somewhere where they did
not make it very well.

00:02:36.057 --> 00:02:38.390 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, that's what's
happening with these beings.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.500 align:middle line:90%
They're not really making it.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.650 align:middle line:84%
So they're going to
go to somewhere that

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.269 align:middle line:90%
is more appropriate for them.

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.634 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.800 align:middle line:84%
>>Something that did
not convince us--

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.240 align:middle line:90%
>>Can we use a microphone?

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.490 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, yeah.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.730 align:middle line:90%
Let's use the mic.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:00.610 align:middle line:90%
Bye, John.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:01.410 align:middle line:90%
>>Bye, John.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.780 align:middle line:90%
>>Bye bye.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.040 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.840 align:middle line:90%
We love you.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.677 align:middle line:90%


00:03:06.677 --> 00:03:08.010 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people have to fly out.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.970 align:middle line:84%
Does anybody have to fly
out of here real quick?

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.770 align:middle line:84%
If they do, we can close right
now until the pole shifts.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.502 align:middle line:90%


00:03:20.502 --> 00:03:22.900 align:middle line:90%
>>We'll stay until the morning.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>>OK, something that
did not make sense to me

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.140 align:middle line:84%
was why couldn't we see the
phenomenal colors and shapes

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.795 align:middle line:84%
before we go through
the great void?

00:03:34.795 --> 00:03:37.655 align:middle line:90%


00:03:37.655 --> 00:03:39.030 align:middle line:84%
>>It's like there's
an interface.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.825 align:middle line:90%


00:03:43.825 --> 00:03:45.200 align:middle line:84%
It's just beginning
to interface.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.260 align:middle line:90%


00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.700 align:middle line:84%
It's like an
interference pattern.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.930 align:middle line:84%
If you have something
that's beginning

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.890 align:middle line:84%
to move through each
other-- it's all here.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.930 align:middle line:84%
So this image of an
interference pattern,

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.140 align:middle line:84%
or of a membrane or two
things coming together

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.914 align:middle line:90%
is not accurate.

00:04:06.914 --> 00:04:08.080 align:middle line:90%
It's right through the room.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.570 align:middle line:90%
It's everything.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And so part of it is
starting to come in.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.575 align:middle line:84%
Part of it has already come
through or already starting

00:04:16.575 --> 00:04:17.466 align:middle line:90%
to come in.

00:04:17.466 --> 00:04:18.924 align:middle line:84%
Part of this is
starting to go out.

00:04:18.924 --> 00:04:20.740 align:middle line:90%
It's starting to separate.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:25.820 align:middle line:90%
It's starting to merge.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.230 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how to express it.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.076 align:middle line:90%
I'm told that this will happen.

00:04:33.076 --> 00:04:35.242 align:middle line:84%
And I know what fourth
dimensional stuff looks like.

00:04:35.242 --> 00:04:38.160 align:middle line:90%


00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.800 align:middle line:84%
I haven't been through
this experience, at least

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.090 align:middle line:90%
not in a very long time.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.005 align:middle line:84%
And so I can't
say more than what

00:04:46.005 --> 00:04:51.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm being told, to expect these
two things occurring prior

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.095 align:middle line:84%
to-- but again, the one
with the synthetic objects--

00:04:54.095 --> 00:04:55.870 align:middle line:90%
they'll say almost certainly.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.500 align:middle line:84%
Because that's a matter of
third dimension breaking down.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.520 align:middle line:84%
The fourth dimensional objects
that they emphasize-- it

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.440 align:middle line:84%
depends on where you are
geographically whether or not

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.225 align:middle line:90%
you'll experience that or not.

00:05:08.225 --> 00:05:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And so exactly what that
means, I can't tell you.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.040 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.000 align:middle line:90%


00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.100 align:middle line:84%
>>So bearing all this
in mind, what we've just

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.400 align:middle line:84%
been talking about,
what is the purpose

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.990 align:middle line:84%
of the individual
Merkaba that we're

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.950 align:middle line:84%
learning if the
whole planet's going

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.394 align:middle line:84%
to go from third to fourth
dimension with this pole shift

00:05:32.394 --> 00:05:33.194 align:middle line:90%
anyway.

00:05:33.194 --> 00:05:36.830 align:middle line:90%


00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.260 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm not saying that
everybody's going to do it,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.600 align:middle line:90%
so why bother.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.040 align:middle line:90%
>>Right, yeah, basically.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:50.140 align:middle line:90%


00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>>Well if you don't do
it, it might not happen.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.200 align:middle line:84%
The reason it is happening is
because you're taking the time

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.958 align:middle line:90%
to open your heart.

00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And lots of other
people are too.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.900 align:middle line:84%
If people didn't, then
this wouldn't be occurring.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.680 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
occur on its own.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.950 align:middle line:84%
It's happening because
of our energies.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.870 align:middle line:84%
It isn't going to
automatically occur.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.220 align:middle line:84%
>>But then if the most important
part of the whole thing

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:20.830 align:middle line:84%
is the opening of the
heart, then what's needed

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.770 align:middle line:84%
is the technique of the
opening of the heart

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.706 align:middle line:84%
and not the technique
of spinning the Merkaba.

00:06:25.706 --> 00:06:26.506 align:middle line:90%
>>You need both.

00:06:26.506 --> 00:06:29.700 align:middle line:90%


00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.050 align:middle line:90%
>>I take your word on that.

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>>I mean, if you don't feel
that, then you don't need it.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.244 align:middle line:84%
And then do only what
you feel is right.

00:06:37.244 --> 00:06:38.160 align:middle line:90%
>>No, on the contrary.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.360 align:middle line:84%
I would like to
just spin my Merkaba

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.080 align:middle line:84%
and go into fourth
dimension tonight.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.400 align:middle line:90%
That would suit me fine.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.580 align:middle line:84%
But from what you're saying,
that's not an option.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.520 align:middle line:90%
>>No, I'm not saying that.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.291 align:middle line:90%
In fact, it's happened before.

00:06:53.291 --> 00:06:54.790 align:middle line:84%
You may go home and
your higher self

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:55.915 align:middle line:90%
says let's get out of here.

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:56.910 align:middle line:90%
Let's go now.

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>>So that was another question.

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.440 align:middle line:84%
How many people of the people
that you have taught have

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.800 align:middle line:84%
learnt the 18th breath and are
either going back and forth

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.240 align:middle line:90%
or decided to go and leave.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.230 align:middle line:90%
>>It's only a few.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:09.770 align:middle line:84%
It's only a few and
that I've talked

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:14.680 align:middle line:84%
with that have been able to do
this, yeah go and come back.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.714 align:middle line:90%
I know a few.

00:07:16.714 --> 00:07:18.190 align:middle line:90%
>>More than once.

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:21.411 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, I know one
who does it a lot.

00:07:21.411 --> 00:07:25.890 align:middle line:84%
>>Is there any advantage to be
able to endure anything useful?

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>>I don't know.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.870 align:middle line:90%


00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.440 align:middle line:84%
That's something between
you and your own higher self

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.940 align:middle line:84%
if you've got a
reason for doing it.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:34.780 align:middle line:90%
There's got to be a reason.

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.690 align:middle line:84%
You're not doing it for just
fun or kicks or something

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:37.490 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.226 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be
reason for doing that.

00:07:39.226 --> 00:07:45.810 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going to
go over and come back,

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:50.740 align:middle line:84%
usually the people that are
doing that kind of thing

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.950 align:middle line:84%
are people that were already
having a problem with it

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.140 align:middle line:90%
to begin with.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:08:00.150 align:middle line:90%
There was a doctor near Seattle.

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And he would find herself
disappearing out of the room

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.430 align:middle line:84%
all the time right in
front of other people.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:09.360 align:middle line:90%
It would happen a lot.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And he had no control
over it at all.

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:15.670 align:middle line:90%


00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:18.870 align:middle line:84%
There's more people
than you would

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:23.000 align:middle line:90%
imagine that have this problem.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And so when he
learned the Merkaba,

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.640 align:middle line:84%
it was like this
great relief to him.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:32.186 align:middle line:84%
Because he could control it,
when it would happen and when

00:08:32.186 --> 00:08:33.580 align:middle line:90%
it would not happen.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And then now he's able to use it
to go back and forth between it

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.618 align:middle line:84%
and be able to say OK, now I'm
going to sit down and do this.

00:08:39.618 --> 00:08:40.909 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to go over there.

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:42.367 align:middle line:84%
And OK, now I'm
going to come back.

00:08:42.367 --> 00:08:44.091 align:middle line:90%
And he's able to control it.

00:08:44.091 --> 00:08:46.768 align:middle line:84%
>>Does he have a great
pull to be here anymore?

00:08:46.768 --> 00:08:48.226 align:middle line:84%
Was that what was
going on with him

00:08:48.226 --> 00:08:51.064 align:middle line:84%
disappearing, that it's
time for him to be there

00:08:51.064 --> 00:08:54.860 align:middle line:90%
more on the fourth dimension?

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.409 align:middle line:90%
>>I don't know.

00:08:56.409 --> 00:08:58.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've spent a lot of time
in the fourth dimension too.

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:02.296 align:middle line:90%


00:09:02.296 --> 00:09:07.459 align:middle line:84%
And I could say that I would
much rather be there than here.

00:09:07.459 --> 00:09:09.000 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to
give me two places

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.210 align:middle line:84%
and just going to
flip a coin and say

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:12.090 align:middle line:84%
which one do you want
to go to, or something,

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:14.215 align:middle line:84%
I would rather be over
there, if I got my druthers,

00:09:14.215 --> 00:09:17.240 align:middle line:90%
because it's kind of more fun.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.951 align:middle line:90%
And fun's real important to me.

00:09:18.951 --> 00:09:22.760 align:middle line:90%


00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.000 align:middle line:90%
But I'm happy to be here.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And it has taken a lot of work
to get here to this level.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not interested
in leaving real fast.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:34.060 align:middle line:84%
I want to go through
it, that way.

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:41.050 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless, I'll
gladly, at a drop of the hat

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:43.261 align:middle line:84%
when this takes place,
I'm ready to go.

00:09:43.261 --> 00:09:47.950 align:middle line:90%


00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:50.924 align:middle line:90%
>>Can I just finish please?

00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:53.090 align:middle line:84%
One of the other things
that I have a question about

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:57.000 align:middle line:84%
is apparently I was
one of those 300

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.970 align:middle line:90%
with Akhenaten and Nefertiti.

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And that whole
thing when you drew

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:08.140 align:middle line:84%
the diagram of the spiral
going through the sarcophagus

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.540 align:middle line:84%
in the great pyramid
and I laid down there.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:13.080 align:middle line:84%
I've done the whole
Egyptian trip-- what's

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.330 align:middle line:84%
happening to me
now when I'm doing

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.380 align:middle line:84%
the first breaths
of the Merkaba is

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:23.130 align:middle line:84%
there's a very strong attraction
to pulling out on a spiral.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And sort of somehow,
there are numbers going on

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:26.830 align:middle line:90%
too in my head.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:28.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, I didn't complete
it at that time.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:32.420 align:middle line:84%
I died before I
completed the thing.

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:35.040 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to know if
there's any danger in my

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.234 align:middle line:90%
going out on that spiral.

00:10:36.234 --> 00:10:38.400 align:middle line:84%
I've kind of been holding
back because I feel like I

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.483 align:middle line:90%
don't know what I'm doing.

00:10:39.483 --> 00:10:43.160 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, and you've got
to ask your higher self.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.310 align:middle line:84%
If you've almost got
all the training done,

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:50.120 align:middle line:84%
that would be a
different path than what

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.210 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about here.

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:54.060 align:middle line:90%


00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And that path is deciding
not to go out and stay there,

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:58.157 align:middle line:90%
but to go out and come back.

00:10:58.157 --> 00:11:02.730 align:middle line:90%


00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:06.340 align:middle line:84%
So if higher self can give
you exactly what you're

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:08.462 align:middle line:84%
supposed to do on that
and tells you to do it,

00:11:08.462 --> 00:11:10.737 align:middle line:90%
you can go for it.

00:11:10.737 --> 00:11:13.660 align:middle line:90%


00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.870 align:middle line:84%
You will definitely
be changed after that.

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:18.040 align:middle line:84%
You won't ever be
the same again.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:21.627 align:middle line:84%
So maybe that's part of what
your purpose and training.

00:11:21.627 --> 00:11:22.960 align:middle line:90%
Almost all of you were Egyptian.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:23.680 align:middle line:90%
I can feel it.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.888 align:middle line:84%
There's so much Egyptian
blood here, it's ridiculous.

00:11:25.888 --> 00:11:28.310 align:middle line:90%


00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:30.630 align:middle line:84%
>>The other thing was
the Merkaba experience

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:33.059 align:middle line:84%
I had just before I
learned about you.

00:11:33.059 --> 00:11:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to explain
it to you other day.

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think you
understood what I was saying.

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:42.240 align:middle line:84%
The spin that happened
around my body was this way.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:46.090 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, I understand,
from head to foot.

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>>I don't understand
how that happened

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:54.920 align:middle line:84%
if there's this tube going
through the star tetrahedron.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:12:01.350 align:middle line:84%
>>The field is such that
the spin naturally happens

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:03.430 align:middle line:90%
in that orientation over there.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:06.810 align:middle line:84%
However, once the
spin is taking place,

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:11.214 align:middle line:84%
you can rotate it into
any angle whatsoever.

00:12:11.214 --> 00:12:12.380 align:middle line:90%
I know because I've done it.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:13.796 align:middle line:84%
>>Does it have to
be on that axis?

00:12:13.796 --> 00:12:15.020 align:middle line:90%
>>No, it does not.

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:15.830 align:middle line:90%
And I've done it.

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:18.610 align:middle line:84%
So I've tried all the angle and
spun it around, make sure, yep,

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:21.290 align:middle line:90%
thing really does do that.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:24.068 align:middle line:90%
So I know you can do it.

00:12:24.068 --> 00:12:25.956 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you very much.

00:12:25.956 --> 00:12:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>>Drunvalo, what
kind of life do you

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.580 align:middle line:90%
have in the fourth dimension?

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:34.750 align:middle line:84%
There is no more IRS,
no more business--

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.270 align:middle line:90%
>>No money.

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:37.740 align:middle line:90%
>>No more money.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.140 align:middle line:90%
So what kind of fun do you have?

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:47.390 align:middle line:90%


00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:50.070 align:middle line:90%
>>No more [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:55.250 align:middle line:84%
>>The fourth dimension is
primarily a learning zone.

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:58.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a place of learning
more than anything else,

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:02.690 align:middle line:84%
for the kind of evolutionary
path that we're going up onto.

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:05.280 align:middle line:84%
For example, I
spent about 15 years

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.490 align:middle line:90%
on the Pleiades coming in here.

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And I have full
memory of doing that.

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:12.190 align:middle line:90%


00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:14.440 align:middle line:84%
There was a very
specific planet there

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:17.150 align:middle line:84%
that's fourth dimensional
that has a green atmosphere.

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:21.290 align:middle line:90%


00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And the kinds of things
that we would do-- it's

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:26.290 align:middle line:84%
actually a university
where I went

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:33.430 align:middle line:84%
to study about living
in a place like this.

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:34.980 align:middle line:84%
I had to learn how
to come down here.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.300 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't just come here.

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:37.612 align:middle line:90%
It was not easy.

00:13:37.612 --> 00:13:39.570 align:middle line:84%
I had to learn a lot of
stuff to get down here.

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.240 align:middle line:90%


00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And what we did is
we played games.

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:47.390 align:middle line:84%
They-- and I had all the time--
we had all kinds of games.

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:51.150 align:middle line:84%
That the games would be such
that in the plane of the game,

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:53.330 align:middle line:90%
you would learn something.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.420 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't like
doing the Olympics

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.320 align:middle line:90%
to see who is the best.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:01.030 align:middle line:84%
It was a game that you would
play that in playing the game,

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:04.414 align:middle line:84%
you would learn about
the reality in life

00:14:04.414 --> 00:14:05.626 align:middle line:90%
and what it was all about.

00:14:05.626 --> 00:14:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's all they
did was play games.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:11.084 align:middle line:90%
And there was no pain.

00:14:11.084 --> 00:14:12.000 align:middle line:90%
There was no sickness.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.541 align:middle line:84%
There was none of
that kind of stuff.

00:14:13.541 --> 00:14:14.600 align:middle line:90%
There's no problems.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.320 align:middle line:84%
There was no want,
or need, or anything

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:19.480 align:middle line:84%
of those kinds of things,
anything like that at all.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:25.350 align:middle line:84%
It was purely a seeking of
understanding and wisdom

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:30.072 align:middle line:84%
and trying to understanding
what it was all about.

00:14:30.072 --> 00:14:31.630 align:middle line:90%
And everybody loved everybody.

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:34.370 align:middle line:90%


00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And they were all
real beautiful.

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:38.260 align:middle line:90%
They were.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:43.460 align:middle line:84%
They were all tall and handsome
and had it real together

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:45.290 align:middle line:84%
on all kinds of
levels like that.

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:47.710 align:middle line:84%
I remember-- just to give
you an example of one

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:54.654 align:middle line:84%
of the games-- I remember when
I was a little baby there,

00:14:54.654 --> 00:15:00.520 align:middle line:84%
maybe two years old or
something like that,

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.015 align:middle line:90%
you played with blocks.

00:15:02.015 --> 00:15:03.977 align:middle line:90%
You know, kids play with blocks.

00:15:03.977 --> 00:15:05.060 align:middle line:90%
I had to play with blocks.

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.720 align:middle line:84%
But they were about as big
around as those things there.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.026 align:middle line:84%
And they were
solid like granite.

00:15:10.026 --> 00:15:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
whole pile of them.

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And I had to lift them up
into space with my mind

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:20.300 align:middle line:84%
and sort them into an image
and set them down with my mind.

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:21.845 align:middle line:84%
And I was just a
little tiny baby.

00:15:21.845 --> 00:15:23.772 align:middle line:90%
It was a game.

00:15:23.772 --> 00:15:26.100 align:middle line:84%
I remember when we
were an adult, one

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:29.565 align:middle line:84%
of the games-- we went in
this room that was really

00:15:29.565 --> 00:15:31.430 align:middle line:84%
a big room compared
to the rooms.

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.780 align:middle line:90%
Some of the rooms are enormous.

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:36.970 align:middle line:84%
But the room was maybe
a half a mile long.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And we were out on this big
round platform that looked out.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And you'd drop down over
this big sweeping thing.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.500 align:middle line:90%
It was all molded.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:45.800 align:middle line:90%
It was enormous.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:51.482 align:middle line:84%
It was probably
five times as wide.

00:15:51.482 --> 00:15:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And it went for
about half a mile.

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And then about a
quarter mile down,

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:58.300 align:middle line:84%
there was a corner that came
over off the other side.

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:01.280 align:middle line:90%


00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And there was these golden
discs that were big, thick,

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.311 align:middle line:90%
and they were heavy.

00:16:06.311 --> 00:16:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And they would take them
kind of like a Frisbee.

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And off this thing, people
sat around and watched this

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:13.670 align:middle line:90%
and had so much fun at this.

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And they would throw these
things down on this low thing.

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And then they would guide
them with their thoughts.

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And then they would have
to guide them around

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.986 align:middle line:84%
into this other alley
that they couldn't see.

00:16:24.986 --> 00:16:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And then they had to psychically
see around the corner

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:31.200 align:middle line:90%
to hit something down there.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.390 align:middle line:84%
I can't even remember
what that was.

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:34.014 align:middle line:84%
But they had to do
something like that.

00:16:34.014 --> 00:16:36.620 align:middle line:90%
And they love that.

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.480 align:middle line:84%
I say they because I didn't
actually play that game.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.303 align:middle line:90%
I watched that game.

00:16:41.303 --> 00:16:42.205 align:middle line:90%
I remember that.

00:16:42.205 --> 00:16:47.860 align:middle line:90%


00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.630 align:middle line:90%
It was things that were fun.

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:52.120 align:middle line:90%
And it's not all.

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:54.632 align:middle line:84%
You still work at playing
games all the time.

00:16:54.632 --> 00:16:55.590 align:middle line:90%
There are other things.

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:57.590 align:middle line:90%
But life is different.

00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:01.178 align:middle line:84%
They coordinate
a lot of movement

00:17:01.178 --> 00:17:04.569 align:middle line:84%
of souls from one
place to another,

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:08.359 align:middle line:84%
like me, who was
coming through there.

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:11.040 align:middle line:84%
I was coming down through
the dimensional levels.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:15.530 align:middle line:90%


00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was coming from
the 13th dimension.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.960 align:middle line:90%
And I had to come down.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.744 align:middle line:84%
I came in probably on about
the sixth dimensional level

00:17:22.744 --> 00:17:25.931 align:middle line:84%
and slowly came
through launching

00:17:25.931 --> 00:17:27.180 align:middle line:90%
in this Melchizedek's Merkaba.

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:37.370 align:middle line:84%
I had to come through slowly
to get to the Pleiades

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:39.162 align:middle line:84%
and then until I got
down to the level

00:17:39.162 --> 00:17:41.370 align:middle line:84%
where they were at, which
was about the 12th overtone

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:42.612 align:middle line:90%
in fourth dimension.

00:17:42.612 --> 00:17:44.750 align:middle line:84%
The thing about the Pleiades,
this particular one,

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:48.200 align:middle line:84%
is that though they
were fourth dimensional,

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.990 align:middle line:84%
they were very
aware of what it was

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:52.490 align:middle line:90%
like to be third dimensional.

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:53.740 align:middle line:90%
They knew what that was.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.940 align:middle line:90%
That's why I was assigned there.

00:17:55.940 --> 00:18:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And so much of my training was
to first be fourth dimensional

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:05.050 align:middle line:84%
and then to learn how
to slowly come down.

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:08.130 align:middle line:84%
But once I learned how to be
the fourth dimensional there

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:10.030 align:middle line:84%
and got kind of a
real rough idea, which

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:12.590 align:middle line:84%
was basically
nothing, I then had

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:15.090 align:middle line:84%
to go to a much lower level
of fourth dimensional,

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:19.220 align:middle line:84%
which was Sirius
and there to work

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:21.710 align:middle line:84%
on a much lower
level of that and was

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:27.732 align:middle line:84%
sent to study from the orca
whales that were there.

00:18:27.732 --> 00:18:32.940 align:middle line:84%
I remember one particular
one, the history

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:35.490 align:middle line:84%
and what it was like
to be a human being.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:38.260 align:middle line:84%
Slowly studying all of
that took a long time.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't have time to
tell my entire life.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.440 align:middle line:90%
It looks like a long time.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:48.210 align:middle line:84%
But I'm real familiar
with the fourth dimension,

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:52.209 align:middle line:84%
at least from what
I learned of it.

00:18:52.209 --> 00:18:54.250 align:middle line:84%
I guess I'm saying really,
kind of bragging here.

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:55.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm real familiar with fourth.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.060 align:middle line:84%
There are certain areas
in the fourth dimension

00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:59.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm familiar with.

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:02.680 align:middle line:84%
There are some areas I am
a lot less familiar with.

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:06.610 align:middle line:90%
It is a vast, vast realm.

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:13.790 align:middle line:84%
But from what I remember,
you won't be sorry

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:15.609 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to
the fourth dimension.

00:19:15.609 --> 00:19:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And leaving here, I
don't think that you'll

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.094 align:middle line:90%
be sad once you get there.

00:19:20.094 --> 00:19:20.894 align:middle line:90%
>>Do you eat?

00:19:20.894 --> 00:19:21.694 align:middle line:90%
Do you eat food?

00:19:21.694 --> 00:19:23.800 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:27.120 align:middle line:84%
A fourth dimensional body does
need fire, earth, air and water

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:32.050 align:middle line:84%
and ether, which means that
you still need to take in prana

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:37.170 align:middle line:84%
and you need
microscopic elements.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:39.380 align:middle line:90%
You don't eat.

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:43.142 align:middle line:84%
But there is a certain intake
of very extremely small amounts

00:19:43.142 --> 00:19:43.942 align:middle line:90%
of elements.

00:19:43.942 --> 00:19:47.390 align:middle line:90%


00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:50.300 align:middle line:90%
But other than that, that's it.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And there's no
struggle to get that.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.870 align:middle line:90%
It's always there and available.

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:58.630 align:middle line:90%
It's easy.

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:03.850 align:middle line:84%
But anything higher
than that, you

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:08.060 align:middle line:84%
don't even need to intake
product like we do now.

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:08.950 align:middle line:90%
It's different.

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:13.450 align:middle line:90%


00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:16.532 align:middle line:84%
>>Drunvalo, I have
a question regarding

00:20:16.532 --> 00:20:20.810 align:middle line:84%
when we do the shift over if
my understanding is correct.

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:22.220 align:middle line:90%
OK, is this better?

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:26.160 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is that
in doing the Merkaba,

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.160 align:middle line:84%
the idea behind
that, in spinning,

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.810 align:middle line:90%
is to retain memory consciously.

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:33.390 align:middle line:84%
We will, when we go over and
make that change, that shift,

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:34.380 align:middle line:90%
we will remember.

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, if we aren't in our
Merkaba, we won't remember,

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.760 align:middle line:90%
we won't have memory?

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.460 align:middle line:84%
>>Well that's the normal
rules of the game.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Again, we have a
unique situation here.

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.090 align:middle line:84%
If something like what
he's talking about here,

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:52.320 align:middle line:84%
where the Earth gets to a
level-- which is outrageous--

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.380 align:middle line:84%
but if it gets to the level
where it creates an Earth

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:58.740 align:middle line:84%
Merkaba and takes us with
it or something like that,

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.950 align:middle line:90%
then you'll be in one.

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:03.944 align:middle line:84%
But you may not be in
your individual one.

00:21:03.944 --> 00:21:08.810 align:middle line:84%
The individual one would
be necessary for what?

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:11.730 align:middle line:84%
It's necessary if we do what
we think it's going to do,

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:13.730 align:middle line:84%
which we're going to go
from here to the fourth.

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Then you'll need
that first step.

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And then some Merkaba is
going to be necessary.

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:22.180 align:middle line:84%
If you start merging with
higher and higher consciousness

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:25.360 align:middle line:84%
levels, then you're really going
to be taking on their Merkaba

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.585 align:middle line:84%
field or that Merkaba
field, whatever that higher

00:21:27.585 --> 00:21:28.710 align:middle line:90%
dimensional level would be.

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:37.276 align:middle line:90%


00:21:37.276 --> 00:21:38.650 align:middle line:84%
>>I think this is
a question I've

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:41.510 align:middle line:84%
been wanting to ask
for a while, that I've

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:44.170 align:middle line:90%
studied under a master.

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:45.310 align:middle line:90%
I've heard of masters.

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:48.776 align:middle line:84%
Now Jesus actually
demonstrated his abilities.

00:21:48.776 --> 00:21:52.460 align:middle line:84%
But never have I seen anyone
demonstrate their abilities.

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And I was wondering
if it's possible

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:57.110 align:middle line:84%
or why don't they
demonstrate their abilities?

00:21:57.110 --> 00:22:00.108 align:middle line:84%
Can you show us one
of the possibilities?

00:22:00.108 --> 00:22:02.934 align:middle line:90%


00:22:02.934 --> 00:22:03.850 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, I'll tell you.

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:09.010 align:middle line:84%
I definitely wouldn't
do that on video camera.

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:16.464 align:middle line:90%


00:22:16.464 --> 00:22:19.462 align:middle line:90%
And you ask why.

00:22:19.462 --> 00:22:20.930 align:middle line:90%
>>I say turn them off.

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:31.510 align:middle line:90%


00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:34.650 align:middle line:90%
>>It's not the best thing to do.

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:38.330 align:middle line:90%


00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:41.020 align:middle line:84%
You could think
that you are ready.

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:43.050 align:middle line:84%
You could think that you
could accept anything.

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:48.290 align:middle line:84%
You could think that
anything could come your way

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:50.090 align:middle line:90%
and you'd just be fine.

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:53.630 align:middle line:84%
But you might be amazed what
that would do to someone

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:55.065 align:middle line:90%
if they were not quite ready.

00:22:55.065 --> 00:22:57.680 align:middle line:90%


00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:00.850 align:middle line:84%
This is just a
quick little story.

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:05.290 align:middle line:84%
My sister and I,
and Ken Page also,

00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:13.870 align:middle line:84%
have been visited by the Chief
of the Taos Pueblo for 35 years

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:17.910 align:middle line:84%
every Christmas or more and come
with his family and everything,

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:20.460 align:middle line:90%
and would come and visit us.

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:26.182 align:middle line:84%
Because they know who my sister
is and who Ken is because we

00:23:26.182 --> 00:23:27.640 align:middle line:84%
were all part of
that tribe before.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And they know exactly who we
are and they recognize us.

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And they used to take my
sister for about one month out

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:41.030 align:middle line:84%
of every year for about
10 years and initiate her

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:44.660 align:middle line:84%
into the Pueblos, into
the ancient rites,

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:49.486 align:middle line:84%
which they don't even allow
Taos females to go in it,

00:23:49.486 --> 00:23:51.580 align:middle line:90%
let alone a white female.

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:57.160 align:middle line:84%
But they allowed her to go in
there and do the initiations.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Only a handful of
people are allowed

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:10.220 align:middle line:84%
to know the inner meanings of
what these things are about.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And one day my sister was
sitting in a field on the Taos

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:21.737 align:middle line:90%
Pueblo way out somewhere.

00:24:21.737 --> 00:24:22.820 align:middle line:90%
I don't know where it was.

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:25.580 align:middle line:84%
But it was just out on
the field out there.

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And they were under a
tree or near a tree.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And they were in a
crowd of about five

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:39.590 align:middle line:84%
or six American Indians and my
sister, this little white girl.

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:43.300 align:middle line:90%


00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And while they were
standing there,

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:52.872 align:middle line:84%
this Spanish man came across
the fields and came up.

00:24:52.872 --> 00:24:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And he wasn't
supposed to be there.

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:56.310 align:middle line:84%
It was illegal for
him to be there.

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:57.670 align:middle line:90%
But he did it anyway.

00:24:57.670 --> 00:24:59.600 align:middle line:84%
And he came across the
fields and he saw them.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And the Indians were
teaching my sister something.

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:04.590 align:middle line:84%
But when the Spanish
man came up, of course,

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:06.678 align:middle line:84%
they just stopped
and acted like hi,

00:25:06.678 --> 00:25:09.476 align:middle line:84%
how're you doing, nothing
going on, stuff like that.

00:25:09.476 --> 00:25:11.684 align:middle line:84%
And he came in and kind of
got in the middle of them.

00:25:11.684 --> 00:25:13.883 align:middle line:90%
And an accident occurred.

00:25:13.883 --> 00:25:17.240 align:middle line:90%


00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:18.430 align:middle line:90%
It was really rare.

00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:19.790 align:middle line:90%
It was a fluke.

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:23.290 align:middle line:90%


00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:27.930 align:middle line:84%
One of the people in the
pueblos down inside the kiva

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:32.700 align:middle line:84%
decided they needed to go
over and talk to this group.

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And so they made themselves
about this little

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:38.552 align:middle line:84%
but in a little bubble and
shot out through the thing

00:25:38.552 --> 00:25:40.760 align:middle line:84%
very quickly and came flying
in over the top of them,

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.622 align:middle line:84%
and came right in and
came right up on a branch,

00:25:43.622 --> 00:25:45.830 align:middle line:84%
rested right on a branch
right in front of the group.

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:49.250 align:middle line:90%


00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:55.650 align:middle line:84%
The Spanish man just
about went insane.

00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:59.472 align:middle line:90%
He just about lost it.

00:25:59.472 --> 00:26:02.120 align:middle line:90%
They almost lost this guy.

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they
immediately made it go away.

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:05.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was like,
that was too late.

00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:06.210 align:middle line:90%
He saw it.

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:08.020 align:middle line:90%
He saw it with his eyes.

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:11.500 align:middle line:84%
And my sister said it
was really, really,

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.080 align:middle line:84%
really traumatic
for this person.

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:16.080 align:middle line:90%


00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is outside
the belief patterns.

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:19.630 align:middle line:84%
This is outside of
what's supposed to be

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:23.170 align:middle line:90%
or what is not supposed to be.

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And so the only way that I
could do something like that

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:44.830 align:middle line:90%
is if higher self did it.

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:48.656 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not getting
a yes on that at all.

00:26:48.656 --> 00:26:49.456 align:middle line:90%
>>Not surprised.

00:26:49.456 --> 00:26:56.510 align:middle line:90%


00:26:56.510 --> 00:27:04.050 align:middle line:84%
>>In fact, with the Tibetan
that allowed himself

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:07.610 align:middle line:84%
to be videoed with
"Omni" magazine recently,

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:11.650 align:middle line:84%
doing that whole thing, I
could hardly believe it.

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:14.300 align:middle line:90%
I can just hardly believe it.

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:16.335 align:middle line:84%
But he did it, did
it right for them

00:27:16.335 --> 00:27:17.610 align:middle line:90%
in front of the whole thing.

00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:20.100 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:23.778 align:middle line:84%
You need to reach this
state on your own.

00:27:23.778 --> 00:27:26.530 align:middle line:90%


00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And so usually if
the teacher was

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:33.250 align:middle line:84%
going to take
someone up on a ledge

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:35.774 align:middle line:84%
and have them dry
those blankets,

00:27:35.774 --> 00:27:38.190 align:middle line:84%
they're not going to have any
of the other students there.

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:41.690 align:middle line:84%
A person needs to reach
that state on their own,

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:50.080 align:middle line:84%
from their own understanding
and their own abilities.

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And yet maybe that's
not always true.

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:55.772 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there are cases
where a certain student

00:27:55.772 --> 00:28:01.070 align:middle line:84%
or a certain person may be
allowed to directly experience

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:02.380 align:middle line:90%
those kinds of things.

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>>Jesus did regularly in
front of hundreds of people.

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:11.210 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, he did.

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:13.210 align:middle line:84%
There was actually
only one that he

00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:22.560 align:middle line:84%
did that was direct--
direct meaning

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:28.950 align:middle line:84%
something that the mind
could not rationalize away

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:36.362 align:middle line:84%
as coincidence or coming
from some other source

00:28:36.362 --> 00:28:37.320 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:39.880 align:middle line:84%
In other words, he
would heal someone.

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.750 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't see anything
happen, you know what I mean?

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:45.620 align:middle line:84%
It didn't appear to go
outside of the laws.

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:51.870 align:middle line:84%
However, turning water into
wine is definitely doing that.

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:55.042 align:middle line:84%
And I do feel that
we need to do that.

00:28:55.042 --> 00:28:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And I've had lots of experiences
like this in my life.

00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:02.872 align:middle line:90%
But you can't do that.

00:29:02.872 --> 00:29:06.277 align:middle line:90%


00:29:06.277 --> 00:29:08.110 align:middle line:84%
I've got it, at least
in my belief patterns,

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:12.960 align:middle line:84%
that I don't turn them
on from my lower self.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.980 align:middle line:84%
They're turned on
from higher self.

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:20.608 align:middle line:90%


00:29:20.608 --> 00:29:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like a TM
person that could levitate.

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.710 align:middle line:84%
If you couldn't do it, I had
one lady, a friend of mine,

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:29.251 align:middle line:84%
that was able to go
up to the ceiling

00:29:29.251 --> 00:29:31.956 align:middle line:84%
and sit there for half an
hour and come back down.

00:29:31.956 --> 00:29:33.700 align:middle line:90%
She lives in New York.

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:35.640 align:middle line:90%
And She's not going to do that.

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:38.410 align:middle line:84%
She's not going down to
the supermarket to do that.

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:40.960 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that would cause--

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>>Seeing something
like that, though,

00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:45.236 align:middle line:84%
has a way of breaking
the conceptual reality

00:29:45.236 --> 00:29:47.548 align:middle line:84%
like this five day
course has done.

00:29:47.548 --> 00:29:51.460 align:middle line:90%


00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:58.230 align:middle line:84%
>>If Maharajah has a group
of people, would he not let

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:00.750 align:middle line:90%
the whole group go at once.

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:05.569 align:middle line:90%
In other words, he didn't--

00:30:05.569 --> 00:30:06.860 align:middle line:90%
>>He didn't display his cities.

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:08.985 align:middle line:84%
He often said that it
doesn't matter what I can do.

00:30:08.985 --> 00:30:11.300 align:middle line:90%
It matters what you can do.

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:14.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't want me to be
tested scientifically.

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.037 align:middle line:84%
I want your brainwaves
to be tested.

00:30:16.037 --> 00:30:20.927 align:middle line:84%
Because that's proof for the
population, not what I can do.

00:30:20.927 --> 00:30:24.300 align:middle line:84%
He also said stuff like,
"to me, since the display

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:28.060 align:middle line:84%
of any kind of city sets
up this master disciple.

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And you're trying to show
us that you're one of us

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:33.340 align:middle line:84%
even though you've had
very profound experiences.

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:35.370 align:middle line:84%
This is the time for
mass [INAUDIBLE]."

00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:36.920 align:middle line:90%
>>I really agree.

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:44.360 align:middle line:84%
Besides that, I
happen to-- I guess

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.990 align:middle line:84%
I have to be tied up,
I guess, behind here.

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:48.240 align:middle line:90%
Definitely, I can't even move.

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:52.160 align:middle line:90%


00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.160 align:middle line:90%
What was I going to say?

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:59.310 align:middle line:90%


00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>>Jesus needed to do it because
people back then didn't have

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.880 align:middle line:90%
the awareness that we have now.

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.560 align:middle line:84%
They needed to be
shocked into a reality

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:09.290 align:middle line:84%
that these things are
possible, that miracles happen.

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:11.620 align:middle line:84%
Because he had to do
things quickly to start

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:14.500 align:middle line:90%
moving the consciousness fast.

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:16.564 align:middle line:90%
So the miracles shocked people.

00:31:16.564 --> 00:31:18.410 align:middle line:84%
But here, we don't
really need that.

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:19.243 align:middle line:90%
We're more advanced.

00:31:19.243 --> 00:31:21.650 align:middle line:90%


00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>>There was a
negative side thing

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:26.656 align:middle line:84%
that happened with all
the miracles that he did.

00:31:26.656 --> 00:31:30.680 align:middle line:84%
He did so many
outstanding things

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:34.440 align:middle line:84%
that people believed that
only he could do them.

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.790 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:40.430 align:middle line:84%
>>And that's what
my parents believe.

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:42.020 align:middle line:90%
We can't do that.

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:43.520 align:middle line:90%
Only he can do that.

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:44.450 align:middle line:90%
And yet, he came here.

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:47.808 align:middle line:84%
He said, "I came here to show
you the possibilities of man."

00:31:47.808 --> 00:31:50.266 align:middle line:84%
And things that I can do, you
could even do greater things.

00:31:50.266 --> 00:31:51.066 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:31:51.066 --> 00:31:53.850 align:middle line:84%
>>Not one Christian hears
that, except for a few

00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:57.230 align:middle line:84%
like Saint Francis
and a few other ones

00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:59.080 align:middle line:90%
that really heard that.

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.680 align:middle line:90%
But he wasn't trying to do that.

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:05.540 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless, he had
to show the possibilities--

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:09.060 align:middle line:84%
and he did-- that
it is possible.

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:12.530 align:middle line:84%
But it had an incredible
negative effect.

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:15.180 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think
it's a good idea.

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:16.146 align:middle line:90%
I really don't.

00:32:16.146 --> 00:32:19.530 align:middle line:90%


00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:21.220 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:23.650 align:middle line:84%
>>Will you finish your
teaching and make comment

00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:29.120 align:middle line:84%
about children and at what
age do children become adults

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:32.260 align:middle line:84%
and then they need to learn
to do the Merkaba themselves?

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:36.080 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, it's my
experience that children

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:39.850 align:middle line:84%
becomes an adult on their
12th birthday or right

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:44.352 align:middle line:84%
around that time, that
something happens to that child.

00:32:44.352 --> 00:32:47.338 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not exactly
sure what it is.

00:32:47.338 --> 00:32:53.686 align:middle line:90%
But they become different.

00:32:53.686 --> 00:33:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And the forgetting begins to
happen very rapidly after that.

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:05.800 align:middle line:84%
But before then-- and
this is another thing

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:09.390 align:middle line:84%
that Diana Gazes was saying,
was that the healing process

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:11.760 align:middle line:84%
on children if
they're under 12 years

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.600 align:middle line:84%
old, that when
they're under 12 years

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:19.130 align:middle line:84%
old, that there are many
miraculous healings that take

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:21.940 align:middle line:90%
place from children-- a lot.

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:26.460 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as they get over
12 years old, they stop.

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>>But do we have to teach
young people over 12

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:33.980 align:middle line:90%
to create the Merkaba?

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:34.900 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh I want to.

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:35.700 align:middle line:90%
But I can't.

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:37.720 align:middle line:90%
Because it's not my job.

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:40.110 align:middle line:84%
If anybody wants to, I'll
do everything I can to help.

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:43.390 align:middle line:90%


00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:47.530 align:middle line:84%
>>Before 12 that they can
remember from their past lives?

00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:54.940 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm not really sure if that's
the place to start or not.

00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:57.450 align:middle line:84%
If there was some kind of
real simple way of teaching

00:33:57.450 --> 00:34:00.240 align:middle line:84%
or something, or maybe if we
got a little bit further down

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:03.140 align:middle line:84%
the line as a planet and
opened up a little bit more,

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:08.360 align:middle line:84%
where demonstrations would
be acceptable on all kinds

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:15.219 align:middle line:84%
of levels, then I
could see that easily.

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:17.090 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if children
were simply allowed

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:20.620 align:middle line:84%
to be who they really are,
it might work the other way

00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:21.949 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:34:21.949 --> 00:34:25.949 align:middle line:84%
>>If they're under 12,
do they automatically go?

00:34:25.949 --> 00:34:26.840 align:middle line:90%
The angels take them?

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, when all this
starts happening,

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:33.365 align:middle line:84%
they'll just remember,
oh yeah, I just did this.

00:34:33.365 --> 00:34:34.989 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have
to worry about them.

00:34:34.989 --> 00:34:37.960 align:middle line:90%
They'll just do it, no problem.

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.590 align:middle line:90%


00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:46.760 align:middle line:84%
>>This is in reference to
the lack of experiences

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:48.320 align:middle line:90%
of unusual phenomena.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.659 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that's
really the case.

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:53.400 align:middle line:84%
Because how many times
have we experienced

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:56.940 align:middle line:84%
and said we got
things done in no time

00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:01.800 align:middle line:84%
and when you go around
looking for a parking space

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.560 align:middle line:90%
and it just emerges.

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:06.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are just as
miraculous kinds of things,

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:06.870 align:middle line:90%
I would think.

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:08.430 align:middle line:90%
>>Or we get the [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:10.840 align:middle line:84%
>>Or we get [INAUDIBLE]
from [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.170 align:middle line:90%
>>Especially in New York City.

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:15.460 align:middle line:90%


00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:16.950 align:middle line:84%
>>There are a lot
of little things

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:19.840 align:middle line:84%
that we don't even
give half a thought to.

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:22.092 align:middle line:84%
But we are quite
miraculous really.

00:35:22.092 --> 00:35:22.936 align:middle line:90%
>>That's right.

00:35:22.936 --> 00:35:28.180 align:middle line:90%


00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:30.700 align:middle line:90%
>>I have a few short questions.

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:34.605 align:middle line:84%
And I also want to
honor your time.

00:35:34.605 --> 00:35:35.440 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm here.

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:36.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm here [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.190 align:middle line:90%
I can't even leave the chair.

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:41.210 align:middle line:90%


00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:42.910 align:middle line:90%
It's up to you.

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:45.930 align:middle line:84%
All I need to know is when you
want to close and I'll close.

00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:50.030 align:middle line:84%
>>Has the teaching been
complete at this time

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.997 align:middle line:90%
besides the questions?

00:35:50.997 --> 00:35:56.070 align:middle line:90%


00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:57.040 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, I think so.

00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.330 align:middle line:90%


00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:03.960 align:middle line:84%
I think yeah, I feel
it's all in there now.

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>>OK, one question is
the geometric language--

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:14.710 align:middle line:84%
how far does that go
into the dimensions?

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:17.496 align:middle line:84%
>>Somebody asked that
question not too long ago.

00:36:17.496 --> 00:36:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>>Somebody already
asked that question.

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:20.530 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, I'll answer it again.

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:21.863 align:middle line:90%
>>Sorry if it's the second time.

00:36:21.863 --> 00:36:24.460 align:middle line:84%
>>The geometry stretches
through all dimensional levels

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:25.290 align:middle line:90%
whatsoever.

00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:26.090 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:28.131 align:middle line:84%
>>That's what created all
the dimensional levels.

00:36:28.131 --> 00:36:32.850 align:middle line:84%
However, the geometry may not
be from dimension to dimension.

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:36.580 align:middle line:90%


00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:39.130 align:middle line:84%
But there is a similarity, like
the difference between a two

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:44.770 align:middle line:84%
dimensional flat surface and
a three dimensional object

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:46.880 align:middle line:90%
is really very different.

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:48.490 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very different.

00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:51.960 align:middle line:84%
But it's recognizable what
the two dimensional one

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:54.460 align:middle line:90%
is, the three dimensional one.

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to see
a three dimensional one

00:36:56.610 --> 00:36:58.430 align:middle line:84%
relative to a four
dimensional one,

00:36:58.430 --> 00:37:00.570 align:middle line:84%
it would be more
distorted in certain ways

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:03.880 align:middle line:84%
if you're thinking along
mathematical lines.

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:06.110 align:middle line:84%
But you would still
kind of get the feel.

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:10.060 align:middle line:84%
But if you go way up in
the dimensions or way down

00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:12.420 align:middle line:84%
and not thinking in terms
of mathematical models

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:15.340 align:middle line:84%
but rather in wavelength
in dimensional things,

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:17.160 align:middle line:84%
they really do
change dramatically.

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:20.450 align:middle line:84%
But there was only one
pattern, the pattern

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:24.190 align:middle line:84%
that is now existing around your
body in the third dimension.

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Though it is a third
dimensional pattern here

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:29.420 align:middle line:84%
in the third dimension,
it's the same one

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:32.620 align:middle line:84%
that creates everything
no matter where you are.

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>>OK, the 32 ascended masters
that you spoke of-- I'm

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:42.172 align:middle line:84%
wondering, was there a purpose
of the 32 rather than being 33,

00:37:42.172 --> 00:37:46.230 align:middle line:90%
or of the 32 equaling five.

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:52.220 align:middle line:84%
>>I think that they chose
32 because the teachers that

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:53.880 align:middle line:90%
were-- this is a guess.

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:56.390 align:middle line:84%
I've got to pull a
guess out on this one.

00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:59.110 align:middle line:84%
But I did kind of think
about this before.

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And there were 32
Syrian members that

00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:07.990 align:middle line:84%
started our race, that
was the father race.

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think that they chose
that size because that

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:19.550 align:middle line:90%
was who was teaching them this.

00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:21.565 align:middle line:84%
But that's the only
reason I could say.

00:38:21.565 --> 00:38:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Other than that, I don't
know why they chose 32.

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:25.260 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And I've been
experiencing, rather

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:31.850 align:middle line:84%
than this leaving
the third dimension

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:34.220 align:middle line:84%
and moving to the fourth,
I've been experiencing

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:39.160 align:middle line:84%
an overlapping of the fourth
and fifth are here already.

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And I've been seeing beautiful
visions of what's ahead,

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:52.530 align:middle line:84%
of the children, the educational
system, and the living

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:55.320 align:middle line:84%
possibilities, and the
cooperative and the harmony,

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.760 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:58.740 align:middle line:90%
And I know it's here.

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:00.370 align:middle line:90%
I know that it's here.

00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:10.550 align:middle line:84%
So I know you mentioned that
one group would be staying here.

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:14.050 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps this is
already happening.

00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>You mean, we've
already shifted?

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:18.970 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, the shift is
already in process.

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:21.060 align:middle line:84%
There's an overlapping
already occurring.

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:23.470 align:middle line:84%
>>There is an overlapping
of certain energies

00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:24.615 align:middle line:90%
as we approach this.

00:39:24.615 --> 00:39:25.415 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:39:25.415 --> 00:39:27.621 align:middle line:90%
There's a certain overlapping.

00:39:27.621 --> 00:39:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And the process
is well underway.

00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:35.970 align:middle line:84%
But there is a
very distinct time.

00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:38.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we will come to a place
where our thoughts will become

00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:41.010 align:middle line:84%
more and more
powerful, our feelings

00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:42.480 align:middle line:84%
will become more
and more powerful,

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:45.580 align:middle line:84%
the manifestation in this
reality as we approach then

00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:48.540 align:middle line:84%
becomes more and more
powerful if we can control it,

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:51.000 align:middle line:84%
if we can control
our emotions and be

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.960 align:middle line:84%
in a Merkaba and these kinds
of things, we can focus,

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:56.925 align:middle line:84%
we could-- you say--
feel an overlapping.

00:39:56.925 --> 00:40:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And all the energies are
going that direction.

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:05.750 align:middle line:84%
But there will come a day
of a very distinct change.

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:06.940 align:middle line:90%
And you'll know.

00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:10.510 align:middle line:84%
You'll say, this is definitely
different than what was before.

00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm
referring to in time.

00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:18.690 align:middle line:84%
But it's just like
all the pyramids

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:21.580 align:middle line:84%
were built first in the fourth
dimensional level of the Earth.

00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And then we coincided
with their structures

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:27.050 align:middle line:90%
on the third dimensional level.

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:29.780 align:middle line:84%
The reality has
been already created

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:30.820 align:middle line:90%
on the fourth dimension.

00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:38.330 align:middle line:84%
This dream that we all want and
that we all have agreed upon

00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:41.720 align:middle line:84%
is already functioning
on the fourth dimension.

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:45.396 align:middle line:84%
And I think that you're just
tuning to it and feeling it.

00:40:45.396 --> 00:40:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>>And just one comment and then
I'll go to these eager hands.

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:54.140 align:middle line:84%
I just want to mention
that the dolphin trips

00:40:54.140 --> 00:41:00.410 align:middle line:84%
that I get information about
have been keenly lined up

00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:02.680 align:middle line:90%
with specific dates.

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it has
to do with grid work

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:11.610 align:middle line:84%
and specific information about
specific grid lines, et cetera.

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And I've been told that
when people come back,

00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:19.630 align:middle line:84%
that they are like
light vortexes

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:21.220 align:middle line:90%
and they have the options.

00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:23.010 align:middle line:84%
There's specific
information that

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:25.950 align:middle line:84%
comes in about what
they can do, and always

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:27.590 align:middle line:90%
be a choice, of course.

00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:33.700 align:middle line:84%
But it's like there is
a lot of grid work going

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:38.200 align:middle line:84%
on with many other people also,
with many other ventures going

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.420 align:middle line:90%
out in different areas.

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if you would
want to comment on that at all.

00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:45.960 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:51.140 align:middle line:84%
Most of the grid work of the
planet was done prior to 1989.

00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:52.320 align:middle line:90%
There was a period of time.

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:55.620 align:middle line:90%


00:41:55.620 --> 00:42:00.890 align:middle line:84%
Most of it started in about the
1980s and went to about 1989.

00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And specifically specially
in '84, '85, '86 ad '87,

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:09.690 align:middle line:84%
there were thousands and
thousands and thousands

00:42:09.690 --> 00:42:12.740 align:middle line:84%
of people all over the world
that were drawn to sacred sites

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:15.862 align:middle line:84%
all over the world who had these
crystals and all these things

00:42:15.862 --> 00:42:17.820 align:middle line:84%
and didn't know why they
were doing these guys.

00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:21.590 align:middle line:84%
And you guys are
probably a lot of them.

00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:23.470 align:middle line:84%
And had to go there
and make chants and all

00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:26.170 align:middle line:84%
these other things, and
walk around pyramids,

00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:28.375 align:middle line:84%
and wondering why
you were doing it.

00:42:28.375 --> 00:42:30.070 align:middle line:90%
But you know you had to do it.

00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:34.712 align:middle line:84%
And that was the final
alignment and setting up

00:42:34.712 --> 00:42:37.050 align:middle line:84%
of all these sites that
were around the world.

00:42:37.050 --> 00:42:38.460 align:middle line:90%
And it was real important.

00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And then when the grid finally
was activated, it became alive

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:43.280 align:middle line:90%
and completed.

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:46.480 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was
February 4th of 1989.

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:50.405 align:middle line:84%
Then it was actually
there and completed.

00:42:50.405 --> 00:42:56.470 align:middle line:84%
What's now occurring is
very fine level tuning.

00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:58.750 align:middle line:84%
It's really minute
tuning that doesn't

00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:02.820 align:middle line:84%
require the numbers of people
that there were before.

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:04.570 align:middle line:84%
There was probably at
least 100,000 people

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:05.990 align:middle line:90%
doing that or more.

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:09.870 align:middle line:84%
At this point, it's really
just handfuls of people

00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:13.730 align:middle line:84%
who, because of the rapid
changes in the grid,

00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:15.955 align:middle line:84%
have to go in there
and every once

00:43:15.955 --> 00:43:19.227 align:middle line:84%
in a while, align
something here,

00:43:19.227 --> 00:43:21.270 align:middle line:84%
align something
there, which usually

00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:24.710 align:middle line:84%
means being physically on a
certain place in the Earth

00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:31.030 align:middle line:84%
and doing something that
usually comes from within that

00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:34.130 align:middle line:90%
tells you what to do.

00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And so there's really not a
lot of that going on right now.

00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:41.734 align:middle line:90%
What is going on is important.

00:43:41.734 --> 00:43:43.900 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean because
there's not much going on,

00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:44.830 align:middle line:90%
it isn't important.

00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:47.410 align:middle line:84%
But there just isn't
anything at all like what

00:43:47.410 --> 00:43:48.880 align:middle line:90%
was happening for a while.

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And I don't foresee there
ever being any for a long time

00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:58.380 align:middle line:84%
because the hard work
has all taken place.

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:01.060 align:middle line:90%


00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:04.030 align:middle line:84%
>>In reference to your speaking
about the power of two joining

00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:08.960 align:middle line:84%
together in the Merkaba, do
you see that there would ever

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:12.200 align:middle line:84%
be any need or any purpose
served by a large number,

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:14.490 align:middle line:84%
such as those of
us in this room,

00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:17.690 align:middle line:84%
joining together
on this dimension?

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:19.890 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, that's not
for me to decide.

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:22.920 align:middle line:90%


00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:26.370 align:middle line:84%
But if I could ever foresee,
sure, I could foresee.

00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:30.430 align:middle line:84%
There must be a reason why
the information was given

00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:32.190 align:middle line:90%
and why the Earth is using it.

00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:35.010 align:middle line:84%
So I assume that
there is a time coming

00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:37.300 align:middle line:90%
when we are going to use it.

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:38.370 align:middle line:90%
It said we would use it.

00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:39.980 align:middle line:84%
So I think we're
going to use it.

00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And so what I see,
initially though-- I

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:47.030 align:middle line:84%
can't see much beyond it--
is small groups of 10,

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:51.550 align:middle line:84%
12, and that kind of
area or maybe more,

00:44:51.550 --> 00:44:56.570 align:middle line:84%
joining together, though there
may be some real large groups.

00:44:56.570 --> 00:44:58.595 align:middle line:90%
It requires one person's spine.

00:44:58.595 --> 00:45:01.620 align:middle line:90%


00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And the group
chooses this person.

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And the person isn't
really the leader.

00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:07.280 align:middle line:90%
They just got to use a spine.

00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:09.750 align:middle line:90%
That's why they use Duncan.

00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:11.320 align:middle line:90%
They use Duncan's spine.

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:13.230 align:middle line:84%
It requires a human
spine to set up

00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:17.450 align:middle line:84%
the Merkaba or a spine, a
dolphin spine or a whale pine.

00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:19.450 align:middle line:90%
It's the nature of the thing.

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:23.330 align:middle line:84%
It requires a living
person at the center.

00:45:23.330 --> 00:45:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And the dolphins
do the same thing.

00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:29.160 align:middle line:84%
They choose one of
them to be the leader.

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And then they each have
their individual Merkabas.

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And then they set up a
group Merkaba, a huge one,

00:45:36.130 --> 00:45:38.460 align:middle line:84%
that the whole group
is connected to,

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:40.080 align:middle line:84%
and the same way
with the whales.

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:43.469 align:middle line:84%
And this is also why it has a
certain downfall in the way.

00:45:43.469 --> 00:45:45.260 align:middle line:84%
There's always positive
and negative things

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:46.060 align:middle line:90%
with everything.

00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:47.850 align:middle line:90%
We're in that kind of world.

00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:52.380 align:middle line:84%
When one of the whales comes
in and beaches themselves,

00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:56.180 align:middle line:84%
ones ten miles back
come in a little while

00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:59.660 align:middle line:84%
later and come slamming
into the same beach.

00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:02.760 align:middle line:84%
Because they're following
this one aspect and they've

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:07.680 align:middle line:84%
chosen that as
their center core.

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:15.249 align:middle line:84%
But there's no
longer individualism

00:46:15.249 --> 00:46:16.540 align:middle line:90%
when you use the group Merkaba.

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:19.170 align:middle line:90%


00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:21.340 align:middle line:84%
If there was a group of
12 people here right now

00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:23.980 align:middle line:84%
and they set up a group
Merkaba, they picked one of them

00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:28.240 align:middle line:84%
and set up the fields and they
did it, and if it was real,

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:31.910 align:middle line:84%
their individualness
is gone forever.

00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:36.600 align:middle line:84%
They are now one
spirit with 12 bodies.

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And they have same spirit
in each one of them.

00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Lots of people do this
all over the universe.

00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:46.180 align:middle line:90%
And it's not unusual.

00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:48.890 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to be
ready to do such a thing.

00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if
we're quite ready there.

00:46:52.330 --> 00:46:53.370 align:middle line:90%
>>Soon.

00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:54.170 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:58.856 align:middle line:90%


00:46:58.856 --> 00:47:00.314 align:middle line:90%
Use our personality?

00:47:00.314 --> 00:47:02.820 align:middle line:84%
>>No, your personalities
stay there.

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:11.750 align:middle line:84%
But a single interpretation
of the reality

00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:13.100 align:middle line:90%
is the same with all of them.

00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:25.471 align:middle line:90%


00:47:25.471 --> 00:47:27.220 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever watched
a whole lot of birds

00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:28.430 align:middle line:90%
fly through the sky?

00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:29.230 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:34.046 align:middle line:90%


00:47:34.046 --> 00:47:35.170 align:middle line:90%
>>Birds aren't individuals.

00:47:35.170 --> 00:47:36.830 align:middle line:90%
It's a spirit.

00:47:36.830 --> 00:47:40.417 align:middle line:84%
One spirit, one consciousness,
is moving through them all.

00:47:40.417 --> 00:47:43.770 align:middle line:90%


00:47:43.770 --> 00:47:46.830 align:middle line:84%
You get hungry and
you all get hungry.

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:49.600 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:50.690 align:middle line:90%
It's time to eat.

00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:51.490 align:middle line:90%
It's time to sleep.

00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:54.140 align:middle line:90%


00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And just like in
your own body, you've

00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:57.930 align:middle line:84%
got millions of
millions of cells.

00:47:57.930 --> 00:47:59.202 align:middle line:90%
And they're all individual.

00:47:59.202 --> 00:48:00.410 align:middle line:90%
They all have their own jobs.

00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:01.860 align:middle line:84%
They're all doing
their own thing.

00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:05.600 align:middle line:90%
But you run through them all.

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:07.831 align:middle line:84%
Whoever you are, you
run thorough them all.

00:48:07.831 --> 00:48:10.420 align:middle line:90%


00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:12.510 align:middle line:84%
>>Would you do that if
there were 11 people?

00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:16.050 align:middle line:84%
Would you be directed to what
11 people to connect with?

00:48:16.050 --> 00:48:18.860 align:middle line:84%
Or would they be directed
to you? [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>>I don't have any
direction or desire

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:31.920 align:middle line:84%
to do that right now if the
time does not feel right.

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:34.680 align:middle line:84%
I did do three
workshops with groups

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:36.950 align:middle line:84%
which were not really to
link the groups together

00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:37.980 align:middle line:90%
but to do experiments.

00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And it was then that I began to
realize what was taking place

00:48:41.110 --> 00:48:42.720 align:middle line:90%
if we did this.

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:45.224 align:middle line:90%
And then it was a great dilemma.

00:48:45.224 --> 00:48:46.140 align:middle line:90%
How do you teach this?

00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:48.389 align:middle line:84%
Because if you teach it, you
become part of the group.

00:48:48.389 --> 00:48:54.470 align:middle line:90%


00:48:54.470 --> 00:49:05.420 align:middle line:84%
So I'm trying to see exactly
when the right time is

00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:06.960 align:middle line:90%
and what it's about.

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:09.950 align:middle line:84%
I just feel we're
not quite there yet.

00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:11.710 align:middle line:84%
A little bit further
down the line,

00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:13.629 align:middle line:84%
really soon, like
maybe next year.

00:49:13.629 --> 00:49:14.712 align:middle line:90%
>>Can you let us all know?

00:49:14.712 --> 00:49:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Or is there some people
you're just going to select?

00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:18.570 align:middle line:84%
>>I've got a feeling he'll
probably let me know.

00:49:18.570 --> 00:49:20.720 align:middle line:90%


00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:24.570 align:middle line:84%
>>Can you also refer to
the concept of ascension

00:49:24.570 --> 00:49:25.850 align:middle line:90%
as it's commonly known?

00:49:25.850 --> 00:49:29.060 align:middle line:84%
Is that simply establishing
the Merkaba field

00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:31.060 align:middle line:84%
and being able to
travel with it?

00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Or is that something
completely different?

00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:38.110 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, I thought I said that too.

00:49:38.110 --> 00:49:38.910 align:middle line:90%
What do you got?

00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Three things going
on here right now.

00:49:41.290 --> 00:49:43.300 align:middle line:90%
Someone right now can die.

00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:46.122 align:middle line:84%
If they die, they're going to
go through the normal thing.

00:49:46.122 --> 00:49:48.630 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
drop their body.

00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:51.490 align:middle line:84%
They'll move through
their astral body,

00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:53.594 align:middle line:84%
in a certain level,
go through the bardo.

00:49:53.594 --> 00:49:55.010 align:middle line:84%
They'll do their
[INAUDIBLE] step.

00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:58.790 align:middle line:84%
They'll come up under
about the third overtone

00:49:58.790 --> 00:50:00.190 align:middle line:90%
of the fourth dimension.

00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And they will exist there in
a life kind of like this one

00:50:06.070 --> 00:50:09.790 align:middle line:84%
but different until a
certain time, at which point

00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:12.930 align:middle line:84%
they will then consciously move
from there up to the higher

00:50:12.930 --> 00:50:13.730 align:middle line:90%
levels.

00:50:13.730 --> 00:50:16.870 align:middle line:84%
This is what, I mean,
in "Revelations" when

00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:19.850 align:middle line:84%
it was talking about,
"the dead would rise."

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:22.440 align:middle line:90%
And that's one possibility.

00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:26.510 align:middle line:84%
So if you're alive now and you
die, you still won the game.

00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:32.010 align:middle line:84%
If you happen to be aware
enough to be conscious,

00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:36.090 align:middle line:84%
in other words, die and
then through the death,

00:50:36.090 --> 00:50:41.590 align:middle line:84%
become aware of the Merkaba,
which is another possibility,

00:50:41.590 --> 00:50:45.550 align:middle line:84%
then you can move
from there consciously

00:50:45.550 --> 00:50:47.060 align:middle line:90%
through the great void.

00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And you don't go to
the third overtone.

00:50:50.850 --> 00:50:53.850 align:middle line:84%
You'll go all the way up to the
10th, 11th or 12th overtone.

00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:56.520 align:middle line:90%
And that's called resurrection.

00:50:56.520 --> 00:51:00.472 align:middle line:84%
And you'll reconstruct
your body with you

00:51:00.472 --> 00:51:02.430 align:middle line:84%
though you won't need
the one that you dropped.

00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Because you'll reconstruct
it in a different way.

00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:06.470 align:middle line:90%
So you don't really need--

00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:11.920 align:middle line:90%


00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:13.550 align:middle line:90%
That's a possibility.

00:51:13.550 --> 00:51:15.170 align:middle line:90%
And that one is very possible.

00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's the one that
most people will probably

00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:21.760 align:middle line:90%
do at this point.

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:23.380 align:middle line:84%
But there is
another possibility.

00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And because it's there,
life will use it.

00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:30.040 align:middle line:90%
And that is of ascension.

00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And ascension is different
in that you don't die.

00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:37.990 align:middle line:84%
There's no dying involved
in ascension at all.

00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:42.160 align:middle line:84%
You just choose the
moment or the moment

00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:45.370 align:middle line:84%
chooses you, in the case if
you wait til the last minute.

00:51:45.370 --> 00:51:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment,
you create your Merkaba

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:57.350 align:middle line:84%
before you die, in the world,
and raise your energy levels

00:51:57.350 --> 00:52:01.080 align:middle line:84%
and take the body with
you consciously, right

00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:03.860 align:middle line:84%
out of here, over
through the great void

00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:05.860 align:middle line:84%
and right up into the
higher dimensional levels.

00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:08.030 align:middle line:84%
But you all end up
in the same place.

00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:10.370 align:middle line:90%
So what difference does it make?

00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:14.740 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's
hundreds of thousands

00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:16.460 align:middle line:90%
of different crystal structures.

00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:18.585 align:middle line:90%
Which one's better?

00:52:18.585 --> 00:52:19.794 align:middle line:90%
It isn't better.

00:52:19.794 --> 00:52:21.210 align:middle line:84%
It's just that
it's a possibility.

00:52:21.210 --> 00:52:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And life will try
every possibility.

00:52:23.810 --> 00:52:28.610 align:middle line:84%
I think that's our instructions
is to try all possibilities.

00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:29.710 align:middle line:90%
And so we do.

00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:31.780 align:middle line:90%
And this is a possibility.

00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:34.910 align:middle line:84%
So there's no
wrong or right way.

00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:37.230 align:middle line:90%
I don't see one being better.

00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:40.390 align:middle line:90%
We all end up there.

00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:42.110 align:middle line:90%
And there's no real losing.

00:52:42.110 --> 00:52:46.020 align:middle line:84%
You're not better or worse
or anything else like that.

00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>>What about suicide?

00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:49.492 align:middle line:90%
>>Suicide?

00:52:49.492 --> 00:52:52.860 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE] in my [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:54.071 align:middle line:90%
>>In the last week or so?

00:52:54.071 --> 00:52:56.837 align:middle line:90%


00:52:56.837 --> 00:52:58.624 align:middle line:84%
>>Can you repeat her
question [INAUDIBLE]?

00:52:58.624 --> 00:53:00.540 align:middle line:84%
>>She wanted to know
about suicide, especially

00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:02.230 align:middle line:90%
in the last week or so.

00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:04.835 align:middle line:84%
You mean, you had someone
that died of suicide

00:53:04.835 --> 00:53:07.820 align:middle line:90%
in the last week or so?

00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:11.600 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
that affects things.

00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:14.140 align:middle line:84%
I doubt very much if
you're going to resurrect

00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:16.980 align:middle line:90%
if you commit suicide.

00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:22.190 align:middle line:84%
A being that is on the
verge of resurrecting

00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:25.470 align:middle line:84%
would love themselves
too much to do that.

00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:29.020 align:middle line:84%
So the only option
that I could see

00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:31.300 align:middle line:84%
would be they would
die in a normal way

00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:34.675 align:middle line:84%
and end up over there
in the third overtone.

00:53:34.675 --> 00:53:39.544 align:middle line:84%
And if the reality is
such that I think it is,

00:53:39.544 --> 00:53:40.460 align:middle line:90%
they will still go on.

00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:44.290 align:middle line:90%


00:53:44.290 --> 00:53:50.042 align:middle line:84%
But they're going to have
to let go of a lot of stuff

00:53:50.042 --> 00:53:51.410 align:middle line:90%
in order to do that.

00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:54.500 align:middle line:90%
But evidently, they can do it.

00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:56.530 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
people here that

00:53:56.530 --> 00:53:58.905 align:middle line:84%
have done a lot worse
things than that

00:53:58.905 --> 00:54:01.666 align:middle line:84%
and have incredible
stuff going on

00:54:01.666 --> 00:54:03.220 align:middle line:90%
and are still going to make it.

00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:05.670 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe these things
that the American Indians

00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:13.330 align:middle line:84%
are talking about where
masses of these people

00:54:13.330 --> 00:54:15.620 align:middle line:84%
are really not
going to make it--

00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:22.921 align:middle line:84%
maybe there are portions of
this evolutionary path are not

00:54:22.921 --> 00:54:24.295 align:middle line:84%
going to make it
and part of them

00:54:24.295 --> 00:54:27.180 align:middle line:84%
are going to go
on somewhere else.

00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:30.060 align:middle line:84%
But I don't still understand how
they could go somewhere else.

00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:32.910 align:middle line:84%
Because if I got what
I think is coming,

00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:34.927 align:middle line:84%
they're not going
to be anywhere else.

00:54:34.927 --> 00:54:36.010 align:middle line:90%
Everywhere is going to go.

00:54:36.010 --> 00:54:40.265 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if
that will really work.

00:54:40.265 --> 00:54:43.140 align:middle line:84%
Now those are ancient
Indian prophecies

00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:45.020 align:middle line:84%
which are just like
Edgar Cayce and everyone

00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:47.130 align:middle line:84%
else who might not
want to conform

00:54:47.130 --> 00:54:50.280 align:middle line:90%
to this unique situation.

00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:55.900 align:middle line:84%
So this is what I mean
is it's real hard to try

00:54:55.900 --> 00:54:59.620 align:middle line:90%
to second guess this situation.

00:54:59.620 --> 00:55:02.890 align:middle line:84%
>>Drunvalo, I'm a little
concerned about-- well,

00:55:02.890 --> 00:55:03.690 align:middle line:90%
not concerned.

00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:06.090 align:middle line:84%
I have some friends who are
happily married and some that

00:55:06.090 --> 00:55:07.200 align:middle line:90%
aren't.

00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you're going into the
fourth and fifth dimension

00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:13.700 align:middle line:84%
with your memory
because of the Merkaba,

00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:19.510 align:middle line:84%
are you still tied to that
person when you go through?

00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:23.820 align:middle line:84%
Are you still the wife or
the mother or the whatever

00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:25.260 align:middle line:84%
to these beings
that you remember

00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:28.420 align:middle line:84%
from the third
dimension going in?

00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:30.120 align:middle line:84%
>>No, you're not
unless you want to me.

00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:34.020 align:middle line:90%


00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:37.670 align:middle line:84%
It's strictly til
death do you part.

00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:40.925 align:middle line:90%


00:55:40.925 --> 00:55:43.845 align:middle line:84%
>>So going to another dimension
is considered like the death

00:55:43.845 --> 00:55:44.970 align:middle line:90%
as far as that's concerned.

00:55:44.970 --> 00:55:53.970 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, you can.

00:55:53.970 --> 00:55:57.935 align:middle line:84%
If there is true love there
then true love will find itself

00:55:57.935 --> 00:55:58.970 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:55:58.970 --> 00:56:00.440 align:middle line:90%
It just will.

00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:01.720 align:middle line:90%
You tend to move.

00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:02.950 align:middle line:90%
This number 32.

00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:04.990 align:middle line:90%
This is nothing but number 32.

00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:08.864 align:middle line:84%
If you ever look at people
that study past lives,

00:56:08.864 --> 00:56:11.030 align:middle line:84%
you will find an interesting
phenomenon-- and almost

00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:12.623 align:middle line:84%
everybody that studied
past lives will

00:56:12.623 --> 00:56:17.870 align:middle line:84%
find this-- is that people tend
to die and be reborn in groups.

00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And these little groups
move in and out together,

00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:25.190 align:middle line:90%
like the mommy becomes the son.

00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:28.220 align:middle line:84%
The son becomes the daddy
and all these various things.

00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:31.100 align:middle line:84%
The good friend becomes
the other friend over here,

00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:32.540 align:middle line:90%
or something else like that.

00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And they move in
and out together.

00:56:35.890 --> 00:56:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>>A whole basketball
team of souls.

00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:39.300 align:middle line:90%
>>A whole basketball team.

00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:41.633 align:middle line:84%
Globetrotters-- they've been
doing this for a long time.

00:56:41.633 --> 00:56:49.160 align:middle line:90%


00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:52.080 align:middle line:84%
>>Drunvalo, when you refer
to Earth as a star seed

00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:54.610 align:middle line:84%
and we also know
on Earth here, we

00:56:54.610 --> 00:56:56.610 align:middle line:84%
have people that do have
emotional problems that

00:56:56.610 --> 00:56:59.990 align:middle line:84%
are doing things that
they shouldn't be doing,

00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:02.130 align:middle line:84%
hurting people one
way or another.

00:57:02.130 --> 00:57:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Is there any chance that Earth
would remain in a 3-D reality

00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:08.690 align:middle line:84%
where these people would still
have a low grade school where

00:57:08.690 --> 00:57:13.810 align:middle line:84%
they have to learn to overcome
hatred and envy and jealousy?

00:57:13.810 --> 00:57:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>>I don't know.

00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:17.690 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the ones
that I really don't know.

00:57:17.690 --> 00:57:20.050 align:middle line:84%
>>Is that the way it was
supposed to be before this?

00:57:20.050 --> 00:57:20.850 align:middle line:90%
That was the plan.

00:57:20.850 --> 00:57:24.610 align:middle line:84%
>>Oh, well yeah, normally
what would happen

00:57:24.610 --> 00:57:28.254 align:middle line:84%
is a small part would
go up in the fourth.

00:57:28.254 --> 00:57:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
ones would just

00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:31.544 align:middle line:84%
have to stay back down
here longer until they

00:57:31.544 --> 00:57:33.930 align:middle line:90%
learned the lessons of life.

00:57:33.930 --> 00:57:36.340 align:middle line:84%
But those that were up in
the fourth of that planet

00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:38.910 align:middle line:90%
would slowly keep working.

00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:40.740 align:middle line:84%
They're like the
ascended masters.

00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:41.584 align:middle line:90%
They figured it out.

00:57:41.584 --> 00:57:43.250 align:middle line:84%
However, what happens
with those guys is

00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:47.610 align:middle line:84%
they usually go up real fast
after that to the highest level

00:57:47.610 --> 00:57:48.610 align:middle line:90%
possible of that planet.

00:57:48.610 --> 00:57:50.109 align:middle line:84%
So what all all the
ascended masters

00:57:50.109 --> 00:57:51.420 align:middle line:90%
did-- they got way up there.

00:57:51.420 --> 00:57:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And everybody else
was still down there.

00:57:53.770 --> 00:57:58.050 align:middle line:84%
They moved up real fast and then
up the six dimensional levels.

00:57:58.050 --> 00:58:00.510 align:middle line:84%
Because once you make that
first step, the rest of them

00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:01.486 align:middle line:90%
are easy after that.

00:58:01.486 --> 00:58:02.330 align:middle line:90%
They're much easier.

00:58:02.330 --> 00:58:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>What would happen
to those people

00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:05.260 align:middle line:90%
now under the new scenario?

00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:08.400 align:middle line:90%


00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:10.704 align:middle line:84%
>>Either the third dimension's
still going to be here

00:58:10.704 --> 00:58:12.870 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to have
to deal with the situation

00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:20.010 align:middle line:84%
down here that has been left
or we're all going to go.

00:58:20.010 --> 00:58:22.474 align:middle line:90%
>>Taken and they'd be alive?

00:58:22.474 --> 00:58:24.734 align:middle line:90%
>>They'll get it.

00:58:24.734 --> 00:58:25.642 align:middle line:90%
>>They'll get it.

00:58:25.642 --> 00:58:27.600 align:middle line:84%
>>I just never could
figure out how they could.

00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:30.260 align:middle line:90%


00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:32.745 align:middle line:84%
When members of the
ascended masters that I

00:58:32.745 --> 00:58:34.980 align:middle line:84%
was communicating
with said that they

00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:41.280 align:middle line:84%
thought we were all going to
go, I mean I was just like how?

00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:46.384 align:middle line:90%
How can people who are so--

00:58:46.384 --> 00:58:47.328 align:middle line:90%
>>So crazy.

00:58:47.328 --> 00:58:48.425 align:middle line:90%
>>I don't know.

00:58:48.425 --> 00:58:50.590 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, these totally
crazy people who've

00:58:50.590 --> 00:58:52.910 align:middle line:84%
been killing people
and everything else--

00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:56.780 align:middle line:84%
what's going to happen that
could possibly align all that?

00:58:56.780 --> 00:58:58.746 align:middle line:90%
And I just keep looking.

00:58:58.746 --> 00:59:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, more
than anything else,

00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:03.460 align:middle line:84%
if this is really true, it's
got to be God coming in here,

00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:04.340 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>>It's the only one
that would forgive it.

00:59:06.090 --> 00:59:07.234 align:middle line:90%
>>There must be some way.

00:59:07.234 --> 00:59:11.050 align:middle line:90%


00:59:11.050 --> 00:59:12.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:59:12.010 --> 00:59:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's really a matter of
them forgiving themselves more

00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:15.640 align:middle line:90%
than anything else.

00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:17.150 align:middle line:90%
That's really the key.

00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:20.444 align:middle line:90%
And so I don't know.

00:59:20.444 --> 00:59:22.360 align:middle line:84%
If this is really true
and if all this happens

00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:25.420 align:middle line:84%
on these kinds of levels and
it isn't just a normal scenario

00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:29.440 align:middle line:84%
that's happening-- I've thought
about this so much-- that there

00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:36.350 align:middle line:84%
would have to be some incredible
event that happens on Earth,

00:59:36.350 --> 00:59:39.406 align:middle line:84%
the likes of which would just--
I don't know what it would be.

00:59:39.406 --> 00:59:41.030 align:middle line:84%
I keep thinking of
all of these things.

00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:43.520 align:middle line:84%
>>The pole shifts would
shake up and set it straight.

00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:45.880 align:middle line:90%


00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:46.680 align:middle line:90%
>>Maybe.

00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:47.859 align:middle line:90%
That would help a lot.

00:59:47.859 --> 00:59:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>>And they indicated to
you that Earth would just

00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:53.510 align:middle line:84%
be disbanded and turn into
a Mars with no life on it,

00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:55.530 align:middle line:90%
where it's no longer used.

00:59:55.530 --> 00:59:59.420 align:middle line:84%
>>What I've said to someone
else before, if we continue

00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:01.830 align:middle line:84%
not thinking along
the lines of that,

01:00:01.830 --> 01:00:04.990 align:middle line:84%
if we continue the way
we're going right now

01:00:04.990 --> 01:00:08.960 align:middle line:84%
or the way we have been going,
the way we're going where we're

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:12.930 align:middle line:84%
just making more and more
bombs, more and more preparing

01:00:12.930 --> 01:00:15.770 align:middle line:84%
and all those other kinds, that
we continue in that direction,

01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:17.620 align:middle line:84%
we're going to end
up just like Mars.

01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:19.930 align:middle line:90%
We're going to end up wiped out.

01:00:19.930 --> 01:00:21.806 align:middle line:84%
The atmosphere is
going to be gone.

01:00:21.806 --> 01:00:23.430 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be gone
anyway real soon.

01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:26.410 align:middle line:84%
So all of these things
are going to be destroyed.

01:00:26.410 --> 01:00:27.770 align:middle line:90%
And the Earth will be nothing.

01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And then this will be
a big barren desert.

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:34.160 align:middle line:84%
It'll look like Venus or
Mars or anywhere else.

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:37.330 align:middle line:84%
Though I don't think that
we are going to do that.

01:00:37.330 --> 01:00:40.080 align:middle line:90%


01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:44.180 align:middle line:84%
But if it were not for this
other factor coming in here,

01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:48.230 align:middle line:84%
if it were not for the higher
aspect of the ascended masters

01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:55.030 align:middle line:84%
and for all the work of lots
of people changing things,

01:00:55.030 --> 01:01:00.246 align:middle line:84%
I think that we would be in real
trouble, real, real trouble,

01:01:00.246 --> 01:01:01.162 align:middle line:90%
coming real fast.

01:01:01.162 --> 01:01:04.500 align:middle line:90%


01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:07.000 align:middle line:84%
But from my point of view now
and with everything I can see,

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.730 align:middle line:90%
there's no problem here.

01:01:09.730 --> 01:01:12.410 align:middle line:90%
We're going to make it.

01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:15.672 align:middle line:84%
Now in terms of how well the
Earth is going to make it

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:17.630 align:middle line:84%
and whether or not people
are going to be here,

01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:20.112 align:middle line:84%
and those kinds of things,
whether or not someone else

01:01:20.112 --> 01:01:22.070 align:middle line:84%
is going to come back in
here and use it again,

01:01:22.070 --> 01:01:25.670 align:middle line:84%
and all those kind of
things, I don't know.

01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:27.246 align:middle line:90%
I just don't know.

01:01:27.246 --> 01:01:28.496 align:middle line:90%
>>I have my page of questions.

01:01:28.496 --> 01:01:29.746 align:middle line:90%
But they're really short ones.

01:01:29.746 --> 01:01:31.050 align:middle line:90%
>>Sure, a page of questions?

01:01:31.050 --> 01:01:34.370 align:middle line:84%
>>I've been keeping
for the whole thing.

01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:37.700 align:middle line:84%
But most of them
have been answered.

01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:40.640 align:middle line:84%
Earlier you said that
in this scenario,

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:42.350 align:middle line:90%
God was going to be intervening.

01:01:42.350 --> 01:01:44.730 align:middle line:84%
Could you give us an
example of how that?

01:01:44.730 --> 01:01:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>>What I said was--

01:01:45.850 --> 01:01:46.740 align:middle line:90%
>>It appeared that--

01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:48.281 align:middle line:84%
>>It appears like
God is intervening.

01:01:48.281 --> 01:01:50.899 align:middle line:90%


01:01:50.899 --> 01:01:52.690 align:middle line:84%
And God has not said,
I am now intervening.

01:01:52.690 --> 01:01:55.340 align:middle line:90%


01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:58.430 align:middle line:84%
But it definitely
appears that way to me.

01:01:58.430 --> 01:02:00.600 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE] seem gross?

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:01.400 align:middle line:90%
>>In what way?

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:12.950 align:middle line:90%


01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:18.090 align:middle line:84%
>>In the nature of the way that
the evolutionary pattern is

01:02:18.090 --> 01:02:22.750 align:middle line:84%
unfolding on Earth, the speed
at which it's occurring,

01:02:22.750 --> 01:02:26.705 align:middle line:84%
the incredible
flawness of the way

01:02:26.705 --> 01:02:30.110 align:middle line:84%
the movements are being made
from one step to the next,

01:02:30.110 --> 01:02:31.960 align:middle line:84%
the way that we are
still here in this room

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:33.980 align:middle line:84%
at this moment, which
I can hardly believe.

01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:40.728 align:middle line:90%


01:02:40.728 --> 01:02:43.350 align:middle line:84%
No, I don't mean
that kind of thing.

01:02:43.350 --> 01:02:46.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean in this room that I
can hardly believe it-- just

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:47.270 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that we
should be out of here by now.

01:02:53.570 --> 01:02:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And nothing is
going by the rules.

01:02:57.290 --> 01:03:00.754 align:middle line:90%
All the rules are being broken.

01:03:00.754 --> 01:03:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And so from my way of seeing,
it appears to me in the way

01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:09.430 align:middle line:84%
that all life is
focusing on here,

01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:12.260 align:middle line:84%
just the whole nature
of the situation

01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:18.260 align:middle line:84%
appears that something very
big, very powerful is occurring.

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:19.230 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it isn't God.

01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:23.010 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it is only the biggest
being in the universe

01:03:23.010 --> 01:03:23.810 align:middle line:90%
is acting on it.

01:03:23.810 --> 01:03:32.150 align:middle line:90%


01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:37.650 align:middle line:84%
>>You had mentioned that there
had been a cigar-shaped shadow.

01:03:37.650 --> 01:03:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And you were fairly
clear about the fact

01:03:39.370 --> 01:03:44.200 align:middle line:84%
that the one that was installed
was in the next overtone.

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:46.700 align:middle line:84%
So you felt sure that
that shadow wasn't

01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:48.460 align:middle line:90%
installed by the good guys.

01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:50.542 align:middle line:84%
So my question is,
since I've seen that--

01:03:50.542 --> 01:03:52.625 align:middle line:84%
>>So wait a minute-- a
cigar-shaped shaped shadow?

01:03:52.625 --> 01:03:54.820 align:middle line:90%
>>Shadow, yes, up on Mars.

01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:59.730 align:middle line:84%
>>Oh, on Mars-- oh, it
was an elliptical shadow.

01:03:59.730 --> 01:04:01.250 align:middle line:90%
OK, go ahead.

01:04:01.250 --> 01:04:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>>And my question is
that you indicated

01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:08.710 align:middle line:84%
that they didn't know-- they
being our government-- didn't

01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:13.230 align:middle line:84%
know what this alien
force was that knocked out

01:04:13.230 --> 01:04:16.110 align:middle line:90%
our satellites.

01:04:16.110 --> 01:04:20.120 align:middle line:84%
>>Right, however they have
a photograph of it which

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.794 align:middle line:90%
they released into Europe.

01:04:22.794 --> 01:04:24.210 align:middle line:84%
They even released
the photograph,

01:04:24.210 --> 01:04:29.020 align:middle line:84%
by the way, of the actual
object striking it,

01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:30.980 align:middle line:90%
which I was real amazed.

01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:33.520 align:middle line:84%
A few years ago, they would
have never allowed those things.

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>>They wouldn't [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:36.580 align:middle line:90%
>>I don't know.

01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:37.380 align:middle line:90%
It'll be here.

01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:41.190 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to
get all that stuff.

01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:43.923 align:middle line:84%
And you want to know who
they are that's there?

01:04:43.923 --> 01:04:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>>You have to go to
Europe to see it.

01:04:45.530 --> 01:04:49.105 align:middle line:84%
>>What I believe has occurred
here is first of all,

01:04:49.105 --> 01:04:51.660 align:middle line:84%
you've got the secret
government who is on there

01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:55.250 align:middle line:84%
and established themselves
in that place also.

01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:58.310 align:middle line:84%
But when the woman from
Peru raised the ship

01:04:58.310 --> 01:05:00.960 align:middle line:84%
and forced the Greys to move
and leave off the Earth,

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:03.390 align:middle line:90%
they went back to Mars also.

01:05:03.390 --> 01:05:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And I believe you have
about at least five

01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:07.810 align:middle line:84%
or six other races
that are there that

01:05:07.810 --> 01:05:11.530 align:middle line:84%
are working with them
and using Mars as a base

01:05:11.530 --> 01:05:14.860 align:middle line:84%
from which they sneak back
here every once in awhile

01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:16.180 align:middle line:90%
and do tiny little things.

01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Because just every
once in awhile,

01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:21.560 align:middle line:84%
there's just like one little one
here and one little one here.

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:25.490 align:middle line:84%
But there's none of this
massive stuff going on.

01:05:25.490 --> 01:05:28.123 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't think that they
can exist here for very long

01:05:28.123 --> 01:05:28.923 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

01:05:28.923 --> 01:05:33.870 align:middle line:84%
But there's still a little
tiny tiny bit still going on.

01:05:33.870 --> 01:05:35.940 align:middle line:90%
I know what their intention is.

01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:39.340 align:middle line:84%
I hope they change
that intention.

01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:52.600 align:middle line:84%
They still want to replace
us with this other race

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:54.890 align:middle line:90%
though it's not going to happen.

01:05:54.890 --> 01:05:57.250 align:middle line:84%
But they still would like
to see that take place.

01:05:57.250 --> 01:06:00.430 align:middle line:90%
And so would some other people.

01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:03.010 align:middle line:84%
But at the rate
that we are moving,

01:06:03.010 --> 01:06:05.903 align:middle line:84%
it's hourly going to become
more and more difficult for them

01:06:05.903 --> 01:06:08.220 align:middle line:90%
to be able to do that.

01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:12.830 align:middle line:84%
Every time one more person
steps into the Merkaba,

01:06:12.830 --> 01:06:14.910 align:middle line:90%
they cannot reach that person.

01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:15.830 align:middle line:90%
There's no way.

01:06:15.830 --> 01:06:17.030 align:middle line:90%
They can't get into them.

01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:18.540 align:middle line:90%
They can't influence them.

01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:21.415 align:middle line:84%
They can't kill them if
that was their thing.

01:06:21.415 --> 01:06:23.165 align:middle line:84%
They can't wipe them
out by switching them

01:06:23.165 --> 01:06:26.600 align:middle line:90%
to another dimensional level.

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:28.490 align:middle line:90%
They can't influence them.

01:06:28.490 --> 01:06:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And New York becomes stronger
and stronger and stronger.

01:06:32.010 --> 01:06:39.310 align:middle line:90%


01:06:39.310 --> 01:06:44.950 align:middle line:84%
Every minute that goes by, the
Armageddon becomes less likely.

01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:48.105 align:middle line:90%


01:06:48.105 --> 01:06:50.800 align:middle line:84%
But Armageddon would
have been a reality

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:54.230 align:middle line:90%
if they could make it so.

01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:56.200 align:middle line:90%
We're not out of it.

01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:58.590 align:middle line:84%
When we get out of this room
into the 3-D world out here,

01:06:58.590 --> 01:07:00.131 align:middle line:84%
we're not out of
that Armageddon yet.

01:07:00.131 --> 01:07:02.420 align:middle line:90%


01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:08.690 align:middle line:84%
But I really think we
will make it out of it.

01:07:08.690 --> 01:07:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>>Do you know when the
poles are going to shift?

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:12.881 align:middle line:90%
>>If I did, I wouldn't tell you.

01:07:12.881 --> 01:07:16.110 align:middle line:90%


01:07:16.110 --> 01:07:19.870 align:middle line:84%
That's like asking, what
day are you going to die on?

01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:23.090 align:middle line:84%
Would you want to know what
day you're going to die on.

01:07:23.090 --> 01:07:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>>Maybe.

01:07:25.290 --> 01:07:26.090 align:middle line:90%
>>Maybe.

01:07:26.090 --> 01:07:27.631 align:middle line:84%
>>No, then you
wouldn't want to know.

01:07:27.631 --> 01:07:30.460 align:middle line:90%
>>Just it's not good.

01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:37.490 align:middle line:84%
It makes you live in the future
and tend to fear a time ahead.

01:07:37.490 --> 01:07:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's much better
to live without fear

01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:43.764 align:middle line:84%
and without anticipation
and just to be here.

01:07:43.764 --> 01:07:45.430 align:middle line:84%
The biggest thing,
even without the fear

01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:47.350 align:middle line:84%
and any of this stuff-- it
makes you live in the future.

01:07:47.350 --> 01:07:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And so you've got part
of yourself extended out

01:07:49.370 --> 01:07:52.820 align:middle line:84%
to that time when you really
want to be right here.

01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:56.090 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the only
place you can do anything.

01:07:56.090 --> 01:07:58.930 align:middle line:84%
The future and the past
is kind of an illusion.

01:07:58.930 --> 01:08:01.110 align:middle line:90%
All there is is this.

01:08:01.110 --> 01:08:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And so the more
your consciousness

01:08:02.970 --> 01:08:06.520 align:middle line:84%
is focused in this
moment, the more efficient

01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:10.174 align:middle line:84%
you are and the more you're
able to make changes and move.

01:08:10.174 --> 01:08:11.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to know
what the future is.

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:12.920 align:middle line:90%
I used to tell that story.

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And I guess I'll tell
that if you want me to.

01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:16.090 align:middle line:84%
I guess some people
haven't heard it.

01:08:16.090 --> 01:08:20.090 align:middle line:84%
But I used to be very involved
in knowing the future.

01:08:20.090 --> 01:08:25.380 align:middle line:84%
I worked with tarot cards and
astrology and the I Ching.

01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:27.840 align:middle line:84%
You name it, I was into it,
in spite of what you think.

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:29.340 align:middle line:84%
Because I always
wanted to know what

01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:31.569 align:middle line:84%
was going to happen
down the road.

01:08:31.569 --> 01:08:34.189 align:middle line:84%
And right after the
angels came in one day,

01:08:34.189 --> 01:08:37.109 align:middle line:84%
it was I think about six
months after they came in,

01:08:37.109 --> 01:08:39.600 align:middle line:84%
one morning they
came in and they

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:41.229 align:middle line:84%
told me everything
that was going

01:08:41.229 --> 01:08:47.439 align:middle line:84%
to happen the next day
in a synopsis form.

01:08:47.439 --> 01:08:50.655 align:middle line:84%
They said the phone's going
to ring at such and such time.

01:08:50.655 --> 01:08:52.779 align:middle line:84%
The doorbell's going to
ring at such and such time.

01:08:52.779 --> 01:08:54.070 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be this guy here.

01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:56.327 align:middle line:84%
And he's going to talk
about that, just laid

01:08:56.327 --> 01:08:57.380 align:middle line:90%
out a basic pattern.

01:08:57.380 --> 01:09:02.327 align:middle line:84%
It took maybe a minute of
everything I was going to do.

01:09:02.327 --> 01:09:05.050 align:middle line:84%
And I thought wow,
this is great.

01:09:05.050 --> 01:09:08.260 align:middle line:84%
So I sat and watched
to see what happened.

01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And everything happened
just like they said down

01:09:11.950 --> 01:09:13.819 align:middle line:90%
to the minute.

01:09:13.819 --> 01:09:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And so while it was
happening, that morning

01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:18.120 align:middle line:84%
when I was waiting
for it to happen,

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:19.953 align:middle line:84%
they came in and told
me everything that was

01:09:19.953 --> 01:09:22.620 align:middle line:90%
going to happen the next day.

01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:23.810 align:middle line:90%
So this whole day happened.

01:09:23.810 --> 01:09:25.079 align:middle line:84%
And then I had this
other day that was

01:09:25.079 --> 01:09:26.220 align:middle line:90%
going to happen the next day.

01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:27.525 align:middle line:84%
And then while that one
was starting to happen,

01:09:27.525 --> 01:09:29.640 align:middle line:84%
they told me the day that was
going to happen the next day.

01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:30.931 align:middle line:90%
And the whole thing kept going.

01:09:30.931 --> 01:09:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And I went through a
huge amount of changes.

01:09:35.810 --> 01:09:40.235 align:middle line:84%
In fact, every time I
think about it, I laugh.

01:09:40.235 --> 01:09:45.250 align:middle line:84%
Because at first, this
was very serious to me

01:09:45.250 --> 01:09:48.350 align:middle line:84%
and this was really
important stuff.

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that
this was happening

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:53.140 align:middle line:84%
was like this was
really significant.

01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And then after I got over
the really significant stuff,

01:09:58.190 --> 01:09:59.409 align:middle line:90%
I got real quiet for a while.

01:09:59.409 --> 01:10:00.950 align:middle line:84%
But then I remember
this phase I went

01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:05.920 align:middle line:84%
through where my ego took
over and a sense of real power

01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:08.040 align:middle line:90%
came over me.

01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:09.720 align:middle line:90%
And people would call up.

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And I would say to
them, the phone's

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:12.756 align:middle line:84%
going to ring in
a couple minutes.

01:10:12.756 --> 01:10:14.562 align:middle line:84%
And I'd go over by the
phone and sit down.

01:10:14.562 --> 01:10:15.520 align:middle line:90%
I'd wait for the phone.

01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:16.670 align:middle line:90%
And I knew who it would be.

01:10:16.670 --> 01:10:18.840 align:middle line:90%
So George was going to call.

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:21.859 align:middle line:84%
So the phone would ring and I--
hi, George, how are you doing?

01:10:21.859 --> 01:10:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And I knew what he was
going to talk about.

01:10:23.650 --> 01:10:25.050 align:middle line:90%
And I would play these games.

01:10:25.050 --> 01:10:30.880 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know.

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:32.330 align:middle line:90%
It just felt good.

01:10:32.330 --> 01:10:34.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what it
was but I did it anyway.

01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:36.962 align:middle line:90%
It is the sense of power.

01:10:36.962 --> 01:10:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And they kept giving
me this information.

01:10:38.670 --> 01:10:41.470 align:middle line:84%
I just kept getting it every
time and so it kept going.

01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And then that lasted for two
or three months or something

01:10:44.450 --> 01:10:45.610 align:middle line:90%
like that.

01:10:45.610 --> 01:10:47.400 align:middle line:90%
And then that got old.

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:49.930 align:middle line:90%


01:10:49.930 --> 01:10:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And then this funny
feeling came over me,

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:55.050 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't quite pinpoint
what the heck it was.

01:10:55.050 --> 01:10:57.882 align:middle line:84%
And it took me a while
to figure it out.

01:10:57.882 --> 01:11:02.872 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, I
realized what it

01:11:02.872 --> 01:11:04.330 align:middle line:84%
was is that when
they would tell me

01:11:04.330 --> 01:11:08.090 align:middle line:84%
what was going to
happen the next day,

01:11:08.090 --> 01:11:09.360 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want them to tell me.

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:11.210 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't have
the guts to ask them.

01:11:11.210 --> 01:11:13.860 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
these angels, right?

01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:16.130 align:middle line:84%
So I sat there and I
kept listening to it.

01:11:16.130 --> 01:11:18.410 align:middle line:90%
And I started getting depressed.

01:11:18.410 --> 01:11:20.510 align:middle line:84%
I started going down and
down and the whole thing.

01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:22.730 align:middle line:90%
I started getting lower on it.

01:11:22.730 --> 01:11:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And then I went through this
whole thing thinking, well

01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:28.650 align:middle line:84%
I gotta tell them that
I don't want this.

01:11:28.650 --> 01:11:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And I finally took
all this guts.

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:31.330 align:middle line:90%
And I finally got it together.

01:11:31.330 --> 01:11:34.457 align:middle line:84%
And one day, they
came in, and I said,

01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:36.040 align:middle line:84%
do you have to tell
me all this stuff?

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:36.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't want it.

01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:39.562 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to know it.

01:11:39.562 --> 01:11:41.020 align:middle line:84%
If I really need
to know something,

01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:43.220 align:middle line:84%
OK, you can tell me and
all that stuff like that.

01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:44.670 align:middle line:90%
But you don't have to tell me.

01:11:44.670 --> 01:11:45.480 align:middle line:90%
They go no.

01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:48.470 align:middle line:90%


01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:49.560 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:52.160 align:middle line:84%
They never told me
anything anymore.

01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:55.452 align:middle line:90%
And then I didn't get it.

01:11:55.452 --> 01:11:57.660 align:middle line:84%
Then I sat there for a long
time and I didn't get it.

01:11:57.660 --> 01:12:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And it was years later when
I was thinking in retrospect.

01:12:02.830 --> 01:12:04.650 align:middle line:90%
Then I got it.

01:12:04.650 --> 01:12:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Oh, the reason they did all that
was because I was so involved.

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:11.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was always
wanting to know

01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:14.507 align:middle line:84%
what was going to-- I was with
the I Ching about five times

01:12:14.507 --> 01:12:15.590 align:middle line:90%
a day and everything else.

01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:18.320 align:middle line:90%


01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that I was out
of balance in a certain way

01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:26.850 align:middle line:90%
and it was interfering with me.

01:12:26.850 --> 01:12:30.380 align:middle line:84%
So they just ODed me on it
until I got to the place

01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:32.260 align:middle line:90%
that I didn't want it anymore.

01:12:32.260 --> 01:12:33.690 align:middle line:90%
And I really don't want it.

01:12:33.690 --> 01:12:35.655 align:middle line:90%
And I realized it's all perfect.

01:12:35.655 --> 01:12:36.455 align:middle line:90%
It's all complete.

01:12:36.455 --> 01:12:39.460 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to know that
stuff because all we've got

01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:40.920 align:middle line:90%
is right now.

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And when the time comes, we'll
know what we need to know

01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:46.930 align:middle line:90%
and we'll handle it just fine.

01:12:46.930 --> 01:12:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And it also takes the
mystery out of life.

01:12:48.770 --> 01:12:50.670 align:middle line:90%
That's what it really was.

01:12:50.670 --> 01:12:53.065 align:middle line:84%
It was like there is no
mystery in life anymore.

01:12:53.065 --> 01:12:55.040 align:middle line:90%
It's no fun.

01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:56.940 align:middle line:84%
What's the most fun when
you look at a movie?

01:12:56.940 --> 01:13:01.010 align:middle line:84%
The most fun time in a movie
is the very first time.

01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:04.660 align:middle line:90%
The second time, nah.

01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:06.600 align:middle line:90%
Third time, meh.

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:10.066 align:middle line:84%
But the first time is where
all the surprises are.

01:13:10.066 --> 01:13:12.530 align:middle line:84%
And so it's more
important for me.

01:13:12.530 --> 01:13:15.250 align:middle line:84%
You may be different and you
may have a different makeup.

And maybe you could
take knowing what

01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:21.510 align:middle line:84%
the future is in a certain
way to use it in a good way.

01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:24.460 align:middle line:84%
But for me, I don't
think I could.

01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:25.667 align:middle line:90%
It is much better for me.

01:13:25.667 --> 01:13:27.125 align:middle line:84%
>>The reason I
asked is all the way

from Kauai to here,

01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:31.420 align:middle line:84%
I kept getting the
sense of a polar shift.

01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:33.577 align:middle line:84%
And I kept thinking,

01:13:33.577 --> 01:13:34.660 align:middle line:90%
it would be on the planet.

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:36.243 align:middle line:84%
I just kept assuming
that it was going

01:13:36.243 --> 01:13:39.990 align:middle line:84%
to be my reality within me,
that some sort of polar shift

01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:43.480 align:middle line:84%
was about ready and
that my concept of what

01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:46.670 align:middle line:84%
my life was going to be
was going to go like that.

01:13:46.670 --> 01:13:50.710 align:middle line:84%
>>It might be both,
your life first, then--

01:13:50.710 --> 01:13:52.330 align:middle line:90%
