00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.928 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.928 --> 00:00:18.230 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>>When Thoth first came to
me, he first appeared to me,

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.390 align:middle line:90%
I believe it was in 1972.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And the angels had
come to me, and they

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.267 align:middle line:84%
had given me his-- well,
they didn't give me his name.

00:00:31.267 --> 00:00:33.350 align:middle line:84%
They gave me the name of
this guy named [? Wilt ?]

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.120 align:middle line:84%
[? Chipman, ?] who is a
Canadian in British Columbia,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.000 align:middle line:90%
and told me I have to go there.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And I studied alchemy
with him for two years.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And he was really doing it,
though he wasn't sure himself

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.476 align:middle line:90%
that he was really doing it.

00:00:48.476 --> 00:00:49.412 align:middle line:90%
But he really was.

00:00:49.412 --> 00:00:51.050 align:middle line:84%
He had figured out
how to turn mercury

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.360 align:middle line:84%
into gold, which is just-- the
process itself is not what's

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.192 align:middle line:84%
important but the understanding
of how it does that so you

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:00.990 align:middle line:90%
can apply it to this level.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.670 align:middle line:84%
It's really the process of how
this level of consciousness

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.032 align:middle line:90%
goes into Christ consciousness.

00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:07.651 align:middle line:84%
And by understanding how
mercury goes into gold or lead

00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:11.790 align:middle line:84%
into gold, you can
understand how that

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.850 align:middle line:90%
takes place on a human level.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.540 align:middle line:84%
The truth is that alchemy is
not just that, though it's

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.110 align:middle line:90%
been centered on that.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.590 align:middle line:84%
All chemical levels, all
chemical levels whatsoever

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.120 align:middle line:84%
and all chemical reactions
have their counterparts

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.770 align:middle line:84%
in human experience, though
alchemy is pretty much focused

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.272 align:middle line:84%
on this one step because it's
the most important one for us

00:01:33.272 --> 00:01:34.571 align:middle line:90%
at this time.

00:01:34.571 --> 00:01:37.610 align:middle line:84%
I studied this with
him for two years.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.120 align:middle line:84%
He had a little house in--
a little ordinary house

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.290 align:middle line:90%
in Burnaby, Canada.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.716 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if I've
ever said this before,

00:01:47.716 --> 00:01:51.140 align:middle line:84%
but I'll say it--
and up in this room,

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.959 align:middle line:84%
he had this bubble
machine, this machine

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:56.500 align:middle line:84%
you filled with this liquid,
and mercury would rise in there.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And as it would, it would
change different colors.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And when it got to the top,
it would turn to solid gold

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.470 align:middle line:90%
and sink back down.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.214 align:middle line:84%
So you had these little
bubbles coming up

00:02:04.214 --> 00:02:05.130 align:middle line:90%
and turning into gold.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.605 align:middle line:84%
And he'd collect a whole
bunch of gold out of there.

00:02:06.605 --> 00:02:09.068 align:middle line:84%
And every day he'd
collect these things up.

00:02:09.068 --> 00:02:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And he built this
chemistry lab downstairs.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.895 align:middle line:90%
So you would go into this house.

00:02:14.895 --> 00:02:16.270 align:middle line:84%
It looked like an
ordinary house.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.353 align:middle line:90%
You'd go into this closet.

00:02:17.353 --> 00:02:21.878 align:middle line:84%
And you'd go down this elevator
into this incredible, space-age

00:02:21.878 --> 00:02:26.110 align:middle line:84%
lab downstairs that he
spent millions of dollars

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.310 align:middle line:84%
on, building this place hidden
from the rest of the world.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.110 align:middle line:90%
It was huge.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.146 align:middle line:84%
It was about the size
of this whole room

00:02:32.146 --> 00:02:33.742 align:middle line:84%
in here, filled
with everything you

00:02:33.742 --> 00:02:37.280 align:middle line:84%
can think of-- electron
balances, everything

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.020 align:middle line:84%
that you could
ever need or want.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.600 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, I was
studying alchemy with him.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And about two years
down the line one day,

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.390 align:middle line:84%
pretty far down
the line, we were

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.605 align:middle line:90%
in Nelson, British Columbia.

00:02:50.605 --> 00:02:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to teach me
a particular meditation.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.332 align:middle line:84%
And so I sat down to
learn this mediation.

00:02:56.332 --> 00:02:58.483 align:middle line:84%
It was an open-eyed
meditation, where we were

00:02:58.483 --> 00:03:00.487 align:middle line:90%
looking into each other's eyes.

00:03:00.487 --> 00:03:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And as I started
doing this mediation,

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.470 align:middle line:84%
we did it for about
an hour or two.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.016 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
long it was in time.

00:03:07.016 --> 00:03:08.000 align:middle line:90%
But it was a long time.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.805 align:middle line:84%
We're staring, and the room
had gone away and everything.

00:03:10.805 --> 00:03:13.180 align:middle line:84%
All there was was just sort
of his eyes I was looking at,

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.977 align:middle line:84%
when suddenly,
something happened

00:03:14.977 --> 00:03:16.268 align:middle line:90%
that had never happened before.

00:03:16.268 --> 00:03:19.874 align:middle line:90%
And he just disappeared.

00:03:19.874 --> 00:03:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And at first I
thought it was just

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.090 align:middle line:84%
a phenomenal effect of my eyes
watching this guy's eyes for so

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.066 align:middle line:90%
long.

00:03:25.066 --> 00:03:27.830 align:middle line:90%
And he was gone for a long time.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.935 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I reached over,
and I kind of went like this.

00:03:30.935 --> 00:03:31.960 align:middle line:90%
There was nobody there.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.985 align:middle line:90%
He was just gone.

00:03:32.985 --> 00:03:34.970 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, wow.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.730 align:middle line:84%
By this time, my concentration
was back in the room.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.545 align:middle line:84%
And I was really
looking on this spot,

00:03:39.545 --> 00:03:40.866 align:middle line:90%
and there was nobody there.

00:03:40.866 --> 00:03:44.335 align:middle line:84%
And after a few
minutes, this person

00:03:44.335 --> 00:03:47.698 align:middle line:90%
reappeared there, just appeared.

00:03:47.698 --> 00:03:48.930 align:middle line:90%
Only it wasn't him.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.554 align:middle line:90%
It was somebody else.

00:03:50.554 --> 00:03:51.442 align:middle line:90%
Totally different.

00:03:51.442 --> 00:03:52.580 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't even close.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.740 align:middle line:90%
And he was about 35 years old.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.540 align:middle line:84%
This guy was maybe
65 or 70 years old.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.150 align:middle line:90%
And he wasn't Anglo, white type.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.556 align:middle line:90%
He was dark-skinned.

00:04:04.556 --> 00:04:07.940 align:middle line:90%
And he looked very Egyptian.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And he was not very
tall, maybe 5' 3" or 4".

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.152 align:middle line:84%
And he was clean shaven,
but with a long beard that

00:04:14.152 --> 00:04:17.923 align:middle line:84%
was tied in five places
down off his chin,

00:04:17.923 --> 00:04:21.120 align:middle line:90%
real thick, tied down.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And he wore a very simple, tan,
long-sleeved pants and shirts.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.902 align:middle line:84%
But they looked like they
were made out of cotton,

00:04:27.902 --> 00:04:30.460 align:middle line:90%
real simple clothing.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.094 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that got me
about this person that just

00:04:34.094 --> 00:04:37.573 align:middle line:90%
grabbed my heart was his eyes.

00:04:37.573 --> 00:04:40.522 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have
anything going on.

00:04:40.522 --> 00:04:42.017 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's got stuff going on.

00:04:42.017 --> 00:04:44.100 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of hard looking
at some people's eyes

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.944 align:middle line:84%
because there's more
stuff going on there.

00:04:45.944 --> 00:04:47.226 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:04:47.226 --> 00:04:49.600 align:middle line:84%
If you look into their aura,
you see more and more stuff.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.148 align:middle line:90%
But he didn't have anything.

00:04:53.148 --> 00:04:57.540 align:middle line:84%
It was just like looking
into the eyes of a baby.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.444 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever watched a baby's
eyes? [SIGH] You look in there.

00:05:01.444 --> 00:05:02.908 align:middle line:90%
It's OK to look down in there.

00:05:02.908 --> 00:05:04.860 align:middle line:90%
It's really OK.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.966 align:middle line:90%
And that's just how he was.

00:05:07.966 --> 00:05:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And I never, ever met an
adult like that before,

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.340 align:middle line:90%
not even any of my teachers.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.140 align:middle line:90%
Nobody.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.265 align:middle line:90%
I'd never seen that before.

00:05:14.265 --> 00:05:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And I was really
impressed with that.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.970 align:middle line:84%
And he told me that there
were three atoms missing

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.380 align:middle line:84%
in the universe and wanted to
know if I knew where they were.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.360 align:middle line:90%
I said, no.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.860 align:middle line:90%
Um, I don't really know.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.050 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And so he gave me a very
interesting experience,

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.664 align:middle line:84%
which I'm not going
to talk about here.

00:05:34.664 --> 00:05:36.289 align:middle line:84%
But when I got back
in that experience,

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:37.872 align:middle line:90%
I understood what he meant.

00:05:37.872 --> 00:05:40.544 align:middle line:90%
And I just said, OK.

00:05:40.544 --> 00:05:41.344 align:middle line:90%
I understand now.

00:05:41.344 --> 00:05:43.540 align:middle line:90%
I told him what I had learned.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And he just smiled and bowed
at me and disappeared again.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And a few minutes later, my
alchemist teacher came back.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.286 align:middle line:84%
And I never knew
who that guy was.

00:05:54.286 --> 00:05:56.270 align:middle line:84%
I was studying with
five different teachers

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:01.490 align:middle line:84%
at that time, four
other ones besides Will.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And so when the angels who
were coming in two and three

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.830 align:middle line:84%
times a day at that point-- I
never asked them who he was.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.118 align:middle line:90%
And time went by.

00:06:13.118 --> 00:06:15.645 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't do it initially.

00:06:15.645 --> 00:06:18.325 align:middle line:84%
And so as time went by,
I just kind of let it go.

00:06:18.325 --> 00:06:20.241 align:middle line:90%
And he never came up again.

00:06:20.241 --> 00:06:23.594 align:middle line:84%
And months went
by, and then years

00:06:23.594 --> 00:06:29.072 align:middle line:84%
went by, until finally,
it was 12 years went by.

00:06:29.072 --> 00:06:34.512 align:middle line:84%
And one day, 12 years
later, he reappeared.

00:06:34.512 --> 00:06:37.746 align:middle line:84%
And my life changed
dramatically.

00:06:37.746 --> 00:06:42.730 align:middle line:84%
That was on November
1 of 1984, which

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:45.250 align:middle line:84%
I will tell the story at
the right time of what

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.720 align:middle line:90%
happened he came back in.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:57.670 align:middle line:90%


00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:58.505 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:58.505 --> 00:07:03.010 align:middle line:90%
Thoth came in, back in.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:04.550 align:middle line:90%
Again, he was gone for 12 years.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:12.050 align:middle line:84%
He came back in
1984, in November 1.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And over a period
of several months,

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.030 align:middle line:84%
he began to teach me or
instruct me in sacred geometry.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:23.800 align:middle line:84%
I had been instructed from
the angels from the very, very

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.600 align:middle line:90%
first.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.130 align:middle line:84%
It was angels who actually
gave me the breathing

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.040 align:middle line:90%
that we're teaching here.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And they taught me a great
deal of the sacred geometry.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.550 align:middle line:84%
But when he came
in, he says, OK.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:38.280 align:middle line:90%
I want to see what you got.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And I had to-- I
just gave it to him

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:41.590 align:middle line:90%
in this little ball of white.

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at the
whole thing and told me

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:47.170 align:middle line:90%
that I was missing a whole lot.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.650 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:53.540 align:middle line:84%
He sat me down every
day for several months.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.850 align:middle line:84%
He would come into the room,
sit down with me on a pillow,

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:01.540 align:middle line:90%
and have me make drawings.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And I did this for day after day
after day after day after day.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:07.160 align:middle line:10%
And after a long
period of time, I

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.840 align:middle line:10%
came up with this
drawing here, which

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.650 align:middle line:10%
was the end result
of maybe three

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:13.552 align:middle line:10%
months of work or something.

00:08:13.552 --> 00:08:18.870 align:middle line:10%
Of course, this is
after-- I'd already

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:23.580 align:middle line:10%
been working for 12 years.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.105 align:middle line:10%
And then I came
up with this one.

00:08:26.105 --> 00:08:31.480 align:middle line:10%
And when I got done, he
said this was a very special

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.850 align:middle line:10%
sacred geometry drawing.

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:34.890 align:middle line:84%
It was one of the
most important ones.

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:38.780 align:middle line:84%
It was the first chromosome
in the human body.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:42.740 align:middle line:84%
Each of your chromosomes are
actually geometrical patterns.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.929 align:middle line:10%
And in the geometry
of the pattern-- which

00:08:44.929 --> 00:08:46.470 align:middle line:10%
you will understand
this when you get

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:50.490 align:middle line:10%
done here-- in the very
geometry of the chromosome

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:54.320 align:middle line:10%
is contained the
instructions on how

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:59.380 align:middle line:10%
not to just make the human
body but the entire reality,

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:04.420 align:middle line:10%
everything, including the
quasars and the planets

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:08.730 align:middle line:10%
and galaxies and everything and
the planets, all the other life

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:09.690 align:middle line:10%
forms, not just human.

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:11.930 align:middle line:10%
Everything's all in there.

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:16.359 align:middle line:10%
Only there are certain
levels that are missing.

00:09:16.359 --> 00:09:18.150 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
aspects that are missing.

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:21.520 align:middle line:90%


00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.050 align:middle line:84%
The first time the
consciousness is self-aware,

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:26.400 align:middle line:84%
which we talked about as
the Australians-- they

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.510 align:middle line:90%
have 42 plus 2 chromosomes.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:32.020 align:middle line:84%
When it jumps up one more,
we gain two chromosomes

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:35.412 align:middle line:84%
and we go to 44 plus 2,
which is what we have.

00:09:35.412 --> 00:09:36.870 align:middle line:84%
When we go to Christ
consciousness,

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:42.220 align:middle line:84%
we'll gain two more chromosomes
and go to 46 plus 2.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And then there will be this
state further down the line

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.050 align:middle line:90%
where we will go to 48 plus 2.

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, the fifth
state that we pass through-- we

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:54.836 align:middle line:84%
pass through these five states--
we'll come to 50 plus 2.

00:09:54.836 --> 00:09:55.636 align:middle line:90%
52.

00:09:55.636 --> 00:10:01.490 align:middle line:90%


00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, when
I first put this out,

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.150 align:middle line:84%
which was over seven
and a half years ago,

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:08.400 align:middle line:84%
there was no scientific
proof whatsoever

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.690 align:middle line:84%
that what I was saying had
any basis in biology at all

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:16.270 align:middle line:84%
until in the last couple
years, someone tested

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.670 align:middle line:90%
the Aboriginals in Australia.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:19.990 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's ever done it, I guess.

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Nobody ever figured out--
they found out that they all

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.450 align:middle line:90%
have 42 plus 2 chromosomes.

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:27.017 align:middle line:84%
They don't have 44
plus 2, I guess.

00:10:27.017 --> 00:10:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And since then, they've found
a couple tribes in Africa,

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:33.000 align:middle line:84%
I understand, that also
have the 44 plus 2.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.050 align:middle line:84%
--got many different
names all around the world

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:38.340 align:middle line:84%
and in various places
of the universe.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:43.020 align:middle line:84%
But one that he called it
was the flower of life.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:50.510 align:middle line:84%
Thought it's also been called
the language of silence

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:54.637 align:middle line:84%
and the language of light
because it is a language,

00:10:54.637 --> 00:10:55.595 align:middle line:90%
as you're about to see.

00:10:55.595 --> 00:11:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's a language that's
hidden underneath the words

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:03.410 align:middle line:90%
that I'm saying right here.

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:07.060 align:middle line:84%
--a statement that was pretty
outrageous for normal ways

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:08.100 align:middle line:90%
of thinking.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:13.320 align:middle line:84%
He says, everything's in
here-- all the laws of physics,

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.510 align:middle line:84%
all structure, all crystal
structure, all biological life

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:19.500 align:middle line:84%
forms in the various shape
of every little detail

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:23.276 align:middle line:84%
in their bodies, all
the planetary bodies,

00:11:23.276 --> 00:11:25.340 align:middle line:84%
all atomic structure,
everything.

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:29.020 align:middle line:84%
The entire reality,
everything that created it,

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.620 align:middle line:90%
was in this one single image.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And this sounds like a
pretty powerful statement

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:40.852 align:middle line:84%
until you really begin
to see how this works.

00:11:40.852 --> 00:11:42.310 align:middle line:10%
When he got done
teaching all this,

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:46.420 align:middle line:10%
he then told me that I would
find this image in Egypt.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And there were two times
when I doubted him.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And I doubted him on
that one because I

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:55.490 align:middle line:84%
thought I had read just about
everything there was in Egypt.

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:58.477 align:middle line:84%
And that did not look like
an Egyptian symbol to me.

00:11:58.477 --> 00:12:00.060 align:middle line:84%
It looked more
Christian or something.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.680 align:middle line:90%
But it did not look Egyptian.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:08.694 align:middle line:84%
And he just said, you'll
find it in Egypt, and left.

00:12:08.694 --> 00:12:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And since then,
by the way, we've

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:13.490 align:middle line:84%
found it all over the world,
just about everywhere.

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:14.990 align:middle line:84%
You'll see at the
very end of this--

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:17.410 align:middle line:84%
you'll see some of the places
that we've found it in,

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:18.890 align:middle line:90%
but almost everywhere.

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:22.000 align:middle line:90%


00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, two weeks
later, I'm sitting

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:28.240 align:middle line:84%
in Taos, New Mexico
in Smith's Food Store

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.610 align:middle line:90%
buying some groceries.

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And Katrina Raphael,
this friend of mine

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:38.270 align:middle line:84%
who writes books on
crystals was in there.

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And I had taken her to Egypt
the first time she went.

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:45.106 align:middle line:84%
And she just from back
from Egypt the second time.

00:12:45.106 --> 00:12:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And she's a woman who
takes a camera and just

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:55.470 align:middle line:84%
[CLICKING], just starts
loading it up, and [CLICKING].

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:58.580 align:middle line:90%
And she takes a lot of pictures.

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:01.764 align:middle line:84%
And she was sitting there at the
counter taking 36 out at a time

00:13:01.764 --> 00:13:02.930 align:middle line:90%
and putting them on a stack.

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And she had a stack of pictures
a good 12 inches high or so.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.589 align:middle line:84%
She was still stacking them
up when I came up to her.

00:13:09.589 --> 00:13:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And we started
talking, saying hello,

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:13.830 align:middle line:84%
how are you doing, and
that kind of stuff.

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:16.214 align:middle line:84%
And she said she just
got back from Egypt.

00:13:16.214 --> 00:13:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And then, she says,
oh by the way,

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:21.650 align:middle line:84%
she says-- she has an
angel that has guided her

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:24.340 align:middle line:84%
into writing the books
that she wrote and gave her

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:26.210 align:middle line:84%
the information that
she wrote and told her

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:28.168 align:middle line:84%
how to get the information
through the crystals

00:13:28.168 --> 00:13:29.720 align:middle line:90%
that she wrote.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that angel's
name is [? Sorell, ?] I think.

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:37.500 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, she said that
[? Sorell ?] told her

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.400 align:middle line:84%
when she was in Egypt that she
was to give me a photograph as

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.716 align:middle line:90%
soon as she saw me.

00:13:41.716 --> 00:13:43.080 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.369 align:middle line:90%
Give me the photograph.

00:13:44.369 --> 00:13:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, well, I
don't know which one it is.

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:49.520 align:middle line:84%
So she turns around away from
the things, goes through them,

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.440 align:middle line:84%
and pulls one out at
random and hands it to me.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And when she did, she
handed me this photograph,

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.715 align:middle line:84%
which was the flower
of life on one

00:13:58.715 --> 00:14:00.460 align:middle line:90%
of the oldest walls in Egypt.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:03.530 align:middle line:84%
That wall's about
6,000 years old.

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, she didn't
know what I was doing.

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:09.810 align:middle line:90%
She had no idea.

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:12.340 align:middle line:84%
That thing didn't mean
a thing to her at all.

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:16.660 align:middle line:90%
But to me, it was like, whoa!

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:19.840 align:middle line:84%
If you could pick one
photograph in the world,

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.250 align:middle line:90%
you got me pretty good on that.

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:24.650 align:middle line:10%
Later, I went to that place.

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:25.520 align:middle line:10%
I went back again.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.520 align:middle line:10%
I had to go there once I
found out it was there.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.020 align:middle line:10%
I had to go find
out what was there.

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:30.520 align:middle line:10%
And I went back again.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And where that was located--
this is in Abydos here.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is from
the dog star here.

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:41.230 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:42.710 align:middle line:90%


00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:43.976 align:middle line:90%
Which is serious.

00:14:43.976 --> 00:14:47.220 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.250 align:middle line:90%


00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:51.440 align:middle line:10%
This is Seti the First
temple in Abydos.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.600 align:middle line:10%
And behind that there's
actually three temples.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.773 align:middle line:84%
There' a-- Seti the First
temple goes like this.

00:14:57.773 --> 00:15:02.784 align:middle line:90%


00:15:02.784 --> 00:15:03.700 align:middle line:90%
There's three temples.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:07.350 align:middle line:84%
This is where we're looking,
like this, right now.

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And there's a real ancient--
one of the oldest temples

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.820 align:middle line:90%
in all of Egypt sits back here.

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.690 align:middle line:90%
It's called the Osirian.

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:18.426 align:middle line:84%
It's where Osiris supposedly
was put back together,

00:15:18.426 --> 00:15:22.180 align:middle line:84%
if you know that story where
he was cut into 14 pieces.

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And this was like a really holy
place to the ancient Egyptians.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:39.940 align:middle line:84%
It was so holy that many of
the kings in the olden days

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:44.940 align:middle line:84%
didn't have, like Djoser
for example-- [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.860 align:middle line:90%
same person.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:54.723 align:middle line:84%
He didn't bury
himself in Saqqara.

00:15:54.723 --> 00:15:57.400 align:middle line:90%
He had himself buried here.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.635 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
old kings did that.

00:15:59.635 --> 00:16:01.510 align:middle line:84%
Even though they built
these huge things that

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:03.480 align:middle line:84%
would look like us
where they would do it,

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.440 align:middle line:84%
they had themselves buried
here or around here.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, so Seti the First was
building this because of this.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.110 align:middle line:84%
And as he was
building back in here,

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:14.410 align:middle line:90%
there was a little hill here.

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And as he was
building into here,

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:19.431 align:middle line:84%
he discovered an even
more ancient temple

00:16:19.431 --> 00:16:21.710 align:middle line:84%
that they didn't
know about here.

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And so he turned his temple
and made an L-shaped temple,

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:27.500 align:middle line:84%
which is the only L-shaped
temple in all of Egypt, which

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:32.990 align:middle line:84%
is part of the proof that
he didn't build this.

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Some people think
that he faked this.

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:41.190 align:middle line:84%
But there's controversy over
whether he did this or not.

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:43.960 align:middle line:84%
But this, to me, is proof
that he did not do it.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.407 align:middle line:84%
Nowhere else has anyone
ever made this L.

00:16:46.407 --> 00:16:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And he did the L so he
wouldn't have to go in here

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:52.010 align:middle line:90%
and mess up that other one.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And there's one thing I
want to say before I go

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:56.430 align:middle line:90%
into those temples in the back.

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:58.910 align:middle line:84%
This is inside of the
Seti the First temple.

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:02.780 align:middle line:10%
What they have discovered in
Egypt in the last few years--

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:08.770 align:middle line:10%
there's writing that
goes from your knees

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:12.319 align:middle line:10%
all the way up to the top
of this 35-foot ceiling

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:15.660 align:middle line:10%
or wherever that is
up there, and even up

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.459 align:middle line:10%
on the pillars way
at the very top.

00:17:18.459 --> 00:17:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And when you go to--
who's been to Egypt here?

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:25.980 align:middle line:90%
OK, there's quite a few.

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.690 align:middle line:90%
About 10, 12 people.

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:29.460 align:middle line:84%
You notice that you
go into these temples.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And many, many, many of the
figures that are on the wall,

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:38.980 align:middle line:84%
either in the reliefs or
however they're on there,

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.220 align:middle line:84%
have been chipped
away or destroyed.

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And for a long time, they may
have told you-- I don't know,

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:48.525 align:middle line:84%
that it was because the
Romans and other people who

00:17:48.525 --> 00:17:50.570 align:middle line:84%
had come in there had
destroyed these things.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:52.330 align:middle line:90%
They now know that's not true.

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:54.870 align:middle line:84%
They know it's not
true beyond any doubt

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:58.420 align:middle line:84%
whatsoever, though they
didn't know for a long time,

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:01.000 align:middle line:84%
because they've
discovered in recent times

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.980 align:middle line:84%
that the language on the walls
was placed there in such a way

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.560 align:middle line:90%
that there was a time frame.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:13.100 align:middle line:84%
The language that is from
roughly about this high down

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.940 align:middle line:90%
was speaking of the past.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And from about this high up
to maybe nine or 10 feet,

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.700 align:middle line:84%
or maybe even 12
feet up the walls,

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:32.120 align:middle line:84%
was the present at the
time the temple was built.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And the stuff that
is up further is

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:39.500 align:middle line:84%
future, what they think is
going to happen in the future.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.644 align:middle line:84%
And they now know who
did it because there's

00:18:42.644 --> 00:18:44.560 align:middle line:84%
only one person who
could've known who did it,

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:45.900 align:middle line:90%
or one group of people.

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
priests themselves

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:51.840 align:middle line:84%
that created the temples or
took care of the temples.

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.220 align:middle line:84%
They were the ones that
went around and destroyed

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:58.160 align:middle line:84%
the writing on the walls
because only the writing that

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.360 align:middle line:84%
was at the present time of
the temples was touched.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:04.240 align:middle line:84%
The past and the
future was not touched.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And somebody just
going in there,

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:09.600 align:middle line:84%
like the Romans, just to
go in there and cause hell

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.110 align:middle line:84%
would not have known
that or could not

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:13.890 align:middle line:84%
have picked that
out so carefully,

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:17.120 align:middle line:90%
to just touch the present.

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And to them, what
they put on those

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:22.150 align:middle line:84%
walls was-- when
they wrote what was

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:27.100 align:middle line:84%
going to happen in the
future, that was just it.

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.260 align:middle line:90%
That's what was going to happen.

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
believe that they

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:34.950 align:middle line:84%
can't see what was going
to happen in the future,

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:38.040 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see a slide
at the very, very end of this.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how it came up for
those you who saw the videos.

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.010 align:middle line:84%
You probably couldn't see
it very clearly or not.

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:45.842 align:middle line:84%
But you'll see this
one very clearly.

00:19:45.842 --> 00:19:48.300 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be a slide at
the very, very end of here--

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:49.245 align:middle line:90%
I'm gonna wait till the end.

00:19:49.245 --> 00:19:50.328 align:middle line:90%
I got to make it dramatic.

00:19:50.328 --> 00:19:51.702 align:middle line:90%
It's more fun that way.

00:19:51.702 --> 00:19:53.025 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:53.025 --> 00:19:55.300 align:middle line:90%


00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.820 align:middle line:84%
When that slide's going to
be way up high above one

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:00.320 align:middle line:84%
of these pillars way up
there at the very, very top.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And it'll be proof
that they could clearly

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.450 align:middle line:90%
see into the future.

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:05.286 align:middle line:90%
No doubt.

00:20:05.286 --> 00:20:06.910 align:middle line:84%
But you have to wait
till we get there.

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:10.710 align:middle line:10%
This is the Osirian Temple,
which is this one back here.

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:15.244 align:middle line:10%
And it's very, very old.

00:20:15.244 --> 00:20:16.910 align:middle line:84%
You're not supposed
to go down in there,

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:19.030 align:middle line:90%
but I couldn't stand it.

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:21.240 align:middle line:84%
So I dropped off this
thing and ran inside

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.680 align:middle line:84%
and took a whole
bunch of pictures

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.683 align:middle line:84%
before they dragged
me out of there.

00:20:24.683 --> 00:20:27.290 align:middle line:90%
And I just had to see in there.

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:30.990 align:middle line:90%
The writing is so sacred.

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:31.970 align:middle line:90%
It's so beautiful.

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:33.710 align:middle line:84%
It's just straightforward
and clear.

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:35.920 align:middle line:90%
There's no junk in the middle.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:42.550 align:middle line:84%
The writing in Egypt and
in Sumeria when it came out

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:48.800 align:middle line:84%
was in its absolute most
sophisticated, perfect form,

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.080 align:middle line:90%
and then degenerated after that.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.110 align:middle line:90%
Got worse.

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:59.790 align:middle line:84%
Came out in its absolute
clearest form with no--

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:02.530 align:middle line:84%
also with no evolutionary
pattern before it.

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:03.750 align:middle line:90%
Just came out in one day.

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:07.590 align:middle line:84%
Just one day, suddenly it's
perfect writing on the walls

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:13.630 align:middle line:84%
with nothing leading up to it,
no evolution, absolutely zero,

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:17.270 align:middle line:90%
both in Syria and in Egypt.

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:20.899 align:middle line:84%
And then got worse and worse
and worse and worse and worse.

00:21:20.899 --> 00:21:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And they never could
understand that.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.210 align:middle line:84%
You'll understand it
in just a little bit.

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, they got
me out of there.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And when they did,
I went over to here.

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
one-- that's the back

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:33.650 align:middle line:90%
of the Seti the First temple.

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:37.663 align:middle line:84%
And I'm standing right now here,
taking a picture toward here.

00:21:37.663 --> 00:21:42.820 align:middle line:84%
And this temple was also
called the Osirian Temple.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And it was dedicated
to resurrection,

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:48.720 align:middle line:84%
according to the hieroglyphics
that are found in.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:53.505 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
ramp right here.

00:21:53.505 --> 00:21:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And it was over here where
that flower of life pattern

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:58.535 align:middle line:90%
was found.

00:21:58.535 --> 00:22:06.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is the building
when they first excavated it.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.040 align:middle line:90%
And it was dry in there now.

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:12.220 align:middle line:84%
The Nile has changed its level,
and it's filling up with water.

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And they talk about
these three steps,

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.700 align:middle line:84%
where these steps came up
this way, thing in the middle,

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:18.160 align:middle line:84%
and the steps go
back down again--

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.950 align:middle line:84%
these three different
levels, which

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:23.120 align:middle line:84%
are associated with the three
levels of consciousness,

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:27.130 align:middle line:84%
the 42, the 44, and the 46
that we're going through,

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:30.280 align:middle line:84%
which are all associated
with resurrection.

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:33.190 align:middle line:10%
And this temple, this was done
by Lucy de Lubicz, which was

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:35.750 align:middle line:10%
Schwaller de Lubicz's daughter.

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:41.650 align:middle line:10%
She reconstructed the temple
from a blueprint plan,

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:45.930 align:middle line:10%
and then discovered that it was
based upon the sacred geometry

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:49.830 align:middle line:10%
of two back-to-back pentagons.

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:51.390 align:middle line:90%
She wasn't exactly sure why.

00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:53.419 align:middle line:90%
All she knew that it was.

00:22:53.419 --> 00:23:00.910 align:middle line:84%
But in today, when we start
talking about the grids,

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:03.740 align:middle line:84%
you'll discover that the grid--
the grids I'm talking about

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:07.220 align:middle line:84%
are actual electromagnetic
fields of energy that

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:09.830 align:middle line:90%
exist around the Earth.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:12.960 align:middle line:84%
Primarily, these grids
exist from about an average

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.840 align:middle line:84%
of about 60 feet in
the Earth, average,

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:19.420 align:middle line:84%
to about 60 miles
above the Earth.

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:23.250 align:middle line:84%
Every life form on the planet,
even if there's only two bugs,

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:26.140 align:middle line:84%
has a grid stretching
around the whole Earth.

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.680 align:middle line:84%
And these grids are all
superimposed, stretching up

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.490 align:middle line:84%
for these 60 miles up,
which causes, like,

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:33.850 align:middle line:84%
this light blue glow
around the Earth.

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:38.612 align:middle line:84%
And the highest
ones are the whales.

00:23:38.612 --> 00:23:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And then the dolphins come
after that, and then the humans.

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And there's three
primary human ones.

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And the newest
one, which was just

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:51.360 align:middle line:84%
finished in 1989, after
13,000 years of work

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:57.064 align:middle line:84%
of constructing it, is based
on a stellated dodecahedron.

00:23:57.064 --> 00:23:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And a stellated--
though we haven't talked

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.110 align:middle line:90%
about these kind of things yet.

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:02.260 align:middle line:90%
This is a dodecahedron.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.796 align:middle line:90%
It's 12 pentagons.

00:24:04.796 --> 00:24:06.824 align:middle line:10%
And this is an icosahedron.

00:24:06.824 --> 00:24:08.240 align:middle line:10%
And if you notice
in here, there's

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:13.446 align:middle line:10%
another pentagon with
five triangles in it.

00:24:13.446 --> 00:24:15.930 align:middle line:84%
You can see the similarity
between these two shapes.

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:18.060 align:middle line:84%
If you were to take
this out of there,

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:22.090 align:middle line:84%
this is called an icosahedronal
cap in sacred geometry.

00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And when you open up
a icosahedronal cap,

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:30.545 align:middle line:84%
it's these two back-to-back
pentagons like this.

00:24:30.545 --> 00:24:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And the icosahedronal cap is the
key to the Christ consciousness

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:36.870 align:middle line:90%
grid.

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:38.780 align:middle line:10%
Because if you
take a dodecahedron

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:43.030 align:middle line:10%
and put one of these in each
one of these things here,

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:45.727 align:middle line:10%
that's what the primary shape
of the Christ consciousness grid

00:24:45.727 --> 00:24:48.410 align:middle line:10%
is.

00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:51.520 align:middle line:10%
And so it was very
clever of them,

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:56.390 align:middle line:10%
by my way of thinking, to
base the geometries of this

00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:59.420 align:middle line:10%
on something that would
eventually-- that they clearly

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:03.540 align:middle line:10%
understood, even back then,
and were in the process, even

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:08.570 align:middle line:10%
back then, of building and
knowing that that someday

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:09.370 align:middle line:10%
would be completed.

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:12.060 align:middle line:90%


00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:15.704 align:middle line:84%
This is the place where it was
found, which was right here.

00:25:15.704 --> 00:25:19.915 align:middle line:84%
And I had a little better
camera than Katrina had.

00:25:19.915 --> 00:25:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that there's
actually two of these,

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:25.282 align:middle line:90%
side-by-side, here.

00:25:25.282 --> 00:25:28.620 align:middle line:90%


00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And I took a shot right
next to it, over here.

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And though I know you
can't see this real well,

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.330 align:middle line:84%
this one here is called
the seed of life,

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:39.640 align:middle line:84%
which we're going to look at
in just a little bit here.

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And there's all
kinds of patterns

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:46.910 align:middle line:84%
all around here, which are
all based on this geometry.

00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:51.652 align:middle line:84%
I put my camera around the
side like this over here--

00:25:51.652 --> 00:25:53.360 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't get around
there because there

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.457 align:middle line:84%
was water and
everything in there--

00:25:55.457 --> 00:25:56.790 align:middle line:90%
just to see what was over there.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:58.164 align:middle line:84%
And again, this
is the back side.

00:25:58.164 --> 00:26:00.770 align:middle line:90%
You can see this.

00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:03.260 align:middle line:84%
I know you can't see
these real well, probably,

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:04.570 align:middle line:90%
from where you are.

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:07.750 align:middle line:84%
But these are all symbols that
you'll find all over the world,

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:10.650 align:middle line:90%
in churches and everywhere.

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And they're all
understandings or-- stuff

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:17.810 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to learn about
in this workshop right here

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:18.610 align:middle line:90%
was on this wall.

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:22.470 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like this
was a school for teaching

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:23.270 align:middle line:90%
this kind of stuff.

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:26.436 align:middle line:90%


00:26:26.436 --> 00:26:28.935 align:middle line:84%
After you go to one of these
workshops and you go back there

00:26:28.935 --> 00:26:30.670 align:middle line:84%
and you stand at
the Osirian Temple

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:34.260 align:middle line:84%
and you see all the symbols,
you get this weird feeling

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:36.190 align:middle line:90%
because it's so familiar.

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:38.060 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:39.542 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just
like, holy cow.

00:26:39.542 --> 00:26:41.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's like you
know what's on the walls.

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.580 align:middle line:84%
You know what they're
talking about.

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And they're talking
about everything.

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:50.150 align:middle line:84%
Way over there-- and this is
with an 80-millimeter lens.

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:51.690 align:middle line:84%
Way over here,
there's this image,

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:53.180 align:middle line:90%
which you can barely see.

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:55.540 align:middle line:84%
That's a long ways
away, actually.

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:57.770 align:middle line:90%
And that image looks like this.

00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:21.870 align:middle line:90%


00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:25.330 align:middle line:84%
This is what was drawn,
carefully though,

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:27.110 align:middle line:90%
over in there.

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:31.905 align:middle line:84%
And that symbol is the symbol
of the first Christians

00:27:31.905 --> 00:27:35.430 align:middle line:84%
in the world, before
Christ was ever born,

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:38.750 align:middle line:84%
which are the Coptics,
which are also Egyptian.

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:42.490 align:middle line:84%
500 years before
Christ was born,

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:44.740 align:middle line:84%
they were talking
about him coming.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And this was the symbol
that they used for him.

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:57.417 align:middle line:84%
And here it is etched in
one of the Egyptian walls.

00:27:57.417 --> 00:27:59.000 align:middle line:84%
That was another
symbol for him, which

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:05.166 align:middle line:84%
was the triangle with the
cross in the middle, over here.

00:28:05.166 --> 00:28:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And another symbol for
him that the Coptics

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.850 align:middle line:90%
gave-- oh, wait a minute.

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:12.000 align:middle line:84%
This is another one of
them that they etched

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.770 align:middle line:90%
in one of the Egyptian walls.

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And notice here, it's
now only that symbol.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:19.540 align:middle line:84%
But at the top, six petals
of the flower of life,

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:20.958 align:middle line:90%
which is the central core.

00:28:20.958 --> 00:28:25.740 align:middle line:90%


00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:29.980 align:middle line:84%
You'll see both these six
petals and sometimes, the six

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:32.560 align:middle line:84%
petals with these six
outer ones around it.

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And many times, you'll
see them side by side.

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:41.120 align:middle line:84%
You can go into St.
Mary's-- once I climbed Mt.

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:46.030 align:middle line:84%
Sinai, where Moses
saw the burning bush.

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:50.690 align:middle line:84%
At the bottom of there is--
I think it's St. Catherine's.

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:51.670 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:53.690 align:middle line:84%
St. Catherine's
is the monastery.

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:54.950 align:middle line:90%
It's a Coptic monastery.

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:56.840 align:middle line:10%
They won't let you
take any photographs.

00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:01.540 align:middle line:10%
But when you go in there, you'll
see the six-petaled pattern

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:03.860 align:middle line:10%
on the wall, along--
right next to it,

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:06.840 align:middle line:10%
where the six-petal pattern
with the six around it,

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:08.810 align:middle line:10%
showing that they
had the understanding

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:13.020 align:middle line:10%
of the flower of life in there.

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:15.834 align:middle line:84%
And this was the--
here's another one.

00:29:15.834 --> 00:29:17.250 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they'd
do it like this,

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:19.940 align:middle line:84%
where they would take four
intersecting circles surrounded

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:21.440 align:middle line:90%
by a circle.

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.360 align:middle line:90%
Another symbol for Christ.

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And this was another
symbol for Christ,

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:33.880 align:middle line:84%
a fish that breathes
air that just happens

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.700 align:middle line:90%
to have 13 scales on it.

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:41.080 align:middle line:90%


00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And you can check this one
out as an interesting bit

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:44.220 align:middle line:90%
of information.

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.600 align:middle line:90%


00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:51.310 align:middle line:84%
Even today, Christ is-- you'll
see this symbol for Christ.

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:58.090 align:middle line:84%
You all are familiar with
this one, of the fish.

00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:00.730 align:middle line:90%


00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And 200 years after Christ
died, the Greek Orthodox Church

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:14.420 align:middle line:84%
took over the power of
the Catholic Roman Church.

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, there
were many, many changes

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:18.810 align:middle line:90%
that were made.

00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And one of them was prior
to those 200 years--

00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:24.650 align:middle line:84%
in the first 200 years
before then, Christ

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:26.520 align:middle line:90%
was not known just as the fish.

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:30.240 align:middle line:84%
Specifically, he was
known as the dolphin.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Exactly what that
connection is, I don't know.

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:37.310 align:middle line:90%
But that's for sure.

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:40.070 align:middle line:90%
And then later, it became known.

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:42.490 align:middle line:84%
But there was this
fish connection.

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:46.675 align:middle line:84%
It could very well be that
it was because of the time,

00:30:46.675 --> 00:30:47.550 align:middle line:90%
the timing of Pisces.

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:50.039 align:middle line:90%


00:30:50.039 --> 00:30:51.580 align:middle line:84%
When Christ came
in, he came in right

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:53.940 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning of Pisces.

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:57.490 align:middle line:90%
And before that time was Taurus.

00:30:57.490 --> 00:31:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And they worshipped the
bull, and the golden bull

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:05.470 align:middle line:84%
and all the stuff that was done
on there, which was that time.

00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And when Jesus came and became
the fish and the Pisces,

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:12.940 align:middle line:84%
the bull was thrown
down and was no longer

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:15.106 align:middle line:84%
the symbol that was
being worshipped.

00:31:15.106 --> 00:31:19.050 align:middle line:90%


00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:23.480 align:middle line:84%
So again, this first
whole day, really,

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:26.774 align:middle line:84%
is just-- we're going to
be going about all kinds

00:31:26.774 --> 00:31:27.690 align:middle line:90%
of different subjects.

00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And we're just trying to get a
background of basic information

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:34.300 align:middle line:90%
so we can all communicate on.

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:37.230 align:middle line:10%
This is the flower
of life again.

00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And I want to show
you a relationship

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:40.000 align:middle line:90%
in the flower of life.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.050 align:middle line:90%


00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:49.200 align:middle line:10%
It was called the flower
of life because-- or one

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:53.950 align:middle line:10%
of the reasons why, well, if
you take the image of a tree--

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:57.670 align:middle line:10%
specifically, a fruit tree.

00:31:57.670 --> 00:31:59.590 align:middle line:90%
A fruit tree comes up.

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:00.390 align:middle line:90%
It grows up.

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And it gets little
flowers on it.

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And then the flowers
become a fruit.

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:11.150 align:middle line:84%
They change from a
flower into a fruit.

00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And then inside of
the fruit is the seed

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.540 align:middle line:84%
that contains the image
of the whole tree.

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And so there is this cycle
pattern from a tree to a flower

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:25.530 align:middle line:84%
to a fruit to a seed to a
tree again that goes around,

00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:28.070 align:middle line:90%
this particular kind of pattern.

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And they felt that
sacred geometry had

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:34.030 align:middle line:90%
that same kind of nature to it.

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And to show that, this
was the flower here.

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:42.340 align:middle line:84%
It's 19 circles in
here, surrounded by two.

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to take
out the center circle here

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:49.630 align:middle line:84%
and the six around the center--
does everybody understand that?

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:55.130 align:middle line:84%
This one and then there's the
center of one, two, three,

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:56.210 align:middle line:90%
four, five, six.

00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:57.910 align:middle line:90%
Those six circles around there.

00:32:57.910 --> 00:33:04.030 align:middle line:84%
If you take that out like
this, does everybody get that?

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:04.830 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:08.394 align:middle line:10%
This is called the seed of life.

00:33:08.394 --> 00:33:09.685 align:middle line:10%
They felt that it was the seed.

00:33:09.685 --> 00:33:11.184 align:middle line:10%
Now, that was another
one that was--

00:33:11.184 --> 00:33:13.880 align:middle line:10%
I told you it was on the wall
right next to the other one,

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:16.210 align:middle line:10%
right next to the flower.

00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:21.200 align:middle line:10%
And there's another image
here that some of you

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:24.370 align:middle line:10%
are familiar with,
probably, which

00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:27.670 align:middle line:10%
is called the tree of life.

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:35.086 align:middle line:10%
And there are 10 spheres
connected by these lines.

00:33:35.086 --> 00:33:39.060 align:middle line:84%
Now originally, there
were 12 spheres.

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:45.280 align:middle line:84%
No doubt about that because
the oldest known tree of life

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:49.820 align:middle line:90%
is not Hebrew but is Egyptian.

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And they're on three pillars
at Luxor and three pillars

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:55.470 align:middle line:84%
at Karnak, Egypt
with the tree of life

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:58.050 align:middle line:84%
etched right on there,
only with one sphere above

00:33:58.050 --> 00:34:01.640 align:middle line:84%
and one sphere below-- one up
there and one below, up here.

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:04.700 align:middle line:90%


00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:07.350 align:middle line:84%
But the Jews and the
Egyptians had a lot in common.

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:09.360 align:middle line:84%
They lived together
for a long time.

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:13.630 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sure they were
interconnected on this belief.

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:18.219 align:middle line:84%
And the Kabbalah, by the way,
which is the main form that you

00:34:18.219 --> 00:34:25.060 align:middle line:84%
will this through today, which
we tend to believe is Hebrew,

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:27.790 align:middle line:84%
has only been out,
is my understanding,

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:30.770 align:middle line:84%
at least in present day
time, for 1,700 years.

00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:35.270 align:middle line:84%
These pillars go way back,
thousands of-- at least

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:39.020 align:middle line:90%
almost 2,000 years before that.

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:42.469 align:middle line:84%
And now here is
the thing-- if you

00:34:42.469 --> 00:34:46.489 align:middle line:84%
were to take the seed of
life, if this is truly

00:34:46.489 --> 00:34:48.480 align:middle line:84%
the seed, and this
image that I was just

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:52.239 align:middle line:84%
referring to-- how a tree
goes to a flower to a fruit

00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:53.699 align:middle line:90%
to a seed and back to a tree.

00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:56.159 align:middle line:84%
If that image, that
kind of metaphor

00:34:56.159 --> 00:34:59.710 align:middle line:84%
is contained in the
geometry, then the tree

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:03.740 align:middle line:84%
would have to be
contained in the seed.

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:05.370 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:08.280 align:middle line:84%
In there would have
to be-- in the seed

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:09.960 align:middle line:90%
would have to be the tree.

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:14.880 align:middle line:84%
That would have to be the source
of the tree, of the Kabbalah,

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.070 align:middle line:90%
the tree of life.

00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And so if it's
true, then those two

00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:21.282 align:middle line:84%
should superimpose,
geometrically.

00:35:21.282 --> 00:35:22.740 align:middle line:84%
This should fit
right over the top.

00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And when you do it, you'll see
that it fits just like a key,

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:30.230 align:middle line:90%
perfectly.

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:33.020 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely nothing left over.

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:37.844 align:middle line:84%
There's one point there, there,
there, here, here, here, there,

00:35:37.844 --> 00:35:39.190 align:middle line:90%
there, there.

00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And the tenth one is down
here, exactly on the two rims.

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:48.790 align:middle line:10%
If you fit 12, the 12 one that
we found on the other one,

00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:56.150 align:middle line:10%
the 12 one will fit right
on the flower, exactly where

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:59.830 align:middle line:10%
the 11th and the 12th
one will fit precisely

00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:02.990 align:middle line:10%
above and below, delineating
where the flower is.

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:15.450 align:middle line:90%


00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:18.090 align:middle line:90%
So you get a feel.

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:22.020 align:middle line:84%
This is a real gentle feel of
what sacred geometry's about.

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:25.620 align:middle line:84%
It's going to get a
lot more hardcore.

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Logical preciseness is
about to enter into all

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:31.420 align:middle line:90%
of this in a little bit.

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:34.140 align:middle line:84%
These are wheels that are
found on the ceilings in Egypt

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:40.520 align:middle line:84%
in tombs in the really old,
old, oldest of all the tombs.

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:44.670 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows-- no Egyptian
archaeologist on the planet,

00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:46.700 align:middle line:84%
that I know of,
knows what they are.

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And I've talked to many of
the world-famous Egyptian

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.590 align:middle line:90%
archaeologists.

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:53.180 align:middle line:90%
And they don't know.

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:57.540 align:middle line:84%
They don't know what they are or
why they are or what they mean.

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:01.610 align:middle line:84%
But to me, I know
where they came from.

00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:06.380 align:middle line:84%
Thoth showed me how they were
extracted and what they are.

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And slowly over
time, I'll show you.

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:11.120 align:middle line:84%
But they're proof that
the Egyptians just

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:14.624 align:middle line:84%
didn't know about the
pattern of the flower of life

00:37:14.624 --> 00:37:16.290 align:middle line:84%
and didn't know about
all this knowledge

00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:18.110 align:middle line:90%
that we're about to tell you.

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:20.860 align:middle line:84%
They're proof because in
order to get to those wheels,

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:23.065 align:middle line:84%
you've got to go
deep, deep, deep,

00:37:23.065 --> 00:37:24.910 align:middle line:84%
deep into the sacred
geometry until you

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:26.325 align:middle line:90%
get way down in there.

00:37:26.325 --> 00:37:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll find these
wheels that'll come out.

00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:30.480 align:middle line:90%
And they're these guys.

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.712 align:middle line:84%
And they're the key to
the harmonics of music.

00:37:32.712 --> 00:37:35.160 align:middle line:84%
But they're also the
key to the harmonics

00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:37.940 align:middle line:90%
of the dimensional levels.

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And what you see here, these
are always on the ceiling,

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:43.540 align:middle line:90%
up in the sky.

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:45.890 align:middle line:90%
They're surrounded by the stars.

00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And here, though
you can't see this,

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:52.560 align:middle line:84%
is a procession of people
with animal heads walking

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:53.510 align:middle line:90%
in a straight line.

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:56.300 align:middle line:84%
If this was the floor,
it'd be about like that.

00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And they have these
red orange ovals

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:02.750 align:middle line:84%
over their heads, which,
according to Thoth,

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:06.538 align:middle line:84%
used to be called the
egg of metamorphosis.

00:38:06.538 --> 00:38:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And you'll understand
why metamorphosis is

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:12.280 align:middle line:90%
involved in this at one point.

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.650 align:middle line:90%
And they're walking along here.

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly,
there's a 90-degree turn.

00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:17.810 align:middle line:90%
90 degrees.

00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And they're now walking
this way, into the stars.

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And he's putting this sphere
through the bull, which

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:28.210 align:middle line:84%
shows you how old this is, going
back into the time of Taurus.

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:33.410 align:middle line:90%


00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:35.412 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to have to
leave these for a while

00:38:35.412 --> 00:38:36.870 align:middle line:84%
to explain what
they are because we

00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:40.740 align:middle line:84%
have a lot to lay down before
this will all make sense.

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:43.740 align:middle line:84%
But these wheels
are-- they're maps.

00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:47.300 align:middle line:84%
They're telling you
exactly where they went,

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:49.960 align:middle line:84%
precisely where in the
dimensional levels and what

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:53.500 align:middle line:84%
they were doing and
where they were going.

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.980 align:middle line:90%
This is Leonardo's drawing.

00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is all
introduction still.

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:05.986 align:middle line:84%
It's Leonardo's drawing with
a little bit of me on there.

00:39:05.986 --> 00:39:08.850 align:middle line:84%
I drew this person
sitting down here

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:10.564 align:middle line:84%
and some of this
other stuff around it.

00:39:10.564 --> 00:39:12.980 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be a very
important drawing in what we're

00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:15.650 align:middle line:90%
doing.

00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:18.260 align:middle line:84%
Though sacred geometry,
as you will see,

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:21.110 align:middle line:84%
can discuss any
subject whatsoever--

00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:24.250 align:middle line:84%
there is no limit on what
subject it cannot discuss

00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:31.590 align:middle line:84%
and describe in detail-- I'm
going to have blinders on as I

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:33.460 align:middle line:90%
discuss sacred geometry.

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:36.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm only interested
in one thing here.

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:40.490 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of this workshop is
ascension, which is consciously

00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:43.430 align:middle line:84%
moving from one world
to another, bringing

00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:46.690 align:middle line:84%
your body with you, which
is a little different

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:51.560 align:middle line:84%
than resurrection, which is
dying and then afterwards,

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:52.940 align:middle line:84%
while you pass
through the bardo,

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:56.289 align:middle line:84%
to consciously pass
through the great void

00:39:56.289 --> 00:39:58.330 align:middle line:84%
and then reconstruct your
body in that way, which

00:39:58.330 --> 00:39:59.470 align:middle line:90%
is another possibility.

00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:01.970 align:middle line:84%
It's just as noble as
this one, but there's just

00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:04.080 align:middle line:90%
another possibility, is all.

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And so in this one
here, we are going

00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:13.250 align:middle line:84%
to be concerned with ascension,
the vehicle of ascension

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:16.080 align:middle line:90%
called the Merkaba.

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And the understanding
of the Merkaba

00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:20.770 align:middle line:84%
comes from the remembering
of the crystal and energy

00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:23.400 align:middle line:90%
field that surround the body.

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:27.180 align:middle line:84%
This field-- and we've had
instruments that can detect

00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:33.190 align:middle line:84%
this field very carefully--
will average about 55 feet

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:37.830 align:middle line:84%
in diameter, or about 27 1/2
feet radius around the average

00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:38.990 align:middle line:90%
person.

00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:40.840 align:middle line:84%
It'll be bigger
if you are taller

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:43.260 align:middle line:84%
and it'll be slightly
smaller if you are less.

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:45.030 align:middle line:84%
But I'd say it would
average somewhere

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:47.960 align:middle line:90%
between 50 and 60 feet total.

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:51.530 align:middle line:90%
And this is the innermost field.

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:54.200 align:middle line:84%
The innermost field, which just
happens to be right out here

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:59.380 align:middle line:84%
at your fingertips is a
star tetrahedronal field.

00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:02.180 align:middle line:90%
It looks like this.

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:04.777 align:middle line:90%
And this is going to be the key.

00:41:04.777 --> 00:41:06.110 align:middle line:90%
This is going to be the doorway.

00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:07.710 align:middle line:90%
There are other doorways.

00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:10.440 align:middle line:10%
There are other
electromagnetic fields

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:14.320 align:middle line:10%
around the body that could
be utilized to create

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:16.120 align:middle line:10%
different types of Merkabas.

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:18.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to say
this is the only way.

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:20.820 align:middle line:84%
But we're only going to
give instructions on one.

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:25.390 align:middle line:84%
This is the easiest, most
simplest one of them all.

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:28.410 align:middle line:90%
And it's the closest one in.

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:31.580 align:middle line:84%
There is another little tiny
one at the base of the spine,

00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:34.520 align:middle line:84%
little tiny, tiny, tiny,
itty, bitty, bitty, tiny, one,

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:36.890 align:middle line:84%
which is the original
eight cells, which

00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:39.350 align:middle line:84%
are in the form of a star
tetrahedron, which our electron

00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:43.050 align:middle line:84%
microscopes can
see that they are,

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:47.100 align:middle line:84%
and which happens to be in
the center of that field.

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:49.730 align:middle line:84%
We grew geometrically,
radially out.

00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:53.030 align:middle line:90%
We did not grow lengthwise.

00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:55.910 align:middle line:84%
We grew out in
shells that go out.

00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Out at 55 feet, you
will find that there's

00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:00.270 align:middle line:90%
a big, round sphere.

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Just in from the
side of that, you're

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:07.040 align:middle line:84%
going to find that there is
a dodecahedron around that.

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And if you connect the centers
of the dodecahedron together,

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.360 align:middle line:90%
it forms an icosahedron.

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.420 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
nesting pattern that

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:18.930 align:middle line:84%
comes in from there all the
way down to this central place

00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:21.910 align:middle line:90%
at the base of your spine.

00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:25.729 align:middle line:84%
There is a tube that runs from
the top, which is directly

00:42:25.729 --> 00:42:27.520 align:middle line:84%
over the top of your
head-- one hand-length

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:30.660 align:middle line:84%
above your head-- to one
hand-length below your feet

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:31.579 align:middle line:90%
down here.

00:42:31.579 --> 00:42:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And there's a tube that
runs through there.

00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:37.970 align:middle line:84%
That tube, the size will
vary with each person.

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:39.797 align:middle line:84%
But if you take your
thumb and your longest

00:42:39.797 --> 00:42:41.880 align:middle line:84%
finger, your middle finger,
and put them together,

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:45.730 align:middle line:84%
that's how big around
your tube is in diameter.

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And it comes up into a
little crystalline pattern.

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:50.200 align:middle line:90%
It fits up into the apex.

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like a
fluorescent tube running through

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:55.600 align:middle line:84%
and connects down at
this point down here.

00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:57.960 align:middle line:84%
It connects into
other types of fields.

00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:01.680 align:middle line:84%
There's also an octahedronal
field that's around here.

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And it also connects
into other fields.

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:07.640 align:middle line:84%
There's what is called
a cube equilibrium

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:09.180 align:middle line:84%
or a cube octahedron
that is also

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:12.470 align:middle line:90%
connected through this one.

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:14.110 align:middle line:84%
But again, we're
only going to be

00:43:14.110 --> 00:43:16.710 align:middle line:84%
interested in this
one field, these two

00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:19.350 align:middle line:90%
interlocked tetrahedrons.

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And so it is this field
that as I keep speaking,

00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:24.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to keep
aiming for this

00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:29.500 align:middle line:84%
and aiming for this to reach
the understanding of what

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:32.160 align:middle line:90%
this is really all about.

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And the breathing that
we're going to do,

00:43:35.370 --> 00:43:39.250 align:middle line:84%
instead of taking prana or
breath in through our mouth,

00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:41.250 align:middle line:84%
we're going to stop
breathing through our mouth,

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:43.090 align:middle line:84%
like we do now,
and start breathing

00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:45.530 align:middle line:84%
through the top of
her head and begin

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:49.810 align:middle line:84%
to breathe up through the
perineum, from underneath.

00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And just to clarify
this a little bit more,

00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:56.610 align:middle line:84%
for so you who don't
know what prana

00:43:56.610 --> 00:44:02.330 align:middle line:84%
is, there are-- in this
invisible space right here,

00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:05.120 align:middle line:90%
we know that there is air.

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's oxygen, nitrogen,
et cetera, various molecules

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:10.630 align:middle line:90%
of the air.

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:15.550 align:middle line:84%
But also in that space, even
if there was no air there,

00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:17.490 align:middle line:84%
is another substance,
if you want

00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:21.730 align:middle line:84%
to call it a substance, an
energy, which is called prana.

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:25.100 align:middle line:90%
And prana is everywhere.

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:27.786 align:middle line:84%
There is nowhere
where it is not.

00:44:27.786 --> 00:44:30.620 align:middle line:84%
If you had a big chunk
of solid steel here,

00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:33.970 align:middle line:84%
a block as big as this,
it'd be in the center of it.

00:44:33.970 --> 00:44:37.320 align:middle line:84%
If you were in deep space
and absolute voidness,

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:39.405 align:middle line:90%
there is prana there.

00:44:39.405 --> 00:44:41.270 align:middle line:84%
It makes no difference
where you are.

00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:43.580 align:middle line:84%
There's always prana,
and it's all you need.

00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:46.460 align:middle line:90%


00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:49.120 align:middle line:84%
Your new science
of tachyon energy,

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:51.770 align:middle line:84%
which is-- the [? yin ?]
machine and a lot

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:55.070 align:middle line:84%
of the overunity generators
that are now being created

00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:57.650 align:middle line:84%
are simply connecting in
to fourth-dimensional prana

00:44:57.650 --> 00:44:59.780 align:middle line:90%
fields, which is everywhere.

00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:00.580 align:middle line:90%
It's unlimited.

00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:04.550 align:middle line:84%
There's no end to
the amount of energy,

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:07.040 align:middle line:84%
unless we live in a
limited world, like we do,

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.800 align:middle line:84%
where we don't know
about it, and we're

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.500 align:middle line:90%
using oil and stuff like.

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:16.122 align:middle line:84%
Energy is not a problem
for most life forms.

00:45:16.122 --> 00:45:17.580 align:middle line:84%
That's the least
of their problems.

00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:21.017 align:middle line:90%


00:45:21.017 --> 00:45:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And so this is where
we're going to be heading.

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:29.980 align:middle line:84%
We're going to learn
to take the prana

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:34.130 align:middle line:84%
down this tube and the
prana coming up this tube.

00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:36.770 align:middle line:90%
And it's going to meet.

00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:38.780 align:middle line:84%
The male and female
prana's going to meet.

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Where it meets, you can
control with your mind.

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And where it meets,
which chakra it meets in,

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:47.010 align:middle line:84%
which energy center in
the body it meets in,

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:51.270 align:middle line:84%
is an ancient science,
which we're just

00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:57.050 align:middle line:84%
going to start-- just lightly
touch upon here in this class,

00:45:57.050 --> 00:45:58.410 align:middle line:90%
though you guys know it.

00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:01.120 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you know it all, man.

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:05.580 align:middle line:84%
You've used your Merkaba
millions and millions of times.

00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:07.760 align:middle line:84%
This is nothing new,
though for some of you,

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:10.854 align:middle line:90%
you may not quite remember.

00:46:10.854 --> 00:46:12.770 align:middle line:84%
You've got a pretty good
idea that it's there,

00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:14.390 align:middle line:90%
but you can't quite remember.

00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:18.060 align:middle line:84%
But once you connect
into it, the memories

00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:21.975 align:middle line:84%
are going to come back
very rapidly because you're

00:46:21.975 --> 00:46:22.775 align:middle line:90%
professionals.

00:46:22.775 --> 00:46:25.810 align:middle line:90%


00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:28.915 align:middle line:90%
You'll know what it is.

00:46:28.915 --> 00:46:31.340 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:35.340 align:middle line:84%
We're going to come back to
this many, many times again

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:36.840 align:middle line:90%
over here, in time.

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:40.100 align:middle line:90%
But this is where we're heading.

00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Leonardo understood
this very clearly.

00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:45.853 align:middle line:90%
