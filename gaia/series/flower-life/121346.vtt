00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.580 align:middle line:90%


00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>>One day they
made this hologram

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.780 align:middle line:84%
in the room of a square and a
circle that looked like that.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:28.160 align:middle line:84%
It was the first time that I
have any conscious recollection

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.360 align:middle line:84%
of ever seeing that square
in the circle before,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.610 align:middle line:84%
and that particular
relationship.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.110 align:middle line:90%
And they had me look at it.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.930 align:middle line:90%
I looked at it.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.553 align:middle line:84%
And then they said,
do you see it?

00:00:39.553 --> 00:00:40.353 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes.

00:00:40.353 --> 00:00:42.290 align:middle line:90%
And they said, OK.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.787 align:middle line:10%
Your job now is to
find that relationship

00:00:48.787 --> 00:00:51.282 align:middle line:10%
in Metatron's Cube.

00:00:51.282 --> 00:00:56.270 align:middle line:90%


00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.250 align:middle line:10%
And then they left.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.480 align:middle line:10%
And I sat.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.200 align:middle line:10%
I actually thought,
at the moment

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.980 align:middle line:10%
when they left--
because they'd always

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.116 align:middle line:10%
give me those little things.

00:01:04.116 --> 00:01:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And usually I'd figure
them out pretty quick.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.786 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd go
onto the next one.

00:01:06.786 --> 00:01:10.457 align:middle line:84%
And when they gave me
that I figured, well, OK.

00:01:10.457 --> 00:01:11.540 align:middle line:90%
I'll do it in a few hours.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.915 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe I'll get
it by tomorrow.

00:01:12.915 --> 00:01:14.882 align:middle line:90%
And I started working on it.

00:01:14.882 --> 00:01:15.840 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't find it.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.740 align:middle line:90%
And I just kept going.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.681 align:middle line:84%
Days went by and weeks went by
and months starting going by.

00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:25.059 align:middle line:84%
And I was here and I was
getting really frustrated.

00:01:25.059 --> 00:01:26.100 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't figure it out.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.570 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't figure out where
that relationship was inside

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.370 align:middle line:90%
of those circles.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.325 align:middle line:84%
I tried every conceivable
thing that I could think of.

00:01:33.325 --> 00:01:35.720 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I didn't have
12 lines in there, which

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.928 align:middle line:90%
might have made a difference.

00:01:36.928 --> 00:01:40.584 align:middle line:84%
But it still wasn't
where it was at anyway.

00:01:40.584 --> 00:01:42.250 align:middle line:84%
So it wouldn't have
made any difference,

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.312 align:middle line:84%
even if I did have the
proper Metatron's Cube.

00:01:44.312 --> 00:01:47.750 align:middle line:90%


00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And one day the angels
interceded directly,

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.640 align:middle line:84%
which they don't
usually do in my life.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.490 align:middle line:90%
But they have a few times.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.190 align:middle line:90%
And this was one of them.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.180 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting with
this stuff late night,

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.840 align:middle line:84%
with patterns all
over the floor.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And nobody knew what I
was doing, by the way.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.330 align:middle line:90%
This was very secret in my life.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.940 align:middle line:84%
I didn't discuss
this with anyone.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.050 align:middle line:90%
Maybe once in awhile.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.820 align:middle line:90%
It was really rare.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.350 align:middle line:90%
No one really knew.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.290 align:middle line:84%
This was sort of a
thing that I was doing

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.890 align:middle line:90%
and I was driven to do it.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.026 align:middle line:90%
Nobody even cared anyway.

00:02:23.026 --> 00:02:23.826 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:02:23.826 --> 00:02:25.698 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:25.698 --> 00:02:28.038 align:middle line:84%
--didn't really
make any difference.

00:02:28.038 --> 00:02:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And a t this time, nobody
cared about this stuff.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.887 align:middle line:84%
And so one day I've got
it all to the floor.

00:02:35.887 --> 00:02:37.303 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to
find this circle

00:02:37.303 --> 00:02:38.825 align:middle line:90%
and the square of this thing.

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:40.320 align:middle line:90%
And I get a knock on the door.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.454 align:middle line:90%
So I open the door up.

00:02:41.454 --> 00:02:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And here's somebody
standing there

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.536 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen before
in my whole life.

00:02:44.536 --> 00:02:46.800 align:middle line:90%
Tall, kind of, this guy.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And he said he was
sorry to bother me

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.420 align:middle line:84%
and every else like that, but
that he had been sent there

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.100 align:middle line:84%
from this group to talk
to me and to tell me

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.720 align:middle line:90%
about the circle and the square.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And I just kind
of looked at him.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.330 align:middle line:90%


00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.955 align:middle line:84%
I don't think he even
told me his name.

00:03:06.955 --> 00:03:10.330 align:middle line:84%
I just really grabbed him
and pulled him in the room.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.130 align:middle line:90%
Sit down.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.600 align:middle line:84%
If you know anything about
a circle and a square,

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.183 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to
listen to [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:14.183 --> 00:03:17.070 align:middle line:90%


00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And he said he was sent
there right from the Masons,

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.130 align:middle line:84%
that they had told him
that he had to come.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.830 align:middle line:84%
They had given him my
address and everything,

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.780 align:middle line:90%
and told him to come to me.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And so this drawing
here was his.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.070 align:middle line:90%
I didn't draw this.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.130 align:middle line:84%
The very first thing he did is
he made a square on the page.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And the second thing he
did is he made the circle

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.290 align:middle line:90%
before he ever even started.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.580 align:middle line:90%
And I went--

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.528 align:middle line:90%
[GASP]

00:03:40.528 --> 00:03:41.950 align:middle line:90%
--there it is.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:42.900 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:43.870 align:middle line:90%
That's the one.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And then he started making
all these fancy lines

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.800 align:middle line:90%
all over the place.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.380 align:middle line:90%
He divided it like this.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And then he drew a diamond
around here, like that.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And then he drew,
from that point,

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.685 align:middle line:84%
up to the circle and
back, and down the circle

00:04:01.685 --> 00:04:04.906 align:middle line:90%
and back, like that.

00:04:04.906 --> 00:04:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And then he did something
that I didn't quite

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.880 align:middle line:90%
understand at the time.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.530 align:middle line:84%
This line that was here, he drew
a parallel line up to there.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And this line, here, he
drew a parallel line down.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And he reflected this to
this one in the same way,

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.120 align:middle line:90%
forming this pattern like that.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.080 align:middle line:84%
By the rules that I had
understood, that's cheating.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.585 align:middle line:90%
You can't play that game.

00:04:28.585 --> 00:04:33.040 align:middle line:84%
Because these points
don't go anywhere.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.770 align:middle line:84%
Everything has to
go to defined places

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.480 align:middle line:84%
that you can geometrically mark
and you don't have to measure

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.940 align:middle line:90%
or anything else like that.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.840 align:middle line:90%
And these don't go anywhere.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.210 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I had a real
problem with that, when

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.510 align:middle line:90%
he started talking about it.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And so he said the secret
to this whole thing

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.590 align:middle line:84%
is that the perimeter
of the square

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.600 align:middle line:84%
has to equal the
circumference of the circle.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.654 align:middle line:84%
For those of you who've read
Taoism and a lot of the Lao Tzu

00:05:03.654 --> 00:05:05.820 align:middle line:84%
and stuff, the whole thing
about circling the square

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.110 align:middle line:84%
and squaring the
circle, you've probably

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.630 align:middle line:84%
heard this before in
poems and everything else.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.140 align:middle line:84%
It's all trying to
get the geometry so

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.480 align:middle line:90%
that the two equal each other.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And life is constantly
trying to deal

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.830 align:middle line:84%
with this relationship
in so many ways,

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.330 align:middle line:84%
on biological levels
and everything else.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.830 align:middle line:90%
In retrospect, I know that.

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.075 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know that then.

00:05:30.075 --> 00:05:32.750 align:middle line:90%


00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And then he began to tell me
that this created something

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.310 align:middle line:84%
called the Phi ratio--
which I wrote up here

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:50.420 align:middle line:84%
before-- this ratio of
Phi, which equals Phi.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And this ratio is 1.618, is what
it's usually approximated at.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.492 align:middle line:84%
Because what comes after
that is 0, 3, 3, 9.

00:06:01.492 --> 00:06:06.140 align:middle line:84%
But this amount here-- since
this is 0 plus a tiny bit--

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:11.380 align:middle line:84%
is so small that they
just eliminate that.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:24.145 align:middle line:84%
And they approximate
it at 1.618.

00:06:24.145 --> 00:06:25.395 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what this meant.

00:06:25.395 --> 00:06:29.200 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have any idea
what that was at that time.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.589 align:middle line:84%
But he talked about it and how
it was a proportion in life,

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:34.630 align:middle line:90%
and how important it was.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:38.300 align:middle line:84%
He spent about two hours
telling me how important it was.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And he said that all
the lines in here

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.270 align:middle line:84%
were all broken up
into the Phi ratio.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, what the Phi
ratio is, is if you

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:52.150 align:middle line:84%
were to take this little rod
that I have in my hand here,

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.290 align:middle line:84%
there's an infinite number of
places you could cut it in.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.620 align:middle line:84%
But there's only two that
you could cut it or bend it

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.900 align:middle line:90%
in that would be the Phi ratio.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.600 align:middle line:90%
And one would be here.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.491 align:middle line:84%
And one would be
approximately here.

00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:05.740 align:middle line:90%
Those would be the two places.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.342 align:middle line:90%
Real, real close.

00:07:08.342 --> 00:07:12.200 align:middle line:84%
The human can zero
right into that.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.400 align:middle line:84%
Humans can, for example,
pick the center of a circle

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.052 align:middle line:84%
better than most
mechanical things can,

00:07:19.052 --> 00:07:22.004 align:middle line:90%
just by going-- like that.

00:07:22.004 --> 00:07:24.740 align:middle line:90%
Because we can intuit it.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:30.260 align:middle line:84%
If this was the rod,
again, we can either

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.780 align:middle line:84%
pick here or there,
approximately

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.510 align:middle line:90%
where the Phi ratio is.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.256 align:middle line:84%
Now, depending on
which direction

00:07:36.256 --> 00:07:37.630 align:middle line:84%
you're coming
from-- now, this is

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:41.830 align:middle line:84%
what I mean by that-- coming
from, say, this direction--

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:44.220 align:middle line:90%
and this is the Phi ratio here.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.990 align:middle line:84%
This will create a
mathematical proportion such

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:52.320 align:middle line:84%
that if this segment is
A and this segment is B,

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.290 align:middle line:84%
and the whole thing
is C, then it's

00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:05.350 align:middle line:84%
a ratio such that A divided by
B is proportionate to B divided

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.040 align:middle line:90%
by C.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.760 align:middle line:90%
It's just a simple relationship.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And it creates this
mathematical formula,

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:15.150 align:middle line:90%
No matter how big or long.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.330 align:middle line:84%
You can get something
12 miles long.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.260 align:middle line:84%
You're going to cut
it at a certain place.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:20.968 align:middle line:84%
And the miles and
everything will divide.

00:08:20.968 --> 00:08:23.850 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't matter if it's inches or
centimeters or whatever it is.

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:26.470 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make any difference
what your yardstick is.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:27.844 align:middle line:84%
It's always going
to be the same.

00:08:27.844 --> 00:08:35.330 align:middle line:90%


00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.039 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you had never
heard about the Phi ratio,

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:41.690 align:middle line:84%
you would not have
any idea how much you

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:45.450 align:middle line:90%
are emerged in the Phi ratio.

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:50.280 align:middle line:84%
There are so many places that
it would not be possible-- this

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.420 align:middle line:90%
is literally true.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.930 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
places in the body

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:54.770 align:middle line:84%
that it would not be
possible for someone

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:57.212 align:middle line:84%
to count them all
in their lifetime.

00:08:57.212 --> 00:09:00.220 align:middle line:84%
If they were counting every
single day of their lives

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.725 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of their
lives, they couldn't do it.

00:09:03.725 --> 00:09:04.930 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't be possible.

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:07.110 align:middle line:84%
Because there's at least
100 trillion cells.

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:08.780 align:middle line:90%
And it's all through those.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.744 align:middle line:84%
So if you're not
counting all the places

00:09:11.744 --> 00:09:13.910 align:middle line:84%
throughout the rest of the
body and everything else,

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:19.130 align:middle line:84%
it's just phenomenal
where God has used

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:21.480 align:middle line:90%
this same particular ratio.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.940 align:middle line:84%
He then brought in
Leonardo's drawing,

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.580 align:middle line:84%
with a square and
the circle around it,

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:29.180 align:middle line:84%
which I had not really
thought much about before.

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And he talked about
that somewhat.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And oh, then he drew this
compass and this square

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.087 align:middle line:90%
and this eye of somebody.

00:09:38.087 --> 00:09:39.920 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't look like
the right Eye of Horus.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.960 align:middle line:84%
The right Eye of Horus,
it has there three lines.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:42.760 align:middle line:90%
It's Egyptian.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:43.766 align:middle line:90%
It's very different.

00:09:43.766 --> 00:09:46.650 align:middle line:84%
That looks like a real
person's eye kind of there.

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:47.715 align:middle line:90%
And then he left.

00:09:47.715 --> 00:09:51.696 align:middle line:84%
And i never saw him ever
since, the rest of my life.

00:09:51.696 --> 00:09:54.000 align:middle line:90%
But my life's not over with.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:54.800 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:55.993 align:middle line:90%
He may show up.

00:09:55.993 --> 00:10:01.150 align:middle line:90%


00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:02.425 align:middle line:90%
He didn't tell me the answer.

00:10:02.425 --> 00:10:04.750 align:middle line:90%
But after he left, I got it.

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:07.430 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere along
the line, I got it.

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
Metatron's Cube is really

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:10.830 align:middle line:90%
a three-dimensional object.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:12.350 align:middle line:84%
Being three
dimensional, you could

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:16.650 align:middle line:84%
rotate it and look at Metatron's
Cube from a different view.

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And so when you do that, if
you rotate Metatron's Cube

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:25.950 align:middle line:84%
to this view, it becomes
square rather than hexagonal.

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:29.760 align:middle line:84%
Once it's in there like
that, just taking the center

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.810 align:middle line:84%
part of Metatron's Cube
out-- which is really

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:35.170 align:middle line:84%
the egg of life, just this
four little cells look

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:39.190 align:middle line:84%
like that-- well, first
of all, it's in a cube.

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:43.470 align:middle line:84%
So you could put a perfect cube
that would fit around here.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And it has the zona pellucida
around it, which is a sphere.

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And so the very
nature 8-cell division

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:56.170 align:middle line:84%
is that there is a sphere
around it and a cube around it.

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And the cub is such
that it points precisely

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:00.740 align:middle line:84%
to where the 16-cell
division goes.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And that looked like what
they were showing me.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.640 align:middle line:84%
But according to
this guy from Masons,

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:11.030 align:middle line:84%
the key was the perimeter had
to equal the circumference.

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And so I spent several more
years trying to calculate

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:19.090 align:middle line:84%
and finally came up with,
sun-of-a-gun, it doesn't.

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:22.525 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:11:22.525 --> 00:11:28.240 align:middle line:84%
But then I remembered that's
the inner surface of the zona

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.040 align:middle line:90%
pellucida.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:33.140 align:middle line:84%
There's two circles that go
around the flower of life.

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And if you go to the outer
surface of the zona pellucida,

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:38.370 align:middle line:90%
bingo.

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:40.520 align:middle line:90%
It's a near perfect Phi ratio.

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.500 align:middle line:90%
Right on.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.510 align:middle line:90%
It's contained.

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:46.020 align:middle line:84%
This great relationship,
of circling the square,

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.735 align:middle line:84%
and squaring the circle was
contained in the original 8

00:11:48.735 --> 00:11:50.060 align:middle line:90%
cells of life.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And from there, many,
many, many things

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:55.280 align:middle line:84%
begin to unfold very
rapidly for me from there.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:59.680 align:middle line:84%
From now on, whenever you see a
square with four circles in it

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:03.023 align:middle line:84%
like that, we are always
talking about the egg of life.

00:12:03.023 --> 00:12:03.910 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:05.120 align:middle line:90%
Cell division.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.400 align:middle line:90%
So here's these four circles.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.460 align:middle line:84%
I then tried to draw in
these other patterns,

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:11.415 align:middle line:84%
just to see what it would
look like over that,

00:12:11.415 --> 00:12:13.290 align:middle line:84%
superimpose it to see
if I can find anything.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And again, this doesn't
seem to appear to--

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:15.730 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO OUT]

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:16.530 align:middle line:90%
--difference.

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very, very small
amount between the arm length

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:21.430 align:middle line:90%
and the height.

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And that 1/10000 of an
inch is not a mistake.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:28.530 align:middle line:84%
It is part of the
Fibonacci sequence,

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:31.140 align:middle line:90%
which you'll see later.

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:32.070 align:middle line:90%
It's built in.

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.270 align:middle line:90%
It's part of it.

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And so we have this squareness,
or cubeness around us.

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And look where the center
of that square field

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:48.890 align:middle line:84%
is-- exactly here, at the
base of the spine, which

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:54.090 align:middle line:84%
happens to be where this
other little square sits,

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:57.230 align:middle line:90%
of these eight cells.

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Centered in the
center of this cube

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:03.830 align:middle line:84%
is a tiny cube,
with this big cube

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:06.065 align:middle line:90%
out around the outside of us.

00:13:06.065 --> 00:13:09.090 align:middle line:84%
This is what I mean by
we grow radially out

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:10.360 align:middle line:90%
from those original 8 cells.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.000 align:middle line:84%
The lines from the
original 8 cells,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.930 align:middle line:84%
from my way of
seeing, 55 feet right

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:18.920 align:middle line:84%
from the moment of
conception, the moment

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.000 align:middle line:84%
that it gets to this
level here, you've

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.600 align:middle line:84%
got a field, even
on a baby, that's

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.940 align:middle line:84%
going to be 27 and 1/2 feet
out there approximately,

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:27.214 align:middle line:90%
all the way around it.

00:13:27.214 --> 00:13:29.130 align:middle line:84%
The lines, everything,
are extended out there.

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:30.335 align:middle line:90%
The whole thing's there.

00:13:30.335 --> 00:13:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And then we start growing,
just like a crystal,

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:33.840 align:middle line:90%
along the lines.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:37.900 align:middle line:90%


00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.510 align:middle line:84%
If you put your legs out
like this and your arms

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:45.140 align:middle line:84%
out like that, there
will be a perfect sphere

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:50.080 align:middle line:84%
that will fit around the
body, or a circle, either one.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:54.500 align:middle line:84%
But its centered
will be at the navel,

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.959 align:middle line:90%
not at the base of the spine.

00:13:56.959 --> 00:13:58.500 align:middle line:84%
The center of this
one is right here.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.310 align:middle line:84%
You can see, if you
look at the circle,

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:04.830 align:middle line:84%
how I'm aiming into the
center of that circle.

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:11.380 align:middle line:84%
Though the science behind
navels is pretty interesting,

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.400 align:middle line:84%
I'll leave that for
just a little bit more

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.740 align:middle line:90%
to discuss that.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:19.450 align:middle line:84%
But it's not as
straightforward as it looks.

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:22.325 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
the square and the circle

00:14:22.325 --> 00:14:24.485 align:middle line:90%
hit exactly on the floor.

00:14:24.485 --> 00:14:28.120 align:middle line:90%


00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:32.420 align:middle line:84%
If you were to take the
center of the circle

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:36.660 align:middle line:84%
and move it down to the
center of the square,

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.322 align:middle line:90%
this would move exactly halfway.

00:14:39.322 --> 00:14:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And the whole thing
would have that image

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:42.363 align:middle line:90%
that you saw in the first place.

00:14:42.363 --> 00:14:46.700 align:middle line:90%


00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.430 align:middle line:84%
The perimeter of
the square that fits

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:50.940 align:middle line:84%
around the human body and the
circumference of the circle

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.360 align:middle line:84%
that fits around
the human body--

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.680 align:middle line:84%
of this particular body--
is almost identical.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And I can prove that
mathematically in a little bit.

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:03.070 align:middle line:90%
It's almost exactly the same.

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:05.210 align:middle line:90%
Almost is part of the game here.

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:06.130 align:middle line:90%
We've got to wait.

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:07.900 align:middle line:84%
You'll see what this
almost is all about.

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:11.560 align:middle line:84%
There's no mistakes in the
geometry of life at all.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.360 align:middle line:90%
None.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.500 align:middle line:90%
Everything is flawless.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.030 align:middle line:90%
It all runs right down there.

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And soon we're going to see that
all these lines that Leonardo

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.387 align:middle line:84%
drew on the body, you see
the lines, the wrists in here

00:15:23.387 --> 00:15:26.750 align:middle line:84%
and here, and across the
neck, and here, here,

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:29.890 align:middle line:84%
and across the knees,
everything, then the face

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:31.900 align:middle line:90%
is broken up in all these lines.

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.350 align:middle line:90%
These all have deep meaning.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And this man obviously
knew about what

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.140 align:middle line:90%
we are about to discuss.

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'll be able to
pretty clearly show

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:45.580 align:middle line:90%
to you that that's true.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.250 align:middle line:84%
Only we are just
beginning to get

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:49.590 align:middle line:90%
into what this is all about.

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:56.560 align:middle line:84%
But Leonardo was right on top
of all of this a long time ago.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.185 align:middle line:84%
This thing about
Phi ratio again,

00:15:58.185 --> 00:16:00.560 align:middle line:84%
which we still don't really
know what it's all about yet.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:05.080 align:middle line:90%


00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:09.780 align:middle line:84%
According to Thoth,
"As above, so below."

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:13.100 align:middle line:84%
He was the one that
said that, by the way.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And the human body is the
measuring stick of the universe

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.180 align:middle line:90%
and the fields of the body.

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:28.540 align:middle line:84%
It measures the macrocosm
as well as the microcosm.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:32.200 align:middle line:84%
Anything that you need to
know on any level of existence

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:36.730 align:middle line:84%
whatsoever is contained
in the human field.

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:39.058 align:middle line:84%
It's the open book
of all that is.

00:16:39.058 --> 00:16:43.640 align:middle line:90%


00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And so anything you want
to know should be there.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And one of the main things
is this Phi ratio thing

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:53.030 align:middle line:84%
should be in the very
proportions of the human body.

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And where that is located is if
you got a square around here,

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:02.400 align:middle line:84%
with a line down
the middle, right?

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.984 align:middle line:84%
And if you drew the line,
divided the body in half

00:17:04.984 --> 00:17:08.640 align:middle line:84%
down the middle, and then you
drew it diagonal from there

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:12.700 align:middle line:84%
to there, that line that
comes down as a diagonal

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.069 align:middle line:84%
and goes over there,
the bend in it

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:21.240 align:middle line:84%
is mathematically
exactly the Phi ratio.

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.930 align:middle line:84%
It could not be
any more perfect.

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:25.250 align:middle line:90%
It's not even possible.

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:28.470 align:middle line:84%
Here is the square around
the body and a line

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:29.270 align:middle line:90%
down the middle.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is that
diagonal that would go up

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:32.900 align:middle line:84%
to this imaginary
corner up there.

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:34.914 align:middle line:84%
If you just use one
edge is 1-- that's

00:17:34.914 --> 00:17:36.330 align:middle line:84%
you're measuring
stick-- then this

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:38.080 align:middle line:90%
divides this into 1/2 and 1/2.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.230 align:middle line:90%
So you got that right away.

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And what you're
looking for is c.

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:45.095 align:middle line:90%
And this'll be b.

00:17:45.095 --> 00:17:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And this one over
here will be a.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And remember that
ratio that we showed

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.860 align:middle line:84%
over there, a divided by b, it's
going to be equal to b divided

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:57.995 align:middle line:90%
by a plus b, or b divided by c.

00:17:57.995 --> 00:18:01.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, c, what I've
done here is I've

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:04.380 align:middle line:84%
taken line like that, a compass
and rule this out like that.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:08.360 align:middle line:90%
So this b is the same as this b.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.656 align:middle line:84%
And so you've got
a line a and b.

00:18:10.656 --> 00:18:12.540 align:middle line:90%
And the whole line is c.

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And so you got a divided
by b is proportionate to b

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.480 align:middle line:84%
divided by a plus b,
or proportionate to b

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.980 align:middle line:90%
divided by c.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.690 align:middle line:84%
We also know because
when Pythagoras lived,

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:27.410 align:middle line:84%
he said that b squared
equals this side squared

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:28.460 align:middle line:90%
plus this side squared.

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:29.550 align:middle line:90%
And this side is a.

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:33.550 align:middle line:84%
So you have b squared equals
a squared plus 1 squared.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:35.720 align:middle line:90%
a squared we know is 1/2.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.380 align:middle line:90%
And 1 squared is 1.

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:40.660 align:middle line:90%
And 1/2 squared is 1/4.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.430 align:middle line:90%
So b squared equals 5/4.

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:45.520 align:middle line:84%
Or b equals the square
root of 5 divided by 2.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:49.210 align:middle line:84%
So this equals the square
root of 5 divided by 2.

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And we know another
simple equation

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:54.350 align:middle line:90%
is that c equals a plus b.

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And c is what we're
looking for here.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And if you take a,
which is 1/2, and b,

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:02.860 align:middle line:84%
which is the square
root of 5 divided by 2--

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:07.080 align:middle line:84%
so c equals 1/2 plus the
square root of 5 divided by 2.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.650 align:middle line:90%
Just try it.

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:11.590 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:13.060 align:middle line:90%


00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:14.530 align:middle line:90%
Take--

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:16.980 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:18.450 align:middle line:90%

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:22.370 align:middle line:90%


00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:25.800 align:middle line:84%
Take that formula and put
it into your computer.

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:30.800 align:middle line:84%
Just take 0.5 plus square
root of 5 divided by 2.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.150 align:middle line:90%
It's a simple equation.

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:35.203 align:middle line:84%
Put it into any little computer
and watch what happens.

00:19:35.203 --> 00:19:36.003 align:middle line:90%
It'll go 1.618.

00:19:36.003 --> 00:19:36.803 align:middle line:90%
And it'll go--

00:19:36.803 --> 00:19:39.570 align:middle line:90%
[WARBLING SOUND]

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:41.650 align:middle line:84%
--until it runs out
of computer chips.

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:42.450 align:middle line:90%
It'll never go.

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:44.380 align:middle line:84%
If you've got a lot of
computer chips in there,

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:45.200 align:middle line:90%
you better wait a while.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.616 align:middle line:84%
Cause that thing's
going to really

00:19:46.616 --> 00:19:49.836 align:middle line:84%
be going like this,
trying to find an end.

00:19:49.836 --> 00:19:53.330 align:middle line:84%
It won't ever find an end
and hit it right on the nail

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:56.180 align:middle line:90%
exactly, right on the nail.

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:57.674 align:middle line:90%
That is how you get to that.

00:19:57.674 --> 00:19:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's in the
human proportions.

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:03.596 align:middle line:90%


00:20:03.596 --> 00:20:05.720 align:middle line:84%
So here's the human body
this line down the middle,

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:07.600 align:middle line:84%
and this diagonal
coming up here.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you were to draw a line
from the navel straight across

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:15.290 align:middle line:84%
here, over to this
point, parallel with it,

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:19.360 align:middle line:84%
from here to here, another
one of those no-no's.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.400 align:middle line:84%
This is not my
drawing originally.

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.810 align:middle line:90%
This is someone else's.

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:26.310 align:middle line:90%


00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:29.945 align:middle line:84%
First thing is that these
two lines cross exactly

00:20:29.945 --> 00:20:31.720 align:middle line:90%
at the Phi ratio.

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:34.680 align:middle line:84%
This line is broken
into the Phi ratio.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.940 align:middle line:84%
This line is broken
into the Phi ratio.

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.470 align:middle line:90%


00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:43.500 align:middle line:84%
We haven't talked about it yet,
but this is a golden triangle.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:44.870 align:middle line:90%
And this is a golden triangle.

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And this big one is
a golden triangle,

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:49.050 align:middle line:90%
creating this same pattern.

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:50.996 align:middle line:84%
And this line-- from
the top of the head

00:20:50.996 --> 00:20:53.120 align:middle line:84%
to navel, from the navel
to the bottom of the feet,

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.420 align:middle line:84%
is also broken in
the Phi ratio, which

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.520 align:middle line:84%
means the top of the body
relative to the bottom

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:01.287 align:middle line:84%
of the body from the
navel is in the Phi ratio.

00:21:01.287 --> 00:21:03.620 align:middle line:84%
Though it's a little more
complex than that-- and people

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:07.340 align:middle line:84%
have studied this in great
detail-- when a baby is born,

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:08.830 align:middle line:84%
the navel is in
the dead center--

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:09.830 align:middle line:90%
shouldn't use that word.

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:13.830 align:middle line:84%
It is in the precise
center of the baby.

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:16.100 align:middle line:84%
So it's right in the
center of the baby.

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:22.670 align:middle line:84%
But as the baby
starts growing, it

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:24.470 align:middle line:84%
starts heading
towards Phi ratio.

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And it goes above it and
then below it, and above it

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:28.892 align:middle line:84%
and below it and
above it and below it.

00:21:28.892 --> 00:21:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And starts zeroing in, getting
closer and closer and closer

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:33.340 align:middle line:84%
and closer and
closer to Phi ratio

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:35.734 align:middle line:84%
as the child gets older
and older and older

00:21:35.734 --> 00:21:38.650 align:middle line:84%
and approaches adult.
And a female, I believe,

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:43.010 align:middle line:84%
ends up where the navel
is above the phi ratio.

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And the male ends up
with it slightly below.

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:46.510 align:middle line:90%
You got to average the two.

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:48.890 align:middle line:90%
And you get the Phi ratio.

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:51.220 align:middle line:84%
This is what the
computers have found.

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:54.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's even more amazing than
just saying it's the Phi ratio.

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:59.570 align:middle line:90%


00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:01.419 align:middle line:84%
But it's not just the
top half of the body

00:22:01.419 --> 00:22:03.460 align:middle line:84%
and the Phi ratio of the
bottom half of the body,

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:04.690 align:middle line:90%
as you're about to see.

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:09.150 align:middle line:84%
It's really a much
more complex situation.

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:11.570 align:middle line:90%
Taking the finger, for example.

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:14.190 align:middle line:84%
Every bend in your body
is in the Phi ratio.

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:17.250 align:middle line:84%
If you take this bone
compared to this bone,

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:18.910 align:middle line:90%
that's in the Phi ratio.

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:20.980 align:middle line:84%
This bone is in the
Phi ratio to this one.

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:23.295 align:middle line:84%
And this one's in the
Phi ratio to this one.

00:22:23.295 --> 00:22:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And all the bones in through
your hands and your feet

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.800 align:middle line:84%
are all bent exactly
at the Phi ratio.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.720 align:middle line:90%


00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:37.620 align:middle line:84%
The length of your hand
compared to this bone, that

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:38.810 align:middle line:90%
bends at the Phi ratio.

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And this one, this bone
relative to this bone,

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:42.870 align:middle line:90%
bends at the Phi ratio.

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:44.910 align:middle line:84%
The length of your
foot to this one,

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:46.810 align:middle line:84%
and the length of
this bone to this one,

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:48.226 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, all the
way up through.

00:22:48.226 --> 00:22:50.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's all your bones
are. all in the Phi ratio,

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:52.840 align:middle line:90%
running through your whole body.

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.929 align:middle line:84%
And even things that
you wouldn't normally

00:22:55.929 --> 00:22:57.970 align:middle line:84%
think about-- you probably
never saw this before.

00:22:57.970 --> 00:22:59.640 align:middle line:84%
Though you may have
learned about it.

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And we haven't talked about
the Golden Mean Spiral,

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:02.530 align:middle line:90%
though we will in a minute.

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:04.172 align:middle line:90%
I always forget to use this one.

00:23:04.172 --> 00:23:05.380 align:middle line:90%
You take your hand like this.

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:06.255 align:middle line:90%
And you go like this.

00:23:06.255 --> 00:23:08.700 align:middle line:90%
Now watch.

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.820 align:middle line:90%
Can see that ratio?

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.700 align:middle line:84%
They move in the Golden
Mean Spiral, as they move.

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:15.535 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a
Fibonacci spiral.

00:23:15.535 --> 00:23:17.970 align:middle line:84%
You can see the spiraling
like in a nautilus shell

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:20.510 align:middle line:90%
that happens in there.

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:24.370 align:middle line:84%
If you even do
things, do something

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:26.680 align:middle line:84%
real unusual like
this, where you connect

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.640 align:middle line:84%
the centers of each
one of your fingertips

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.700 align:middle line:84%
into zigzag patterns,
each one of these bends

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:35.740 align:middle line:84%
are in the Phi ratio, as
they go down there like that.

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:38.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's emerged throughout
your whole body,

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:40.500 align:middle line:90%
but in all kinds of ways.

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.590 align:middle line:84%
The sizes of organs relative
to the sizes of other organs

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:48.360 align:middle line:84%
and in the cells, the sizes
of nuclei to other things.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:51.240 align:middle line:84%
It just goes on and on
and on and on and on.

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.485 align:middle line:90%
It's somewhat redundant.

00:23:52.485 --> 00:23:55.030 align:middle line:90%


00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:57.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, the ancients were
well aware of this.

00:23:57.230 --> 00:24:01.800 align:middle line:84%
The Greeks, Egyptians, Chinese,
all of them from a long time

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:05.250 align:middle line:84%
ago, they understood this
relationship in life.

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And so this, by the
way, is another way

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.607 align:middle line:90%
to show a Phi ratio.

00:24:11.607 --> 00:24:13.690 align:middle line:84%
In other words, instead
of showing a straight line

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:15.400 align:middle line:84%
with a dot on it,
if you were going

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.275 align:middle line:84%
to show a bunch of Phi
ratios, all you'd have

00:24:17.275 --> 00:24:19.250 align:middle line:90%
is a bunch of dots on a line.

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:22.890 align:middle line:84%
So another way to do it
is have a curve like this,

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:24.980 align:middle line:84%
showing where it crosses
at the Phi ratio.

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And this way, you can see
all the curves at one time,

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.560 align:middle line:84%
and see where one came
from to the next one.

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.980 align:middle line:84%
This came out of the
"Power of Limits"

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.900 align:middle line:90%
by-- I can't pronounce his name.

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:37.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.617 align:middle line:90%
Doczi?

00:24:39.617 --> 00:24:41.450 align:middle line:84%
Does anybody know how
to pronounce his name?

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:43.158 align:middle line:84%
It's a book called
"The Power of Limits".

00:24:43.158 --> 00:24:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very, very, very
good book on sacred geometry.

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And here, you can see how
they have the navel here.

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And they even showed
it slightly above,

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:58.580 align:middle line:84%
which is accurate on this, and
exactly where the nipples are,

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:00.730 align:middle line:90%
forms another Phi ratio in here.

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:03.810 align:middle line:84%
It forms a Phi ratio
with the knees.

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:06.090 align:middle line:84%
Examine all your various
points in your body.

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:07.740 align:middle line:90%
And this is just a few.

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:11.715 align:middle line:84%
You can just keep going
on and on and on and on.

00:25:11.715 --> 00:25:13.090 align:middle line:84%
But the point I
want to make here

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:17.780 align:middle line:84%
is the Greeks, when
they understood this,

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:20.802 align:middle line:84%
they created architecture
and all of their arts

00:25:20.802 --> 00:25:22.760 align:middle line:84%
using both sides of their
brain simultaneously.

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:25.830 align:middle line:90%


00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:29.740 align:middle line:84%
They used the left side,
their logical male side,

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:34.930 align:middle line:84%
that when they were making
this sculpture they carefully,

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:39.270 align:middle line:84%
carefully measured all
the links of everything.

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:40.780 align:middle line:90%
There was no intuitiveness.

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:41.580 align:middle line:90%
None.

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:42.820 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely zero.

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:46.650 align:middle line:84%
Everything was used and
carefully, carefully measured.

00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:51.860 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, they
used their creative side,

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:55.710 align:middle line:84%
their feminine
creative side to decide

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:57.440 align:middle line:84%
exactly how he's
going to be standing

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.380 align:middle line:84%
and where he's looking, and
what he's going to feel like,

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:01.796 align:middle line:84%
and what kind of smile he's
got, and all these other kinds

00:26:01.796 --> 00:26:02.785 align:middle line:90%
of things on his face.

00:26:02.785 --> 00:26:05.980 align:middle line:90%


00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And the unity between
the left and right side

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:10.230 align:middle line:84%
of the brains in
this kind of way

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:13.810 align:middle line:84%
created an art form
that is stupendous.

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:17.060 align:middle line:84%
The Greek sculpture
is incredible.

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And yet the Romans came
in directly behind them,

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:24.690 align:middle line:84%
did not know anything for
many, many, many years later,

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:26.500 align:middle line:90%
until the Italian Renaissance.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:29.230 align:middle line:84%
Did not know about
this mathematics that

00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:32.280 align:middle line:84%
was behind this sculpture and
their buildings and everything

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.304 align:middle line:84%
else that they had at
the Greek Parthenon.

00:26:34.304 --> 00:26:35.470 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know about that.

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And all they saw was these
amazing statues and amazing art

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.440 align:middle line:90%
work.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Even the bulls, where
the bulls come in

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:44.340 align:middle line:84%
and where the art's laid
out on it, the sizes of them

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:47.060 align:middle line:84%
and everything, was
all in sacred geometry.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And so when the Romans
tried to do this,

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:56.040 align:middle line:84%
they just tried
to, like, copy it.

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:59.160 align:middle line:84%
They tried to intuit the
feelings of this stuff.

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And some of them got very
good, like Michelangelo.

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:04.380 align:middle line:84%
But at that point, I
actually think by that time

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:05.180 align:middle line:90%
he already knew.

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:07.670 align:middle line:90%
He knew about Sacred Geometry.

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:10.470 align:middle line:84%
But in the beginnings, when they
first took over, they didn't.

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And you look at the
initial stages of Roman art

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:17.140 align:middle line:84%
relative to Greek
art, and forget it.

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:18.700 align:middle line:90%
They're not even close, man.

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:22.670 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have anything even
close to the type of feel that

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:24.080 align:middle line:90%
was in the Greek art.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:28.540 align:middle line:84%
But this proportions of
life, called the Phi ratio,

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:31.380 align:middle line:84%
is not just in the
human structure.

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:34.100 align:middle line:90%
It's in all life-- everything.

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:37.420 align:middle line:84%
The bugs, the plants and
trees, and relationship

00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:39.450 align:middle line:84%
of planets and orbits
and everything else.

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:40.426 align:middle line:90%
It's in all of it.

00:27:40.426 --> 00:27:44.780 align:middle line:84%
It ties down into electrons
and everything else.

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:49.904 align:middle line:84%
But even in here, you can
see the relationships.

00:27:49.904 --> 00:27:51.070 align:middle line:90%
This is not a real good one.

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:53.470 align:middle line:84%
But the length of
the body compared

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:55.530 align:middle line:84%
to the size the wings
and everything else,

00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:56.760 align:middle line:84%
and if you were really
going to get into it,

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.010 align:middle line:84%
where the dots are located
and everything else,

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:01.710 align:middle line:90%
is all Phi ratio stuff.

00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:03.110 align:middle line:90%
This one is a Dragonfly.

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And the length of each
tail segment coming in here

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:09.536 align:middle line:84%
is all in these cascading
Phi ratios over here.

00:28:09.536 --> 00:28:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And then they
didn't get into it.

00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:13.750 align:middle line:84%
But the bend in every
one of the legs and arms,

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:17.160 align:middle line:84%
and the size of the head this
way relative to this way,

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.600 align:middle line:84%
even the overall
structure-- like,

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.630 align:middle line:84%
we have a square
that fits around us.

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is a rectangle
that fits around that.

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:27.840 align:middle line:84%
All of the external
fields that fit

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:30.240 align:middle line:84%
around all of the
geometrical forms

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.614 align:middle line:84%
are all going to be
functions of this.

00:28:32.614 --> 00:28:33.530 align:middle line:90%
Now, ours is directly.

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:34.890 align:middle line:90%
It's a square.

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:36.280 align:middle line:90%
But there's the square.

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.550 align:middle line:90%
There's the diamond.

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:40.110 align:middle line:84%
There's the diamond field this
way, which is a rectangle.

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:42.470 align:middle line:84%
The diamond field this
way, which is a rectangle.

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:44.550 align:middle line:84%
There's a hexagonal
field that goes this way.

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And there's another one
that fits up over this way.

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And the outer
fields are all going

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:54.450 align:middle line:84%
to be directly associated with
those or functions of them.

00:28:54.450 --> 00:29:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Many additions, multiplications,
divisions, those shapes.

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:05.512 align:middle line:90%
And this is a frog skeleton.

00:29:05.512 --> 00:29:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
here, where they've

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:10.850 align:middle line:84%
shown all the divisions
inside the frog overall,

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:14.060 align:middle line:84%
broken down into these
very strict mathematics.

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:18.256 align:middle line:90%
It's not just at random.

00:29:18.256 --> 00:29:20.180 align:middle line:90%
There's no randomness.

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And this one is fish, which I
chose this one because there's

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:26.300 align:middle line:84%
so many different kinds
of fish, that it's

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:32.240 align:middle line:84%
hard to imagine that they could
all be purely mathematical.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:35.740 align:middle line:84%
They really do seem to
be non-mathematical.

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:36.800 align:middle line:90%
But they're really not.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:42.610 align:middle line:90%


00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Once an outer body
shape takes place,

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:48.490 align:middle line:84%
it very rapidly determines
everything else--

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:52.520 align:middle line:84%
where the fin is going to be
located, and how high and long.

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And all these kind of
things will be determined.

00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:57.430 align:middle line:84%
There's only certain
shapes there can be.

00:29:57.430 --> 00:30:00.780 align:middle line:84%
Once you make one line,
then you have predetermined

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:02.770 align:middle line:90%
a lot of other lines.

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:08.540 align:middle line:84%
In fact, all forms are
probably holographic.

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:11.080 align:middle line:84%
I say that because of some of
the work of Lucy [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:15.994 align:middle line:84%
later on, which I'll show
you some of things she did.

00:30:15.994 --> 00:30:18.180 align:middle line:84%
I'll actually show you
the photograph of this.

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:21.020 align:middle line:84%
She was at the Karnak
Temple in Egypt.

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:23.385 align:middle line:84%
And there was this
big pile of rocks

00:30:23.385 --> 00:30:25.889 align:middle line:84%
that they had
gathered up, that had

00:30:25.889 --> 00:30:28.430 align:middle line:84%
been thrown all over the place
when this place was destroyed.

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:29.770 align:middle line:90%
It was a temple.

00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:32.837 align:middle line:84%
The Romans came in and
really wrecked things up.

00:30:32.837 --> 00:30:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And all these rocks were just
all broken up into pieces.

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:37.130 align:middle line:84%
They knew they were
from the same temple.

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:39.230 align:middle line:84%
Because there was an
unusual kind of rock.

00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:41.270 align:middle line:84%
They were different than
anything else there.

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:43.090 align:middle line:84%
But it's just a
big pile of rocks.

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:46.000 align:middle line:84%
So they just piled them
up in this big pile.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And Lucy came up and just
picked up one of these rocks--

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:54.206 align:middle line:84%
it was in good shape--
and measured it.

00:30:54.206 --> 00:30:56.580 align:middle line:84%
Went back and made a drawing
of what the temple was going

00:30:56.580 --> 00:31:00.060 align:middle line:90%
to look like-- the whole thing.

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:02.512 align:middle line:84%
And they took the drawing
and put it together.

00:31:02.512 --> 00:31:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And when you see
it a little later,

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:07.200 align:middle line:84%
you won't believe that that
would have been possible.

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.000 align:middle line:90%
But it did.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And she did it on
another temple too.

00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:14.260 align:middle line:84%
That's when I really became
interested in her work.

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:15.769 align:middle line:90%
She was amazing person.

00:31:15.769 --> 00:31:18.060 align:middle line:84%
But we'll have to wait till
a little later to see that.

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:20.700 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't have told you that.

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:22.413 align:middle line:90%
