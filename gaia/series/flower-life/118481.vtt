00:00:03.437 --> 00:00:24.080 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.872 align:middle line:84%
>>Where I need to go into
now is where we generally

00:00:26.872 --> 00:00:28.080 align:middle line:90%
start the slide presentation.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.010 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we start
talking about our belief

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.770 align:middle line:84%
patterns and what we think
is true and is not true.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.450 align:middle line:84%
You see, we were all raised
with a certain-- most of us

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.750 align:middle line:84%
were raised with a certain
belief pattern about how

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.075 align:middle line:90%
things were and how things are.

00:00:49.075 --> 00:00:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And we have certain
limitations that

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.595 align:middle line:84%
are placed on ourselves
by our parents

00:00:52.595 --> 00:00:55.950 align:middle line:84%
because of what we believe
is true and what is not true.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.620 align:middle line:84%
As this unfolds more
and more, you'll

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.770 align:middle line:84%
see how important your
belief patterns are.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And there are many--
let's start another way.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.710 align:middle line:90%


00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.100 align:middle line:84%
The history of our
planet as we know it,

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.370 align:middle line:84%
what we get in our history
books and our schools,

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.380 align:middle line:90%
very well may not be true.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.530 align:middle line:84%
It may not even be close to
the truth, not even close.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.230 align:middle line:84%
Because realize that
whatever-- the books were

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.660 align:middle line:84%
written by the people
that win the wars.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.390 align:middle line:84%
It was always wars that
shaped our history.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And so whoever won
that war said, well,

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.400 align:middle line:90%
this is what happened.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times it was just
a single person like a king

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.208 align:middle line:84%
or something deciding
this is what happened.

00:01:50.208 --> 00:01:53.980 align:middle line:90%
And this may not be even true.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.616 align:middle line:84%
What would happen if Hitler
had won World War II?

00:01:57.616 --> 00:01:58.990 align:middle line:84%
How would the
history books read?

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.084 align:middle line:90%


00:02:02.084 --> 00:02:03.860 align:middle line:90%
Totally different.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:04.660 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.229 align:middle line:84%
You know, we would have been
the bad guys and, you know.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.404 align:middle line:84%
>>It was necessary to
cleanse the human--

00:02:10.404 --> 00:02:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>>It would be necessary
to [AUDIO OUT] important.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.670 align:middle line:90%
All these various things.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.921 align:middle line:90%
Totally would have changed.

00:02:19.921 --> 00:02:22.170 align:middle line:84%
But we don't think about
that when we do these things.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.810 align:middle line:84%
We just assume this
is the way it is.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And on many, many, many
levels we've been given this.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.670 align:middle line:84%
Not just in history but
in all kinds of levels

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.590 align:middle line:84%
we've been given this
same kind of thing.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:42.720 align:middle line:84%
Our parents tell us, you can
do this but you can't do this.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.518 align:middle line:84%
You can jump 6 feet high but
you can't jump 30 feet high.

00:02:45.518 --> 00:02:49.340 align:middle line:90%


00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.400 align:middle line:84%
The doctors tell us you
can cure this disease

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.702 align:middle line:90%
but you can't cure that one.

00:02:53.702 --> 00:02:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And we keep putting these
walls and these limitations

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.160 align:middle line:84%
on what's true and what's
possible and everything else.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Until someone comes along
and breaks those rules.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.410 align:middle line:84%
But in history,
the rules have been

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.030 align:middle line:90%
broken many, many, many times.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.460 align:middle line:84%
But our history people just
keep shoving these things

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.260 align:middle line:90%
under the mat.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.090 align:middle line:90%
They don't want us to see it.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.574 align:middle line:84%
They don't want us to know
about a lot of these things.

00:03:17.574 --> 00:03:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's only until really
recently, the last 20

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.150 align:middle line:84%
years or so, that a
lot of these things

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.890 align:middle line:84%
have been allowed
to be talked about.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.090 align:middle line:84%
Before that, you just
couldn't even talk about them.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.116 align:middle line:90%
They wouldn't let you.

00:03:29.116 --> 00:03:31.900 align:middle line:90%


00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.470 align:middle line:84%
So I'm starting
with this first one,

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.860 align:middle line:90%
which is from Robert Temple.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.970 align:middle line:84%
He wrote a book called
"The Sirius Mystery,"

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.180 align:middle line:90%
the star Sirius.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.880 align:middle line:10%
And he chose this
particular subject matter

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.770 align:middle line:10%
after looking at,
I think, 11 or 12

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.884 align:middle line:10%
other subjects that
were just about as good.

00:03:48.884 --> 00:03:50.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad he chose this
one for certain reasons

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.240 align:middle line:90%
that you'll see.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And what Robert was
writing about it

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.520 align:middle line:84%
was that there was
this tribe in Africa

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.670 align:middle line:84%
called the Dogon tribe that
holds certain information

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.230 align:middle line:84%
that, by our present-day
standards of understanding,

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.620 align:middle line:84%
they could not have
this information.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.670 align:middle line:84%
It's impossible for them
to have the information.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.371 align:middle line:90%
It's written in these caves.

00:04:16.371 --> 00:04:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's been written in
these caves for 700 years.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.280 align:middle line:84%
It's all written
down in these caves.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And there's this one man, this
one Dogon man, who sits there.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.830 align:middle line:90%
And he's untouchable.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:27.945 align:middle line:90%
Nobody can ever touch him.

00:04:27.945 --> 00:04:29.528 align:middle line:84%
And he sits there
and guards the cave.

00:04:29.528 --> 00:04:31.566 align:middle line:84%
That's his whole job
for his whole life.

00:04:31.566 --> 00:04:33.815 align:middle line:84%
And when he's done, they
give it to this one other guy

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:36.270 align:middle line:84%
who sits there for his whole
life and guards this cave.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.396 align:middle line:84%
And he has all these symbols
and everything in there.

00:04:39.396 --> 00:04:43.080 align:middle line:84%
And according to
the Dogons, they

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.660 align:middle line:84%
talk about that there is
another star, a dark star,

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.100 align:middle line:90%
that rotates around Sirius.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.800 align:middle line:10%
Sirius is the brightest
star in the sky.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.200 align:middle line:10%
It's a 4.6 magnitude.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.320 align:middle line:10%
And if you were to look at
the belt of Orion, which

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.200 align:middle line:10%
is three stars, you could
go to your left about so far

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.720 align:middle line:10%
in the sky and you'd come
over to this really, really

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.136 align:middle line:10%
bright star, which is Sirius.

00:05:08.136 --> 00:05:11.560 align:middle line:84%
If you move the other way
you'll come up to the Pleiades.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And according to
the Dogons, there's

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.920 align:middle line:84%
another star that
rotates around that star.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And they're very, very
specific about this other star.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:29.480 align:middle line:84%
They say that it's this very
heavy matter, extremely heavy

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.480 align:middle line:84%
matter that the
star's made out of,

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.730 align:middle line:84%
and that it's an
old ancient star,

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:40.132 align:middle line:84%
and that it's real little, and
that revolves around this star.

00:05:40.132 --> 00:05:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Now this is where a
contradiction that I

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.450 align:middle line:90%
have to check out on my own.

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.358 align:middle line:84%
Everything I've ever read has
said that it was 50 years.

00:05:50.358 --> 00:05:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And however, a
television special

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.840 align:middle line:84%
just came up recently
and said it was 60 years.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.632 align:middle line:84%
And I about fell over because
everything I've ever read

00:05:57.632 --> 00:05:59.295 align:middle line:90%
says only 50 years.

00:05:59.295 --> 00:06:00.245 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure now.

00:06:00.245 --> 00:06:01.530 align:middle line:90%
I've got to check this out.

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.500 align:middle line:84%
But it was either 50 or 60
years that this star rotated

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.070 align:middle line:90%
around an even 50 or 60 years.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have
checked here on Earth

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:18.022 align:middle line:84%
and have never been
able to see this star.

00:06:18.022 --> 00:06:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't know, so we
just assumed it was fantasy.

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:28.255 align:middle line:84%
Until I believe in the 1950s
they got a telescope finally--

00:06:28.255 --> 00:06:31.680 align:middle line:84%
I had thought also that it
had been done from space when

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.048 align:middle line:90%
they first put one in space.

00:06:33.048 --> 00:06:34.933 align:middle line:84%
But they said in
this TV thing that it

00:06:34.933 --> 00:06:36.802 align:middle line:90%
had been done from the ground.

00:06:36.802 --> 00:06:38.260 align:middle line:84%
They finally got
to the place where

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.810 align:middle line:84%
they were able to see this star
one way or another out there.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.915 align:middle line:84%
And they saw this star
and were able to locate

00:06:44.915 --> 00:06:48.215 align:middle line:84%
and they did locate this other
little star moving around it.

00:06:48.215 --> 00:06:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And when they did they were
amazed because the star

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.760 align:middle line:90%
was a white dwarf.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.107 align:middle line:90%
Stars are like people.

00:06:54.107 --> 00:06:56.442 align:middle line:90%
They live and they grow.

00:06:56.442 --> 00:06:58.730 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about this again
if we have time today.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.780 align:middle line:84%
They have very definite
growth patterns.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:05.190 align:middle line:84%
They move through very definite
levels of awareness and changes

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.030 align:middle line:90%
that are very specific.

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.160 align:middle line:90%
And our star is a baby star.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.970 align:middle line:84%
It starts out at
hydrogen. And then

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:14.940 align:middle line:84%
all the light and life
that's on this planet

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.230 align:middle line:84%
comes from a fusion
reaction of two hydrogen

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.596 align:middle line:90%
atoms that form helium.

00:07:19.596 --> 00:07:21.880 align:middle line:84%
But then eventually
when the helium process

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.040 align:middle line:84%
builds up great enough
inside there, when

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.300 align:middle line:84%
the concentration
of helium builds up

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.700 align:middle line:84%
and another fusion
reaction begins,

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.450 align:middle line:84%
which is three helium atoms
coming together forming carbon.

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:36.010 align:middle line:84%
Which just took place
on our Sun in 1972,

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:40.055 align:middle line:84%
which is the beginning
of a similar situation

00:07:40.055 --> 00:07:42.134 align:middle line:90%
here on Earth.

00:07:42.134 --> 00:07:44.770 align:middle line:90%
And that process keeps going on.

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And when a star
gets old and gets

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:48.766 align:middle line:84%
toward the end of
this fusion process

00:07:48.766 --> 00:07:53.620 align:middle line:84%
and it moves into a certain
area of space, it has a choice.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.970 align:middle line:84%
It can either blow up
and become a supernova,

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:01.190 align:middle line:84%
or it can expand out and become
a red giant, at which point

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:04.220 align:middle line:84%
it will contract back in
and become a white dwarf.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.990 align:middle line:90%


00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:11.910 align:middle line:90%
And so the first thing they did.

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:14.009 align:middle line:84%
This happened to be
a white dwarf, which

00:08:14.009 --> 00:08:15.050 align:middle line:90%
is what they said it was.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.195 align:middle line:90%
A little, ancient, small star.

00:08:17.195 --> 00:08:20.320 align:middle line:84%
It's a very
compressed, tiny star.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.244 align:middle line:84%
And when they
calculated its orbit,

00:08:23.244 --> 00:08:24.660 align:middle line:84%
it was exactly
whatever they said.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.350 align:middle line:90%
It was either 50 or 60 years.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:28.280 align:middle line:84%
Instead of 50
years, it was 50.1.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:32.445 align:middle line:84%
It was so close, it was
almost exactly the same.

00:08:32.445 --> 00:08:34.319 align:middle line:84%
And that just couldn't
be a coincidence.

00:08:34.319 --> 00:08:36.470 align:middle line:90%
It's just too much.

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:39.939 align:middle line:84%
And they described in great
detail how heavy this was.

00:08:39.939 --> 00:08:45.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, I remember the first day
that I got-- 20 years ago or so

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.410 align:middle line:84%
when I was studying
this-- was that 1

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:50.810 align:middle line:84%
cubic inch of a white dwarf,
if it was brought on Earth,

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:54.164 align:middle line:90%
would be 2,000 pounds.

00:08:54.164 --> 00:08:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And I remember saying
that at one point.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.774 align:middle line:84%
And people would go,
wow, 2,000 pounds.

00:08:57.774 --> 00:09:01.765 align:middle line:84%
Well, the new data that comes
up now, it's 1 cubic inch

00:09:01.765 --> 00:09:06.722 align:middle line:90%
is 1.6 million tons.

00:09:06.722 --> 00:09:09.626 align:middle line:84%
If you can imagine 1.6
million tons in 1 inch.

00:09:09.626 --> 00:09:11.000 align:middle line:84%
If you put it down
on the ground,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.200 align:middle line:84%
it would just keep going
to the center of the Earth.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.270 align:middle line:84%
There wouldn't be
much to stop it.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:19.810 align:middle line:84%
So when they said it was
heavy, they weren't kidding.

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.510 align:middle line:90%
It was really a heavy star.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:26.242 align:middle line:90%


00:09:26.242 --> 00:09:30.705 align:middle line:84%
And so the fact that they were
able to do this was amazing.

00:09:30.705 --> 00:09:34.270 align:middle line:90%


00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:39.330 align:middle line:84%
They held other data
that is also impossible.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:43.260 align:middle line:84%
They had great detail of the
planets, what they looked like,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.090 align:middle line:84%
what was on them,
what the colors were

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:46.650 align:middle line:90%
as they approached them.

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:50.266 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of data that
is all written down

00:09:50.266 --> 00:09:52.983 align:middle line:84%
in the caves which
we didn't even know

00:09:52.983 --> 00:09:56.057 align:middle line:90%
until just the last few years.

00:09:56.057 --> 00:09:58.015 align:middle line:84%
Similar-- I can't remember,
Voyager or whatever

00:09:58.015 --> 00:09:59.758 align:middle line:84%
it was that was going
out there, as it went

00:09:59.758 --> 00:10:01.133 align:middle line:84%
past some of those
planets, began

00:10:01.133 --> 00:10:04.960 align:middle line:84%
to realize that
this data was true.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.182 align:middle line:84%
So at one point
not too long ago,

00:10:07.182 --> 00:10:11.090 align:middle line:84%
we sent a scientific team
to these guys to ask them,

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:13.090 align:middle line:90%
how do you know this?

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:14.895 align:middle line:84%
How do you know
this information?

00:10:14.895 --> 00:10:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Which in a way was
kind of a big mistake

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:23.900 align:middle line:84%
because, if you realize that
their information is correct,

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.812 align:middle line:84%
then you've got
to accept how they

00:10:25.812 --> 00:10:28.730 align:middle line:90%
got the information, right?

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:32.875 align:middle line:84%
But since they found that
piece of information out,

00:10:32.875 --> 00:10:34.750 align:middle line:84%
that's where they would
show they were right.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:39.471 align:middle line:84%
Because what the Dogon said
was, well, this flying saucer

00:10:39.471 --> 00:10:44.446 align:middle line:84%
came out of the sky, came
down and landed on three legs.

00:10:44.446 --> 00:10:46.800 align:middle line:84%
And they've got a picture
of this in the cave also.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And that the beams in the ship
made a big hole in the ground.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.550 align:middle line:84%
They filled it with
water and they jumped out

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.326 align:middle line:90%
and they looked like dolphins.

00:10:55.326 --> 00:10:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And they came up to the edge
of the water and talked to them

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:01.000 align:middle line:84%
and told them about
the planet, that this

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.530 align:middle line:90%
is where they came from.

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:04.530 align:middle line:90%
This is what they said.

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:07.886 align:middle line:84%
And the scientists
just said, nah.

00:11:07.886 --> 00:11:10.170 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:10.970 align:middle line:90%


00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And just shoved
it under the rug.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:17.460 align:middle line:84%
But this was the picture
that they gave to them.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:22.570 align:middle line:10%
They called them
the Nommo, N-O-M-O.

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:25.422 align:middle line:10%
And that they were half in and
out of water and they breathed

00:11:25.422 --> 00:11:26.222 align:middle line:10%
air.

00:11:26.222 --> 00:11:29.090 align:middle line:10%
And they had the
fin facing this way,

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:34.722 align:middle line:10%
which is the only-- there's
no fish that have this.

00:11:34.722 --> 00:11:39.527 align:middle line:84%
Only the animals, the
cetacean nation, has fins.

00:11:39.527 --> 00:11:40.902 align:middle line:84%
I forget, what's
that called when

00:11:40.902 --> 00:11:45.230 align:middle line:84%
it's f-- it's got a name
when it's facing this way.

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:46.620 align:middle line:90%
So these were cetaceans.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:50.910 align:middle line:84%
These were air-breathing animals
that came out and lived here.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And they were dolphin-like,
anyway, put it that way.

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:59.340 align:middle line:10%
Cannot say for certain
that they were dolphins.

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And they said that when
the Nommo came here,

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.450 align:middle line:84%
that a new star
appeared in the heavens

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:12.150 align:middle line:84%
and that it hung in
the sky over them.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:14.660 align:middle line:10%
And that the Nommo
said that they

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:18.076 align:middle line:10%
came from the star, which
was really the mother ship

00:12:18.076 --> 00:12:20.360 align:middle line:10%
they came down from.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And that as soon
as the Nommo left,

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.690 align:middle line:84%
when they left and did this,
it started disappearing.

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:27.690 align:middle line:90%


00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:33.070 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very interesting
little bit of information.

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:34.620 align:middle line:84%
There was another
bit of information

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:40.325 align:middle line:84%
that was extraordinary that
was given to the scientists

00:12:40.325 --> 00:12:45.970 align:middle line:84%
and was studied by a group
of Australian astronomers.

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:49.570 align:middle line:84%
They said that this was the
image, that this image was

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:52.250 align:middle line:90%
given to them a long time ago.

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:56.530 align:middle line:84%
Now realize, the Dogons
lived near Timbuktu

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:59.230 align:middle line:84%
in northern Africa in
the desert and they're

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:02.670 align:middle line:90%
talking about dolphins, right?

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And this information
has now been

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:11.250 align:middle line:84%
traced way back into ancient
Egypt and further back

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:14.608 align:middle line:84%
into Sumeria, which
we'll talk about later.

00:13:14.608 --> 00:13:18.944 align:middle line:84%
This may be more
ancient than what

00:13:18.944 --> 00:13:21.614 align:middle line:90%
Robert Temple has [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:21.614 --> 00:13:25.550 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, this
particular pattern

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:29.340 align:middle line:84%
was given to them, which they
said was the view of A and B

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:30.490 align:middle line:90%
from Earth.

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:35.520 align:middle line:84%
It's now called Sirius A
and Sirius B. And Sirius A,

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.360 align:middle line:84%
it isn't A or B, which
is the little dark star.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.010 align:middle line:84%
It moves around
Sirius A like this.

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:44.080 align:middle line:90%
It's a more complex pattern.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:48.290 align:middle line:84%
There's a third place in space,
and Sirius B moves like this

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:51.440 align:middle line:84%
and Sirius A moves
like this around it.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And the two make a
double helical pattern

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.820 align:middle line:84%
as they move through space in
this complex pattern, which,

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.090 align:middle line:84%
according to computers
in Australia,

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:02.470 align:middle line:84%
is identical to
the DNA molecule.

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And they found that, again,
an amazing little thing.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.070 align:middle line:84%
But what was real interesting
is that this pattern, which

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:14.330 align:middle line:84%
is at least 700
years old, happened

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.360 align:middle line:90%
to be a specific time thing.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.780 align:middle line:84%
In other words, when
it's put into computers,

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:23.440 align:middle line:84%
that ever-changing
pattern from Earth,

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:29.130 align:middle line:84%
that this specific pattern
was exactly from the year 1912

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:31.660 align:middle line:90%
to 1990.

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And those are real important
dates, those particular dates,

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:38.710 align:middle line:90%
especially 1912.

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:40.752 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about the
Philadelphia experiment

00:14:40.752 --> 00:14:44.060 align:middle line:84%
and stuff later on, that
was a very important moment

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:49.320 align:middle line:90%
in our history in 1912.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And so why the dolphins
wanted us to know exactly

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:57.610 align:middle line:84%
about this particular
time, I don't know for sure

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:00.640 align:middle line:84%
except that it is
very pertinent to us,

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.469 align:middle line:84%
and this happened to
be the time when we

00:15:03.469 --> 00:15:04.760 align:middle line:90%
were even aware of the pattern.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.180 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't even have known
what the pattern was before,

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:09.680 align:middle line:84%
but they were giving us
one earlier than that.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.452 align:middle line:90%


00:15:12.452 --> 00:15:15.920 align:middle line:84%
So just realizing
this is one little bit

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:19.940 align:middle line:84%
of information showing
that maybe there's

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.830 align:middle line:84%
something else going
on in our history

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:26.420 align:middle line:84%
other than what the history
books are telling us.

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:32.400 align:middle line:84%
In 1985, I was
giving a-- I gave a--

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:38.752 align:middle line:84%
took a tour of people, small
group of people, through Peru.

00:15:38.752 --> 00:15:42.838 align:middle line:84%
And we went along-- one of the
things we were going to do is

00:15:42.838 --> 00:15:45.570 align:middle line:84%
to go along the Inca Trail,
the original Inca Trail,

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:49.482 align:middle line:84%
which is about 40 miles
through the jungle,

00:15:49.482 --> 00:15:51.450 align:middle line:90%
14,000-foot peaks and stuff.

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:53.914 align:middle line:90%
Drops down into Machu Picchu.

00:15:53.914 --> 00:15:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And the night before we
were going to take-- you

00:15:56.410 --> 00:16:00.028 align:middle line:84%
have to take this little train
out in the middle of nowhere

00:16:00.028 --> 00:16:03.680 align:middle line:84%
and then leap out the
windows of this train.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:07.335 align:middle line:84%
And it'll stop for 30
seconds and take off again.

00:16:07.335 --> 00:16:12.595 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I was saying,
where you begin the trip.

00:16:12.595 --> 00:16:13.970 align:middle line:84%
The night before
this took place,

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:16.440 align:middle line:84%
we were in a place
called Cusco, which

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:23.358 align:middle line:84%
is a city in the shape
of a puma, a cat.

00:16:23.358 --> 00:16:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And we were in this very fancy
hotel, four-star hotel there.

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.700 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember the name of it.

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.440 align:middle line:90%
It'll come up here in a minute.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:38.385 align:middle line:84%
And one of the people
I was traveling with

00:16:38.385 --> 00:16:41.700 align:middle line:84%
was one of these people that had
been on one of the expositions

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.740 align:middle line:90%
over to Dogon tribe.

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And he was telling me a lot
of the stuff about this.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And he was telling me
how the number 23 was

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:56.204 align:middle line:84%
so important to the Dogons
because the star Sirius dips

00:16:56.204 --> 00:16:58.200 align:middle line:84%
below-- from the
Northern Hemisphere it

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:01.320 align:middle line:84%
dips below the Southern
Hemisphere, at least

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:06.766 align:middle line:84%
from Egypt, put it that
place-- on the 23rd of July

00:17:06.766 --> 00:17:10.410 align:middle line:84%
and stays down-- or excuse
me, dips below a couple months

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:11.329 align:middle line:90%
earlier than that.

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:16.481 align:middle line:84%
But it rises up above the
horizon on the 23rd of July.

00:17:16.481 --> 00:17:21.119 align:middle line:84%
And it's called the
helical rising of Sirius.

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:23.700 align:middle line:84%
At that particular moment,
early in the moment,

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:25.810 align:middle line:84%
right before the sun
comes up, in fact,

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:31.750 align:middle line:84%
60 seconds before the sun comes
up, approximately, the star

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:33.590 align:middle line:90%
Sirius rises above the horizon.

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:36.560 align:middle line:90%
And it comes up a ruby red star.

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And then 60 seconds
later, the sun

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:42.760 align:middle line:84%
comes up directly behind
that, which blocks it out.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And so at that moment that
the sun rises, in deep space,

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:52.340 align:middle line:84%
you have the star Sirius,
our Sun, and the Earth

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:55.190 align:middle line:90%
in a straight line.

00:17:55.190 --> 00:18:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And that was the first day
of the [INAUDIBLE] calendar,

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:01.680 align:middle line:90%
which is the Egyptian calendar.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And many other of
the ancient calendars

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:08.910 align:middle line:84%
were based on the
helical rising of Sirius.

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:11.170 align:middle line:84%
Why they chose
that we don't know.

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:16.650 align:middle line:84%
But as this unfolds about
Sirius here in a few minutes,

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:19.670 align:middle line:84%
you'll become a pretty
good idea why they

00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:22.840 align:middle line:90%
chose that particular moment.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:25.661 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, I'm sitting in Peru.

00:18:25.661 --> 00:18:27.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling like I'm
in Peru right now.

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:29.210 align:middle line:84%
It's getting colder
in this room.

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:30.210 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, it is.

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, yeah.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible to come up at
least a couple degrees or so?

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:40.110 align:middle line:90%


00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:43.110 align:middle line:90%
And we get Room 23, of course.

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:44.480 align:middle line:90%
And we go in Room 23.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.255 align:middle line:84%
He's telling us, hey,
we've got Room 23.

00:18:46.255 --> 00:18:47.420 align:middle line:90%
A good sign also, I think.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:54.260 align:middle line:84%
We go in Room 23, and on the
bed was this symbol in Peru.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And I remember standing there
for about five minutes looking

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.780 align:middle line:84%
at this, and we
were going, trying

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:01.590 align:middle line:84%
to figure out the link in our--
we didn't even say anything.

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:03.710 align:middle line:84%
We just looked at this bed
for about five minutes,

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:08.232 align:middle line:84%
trying to figure out how that
symbol had got from the Dogons

00:19:08.232 --> 00:19:10.934 align:middle line:90%
in Africa over to Peru.

00:19:10.934 --> 00:19:13.870 align:middle line:90%
Because it was the same one.

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:16.712 align:middle line:90%
Or very, very, very close to it.

00:19:16.712 --> 00:19:21.940 align:middle line:10%
In fact, it was the Hotel
San Agustin International

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:24.060 align:middle line:10%
in Cusco, Peru.

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:26.018 align:middle line:10%
And I went around
to all the people

00:19:26.018 --> 00:19:28.393 align:middle line:10%
and said-- you know, people
that worked there-- you know,

00:19:28.393 --> 00:19:29.380 align:middle line:10%
what does this mean to you?

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.170 align:middle line:10%
Well, it has something
to do with our creation.

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:31.970 align:middle line:10%
They didn't know.

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:34.100 align:middle line:10%
They were almost all
Spanish that ran this thing.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:38.664 align:middle line:84%
They didn't really know the
creation stories of the Indians

00:19:38.664 --> 00:19:40.620 align:middle line:90%
that were hunting this.

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:44.200 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't until I
got to Lake Titicaca,

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:49.758 align:middle line:84%
and it was the-- it
wasn't a catchy one.

00:19:49.758 --> 00:19:54.240 align:middle line:84%
It was the ones that float
out on the islands out there.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.041 align:middle line:90%
Uros?

00:19:55.041 --> 00:19:55.956 align:middle line:90%
Is that what they are?

00:19:55.956 --> 00:19:56.830 align:middle line:90%
Can't remember.

00:19:56.830 --> 00:20:00.030 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, it was an island
tribe that they live on reeds.

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:03.112 align:middle line:84%
They build their islands
daily by putting reeds.

00:20:03.112 --> 00:20:05.104 align:middle line:90%
And they float on these islands.

00:20:05.104 --> 00:20:06.770 align:middle line:84%
They've got these
whole cities out there

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:08.802 align:middle line:84%
with buildings and cars
and everything else.

00:20:08.802 --> 00:20:10.155 align:middle line:90%
No cars, but buildings.

00:20:10.155 --> 00:20:12.570 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:13.460 align:middle line:90%


00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:15.578 align:middle line:84%
But there's buildings,
metal buildings

00:20:15.578 --> 00:20:17.994 align:middle line:84%
and everything else floating
out on these reeds out there.

00:20:17.994 --> 00:20:21.646 align:middle line:84%
Houses and homes and chickens
and goats and everything else

00:20:21.646 --> 00:20:23.095 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:20:23.095 --> 00:20:28.136 align:middle line:84%
And they did it a long time
ago to escape being killed.

00:20:28.136 --> 00:20:30.279 align:middle line:90%
And they just stayed there.

00:20:30.279 --> 00:20:32.404 align:middle line:84%
It's real weird when you're
walking on these things

00:20:32.404 --> 00:20:35.610 align:middle line:84%
because you look off and
there's water right there.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying,
now walk where we walk.

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:39.219 align:middle line:84%
And we're walking
exactly where they walk.

00:20:39.219 --> 00:20:42.026 align:middle line:84%
And if you walk in the wrong
place, you just floomp.

00:20:42.026 --> 00:20:43.918 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:43.918 --> 00:20:45.400 align:middle line:84%
They lost somebody
a week before.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.275 align:middle line:84%
They kept saying, now
we lost somebody a week

00:20:47.275 --> 00:20:49.680 align:middle line:90%
before so stay real close.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.680 align:middle line:84%
I was walking exactly
where they walked.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:55.050 align:middle line:90%


00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:58.950 align:middle line:10%
Anyway, they told us, oh,
yeah, they knew what this was.

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:01.794 align:middle line:10%
And they said that was
the creation symbol.

00:21:01.794 --> 00:21:03.460 align:middle line:10%
And pretty soon after
a while we started

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.970 align:middle line:10%
talking to other Indians, and
they all had the same story,

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:07.690 align:middle line:10%
pretty close.

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:08.490 align:middle line:10%
Same thing.

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:11.160 align:middle line:10%
This flying saucer came
out of the sky, landed

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.610 align:middle line:10%
in Lake Titicaca, and these
dolphin-like creatures

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:16.300 align:middle line:10%
came out, jumped
up into the water,

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:19.540 align:middle line:10%
came up to the shoreline,
and talked to them,

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:21.590 align:middle line:10%
and began their culture.

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:24.470 align:middle line:84%
Now when you read
Zecharia Sitchin,

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:27.060 align:middle line:84%
which I'm going to talk about
his work a little later.

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:30.730 align:middle line:84%
He talks about how the
first piece of land

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:32.627 align:middle line:84%
that broke the
surface of the water

00:21:32.627 --> 00:21:34.960 align:middle line:84%
was the Island of the Sun,
which is in Bolivia, which is

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.670 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of Lake Titicaca.

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And there's a rock there, which
is supposedly the point that

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:40.970 align:middle line:90%
broke the surface.

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And that that was
where Thoth came to

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:48.720 align:middle line:84%
and landed there and began
the Incan culture, anyway.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.532 align:middle line:84%
Which is exactly what
Thoth told me, exactly.

00:21:51.532 --> 00:21:53.490 align:middle line:84%
Before I'd ever even
heard of Zecharia Sitchin.

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:55.260 align:middle line:84%
He said he went to
the Island of the Sun

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:58.940 align:middle line:84%
and that's where he stepped
out and began the whole thing.

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.170 align:middle line:90%
He was summoned.

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:02.090 align:middle line:90%
It's really amazing.

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:04.850 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know about Zecharia
until about the last two years

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:05.650 align:middle line:90%
or so.

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:07.634 align:middle line:90%


00:22:07.634 --> 00:22:10.050 align:middle line:84%
Because most of the history
that I got I got from this man

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:12.350 align:middle line:84%
named Thoth, who I'll talk
about it in a little bit.

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't-- it was just
absolutely amazing to me as I

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:19.300 align:middle line:84%
was reading this that
how the Sumerian records,

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.350 align:middle line:84%
which we're going to talk
about in just a moment,

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:26.010 align:middle line:84%
and what Thoth had told me from
another dimensional level just

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:30.330 align:middle line:84%
fit together like, just
like two perfect keys.

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:32.520 align:middle line:84%
I can't find any
mistakes at all.

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.170 align:middle line:90%
Can't find even anything.

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:37.310 align:middle line:90%
It seems perfect.

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:39.550 align:middle line:84%
Which are the actual
written records

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:44.000 align:middle line:84%
of our history, which we're just
becoming aware of right now.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.430 align:middle line:84%
We're just now
becoming aware of what

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:49.055 align:middle line:90%
was written down in Sumeria.

00:22:49.055 --> 00:22:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Give me just a few more
minutes and I'll get to that.

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:57.730 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, here is
a very similar story

00:22:57.730 --> 00:22:59.830 align:middle line:84%
about dolphins
somehow having to do

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:02.280 align:middle line:90%
with the creation of this area.

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:05.172 align:middle line:84%
If you want to read an
article, which I have here.

00:23:05.172 --> 00:23:08.790 align:middle line:90%


00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:10.470 align:middle line:90%
This also came out of Australia.

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:15.260 align:middle line:84%
It's called "Our Father,
Who Art In Water. "

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:19.270 align:middle line:84%
Which is a lot of the dolphin
data that has been gathered

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:21.734 align:middle line:90%
from around the world.

00:23:21.734 --> 00:23:25.025 align:middle line:84%
If you read this
article, which I guess

00:23:25.025 --> 00:23:26.066 align:middle line:90%
we can copy or something.

00:23:26.066 --> 00:23:27.000 align:middle line:90%
I don't have.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.664 align:middle line:90%
It's a pretty thick one here.

00:23:28.664 --> 00:23:30.331 align:middle line:90%
And really amazing here.

00:23:30.331 --> 00:23:33.460 align:middle line:84%
Because all over the
world a similar story

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:38.775 align:middle line:84%
is told, how dolphins have
had an amazing influence

00:23:38.775 --> 00:23:43.280 align:middle line:84%
in the creation of a lot
of the ancient cultures,

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:46.352 align:middle line:84%
especially around
the Mediterranean,

00:23:46.352 --> 00:23:49.590 align:middle line:84%
from Greece to lots and lots
and lots of places there,

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:50.720 align:middle line:90%
not just Greece.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.740 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of other
places that they've

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:56.090 align:middle line:90%
had a deep influence.

00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:59.936 align:middle line:84%
And their influence on Australia
has been very, very powerful.

00:23:59.936 --> 00:24:03.520 align:middle line:84%
The original ships that landed
in Australia, the lead ship

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.290 align:middle line:90%
was called the "Sirius."

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's now called Sirius
Bay where they landed.

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And the star, Sirius star,
is on the Australian flag.

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And there's more dolphins around
the continent of Atlantis--

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:18.960 align:middle line:90%
I mean, Atlantis.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:23.710 align:middle line:84%
Of Australia than anywhere
else in the world.

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:27.115 align:middle line:84%
No one knows how
many, of course.

00:24:27.115 --> 00:24:28.740 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
dolphins in the world.

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:30.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
know how many dolphins.

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:31.760 align:middle line:84%
Most people think there are
a few dolphins out there

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.620 align:middle line:84%
in the ocean and
they're endangered

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:36.330 align:middle line:90%
and we've got to be careful.

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:39.810 align:middle line:90%
That's far from the truth.

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:44.140 align:middle line:84%
There are certain species of
dolphins that are endangered,

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:48.100 align:middle line:84%
like the pink dolphins
of the Amazon River,

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:51.400 align:middle line:84%
and there are a few other ones
that are really endangered.

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:56.880 align:middle line:84%
But by and large, we've got,
what, 5 and 1/2 billion people

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.460 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:00.600 align:middle line:84%
That's nothing compared
to the dolphins.

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:03.760 align:middle line:84%
There are seven dolphins
minimum per every person.

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:07.700 align:middle line:84%
There's at least 35 billion
dolphins in the waters.

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:09.960 align:middle line:90%
That's a conservative estimate.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:13.508 align:middle line:84%
And there may be as many as 50
billion dolphins in the waters.

00:25:13.508 --> 00:25:16.510 align:middle line:90%


00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:18.850 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And they're a race of
beings from another place,

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:23.680 align:middle line:90%
as we unfold here.

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And they're on a
level of consciousness

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.120 align:middle line:84%
so far beyond where we're
at now that we can't hardly

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:31.690 align:middle line:90%
talk about it.

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:35.270 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, I will talk about it.

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:37.770 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:40.000 align:middle line:90%


00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.457 align:middle line:84%
But they probably had a big
influence on us at one point.

00:25:43.457 --> 00:25:45.290 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to change the
subject a little bit

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:50.930 align:middle line:10%
here and go to-- this is out
of the "Clarion Call" magazine,

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:56.165 align:middle line:10%
"Mathematics and the Spiritual
Dimensions," by David Osborn.

00:25:56.165 --> 00:25:59.130 align:middle line:10%
And I don't know if David
was the one who first came up

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:02.630 align:middle line:10%
with this or not, but he was
the one that reported it.

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:08.290 align:middle line:10%
The Sanskrit language has
been around a long time.

00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:10.260 align:middle line:10%
It's one of the oldest
languages in the world,

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:12.590 align:middle line:10%
so we're talking
about going back maybe

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:14.820 align:middle line:10%
close to 6,000 years old.

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:19.520 align:middle line:10%
And for a long time,
well, there were

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:23.488 align:middle line:10%
a lot of these little poems that
were in the Sanskrit language.

00:26:23.488 --> 00:26:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And eventually at one point
they translated the language.

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:30.116 align:middle line:84%
And when they
interpreted the poems,

00:26:30.116 --> 00:26:32.970 align:middle line:84%
they believed that that was
it, that they had finished

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:35.237 align:middle line:84%
their job, that once
they interpreted

00:26:35.237 --> 00:26:38.380 align:middle line:84%
the poems that was about
all there was to the poems.

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:40.149 align:middle line:90%
Until recently.

00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:42.867 align:middle line:84%
And I guess this has been,
maybe-- I don't know,

00:26:42.867 --> 00:26:44.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm guessing-- four
or five years ago.

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:51.440 align:middle line:10%
And they discovered that the
Sanskrit had numerical value

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:54.770 align:middle line:10%
to the various sounds.

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:56.646 align:middle line:10%
Again, remember ka the spirit?

00:26:56.646 --> 00:27:00.996 align:middle line:10%
And ka happens to
be either 0 or 1.

00:27:00.996 --> 00:27:02.980 align:middle line:10%
But you have all
these different sounds

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:05.010 align:middle line:10%
that are possible in there.

00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:08.100 align:middle line:10%
And there is a numerical
value associated

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:10.300 align:middle line:10%
with each one of these sounds.

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:13.780 align:middle line:10%
And in this particular poem,
and they're unfolding this now

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:15.442 align:middle line:10%
on all of them, I guess.

00:27:15.442 --> 00:27:21.650 align:middle line:10%
They took the various sounds
and put the numerical value

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:22.450 align:middle line:10%
to them.

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:24.189 align:middle line:10%
Now I don't know
how they figured out

00:27:24.189 --> 00:27:25.022 align:middle line:10%
the numerical value.

00:27:25.022 --> 00:27:25.935 align:middle line:10%
Don't ask me that.

00:27:25.935 --> 00:27:28.511 align:middle line:84%
You'll have to go back
and research their things.

00:27:28.511 --> 00:27:30.516 align:middle line:84%
But when they did
that on here, they

00:27:30.516 --> 00:27:33.890 align:middle line:84%
found something that
was rather amazing.

00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:40.870 align:middle line:10%
They found pi to 32
digits of accuracy.

00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:45.230 align:middle line:10%
Now these are supposedly
hairy barbarians back there

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:51.660 align:middle line:10%
who are just emerging
out of nothingness,

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:54.030 align:middle line:10%
from our present-day thinking.

00:27:54.030 --> 00:28:00.690 align:middle line:10%
How could they possibly
create accuracy to 32 digits?

00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:01.840 align:middle line:10%
This is it right here.

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:03.110 align:middle line:10%
Only there's no decimal point.

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:04.490 align:middle line:10%
So it's really pi/10.

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:07.830 align:middle line:10%
So they don't know where
the decimal point is.

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:12.480 align:middle line:10%
So that kind of perfection
could not be a coincidence.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.280 align:middle line:90%
Impossible.

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:16.284 align:middle line:84%
If that was a coincidence, that
would even be more ridiculous.

00:28:16.284 --> 00:28:19.260 align:middle line:90%


00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:23.130 align:middle line:84%
And yet there is proof that
they had the ability to do that,

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:26.460 align:middle line:84%
right back from the
very, very beginning.

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:30.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, way back there
in the beginning,

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:33.950 align:middle line:84%
there are all kinds of things
that archaeologists and people

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:37.310 align:middle line:84%
who study these things
really don't understand--

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:38.810 align:middle line:84%
at least most of
them-- don't really

00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:42.210 align:middle line:90%
know how it was even possible.

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:47.340 align:middle line:10%
The Sumerian culture just-- in
approximately 3800 BC-- just

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:52.970 align:middle line:10%
appeared out of nowhere
with a full language

00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:56.300 align:middle line:10%
and a full spectrum of
knowledge, some of which

00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:00.260 align:middle line:10%
we're just regaining right now.

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:06.700 align:middle line:84%
For one thing, they knew the
precession of the equinoxes.

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:10.580 align:middle line:84%
They knew that-- which is--
precession of the equinoxes

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:15.300 align:middle line:84%
is that there's a-- if this
was the axis of the Earth,

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:18.160 align:middle line:90%
there's a wobble in that axis.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.745 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to
look at that tip,

00:29:19.745 --> 00:29:22.060 align:middle line:90%
it forms an elliptical pattern.

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And it takes a little less
than 26,000 years for that pin

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:26.250 align:middle line:90%
to go around.

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:29.730 align:middle line:84%
It's about 20-- depends on
who you talk to-- 25,900,

00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:31.500 align:middle line:90%
roughly, years.

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:34.236 align:middle line:90%
950, some people say.

00:29:34.236 --> 00:29:36.060 align:middle line:90%
Some people say 850.

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:40.080 align:middle line:84%
But a little less than 26,000
years to go around one time.

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:43.350 align:middle line:90%
They knew it exactly.

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:46.250 align:middle line:84%
It's been calculated
by astronomers

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:51.853 align:middle line:84%
that it would take 2,160
years minimum to even know

00:29:51.853 --> 00:29:52.936 align:middle line:90%
that you were in a wobble.

00:29:52.936 --> 00:29:57.070 align:middle line:90%


00:29:57.070 --> 00:30:01.450 align:middle line:84%
So if the culture
started in 3800 BC

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:04.670 align:middle line:84%
and they knew that in 3800
BC and there was nothing

00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:08.610 align:middle line:84%
before that, no
writing, no nothing,

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:10.650 align:middle line:84%
then how did they
know that we were

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:12.215 align:middle line:84%
in a precession of
the equinoxes when

00:30:12.215 --> 00:30:17.680 align:middle line:84%
it takes 2,160 years of
continual, constant every day

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:20.317 align:middle line:84%
and night observation to be
able to come up with that?

00:30:20.317 --> 00:30:24.310 align:middle line:90%


00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:26.450 align:middle line:84%
They had written--
Sumerians had written

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:32.700 align:middle line:84%
on their walls the
entire solar system,

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:37.013 align:middle line:84%
the whole solar system, all
the way up to Neptune, Pluto,

00:30:37.013 --> 00:30:41.600 align:middle line:84%
all of them, all the way out
there in their very exact sizes

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:45.640 align:middle line:84%
and everything and
shapes on the wall.

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:48.850 align:middle line:84%
They had written in
cuneiform on these clay,

00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:51.830 align:middle line:84%
round clay tablets,
which they now

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:55.000 align:middle line:84%
have over 100,000 of
these clay tablets out,

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.110 align:middle line:84%
and they're madly
trying to get them out,

00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:01.470 align:middle line:84%
interpreted and written
out and what they mean.

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And what's unfolding is a
whole new history beyond our--

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.930 align:middle line:84%
it's almost "Star Trek,"
what's coming out of that.

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:13.000 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing what's
coming out of this.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.240 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to accept, but I'm
going to go into it anyway.

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:19.960 align:middle line:90%
Because it is history.

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:20.820 align:middle line:90%
It's archeology.

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:23.000 align:middle line:84%
This is what our ancient
people are telling us.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.010 align:middle line:84%
The oldest people that we know,
this is what they are saying

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:31.274 align:middle line:84%
is happening, which is
totally different than what

00:31:31.274 --> 00:31:33.694 align:middle line:90%
we've been told.

00:31:33.694 --> 00:31:39.460 align:middle line:84%
They had the planets
described in detail,

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:43.110 align:middle line:84%
in absolute detail of what it
looks like to approach them

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:46.026 align:middle line:90%
from space.

00:31:46.026 --> 00:31:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, so much
so that when we

00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:52.720 align:middle line:84%
were passing past the further
one, Neptune, et cetera,

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.520 align:middle line:84%
and went past those,
Zecharia Sitchin,

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:58.120 align:middle line:84%
from reading the
records, was able to tell

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:01.350 align:middle line:84%
NASA what they were going to
find before they got there.

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:03.800 align:middle line:90%
And he was 100% accurate.

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:06.480 align:middle line:84%
Telling them the exact colors
and nature of the planets

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.340 align:middle line:84%
before they ever
even arrived there.

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And he purposely
publicly did it because--

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:14.880 align:middle line:84%
and he was just
reading the records.

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And he did it beforehand so
that they couldn't say, well,

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:18.170 align:middle line:90%
you knew.

00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Because he did it before we
knew, before we got there.

00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:24.532 align:middle line:84%
And he was absolutely
accurate in that.

00:32:24.532 --> 00:32:28.018 align:middle line:84%
And all he did was just
read out of the records.

00:32:28.018 --> 00:32:29.934 align:middle line:84%
So how could they have
known all these things?

00:32:29.934 --> 00:32:32.620 align:middle line:90%


00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:34.520 align:middle line:84%
Somebody is not telling
us the truth here.

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:36.475 align:middle line:84%
Somebody's going
to say, you know,

00:32:36.475 --> 00:32:37.600 align:middle line:90%
something just isn't right.

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:38.900 align:middle line:90%
And there's a lot more.

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:41.960 align:middle line:84%
There's a really big
one going on right now.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:46.280 align:middle line:84%
This is a really, really big
thing happening right now.

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with
the Sphinx in Egypt.

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:52.180 align:middle line:84%
There's a man named
John Anthony West.

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:55.252 align:middle line:90%
And I really support his work.

00:32:55.252 --> 00:32:58.580 align:middle line:84%
I highly recommend
you listen carefully

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:00.800 align:middle line:84%
to everything he has to
say right now because he's

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:02.950 align:middle line:90%
changing the face of history.

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:05.010 align:middle line:90%
And he's already done it.

00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:07.010 align:middle line:84%
It's just now a matter
of throwing out the books

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:08.460 align:middle line:90%
and starting over again.

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:12.110 align:middle line:84%
We don't have any
choice anymore.

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:15.940 align:middle line:90%
He happened to notice.

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:18.210 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't the first person
to notice this, by the way.

00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:21.445 align:middle line:84%
The first person was Schwaller
de Lubicz a long time ago.

00:33:21.445 --> 00:33:26.860 align:middle line:84%
He noticed that the Sphinx had
incredible wear patterns on it.

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:31.110 align:middle line:84%
These wear patterns were
as much as 12 feet deep.

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And it was Schwaller
de Lubicz who

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:38.210 align:middle line:84%
noticed by looking at them that
this sits in the desert here.

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:42.962 align:middle line:84%
And was it the Gobi
Desert, is that what it is?

00:33:42.962 --> 00:33:43.880 align:middle line:90%
>>Sahara.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:44.998 align:middle line:90%
>>Sahara Desert.

00:33:44.998 --> 00:33:48.750 align:middle line:90%


00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:53.158 align:middle line:84%
And the Sahara Desert is
at least 7,000 years old.

00:33:53.158 --> 00:33:56.030 align:middle line:84%
That's been determined
through geology.

00:33:56.030 --> 00:34:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And the wear patterns,
however, that are on there

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:05.400 align:middle line:84%
appear to be made by water,
not by sand and wind, which

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:09.460 align:middle line:84%
is the only erosion factors
that are in a desert.

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:10.984 align:middle line:84%
But they appear to
be made by water.

00:34:10.984 --> 00:34:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And it was Schwaller
de Lubicz who

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:17.060 align:middle line:84%
stated this a long time ago, 30,
40 years ago, whenever it was.

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:19.014 align:middle line:84%
And there have been
other archaeologists who

00:34:19.014 --> 00:34:21.190 align:middle line:84%
have come up, like John
Anthony West, who can also

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:24.800 align:middle line:90%
see this and say, you know.

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:29.800 align:middle line:84%
Because [INAUDIBLE] saying
it at-- what the date-- was

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:34.989 align:middle line:90%
that 20-- 2600 BC, I think?

00:34:34.989 --> 00:34:38.580 align:middle line:84%
They put it in the
Fourth Dynasty of Cheops,

00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:42.760 align:middle line:84%
roughly, somewhere
around back in there.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:45.889 align:middle line:84%
And there were many buildings
that were made at the same time

00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:48.764 align:middle line:90%
by Cheops.

00:34:48.764 --> 00:34:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And when you go to
those buildings, which

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:52.859 align:middle line:84%
were supposedly made at
the exact same moment

00:34:52.859 --> 00:34:54.400 align:middle line:84%
these were made,
and you look at them

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.345 align:middle line:84%
and they look like
they're brand new.

00:34:56.345 --> 00:34:57.970 align:middle line:84%
There's hardly any
wear on them at all.

00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:02.553 align:middle line:84%
You come to this and it's
like, wow, this is incredible.

00:35:02.553 --> 00:35:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And so nobody would
listen to this.

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:09.559 align:middle line:84%
Nobody would-- for many,
many, many, many years,

00:35:09.559 --> 00:35:11.350 align:middle line:84%
nobody would listen to
Schwaller de Lubicz,

00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:14.050 align:middle line:84%
no one would listen
to John Anthony West.

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And other people, I'm sure,
who have looked at this

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:17.610 align:middle line:90%
and thought the same thing.

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:19.370 align:middle line:90%
This is really very old.

00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And finally John got this
geologist, Robert Schoch,

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:27.600 align:middle line:84%
I think is his name,
of the United States,

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:30.910 align:middle line:84%
to take the time to go
over there and look at it.

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:32.830 align:middle line:90%
And he did.

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And then by many trips of
going over there and by doing

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:41.069 align:middle line:84%
that pure, straight, scientific
analysis of the wear patterns

00:35:41.069 --> 00:35:43.235 align:middle line:84%
and using computers and all
the other various things

00:35:43.235 --> 00:35:47.584 align:middle line:84%
that we have now, regardless of
what anybody else has to say.

00:35:47.584 --> 00:35:50.250 align:middle line:84%
Forget about the archaeologists,
what they have to say about it.

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:54.320 align:middle line:84%
From a pure geological
point of view,

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:58.390 align:middle line:84%
that thing has water
patterns on it,

00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:59.967 align:middle line:84%
wear patterns on
it from the water.

00:35:59.967 --> 00:36:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's been
calculated that it would

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:06.190 align:middle line:84%
take 1,000 years of
constant torrential rain

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:09.790 align:middle line:90%
to create that depth of wear.

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:13.351 align:middle line:84%
Which means that
this is a lot older.

00:36:13.351 --> 00:36:14.850 align:middle line:84%
It had to go back
before the desert.

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:17.290 align:middle line:84%
That put it back
7,000 years old.

00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And another thousand
years minimum, less

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:21.370 align:middle line:84%
if it rained constantly
day and night

00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:25.500 align:middle line:84%
and never stopped with
total buckets pouring on it.

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:27.430 align:middle line:90%
And put it back 8,000 years old.

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:29.430 align:middle line:84%
So they're saying, well,
it's probably somewhere

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:33.468 align:middle line:84%
between 10,000 and
15,000 years old.

00:36:33.468 --> 00:36:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's been
established over there.

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:43.034 align:middle line:84%
And by doing that pure, straight
scientific analysis of the wear

00:36:43.034 --> 00:36:45.575 align:middle line:84%
patterns and using computers
and all the other various things

00:36:45.575 --> 00:36:47.670 align:middle line:90%
that we have now.

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of what
anybody else has to say.

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.790 align:middle line:84%
Forget about the archaeologists,
what they have to say about it.

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:56.830 align:middle line:84%
From a pure geological
point of view,

00:36:56.830 --> 00:37:00.900 align:middle line:84%
that thing has water
patterns on it,

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:02.477 align:middle line:84%
wear patterns on
it from the water.

00:37:02.477 --> 00:37:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's been
calculated that it would

00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:08.410 align:middle line:84%
take 1,000 years of
constant torrential rain

00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:12.310 align:middle line:90%
to create that depth of wear.

00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:15.930 align:middle line:84%
Which means that
this is a lot older.

00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:17.660 align:middle line:84%
It had to go back
before the desert.

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:19.380 align:middle line:84%
That puts it back
7,000 years old.

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And another 1,000
years minimum, less

00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:23.640 align:middle line:84%
if it rained constantly
day and night

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:28.096 align:middle line:84%
and never stopped with
total buckets pouring on it.

00:37:28.096 --> 00:37:29.950 align:middle line:90%
And put it back 8,000 years old.

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:31.950 align:middle line:84%
So they're saying, well,
it's probably somewhere

00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:36.170 align:middle line:84%
between 10,000 and
15,000 years old.

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:40.204 align:middle line:90%
And that's been established.

00:37:40.204 --> 00:37:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And the scientific
community has--

00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:47.060 align:middle line:84%
there's a huge-- I've got
all the paperwork here.

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:49.960 align:middle line:90%
You can look at it.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.770 align:middle line:84%
That happened, I
think, in 1990, 1991.

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:58.100 align:middle line:84%
They had the
scientific community

00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:00.110 align:middle line:84%
came together and
investigated all of his work

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:01.023 align:middle line:90%
and looked at it.

00:38:01.023 --> 00:38:02.770 align:middle line:84%
Other people have gone
over and at this point,

00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:03.920 align:middle line:84%
they're just shrugging
their shoulders.

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:04.720 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.985 align:middle line:90%
It's got to be true.

00:38:06.985 --> 00:38:11.772 align:middle line:84%
This has got to be at
least 10,000 years old.

00:38:11.772 --> 00:38:15.176 align:middle line:84%
Well, according to
everything that we know,

00:38:15.176 --> 00:38:19.340 align:middle line:84%
the Sumerian culture
began in 3800 BC.

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:21.210 align:middle line:90%
Before that, nothing.

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:23.600 align:middle line:84%
No writing, no
culture, no nothing.

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:27.060 align:middle line:84%
Just hairy barbarians wandering
around bumping into trees

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:30.184 align:middle line:84%
and hitting each other
over the head with clubs.

00:38:30.184 --> 00:38:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
bingo, here's

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:36.660 align:middle line:84%
this amazing culture that
appears out of nowhere.

00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And so if there was nothing
before 3800 BC, which

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:44.840 align:middle line:84%
is what all your history
books are going to tell you,

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:47.410 align:middle line:84%
and that's 10,000 years
old minimum, who did it?

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:50.770 align:middle line:90%


00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:55.534 align:middle line:84%
Obviously this is a great
dilemma for historians.

00:38:55.534 --> 00:38:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And the way it looks,
they'll have to be rewritten.

00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And now they're going to have
to take Plato a little serious.

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:08.060 align:middle line:84%
It's even been talked about
in the United Nations.

00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:11.210 align:middle line:84%
They're going to have to take
him a little serious because he

00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:14.830 align:middle line:84%
referred to this
place called Atlantis,

00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:20.420 align:middle line:84%
where there was another
culture long before him.

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:21.670 align:middle line:90%
No one ever took it seriously.

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Now they've got to
take that seriously.

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:26.250 align:middle line:84%
They've got to start
investigating to find out

00:39:26.250 --> 00:39:28.050 align:middle line:84%
who was there because
this is the largest

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:29.008 align:middle line:90%
sculpture in the world.

00:39:29.008 --> 00:39:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And it required somebody,
a little bit more

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:42.590 align:middle line:84%
than primitive people
doing-- wandering around.

00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:46.140 align:middle line:84%
For those of you who are Edgar
Cayce fans and from the ARE

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:47.098 align:middle line:90%
and this kind of thing.

00:39:47.098 --> 00:39:48.990 align:middle line:90%
Is there anybody here from that?

00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:51.230 align:middle line:90%
A few people?

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:54.301 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Cayce talked about
the Halls of Records

00:39:54.301 --> 00:39:58.570 align:middle line:84%
and how that someday these
records would be opened

00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:03.540 align:middle line:84%
and that they would prove
that there had been cultures,

00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:07.960 align:middle line:84%
vast cultures on the Earth,
way beyond our imagination

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.388 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:40:09.388 --> 00:40:11.885 align:middle line:84%
No, not beyond our
imagination because there's

00:40:11.885 --> 00:40:12.750 align:middle line:90%
a third dimension.

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:15.470 align:middle line:84%
We could imagine it, but
beyond our belief, almost.

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And that have lived
on Earth going back

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:22.730 align:middle line:90%
5 and 1/2 million years.

00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:28.754 align:middle line:84%
And according to Thoth, who was
the first thing I talked about,

00:40:28.754 --> 00:40:31.450 align:middle line:84%
we actually have cultures
on this planet going back

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:35.872 align:middle line:84%
500 million years,
way, way, way, way

00:40:35.872 --> 00:40:37.110 align:middle line:90%
beyond where we're at now.

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:40.030 align:middle line:84%
This is nothing compared
to where we've been before.

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:42.910 align:middle line:84%
But with no traces,
or almost no traces

00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:46.356 align:middle line:84%
left, which we'll explain
why there's no traces of it

00:40:46.356 --> 00:40:48.910 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And then according
to Cayce, this

00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:54.820 align:middle line:84%
would be the key that
would open up the halls.

00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And the halls are where
these physical records

00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:00.970 align:middle line:84%
are that can be carbon dated
and even further and other ways

00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:03.920 align:middle line:84%
to date back to prove that
these things are ancient.

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And also you can still use
them, and they can do things

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:09.400 align:middle line:84%
that we can hardly
believe, which

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:15.060 align:middle line:84%
will prove that they were vast
sciences way back in that.

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:16.770 align:middle line:90%
And this would be the opening.

00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:20.752 align:middle line:84%
The opening, they said, would be
in the right paw of the Sphinx.

00:41:20.752 --> 00:41:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And for a long time
they thought that was

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:25.090 align:middle line:84%
sort of an arbitrary place, just
the right paw of the Sphinx.

00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:25.470 align:middle line:90%
So what?

00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:27.250 align:middle line:84%
But it's not
arbitrary, you'll see.

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:33.100 align:middle line:84%
All of this has-- there's logic
and meaning behind all of this.

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And the records are not held
just on physical objects.

00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Records are held on many
dimensional levels surrounding

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:44.440 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:46.920 align:middle line:84%
So I find it very
appropriate that even

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:49.740 align:middle line:84%
though books like
what Robert wrote

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:51.110 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of other things.

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:52.484 align:middle line:84%
And there's lots
of other things.

00:41:52.484 --> 00:41:54.510 align:middle line:84%
You could keep going on
in this for a long time.

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:56.520 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of other
stuff that has come up

00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:00.960 align:middle line:84%
that has challenged the
belief systems of the history,

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:04.630 align:middle line:84%
that this happens to be the
object that actually cracked

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:06.310 align:middle line:90%
the egg.

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:08.173 align:middle line:90%
