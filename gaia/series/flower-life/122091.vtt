00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.932 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.932 --> 00:00:20.280 align:middle line:90%
>>OK, here we go, more school.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:26.470 align:middle line:84%
We were working with the
Fibonacci sequence before.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:34.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, just as there are two
primary shapes-- the cube

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.510 align:middle line:84%
and the sphere-- there are two
primary mathematical sequences

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.340 align:middle line:84%
that are primary to life,
that move all throughout life.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.090 align:middle line:84%
One of them we saw
with the Fibonacci.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.131 align:middle line:84%
And you saw how it was
all in the bone structures

00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:50.480 align:middle line:84%
and the shape of things and
stuff all over the place.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.480 align:middle line:90%
But there's another one.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.040 align:middle line:84%
There's another one's
just as important.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.460 align:middle line:84%
It's just as important
as mommy is to daddy.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.010 align:middle line:10%
Because the Fibonacci
one is female.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.850 align:middle line:10%
It's the female cycle.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.950 align:middle line:10%
But there's a male one that's
also equally as important.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.418 align:middle line:10%
And it's called the
Binary Sequence.

00:01:10.418 --> 00:01:13.650 align:middle line:10%
The Binary Sequence, instead
of adding the last number

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.220 align:middle line:10%
to the last number, it's
doubling the last number.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:25.666 align:middle line:84%
So if you had 3-- well, it
starts out 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,

00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:27.550 align:middle line:84%
64, just like the
mitosis of cell

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.150 align:middle line:84%
division that we
were talking about.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.720 align:middle line:90%
That's the binary sequence.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.400 align:middle line:84%
But it's really
all over the place.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And so I want to look
at it for a moment.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.630 align:middle line:10%
This is it here.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.910 align:middle line:10%
And so it goes like this-- 1,
2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, et cetera.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.090 align:middle line:10%
Now, in terms of mitosis,
or cell division,

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.760 align:middle line:10%
at the end of 10 divisions
you have 512 cells.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.597 align:middle line:10%
And that happens to
be what the apple is.

00:01:55.597 --> 00:01:57.180 align:middle line:10%
When we see the
apple, that's how many

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.950 align:middle line:10%
cells are in the apple,
from everything that I've

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.060 align:middle line:10%
learned about it anyway.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.150 align:middle line:10%
Now, there's two
facts that we know.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.300 align:middle line:10%
One of them is that there
are approximately 10

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.390 align:middle line:10%
to the 14 cells in the
average human body.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.630 align:middle line:10%
And I got one too
many 0's on here.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.120 align:middle line:10%
But it's hundreds, thousands,
millions, billions, trillions.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.160 align:middle line:10%
There's about 100 trillion
cells in the average human body.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.660 align:middle line:10%
And if you talk to one doctor,
he'll tell you a little more.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.285 align:middle line:10%
And if you talk to another one,
they'll tell you a little less.

00:02:27.285 --> 00:02:29.990 align:middle line:10%
But there's a lot of
cells in the human body.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.690 align:middle line:10%
And another little fact-- and
there's lots of these facts.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.110 align:middle line:10%
But this is another one-- every
second of your life, 2 and 1/2

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.290 align:middle line:10%
million red blood cells die
and have to be replaced.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.090 align:middle line:10%
Every second.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.870 align:middle line:10%


00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.600 align:middle line:10%
I mean, that's a lot of red
blood cells, 2 and 1/2 million.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.950 align:middle line:10%
It would take about
three months just

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.780 align:middle line:10%
to count to 2 and a 1/3
million, day and night.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.380 align:middle line:90%
So I mean, it's a lot.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And yet, the only way
that both of those things

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.420 align:middle line:84%
can be satisfied--
in other words,

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.110 align:middle line:84%
the way the body can be
created and then maintained

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.540 align:middle line:84%
is only through mitosis,
which is cell division.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And so at the end of 10 of
these, you've got 512 cells.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And you just look at this and
you think, well, boy it better

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.802 align:middle line:90%
start going fast.

00:03:24.802 --> 00:03:27.620 align:middle line:84%
Because we got a lot
of work to do here.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And it just doesn't seem
possible at this point.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.330 align:middle line:84%
But the thing about the binary
sequence-- and those of you

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.290 align:middle line:84%
who have studied
mathematics realize--

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.730 align:middle line:84%
it has an almost
magical quality,

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.410 align:middle line:84%
that it has ab almost
impossible quality about it.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.260 align:middle line:10%
At 512 cells, when it goes
to the 11th mitosis division,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.415 align:middle line:10%
it's at 1,024.

00:03:50.415 --> 00:03:55.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, by the end of 10 more,
it's at over a half million.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.420 align:middle line:84%
They went from 512 to a
half million from 10 to 20.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And when it goes for
10 more cell divisions,

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.250 align:middle line:84%
it goes up to 530
million at the end of 30.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And according to Anna C.
Pai and Helen Marcus-Roberts

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.200 align:middle line:84%
in their book, Genetics and
its complications-- "Genetics,

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.579 align:middle line:90%
Its Concepts & Implications"--

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.186 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:20.186 --> 00:04:23.470 align:middle line:90%


00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.730 align:middle line:90%
--Freudian slips.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.590 align:middle line:90%


00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:35.010 align:middle line:84%
It takes it exactly and only
46 mitotic cell divisions

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.380 align:middle line:84%
to create an adult.
46 times, that's

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.660 align:middle line:10%
a really interesting number.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.590 align:middle line:10%
Because that's the number
of chromosomes we have.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.300 align:middle line:10%
And it's also 1/2 the
number of stable elements

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.270 align:middle line:10%
that we have in the environment.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:57.636 align:middle line:84%
And it's just amazing that
it could be done in 46 times.

00:04:57.636 --> 00:04:58.760 align:middle line:90%
It takes 9 months to do it.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:05.100 align:middle line:84%
But in 46 times, it
creates the whole process.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.880 align:middle line:84%
Actually, must be
more than nine months.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't know when they
figure there's an adult.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Us humans chose
the binary sequence

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:19.855 align:middle line:84%
to create our computer
structures, which

00:05:19.855 --> 00:05:22.750 align:middle line:84%
is kind of wise in
a way, because it's

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.810 align:middle line:84%
one of the living structures,
one of the living sequences.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:32.480 align:middle line:10%
And if we had not
chosen that one,

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.370 align:middle line:10%
it would not have
been possible, really.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.996 align:middle line:10%
And I would like to just
very quickly tell you

00:05:39.996 --> 00:05:41.870 align:middle line:10%
how a computer works,
even though most of you

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:42.970 align:middle line:10%
know how it works.

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.640 align:middle line:10%
There's probably somebody here
who maybe don't know that.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.582 align:middle line:10%
And it's real simple.

00:05:50.582 --> 00:05:52.540 align:middle line:10%
It's just you got some
light switches in there.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.135 align:middle line:10%
Call them computer chips.

00:05:54.135 --> 00:05:56.370 align:middle line:10%
You can turn them
off or turn them on.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.570 align:middle line:10%
And say you have a
real simple computer.

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.416 align:middle line:10%
You only have five
computer chips in it.

00:06:01.416 --> 00:06:02.940 align:middle line:10%
A few little places in there.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:08.400 align:middle line:10%
And so those chips are given
names of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.760 align:middle line:10%
So you've got five of them,
and that's their names.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.520 align:middle line:10%
That's their numerical value.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.320 align:middle line:10%
Well, by turning off or on any
sequence of those five chips,

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.412 align:middle line:10%
you can come up with every
number between 1 and 16.

00:06:22.412 --> 00:06:24.620 align:middle line:10%
In other words, if you turn
on the first chip, that's

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:25.880 align:middle line:10%
called 1, you get 1.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.910 align:middle line:10%
If you turn on the second chip
that's called 2, you get 2.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.385 align:middle line:10%
If you turn on both of
those chips, you get three.

00:06:32.385 --> 00:06:33.185 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:06:33.185 --> 00:06:36.530 align:middle line:10%
If you on this one, you get 4.

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.770 align:middle line:10%
That's the 1, 2, 3 and 4.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:40.490 align:middle line:10%
4 and 1 is 5.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:41.600 align:middle line:10%
4 and 2 is 6.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.265 align:middle line:10%
4, 2, and 1 is seven.

00:06:43.265 --> 00:06:44.250 align:middle line:10%
Then you have 8.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.600 align:middle line:10%
And 8 and 1 is 9.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.410 align:middle line:10%
8 and 1 is 9.

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:48.640 align:middle line:10%
8 and 2 is 10, 8
and 2 and 1 is 11.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.550 align:middle line:10%
8 and 4 is 12.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.540 align:middle line:10%
8, 4, and 1 is 13.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.770 align:middle line:10%
8 and 4 and 2 is 14.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.885 align:middle line:10%
And 8 and 4 and 2 and 1 is 15.

00:06:54.885 --> 00:06:56.685 align:middle line:10%
And then you have 16.

00:06:56.685 --> 00:06:59.260 align:middle line:10%
So you can get every
number in between there.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:03.040 align:middle line:10%
If you add one more computer
chip and you call it 32,

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.150 align:middle line:10%
then you can get every
number between 1 and 32.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.760 align:middle line:84%
If you had one more computer
chip, and you call it 64,

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.670 align:middle line:84%
you can get every
number between 1 and 64.

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:18.450 align:middle line:84%
If you have a computer
that has 46 chips in it,

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:23.120 align:middle line:84%
you can get every number
between 1 and 100 trillion,

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.120 align:middle line:90%
which is 46 [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.450 align:middle line:90%


00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:32.450 align:middle line:84%
I begin to see this
binary sequence in life

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:35.360 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.540 align:middle line:90%
It just keeps repeating.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And not just in the mitosis,
but it's all over the place,

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.450 align:middle line:90%
in all kinds of ways.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And at one point, I realized
that we had mommy and daddy

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.400 align:middle line:90%
sequences here.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I suspected
since there is always

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:55.642 align:middle line:84%
a geometrical nature
behind numbers--

00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:57.600 align:middle line:84%
I'll just throw something
out here, by the way.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.760 align:middle line:84%
Most scientists believe
that numbers or mathematics

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.790 align:middle line:84%
is the hidden language
behind your science.

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:07.370 align:middle line:90%
I don't agree with that.

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:11.460 align:middle line:84%
I say that geometry
is the hidden shape

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:15.060 align:middle line:84%
underneath all numbers, that
generates the numbers that

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.280 align:middle line:90%
is behind the science.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, when I
see all these numbers,

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:22.640 align:middle line:84%
I realize there's got to be a
shape underneath it that has

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.100 align:middle line:90%
generated the two sequences.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.939 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe one shape that
generated one and one

00:08:28.939 --> 00:08:30.230 align:middle line:90%
shape that generated the other.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:32.840 align:middle line:84%
But because they appear to
be mommy and daddy to me,

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.500 align:middle line:84%
I highly intuited
that there must

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.799 align:middle line:84%
be some kind of geometrical
form or shape or pattern

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:41.059 align:middle line:90%
that tie the two together.

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:42.346 align:middle line:90%
And I looked for years on it.

00:08:42.346 --> 00:08:44.387 align:middle line:84%
I thought about it for
years and years and years,

00:08:44.387 --> 00:08:45.860 align:middle line:90%
and never could find it.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And then one day I was going
through one of my son's

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.350 align:middle line:90%
sixth grade mathematical books.

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And I was just looking at
it, and checking up on things

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.440 align:middle line:90%
and seeing how stuff works.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And as I was going through
there, I came across something.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.190 align:middle line:90%
And I really am sorry.

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Whoever wrote this book, I
don't remember their name.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.200 align:middle line:84%
I would like to
give them credit.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.000 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.060 align:middle line:90%
I don't have the book anymore.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.920 align:middle line:84%
But he did something in
there, that he actually

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.300 align:middle line:90%
didn't know what he did.

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.270 align:middle line:84%
He did something
really incredible

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:27.420 align:middle line:84%
and was unconscious
that he had done it.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:32.070 align:middle line:84%
But the guy had taken a
particular geometrical form

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.430 align:middle line:84%
and plotted a
logarithmic spiral on it.

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And when he did,
he simultaneously

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:42.980 align:middle line:84%
came up with both the two
sequences, the Fibonacci

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:44.392 align:middle line:90%
and the Binary sequence.

00:09:44.392 --> 00:09:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't even
know he had done that.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.260 align:middle line:84%
He was talking about
something totally different.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.450 align:middle line:90%
But this is what happens.

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:53.690 align:middle line:84%
This was the geometrical form
that he was working with.

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:58.360 align:middle line:10%
It's called a Polar
Graph, which is

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:03.420 align:middle line:10%
a two-dimensional representation
of a three-dimensional form,

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.405 align:middle line:10%
a sphere.

00:10:04.405 --> 00:10:08.600 align:middle line:84%
It's how to plot from a sphere
onto a two-dimensional form.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.867 align:middle line:84%
It makes perfect sense, now
that I think about what it is.

00:10:11.867 --> 00:10:13.825 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the sacred
shapes, going from three

00:10:13.825 --> 00:10:16.360 align:middle line:90%
to two-dimensional levels.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.602 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
is about this,

00:10:19.602 --> 00:10:21.060 align:middle line:84%
when I started
thinking about this,

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:23.460 align:middle line:84%
I thought this was something
that maybe the Navy came up

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:24.860 align:middle line:90%
with, or army or something.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.690 align:middle line:90%
It was relatively new.

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And I'm beginning to find
out that the Polar Graph goes

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:30.520 align:middle line:90%
all way back as far as Egypt.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.560 align:middle line:90%


00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.690 align:middle line:84%
That they had maps of the
earth going all the way back,

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:39.250 align:middle line:90%
using a system similar to this.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:42.180 align:middle line:90%
And so this is old.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:45.040 align:middle line:10%
It's ancient.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.630 align:middle line:10%
So this is how we
usually see a Polar

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:50.940 align:middle line:10%
Graph, which is there will
be a circle in the middle.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.660 align:middle line:10%
And whatever the radii
of that circle is,

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.100 align:middle line:10%
that will become your yardstick.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.160 align:middle line:10%
And you call that 1.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.070 align:middle line:90%


00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:03.490 align:middle line:10%
And then you just come out
that far to the next circle,

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:05.380 align:middle line:10%
and you keep coming
out that distance

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.220 align:middle line:10%
to create all your circles.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.470 align:middle line:10%
And then there are 36
lines equally spaced,

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.940 align:middle line:10%
which creates your 360 degrees.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:19.050 align:middle line:10%
Of course, even everything
in here is not arbitrary.

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:23.495 align:middle line:10%
360 degrees isn't arbitrary
when you know the geometries.

00:11:23.495 --> 00:11:26.780 align:middle line:10%
There's all reasons
why it's all in there,

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.539 align:middle line:10%
the more you get into this.

00:11:29.539 --> 00:11:30.830 align:middle line:10%
But anyway, this was the shape.

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:35.100 align:middle line:10%
And what this man did was he
took this middle sphere in here

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.620 align:middle line:10%
as though it was
a planet in space.

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:40.370 align:middle line:10%
You could see it like that.

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:42.540 align:middle line:10%
And from the surface
of the planet,

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:46.750 align:middle line:10%
he plotted a logarithmic spiral.

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:49.260 align:middle line:10%
As it turns out, a
logarithmic spiral

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.740 align:middle line:10%
is the creator or
the key between both

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.140 align:middle line:10%
of those other
two, the Fibonacci

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.480 align:middle line:10%
and the binary sequence.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.940 align:middle line:10%
And so he plotted
one around here.

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.060 align:middle line:10%
He started at 0 degrees.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.940 align:middle line:10%
And he plotted
this spiral around,

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:09.150 align:middle line:10%
until it came around one time,
back to 0 degrees, like this.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:13.660 align:middle line:90%


00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:14.680 align:middle line:10%
He started here.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.900 align:middle line:10%
And he plotted this logarithmic
spiral around one time.

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:23.810 align:middle line:10%
Now, he was only concerned where
the spiral crossed the degree

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:25.020 align:middle line:10%
marks.

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:28.670 align:middle line:10%
And the system that he
used to calculate this

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:33.500 align:middle line:10%
was using the central circle
as your measuring stick of 1.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.305 align:middle line:84%
And say you wanted to
know where this point was,

00:12:36.305 --> 00:12:37.210 align:middle line:90%
he would come here.

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And you'd go, that
would be 1, 2, 3,

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:43.896 align:middle line:90%
4.5-- approximately-- radii.

00:12:43.896 --> 00:12:45.190 align:middle line:90%
You see how that is?

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:51.400 align:middle line:84%
This one over here would be
1, 2.8 radii approximately.

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.890 align:middle line:10%
But you could calculate
this pretty accurately.

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:57.370 align:middle line:10%
Well, look at the mathematics.

00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:02.070 align:middle line:10%
This is from 0 to 360 degrees.

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:04.060 align:middle line:10%
And at 0 degrees,
it's exactly 1.

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:07.060 align:middle line:10%
Because it's starting right
on the surface of the planet.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:12.130 align:middle line:10%
And at 120 degrees, it keeps
going up, up and up and up.

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:18.240 align:middle line:10%
But at 120 degrees, it
exactly crosses it at 2.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.500 align:middle line:10%
And then over here,
at 240 degrees,

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:25.420 align:middle line:10%
it just perfectly
goes over at 4.

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:31.310 align:middle line:10%
And then, at 360 degrees,
it returns exactly at 8.

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:36.210 align:middle line:10%
That's 1, 2, 4, 8,
binary sequence.

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:44.320 align:middle line:10%
At the same moment, it goes,
1, 2, and also at 190 degrees,

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.700 align:middle line:10%
it crosses exactly at 3.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.810 align:middle line:10%
And 280 degrees, exactly at 5.

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:52.290 align:middle line:10%
360 degrees, exactly at 8.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:58.250 align:middle line:10%
1, 2, 3, 5, 8--
Fibonacci sequence,

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:01.530 align:middle line:10%
both unfolding from
this particular pattern.

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:04.340 align:middle line:10%
And I went, wow!

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:14.240 align:middle line:10%
And I have to admit a defect in
my personality here right now.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.989 align:middle line:84%
When I see things like this,
I will check one thing out.

00:14:16.989 --> 00:14:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And then I just know that
it's true for the rest of it.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:20.420 align:middle line:90%
So I go on.

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And I've never
finished this work.

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:27.750 align:middle line:84%
I've only looked at the
binary sequence of 1, 2, 4, 8.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And I've never
checked out what it

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:35.790 align:middle line:84%
means in terms of the geometries
behind the Fibonacci sequence.

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:38.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm not really interested.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:41.059 align:middle line:84%
But it could be very important
to somebody's work here.

00:14:41.059 --> 00:14:43.600 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, if you want to do
that, you go ahead and do it.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.160 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to look only at
the binary sequence right now.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.730 align:middle line:84%
But here's what that
means geometrically.

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Those points of 0,
120, 240, and 0,

00:14:55.030 --> 00:15:01.150 align:middle line:84%
form an equilateral
triangle around the center.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:02.775 align:middle line:84%
Geometrically, this
is binary sequence.

00:15:02.775 --> 00:15:05.330 align:middle line:90%


00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:07.620 align:middle line:84%
It's more than just an
equilateral triangle.

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:11.270 align:middle line:84%
Because you are now literally
looking at a tetrahedron.

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:13.060 align:middle line:90%
Because the lines are all there.

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:15.120 align:middle line:84%
There's a line
coming to the center.

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.180 align:middle line:10%
And you are looking at
two-dimensional view

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:23.410 align:middle line:10%
of a tetrahedron-- so realize
that as we start to work here--

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:25.630 align:middle line:10%
inscribed perfectly in a sphere.

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:28.990 align:middle line:90%


00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:31.480 align:middle line:84%
However-- I'm going to change
this a little bit-- there's

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.885 align:middle line:90%
another image in here.

00:15:32.885 --> 00:15:36.860 align:middle line:10%
And that image is an
equilateral triangle

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.072 align:middle line:10%
with a line down the middle.

00:15:39.072 --> 00:15:40.030 align:middle line:10%
See this line here?

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:41.584 align:middle line:10%
That's another image
that's in there.

00:15:41.584 --> 00:15:42.750 align:middle line:10%
Well, there was another man.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:45.530 align:middle line:10%
His name was Keith
Critchlow, who's

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:47.600 align:middle line:10%
done a lot of real
incredible work.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.130 align:middle line:90%
You can check out his work too.

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:50.930 align:middle line:90%
It's very mental.

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:52.840 align:middle line:90%
But it's very good.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And Keith just happened--
and I don't know

00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:59.500 align:middle line:90%
how he ever figured it out.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:04.765 align:middle line:84%
It was just pure luck-- to
find out-- stumble upon,

00:16:04.765 --> 00:16:06.850 align:middle line:84%
I think would be the
best word-- that if you

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:09.920 align:middle line:84%
had an equilateral triangle
with a line down the middle,

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.642 align:middle line:84%
that an incredible unique
phenomena took place.

00:16:13.642 --> 00:16:15.600 align:middle line:84%
He did not realize it
was really a tetrahedron.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.340 align:middle line:90%


00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.860 align:middle line:84%
He found out that if you took
the line that was in the middle

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:26.770 align:middle line:84%
and you measured-- this
is the flaw in his system.

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:30.920 align:middle line:84%
You had to measure
with a measuring stick.

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:36.230 align:middle line:84%
Anytime you have to use a ruler,
then you're not at the core.

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:37.490 align:middle line:90%
Go deeper.

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:39.970 align:middle line:84%
Because you should never
have to measure anything.

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:41.810 align:middle line:84%
You should be able
to figure it all out

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:46.080 align:middle line:84%
with nothing but a compass
and just a straight edge.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And all your measuring should
be automatically determined

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.740 align:middle line:90%
by the lines.

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:53.992 align:middle line:84%
Which I'll show you what
I mean in just a moment.

00:16:53.992 --> 00:16:56.450 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, he had to measure
from here to find the middle.

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Once he found the middle,
you draw a line straight up

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:03.110 align:middle line:84%
at 90 degrees and then bring
it down to this corner.

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:05.160 align:middle line:84%
Where it crosses, you
make another one straight

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.400 align:middle line:90%
up and down to this corner.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.859 align:middle line:84%
And you could keep
doing that, obviously.

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And he discovers something, that
this line, this middle line,

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:16.304 align:middle line:84%
the links of these lines that
are broken up inside of there

00:17:16.304 --> 00:17:17.595 align:middle line:90%
do something rather remarkable.

00:17:17.595 --> 00:17:20.450 align:middle line:90%


00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:22.310 align:middle line:90%
This is his writing.

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:25.170 align:middle line:84%
It says, "Continuing
in this way--"

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:27.350 align:middle line:84%
meaning this little
pattern that he made.

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:31.230 align:middle line:84%
"--each successive proportion
will be the harmonic mean

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:34.080 align:middle line:84%
between the previous proportion
and the total length."

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.190 align:middle line:84%
Same kind of thing that
we were doing with a over

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:42.260 align:middle line:90%
b for the Phi ratio.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And all of these proportions
will be musically significant,

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.690 align:middle line:90%
1/2 being the octave.

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:51.200 align:middle line:84%
Meaning the length of
this to the length of this

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.802 align:middle line:84%
is equivalent proportionately
to the octave.

00:17:53.802 --> 00:17:58.040 align:middle line:10%
"2/3 being the fifth, 4/5
being the major third,

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:05.320 align:middle line:10%
8/9 being the major tone, and
16/17 being the half tone."

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:08.050 align:middle line:84%
It's perfect
musical proportions.

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:09.210 align:middle line:90%
So he tried it another way.

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And he came down here and
tried another pattern.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:13.310 align:middle line:90%
And the same thing came out.

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:18.640 align:middle line:84%
He came out with 1/7, 1/4,
2/5, 4/7, 8/11, and 16/19.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And all those were
musical proportions,

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:23.840 align:middle line:84%
that there are musical
notes associated

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.000 align:middle line:90%
with those proportions.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.840 align:middle line:90%


00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.060 align:middle line:90%
And he sort of went, wow.

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:30.060 align:middle line:90%
And I went, really wow.

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:32.820 align:middle line:84%
Because I was seeing the
other side of the whole thing

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:33.845 align:middle line:90%
that was going on there.

00:18:33.845 --> 00:18:36.470 align:middle line:10%
So look at this.

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:38.720 align:middle line:10%
Here's the original one.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.220 align:middle line:84%
To find the middle, you
don't have to measure.

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Just draw a line from
there to the center.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.260 align:middle line:84%
It will come, come down, and
precisely break this in half

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.560 align:middle line:90%
to the middle.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.850 align:middle line:10%
So the middle point
is the octave.

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:55.455 align:middle line:10%
And so then I can automatically
create the rest of the pattern

00:18:55.455 --> 00:18:58.740 align:middle line:10%
that he created, but
without any measuring stick.

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, even
the external sphere

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:06.840 align:middle line:84%
is aligned with what happens
in the middle, what happens off

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:07.640 align:middle line:90%
of here.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:10.870 align:middle line:90%


00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:12.180 align:middle line:90%
We have done a lot of research.

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:14.790 align:middle line:10%
And what we believe
now is that you

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:17.900 align:middle line:10%
can draw a line from any
one of these three corners

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.190 align:middle line:10%
to any space inside of here.

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Say that you pick
that one right there.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:25.220 align:middle line:84%
You draw a line up to
that one, and then down.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:26.890 align:middle line:84%
Then make your mess
with your patterns.

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:29.960 align:middle line:84%
You'll come up with all the
musical proportions there are.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.470 align:middle line:90%
Period and end.

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:36.550 align:middle line:10%
All the harmonics
of music that exist,

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:39.660 align:middle line:10%
no matter what scales or types
of skills you want to use,

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:42.960 align:middle line:10%
they will all be there.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:46.850 align:middle line:10%
And we should be able
to prove this soon,

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:49.420 align:middle line:10%
which will mean that
the harmonics of music

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:54.290 align:middle line:10%
are these proportions that
are located in the simplest

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:58.470 align:middle line:10%
shape in existence,
a tetrahedron.

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:05.020 align:middle line:84%
Even remember we have the
eight notes and the five notes

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:08.990 align:middle line:84%
creating the chromatic scale,
which have 12 divisions in it.

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:11.576 align:middle line:84%
And the divisions along each
one of these sides is 12.

00:20:11.576 --> 00:20:15.065 align:middle line:84%
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

00:20:15.065 --> 00:20:17.730 align:middle line:84%
There's 12 spaces on
each one of these sides.

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:20.250 align:middle line:90%


00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:22.620 align:middle line:10%
While I was studying
this and understanding

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:26.770 align:middle line:10%
how sound was a function
of a tetrahedron,

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:29.180 align:middle line:10%
someone sent me a postcard.

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:33.060 align:middle line:10%
It was Janice Dolphin.

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:34.980 align:middle line:90%
She's a good person.

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:37.720 align:middle line:84%
She sent me a postcard,
which happened

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:42.210 align:middle line:84%
to be a polar graph with
reflective surfaces on it,

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:45.374 align:middle line:84%
how light reflects
off of a polar graph.

00:20:45.374 --> 00:20:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, it was right while
I was in the midst of this.

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:49.070 align:middle line:84%
So I was sitting
there going, wow!

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:49.530 align:middle line:90%
Wow!

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:50.905 align:middle line:84%
Wow! oh, thanks
for the postcard.

00:20:50.905 --> 00:20:51.800 align:middle line:90%
Wow, wow, wow.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:52.600 align:middle line:90%
Ah!

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.364 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:54.364 --> 00:20:55.280 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't believe it.

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.820 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was perfect time.

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:57.980 align:middle line:90%
So this is a polar graph.

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is how light
reflects off of a polar graph,

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:05.220 align:middle line:90%
with logarithmic spirals.

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:08.720 align:middle line:90%
You can see it happening.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was just,
like, overwhelmed.

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:13.160 align:middle line:90%
For me, it was very powerful.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually see that
the white light is exactly 180.

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And right at 90 degrees,
you can see the blackening,

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:27.500 align:middle line:84%
the black light spirals
that come out of it.

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.715 align:middle line:84%
And we have seen that
somewhere else before.

00:21:29.715 --> 00:21:32.940 align:middle line:90%


00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:36.520 align:middle line:84%
The white light coming
out here, 180 degrees off,

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:38.990 align:middle line:84%
the other white
light, and 90 degrees

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:40.410 align:middle line:90%
from that, the black light.

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And 180 degrees from that,
the other black light.

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Exactly what we're
seeing right here.

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:50.430 align:middle line:90%
You can just look at it.

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:52.830 align:middle line:84%
We have the same energy
fields around us, of course.

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:55.800 align:middle line:84%
You're just looking at it
on a major, major level.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.020 align:middle line:90%
As above, so below.

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:59.252 align:middle line:90%
Everything's the same.

00:21:59.252 --> 00:22:00.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's another
point I want to make

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.620 align:middle line:90%
right now, before I go on.

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:05.980 align:middle line:84%
Coming back to
this one, remember

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:09.380 align:middle line:84%
before when I said
that when you're

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:13.340 align:middle line:84%
looking at this geometries
that the lines that are on here

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:14.600 align:middle line:90%
are not just lines on a page.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:18.930 align:middle line:84%
But they're spirit
moving through nothing

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:19.900 align:middle line:90%
and that they're maps.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:23.230 align:middle line:90%


00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:26.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's another statement
I'd like to make about.

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:27.480 align:middle line:90%
I made it once before.

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:32.230 align:middle line:84%
But I want to kind of make it
come home quicker or harder.

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And that is, is that for
every line that's on a page,

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:46.330 align:middle line:84%
it has an experiential
aspect to it.

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:49.160 align:middle line:90%


00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.200 align:middle line:90%
It's not just arbitrary.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.350 align:middle line:90%
It's not just a move.

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:54.550 align:middle line:84%
Every time the
spirit moves, there

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:57.540 align:middle line:84%
is a corresponding relationship
into the outer world

00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:01.900 align:middle line:84%
that is associated with
it in every single case.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.210 align:middle line:90%
There's no exceptions.

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:05.590 align:middle line:84%
There is something
associated with it.

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:07.500 align:middle line:90%
It could mean a rock somewhere.

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:11.550 align:middle line:84%
Or it could describe a star
somewhere or something else.

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:14.660 align:middle line:84%
In this case, we're talking
about harmonics of music.

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And so you could
be looking at that.

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:22.220 align:middle line:84%
Or you can be
thinking about this,

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:26.600 align:middle line:84%
which is what this
represents are musical notes.

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And they are really
interrelated.

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:31.570 align:middle line:90%
There's really no difference.

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:36.300 align:middle line:84%
This strikes you primarily
into your left brain.

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:39.530 align:middle line:84%
This comes into
your right brain.

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:42.980 align:middle line:84%
If you add right now and
you go, 1 plus 1 is 2,

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:44.770 align:middle line:84%
and 2 plus 2 is 4,
you're functioning

00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:46.170 align:middle line:90%
from your left brain.

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:49.180 align:middle line:84%
If you hum and you
go, hmm, you just

00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:51.071 align:middle line:84%
switched over to
your right brain.

00:23:51.071 --> 00:23:53.362 align:middle line:84%
As long as you don't put any
words or anything into it.

00:23:53.362 --> 00:23:55.112 align:middle line:84%
If you're listening
to music without words

00:23:55.112 --> 00:23:57.680 align:middle line:90%
it goes to your right brain.

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:02.380 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'd like to do, just
for just a moment, just for one

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:05.540 align:middle line:84%
minute or so is I'm just
going to play some music.

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.314 align:middle line:90%
Hopefully it's tuned.

00:24:07.314 --> 00:24:08.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
play this flute.

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:12.000 align:middle line:84%
It's a little Sioux Indian
flute, Lakota Indian flute.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'll play just a
little bit of Indian music.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And while I am,
you might realize

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:23.260 align:middle line:84%
that the sounds you are hearing
and the musical significance

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:25.030 align:middle line:84%
of the notes that
you are hearing

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:29.370 align:middle line:84%
is exactly the same
thing up there.

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:31.310 align:middle line:84%
Only there it's
in geometry rather

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:37.310 align:middle line:84%
than what's coming into your
brain through experience.

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:39.010 align:middle line:90%
So let's try this for a moment.

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:46.880 align:middle line:90%

Same thing.

00:26:07.605 --> 00:26:11.180 align:middle line:90%
It just feels different.

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:13.570 align:middle line:84%
It just feels
difficult. That's all.

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:15.876 align:middle line:84%
But one is the same
as the other one.

00:26:15.876 --> 00:26:18.540 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot easier to take
this one in, I imagine.

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:20.360 align:middle line:84%
But that's really
the same thing.

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:21.960 align:middle line:84%
If you get this,
then you understand

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.210 align:middle line:90%
what sacred geometry is about.

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:25.840 align:middle line:90%


00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.444 align:middle line:90%
Well, there was a man named--

00:26:27.444 --> 00:26:34.370 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:35.520 align:middle line:90%
He's not over there.

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.990 align:middle line:90%


00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:41.865 align:middle line:84%
There was a man named
Charles [? Sherburn ?].

00:26:41.865 --> 00:26:43.430 align:middle line:90%
And he was a fireman.

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to
study Noah's Ark.

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And so had read in the
Bible that Noah's Ark

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:52.376 align:middle line:84%
was so many qubits one way and
so many qubits another way.

00:26:52.376 --> 00:26:54.510 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know for sure
what the qubit was.

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:58.040 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of
controversy over that.

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.350 align:middle line:84%
But he knew that he could
use the same proportion.

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:04.960 align:middle line:84%
So when he did what the Bible
said, it came up with a block.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:08.120 align:middle line:84%
It looks like that,
which he figured probably

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:09.770 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't float in
water too well.

00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:11.510 align:middle line:84%
However, the Noah's
Ark which they

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:16.360 align:middle line:84%
think they have now discovered
on Mount Ararat in Turkey,

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:19.290 align:middle line:90%
does look a lot like a block.

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's extraordinary, to
have the good fortune of having

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:24.630 align:middle line:84%
the team that went
through there,

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:27.620 align:middle line:84%
found it, went through there,
measured everything and went

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:29.360 align:middle line:84%
to the whole photograph
thing, came back

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:30.850 align:middle line:84%
and showed me all
the blueprints.

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:33.110 align:middle line:84%
It's all sacred
geometry of this thing.

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.920 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:36.540 align:middle line:84%
Every room is in proportion
to the other one.

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:38.620 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
in it that isn't.

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.557 align:middle line:84%
And it has some
extraordinary things

00:27:40.557 --> 00:27:41.640 align:middle line:90%
they're not talking about.

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:46.602 align:middle line:84%
One of them, this thing is
about the size of Queen Mary.

00:27:46.602 --> 00:27:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's got hundreds
and hundreds and hundreds

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:49.690 align:middle line:90%
of rooms in it.

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:52.489 align:middle line:84%
And you would have a problem
if you had a lot of animals

00:27:52.489 --> 00:27:54.697 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of these little
rooms, it would be air.

00:27:54.697 --> 00:27:56.721 align:middle line:84%
It would be a big
problem, wouldn't it?

00:27:56.721 --> 00:27:58.220 align:middle line:84%
How to get air into
all these rooms.

00:27:58.220 --> 00:27:59.450 align:middle line:84%
Because the whole
boat was sealed,

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:00.825 align:middle line:84%
on top and bottom
and everything,

00:28:00.825 --> 00:28:04.800 align:middle line:84%
so it couldn't sink under any
kind of conditions, almost.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And what they did
was so ingenious.

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:11.630 align:middle line:90%
And it's just amazing.

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:13.870 align:middle line:84%
They made this
hole in the bottom

00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:18.960 align:middle line:84%
of the boat that was a
big room, a big open room.

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.950 align:middle line:84%
It's like, almost
as big as this room

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:25.720 align:middle line:84%
here, that exposed itself
to the water underneath.

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.630 align:middle line:90%
And it went up into the ship.

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And from the top
part of that, there

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:32.670 align:middle line:84%
were these little
channels that went out

00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:35.530 align:middle line:84%
to all the various rooms
all over the place.

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And when the boat
went up in the water,

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:42.190 align:middle line:84%
it sucked all the air
out of all those rooms.

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And when I went
down in the water

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:46.584 align:middle line:84%
it pushed all the air
back into those rooms.

00:28:46.584 --> 00:28:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And they calculated that it
would exchange all the air out

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.320 align:middle line:84%
of all the rooms
72 times every day.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.510 align:middle line:90%
That's what it was.

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:57.480 align:middle line:90%
Totally remove all the things.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:58.450 align:middle line:90%
That is pretty good.

00:28:58.450 --> 00:28:59.822 align:middle line:90%
That was really pretty good.

00:28:59.822 --> 00:29:01.405 align:middle line:84%
Especially for those
hairy barbarians.

00:29:01.405 --> 00:29:04.200 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:09.770 align:middle line:90%


00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:15.110 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I don't know if
that's the Noah's Ark or not.

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:20.490 align:middle line:84%
It is an ancient, ancient
boat found way up high

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:22.130 align:middle line:90%
on a mountaintop.

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And so it's hard
to say for sure.

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:30.570 align:middle line:84%
But what he discovered was
something, perhaps different.

00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:32.880 align:middle line:84%
He may have been
looking for Noah's Ark.

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:37.250 align:middle line:84%
But he found something
that is interesting.

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:39.850 align:middle line:90%
And I just want to present it.

00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:41.710 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, if
it's Noah's Ark,

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:45.640 align:middle line:84%
maybe they meant arc,
like the arc of a circle.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And so he put the proportions
that were set in the Bible

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:51.930 align:middle line:90%
into arcs.

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:55.070 align:middle line:84%
The proportions were
6 to 1, 10 to 1 ratio.

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:58.330 align:middle line:84%
What I mean by that is
if you took this block

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:00.780 align:middle line:84%
and you measured
the height of it

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:03.290 align:middle line:84%
and used that as your measuring
stick and called it 1,

00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:07.130 align:middle line:84%
then there would be 10
of them going this way.

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:09.579 align:middle line:84%
And if you took the width
of it and measured it,

00:30:09.579 --> 00:30:10.620 align:middle line:90%
there would be 6 of them.

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:12.078 align:middle line:84%
In other words, on
this thing here,

00:30:12.078 --> 00:30:14.330 align:middle line:84%
if you were to
measure this, there

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:16.160 align:middle line:84%
would be 6 of those
going down this way.

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you measured
it this way, there

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:21.700 align:middle line:84%
would be 10 of them
going this way.

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:24.390 align:middle line:84%
So it creates very specific
arcs, by doing this 6 to 1,

00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:25.980 align:middle line:90%
10 to 1 ratio.

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And it makes a thing
that looks like this.

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:33.470 align:middle line:84%
It looks like a kayak, only
kind of a streamlined kayak.

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:38.215 align:middle line:84%
And here's where the part I
don't know exactly what to do.

00:30:38.215 --> 00:30:41.412 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if this
will do it on here.

00:30:41.412 --> 00:30:46.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to try this and
see if I can do it on here.

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:49.060 align:middle line:84%
This might work on this thing
here, if it doesn't go off.

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:52.610 align:middle line:90%


00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:54.276 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it will.

00:30:54.276 --> 00:30:57.180 align:middle line:90%
I'll have to see if I can do it.

00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:01.520 align:middle line:84%
If at one point you decided
to rotate it like this.

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to rotate
an object like this,

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.640 align:middle line:84%
it should do what
you see right there.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.850 align:middle line:90%
It should just rotate.

00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:12.361 align:middle line:84%
And if it did anything
else, then there

00:31:12.361 --> 00:31:13.860 align:middle line:84%
would have to be
something going on.

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.750 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you were to throw
a rock across the room here.

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:18.620 align:middle line:84%
It's shouldn't
just stop and turn

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:21.020 align:middle line:84%
and go sideways or
something, without any force.

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:25.169 align:middle line:84%
But this thing here, if you turn
it clockwise, it will rotate.

00:31:25.169 --> 00:31:26.710 align:middle line:84%
But if you try to
turn it clockwise--

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:28.835 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know if this
is going to work on here--

00:31:28.835 --> 00:31:29.742 align:middle line:90%
>>Counter clockwise?

00:31:29.742 --> 00:31:32.470 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:34.930 align:middle line:90%
>>It will stop and turn around.

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:38.210 align:middle line:90%


00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:40.610 align:middle line:90%
It won't rotate the other way.

00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:49.460 align:middle line:90%


00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:52.386 align:middle line:84%
And there were about
two or three teams

00:31:52.386 --> 00:31:54.260 align:middle line:84%
of scientists in California
who were studying

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:56.770 align:middle line:90%
this thing for a long time.

00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And then finally
discovered that it

00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:03.890 align:middle line:84%
creates an ever-so-slight
angle coming down here.

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:06.500 align:middle line:84%
The energy is transferred
from one circle to the next

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:09.810 align:middle line:84%
to the next, that causes
us to do this whole thing.

00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:11.660 align:middle line:84%
They've pretty much
figured it out.

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:19.125 align:middle line:84%
But there are other things
that have been coming forth

00:32:19.125 --> 00:32:25.120 align:middle line:84%
from it, that are even
more deeply intriguing.

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:27.010 align:middle line:84%
First of all, they
have discovered

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:30.052 align:middle line:84%
that the arcs that
are created this way,

00:32:30.052 --> 00:32:31.010 align:middle line:90%
there's five arcs here.

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:33.150 align:middle line:90%
I think there's this arc.

00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:35.940 align:middle line:84%
There's an arc that goes
this way and an arc that

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:36.790 align:middle line:90%
goes this way.

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:37.950 align:middle line:84%
There's an arc
that goes this way.

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:40.072 align:middle line:84%
And believe it or not, there's
an arc that goes that way.

00:32:40.072 --> 00:32:40.780 align:middle line:90%
It's an optical.

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:41.821 align:middle line:90%
It looks like it goes in.

00:32:41.821 --> 00:32:43.960 align:middle line:90%
It actually goes like that.

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:46.010 align:middle line:84%
So very long arc,
going like this.

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:47.340 align:middle line:90%
There's five arcs there.

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And these arcs, if
I've got them right,

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:51.840 align:middle line:84%
is the arc of the
surface of the moon,

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:54.250 align:middle line:84%
the arc of the
surface of the Earth,

00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:56.795 align:middle line:84%
the arc of the
surface of the Sun,

00:32:56.795 --> 00:33:00.460 align:middle line:84%
the arc the Moon makes
around the Earth,

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:03.960 align:middle line:84%
and the arc the Earth makes
around the Sun, all in this one

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:04.760 align:middle line:90%
object.

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:07.460 align:middle line:90%


00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:10.210 align:middle line:84%
Which is incredible
that should take place.

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And then they discovered that
in the way that it turns around,

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:17.720 align:middle line:84%
when it starts doing this
rocking motion like this,

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.890 align:middle line:84%
if you were to plot
with a computer,

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:23.181 align:middle line:84%
you would see this
thing doing like this.

00:33:23.181 --> 00:33:31.050 align:middle line:84%
It goes-- in this
pattern like this.

00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And when they've
mapped in any one

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:34.820 align:middle line:84%
of these individual
patterns, they

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:39.430 align:middle line:84%
found it to be absolutely
identical to the motion

00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:42.400 align:middle line:90%
that the Earth rocks on itself.

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:45.400 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if you put
a camera into the Southern

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:50.120 align:middle line:84%
Hemisphere, tied it down real
good, use one photographic film

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:54.170 align:middle line:84%
and took a photograph
once a week for a year,

00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:56.460 align:middle line:84%
you would get 52 little
dots on this one thing.

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's what shape
they would be in.

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.590 align:middle line:90%
There's a name for this.

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:03.290 align:middle line:84%
The sun appears to move in
the sky over a one-year period

00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:05.800 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.634 align:middle line:84%
It appears that way because
the precession of the equinoxes

00:34:08.634 --> 00:34:10.360 align:middle line:90%
and the rocking of the Earth.

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And the motion that
it turns around

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:19.310 align:middle line:84%
is identical to another cosmic
phenomena, exactly the same.

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:21.335 align:middle line:84%
And then recently,
they've done something

00:34:21.335 --> 00:34:23.460 align:middle line:84%
that they really don't
understand about this thing.

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:26.260 align:middle line:84%
He thought well, if
this is Noah's Ark,

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:28.790 align:middle line:90%
then let's test it in water.

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is the stuff
that's coming out

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:33.460 align:middle line:90%
in the last couple years.

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:37.570 align:middle line:84%
They made these 12, 14-feet
long or so, like this,

00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:38.570 align:middle line:90%
and put them in water.

00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:40.170 align:middle line:90%
And they discovered something.

00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:43.860 align:middle line:84%
First of all, whenever you
have something really, really

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:48.750 align:middle line:84%
primary, like in all your
mathematical sequences,

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:50.659 align:middle line:84%
you only need to
know three numbers.

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:52.159 align:middle line:84%
And you can know
the whole sequence.

00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:53.034 align:middle line:90%
Remember I said that?

00:34:53.034 --> 00:34:55.696 align:middle line:84%
On the Logarithmic Spiral,
you only need to know two.

00:34:55.696 --> 00:35:00.100 align:middle line:84%
You can calculate the
whole spiral from two.

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's the only
one in existence

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:05.190 align:middle line:84%
that they know of that
you can do that with,

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:08.790 align:middle line:90%
the Golden Mean Spiral.

00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And every boat that's in
the water has three vectors.

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:16.420 align:middle line:90%
It can move this way, this way.

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:18.371 align:middle line:90%
And it can rock like this.

00:35:18.371 --> 00:35:19.674 align:middle line:90%
This only has two.

00:35:19.674 --> 00:35:22.173 align:middle line:84%
There's one of those vectors--
I don't know which one it is.

00:35:22.173 --> 00:35:23.040 align:middle line:90%
It will not do it.

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.930 align:middle line:90%
You can't make it do it.

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:27.050 align:middle line:90%
It just simply won't do it.

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
reports that we got.

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And I have eyewitness people
that went out there and watched

00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:32.340 align:middle line:90%
all this stuff.

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And when they put
the boat in water

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:37.890 align:middle line:84%
and it goes through
water, it does something

00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:38.974 align:middle line:90%
no one's ever seen before.

00:35:38.974 --> 00:35:40.056 align:middle line:90%
And they can't explain it.

00:35:40.056 --> 00:35:40.960 align:middle line:90%
They don't know.

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:43.590 align:middle line:84%
But normally, if there's a
wave like this and the boat's

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:46.510 align:middle line:84%
coming, the wave will
just crash over the boat.

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:48.010 align:middle line:90%
This won't do that.

00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:50.080 align:middle line:84%
When this comes in,
the waves come in.

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.480 align:middle line:90%
This goes right around the wave.

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:53.710 align:middle line:90%
It does this motion.

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:57.560 align:middle line:84%
So when it's going through
water, it's going like this.

00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.500 align:middle line:84%
But what's weird
is, is the person

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:02.430 align:middle line:84%
who's in the boat
doesn't see a thing.

00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:06.900 align:middle line:84%
They feel that they're
going to have real smooth.

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:08.660 align:middle line:90%
They don't see anything at all.

00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:09.570 align:middle line:90%
They feel themselves.

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And so the first time someone
did, the people on the outside

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:12.750 align:middle line:90%
were going holy cow.

00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:14.817 align:middle line:90%
And the guy calmly got back in.

00:36:14.817 --> 00:36:15.650 align:middle line:90%
Well, that was nice.

00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:17.858 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, well, you were
going all over the place.

00:36:17.858 --> 00:36:19.527 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, no I wasn't.

00:36:19.527 --> 00:36:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And so they had to put a video
before they even convinced him.

00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:24.150 align:middle line:84%
It was like, see
the thing going on.

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, the person in there,
they can't believe it, I guess.

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:31.780 align:middle line:84%
So who knows what's going on
and what laws are happening?

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:33.780 align:middle line:90%
This is so unique.

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, with all this work and
all this stuff, and everybody's

00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:38.433 align:middle line:84%
trying to figure out what
this thing is all about,

00:36:38.433 --> 00:36:39.430 align:middle line:90%
I had a man come here.

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:40.590 align:middle line:90%
His name was Brad Smith.

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And he makes sacred
geometry toys.

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:45.799 align:middle line:90%


00:36:45.799 --> 00:36:48.090 align:middle line:84%
If you ever get any of his
toys, man-- he's got a toy--

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:48.923 align:middle line:90%
>>What was his name?

00:36:48.923 --> 00:36:50.840 align:middle line:90%
>>Brad Smith.

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:57.190 align:middle line:84%
He's got a cube
that's about this big.

00:36:57.190 --> 00:37:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And it opens up and
there's perfectly smoothly

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.970 align:middle line:90%
fit in here is all these toys.

00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:04.940 align:middle line:90%
And you pull one out.

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And the toy unfolds into all
these sacred geometry forms.

00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:10.170 align:middle line:84%
It changes color and comes
back and forms other shapes.

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:13.522 align:middle line:84%
He's got a cube that turns
into a perfect sphere

00:37:13.522 --> 00:37:14.707 align:middle line:90%
and back into a cube again.

00:37:14.707 --> 00:37:16.082 align:middle line:84%
There's all these
different ones.

00:37:16.082 --> 00:37:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And then the whole thing,
it's all the information

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.040 align:middle line:90%
all in toys.

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And the whole thing will
fit back into there.

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.990 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:23.942 align:middle line:90%
It's an adult toy.

00:37:23.942 --> 00:37:27.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I spent all
day on this thing.

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:28.810 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't leave.

00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:29.610 align:middle line:90%
Wow!

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:31.160 align:middle line:90%
Look at this one.

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.250 align:middle line:84%
So he'll have one
of these things.

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:34.050 align:middle line:90%
And you open it up.

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:36.232 align:middle line:84%
And it'll turn into
an icosahedron.

00:37:36.232 --> 00:37:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And you turn it in
another way, and it'll

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:40.144 align:middle line:90%
become some other polyhedron.

00:37:40.144 --> 00:37:42.514 align:middle line:90%
>>Does he sell those things?

00:37:42.514 --> 00:37:45.516 align:middle line:84%
>>He sold the whole process to
Mattel or someone like that.

00:37:45.516 --> 00:37:46.390 align:middle line:90%
[DISAPPOINTED GROANS]

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:51.914 align:middle line:84%
And who knows how long it'll
take before it gets out?

00:37:51.914 --> 00:37:53.080 align:middle line:90%
It's been several years now.

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:54.700 align:middle line:84%
It's been three or four years,
and it's still not happened.

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:55.981 align:middle line:90%
>>Where?

00:37:55.981 --> 00:37:58.660 align:middle line:90%
>>He's in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:01.390 align:middle line:90%


00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:04.649 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, Brad came
to the workshop

00:38:04.649 --> 00:38:05.940 align:middle line:90%
and got all excited about this.

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:08.040 align:middle line:84%
Because he knew about
sacred geometry.

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:11.710 align:middle line:84%
But he didn't know about
the Flower of Life,

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:13.710 align:middle line:84%
and how the Flower of
Life tied it all together.

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And so he was really
excited about it.

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And he went and
he saw this form.

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:18.410 align:middle line:90%
He's really into shape.

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:18.890 align:middle line:90%
And he saw this form.

00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:19.690 align:middle line:90%
And he went back.

00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well, this is
obviously a sacred shape.

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.210 align:middle line:90%
It must be the Flower of Life.

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:25.970 align:middle line:90%
And he found it.

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:30.489 align:middle line:84%
He found the precise
location inside this pattern.

00:38:30.489 --> 00:38:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Of course, these look like
these little boats in there.

00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:36.130 align:middle line:84%
But that's not
exactly where it is.

00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:37.890 align:middle line:84%
But there's a very
precise place.

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:39.640 align:middle line:84%
Here's the hidden
pattern underneath here,

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:41.280 align:middle line:90%
with these broken lines.

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And the flower, the
6 to 1, 10 to 1 ratio

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:47.500 align:middle line:84%
is right here, located
in between the petals.

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Here's one here and
in between here.

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:52.200 align:middle line:84%
There's a ratio that's
located in between there.

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:56.740 align:middle line:84%
And it describes
the arc perfectly.

00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And so anyway, now, what Edmund
Scientific has just discovered

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:05.350 align:middle line:84%
is that now,
everybody's studying

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:08.490 align:middle line:84%
these things further
is that they now

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:14.245 align:middle line:84%
have found out that these things
occur naturally in nature.

00:39:14.245 --> 00:39:19.160 align:middle line:84%
That nature carves these
things out with river rocks.

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:22.030 align:middle line:84%
That there are rocks
are formed in water

00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:23.210 align:middle line:90%
that come out this shape.

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:26.505 align:middle line:84%
Though usually the
ends are worn off more.

00:39:26.505 --> 00:39:28.630 align:middle line:84%
But you put these rocks
down, they'll spin one way.

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:30.254 align:middle line:84%
And the other way
they'll rock and come

00:39:30.254 --> 00:39:33.350 align:middle line:84%
back around again, without
man even touching a thing.

00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:36.290 align:middle line:90%


00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:37.980 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now we get
back to the thing

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:42.450 align:middle line:84%
about there being two
one arm 180 degrees off

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:43.250 align:middle line:90%
from the other one.

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:46.220 align:middle line:90%


00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:48.870 align:middle line:84%
There's really two spirals
in here and not just one.

00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:52.470 align:middle line:84%
So if you plot two
spirals, like nature shows,

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:59.000 align:middle line:84%
180 degrees off, what you'll get
is two equilateral triangles.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.120 align:middle line:10%
Which, of course, are
really two tetrahedrons,

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:06.860 align:middle line:10%
which is a star tetrahedron
inscribed perfectly

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:09.130 align:middle line:10%
in a sphere.

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:12.460 align:middle line:84%
Which as we will see later,
is the mathematical message

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:14.670 align:middle line:90%
of Cydonia on Mars.

00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's also the message
that's been coming up

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:20.480 align:middle line:84%
for the last couple years
on the crop circles.

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:24.320 align:middle line:84%
Precisely, mathematically, it
has been a star tetrahedron

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:28.010 align:middle line:84%
inscribed in a sphere, which
is the key to the Merkaba,

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:31.825 align:middle line:84%
or to the inter-dimensional
time space and the harmonics.

00:40:31.825 --> 00:40:36.190 align:middle line:90%


00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:41.010 align:middle line:84%
There is a star that will fit
perfectly inside of that one.

00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And there is a sphere that
will fit perfectly inside

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:48.250 align:middle line:90%
of the original hexagon.

00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to take that
one that fits inside of there

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:56.880 align:middle line:84%
and place it on each
one of these points

00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:59.040 align:middle line:84%
all the way around
there, what you

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:02.150 align:middle line:90%
would have is the fruit of life.

00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:05.270 align:middle line:90%


00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:09.660 align:middle line:10%
And so remember that's
one of the sacred forms

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:18.150 align:middle line:10%
that we first showed how by
connecting all the centers

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:21.700 align:middle line:10%
together, we came up with
the sacred shapes that

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:25.790 align:middle line:10%
were the basis of
structure in the reality.

00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:28.750 align:middle line:10%
But by not connecting
the centers together

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:31.860 align:middle line:10%
like we did here, but rather
by concentric circles that

00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:35.250 align:middle line:10%
are formed off of the
patterns, and by radial lines

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:38.860 align:middle line:10%
that come out from the center
forming the polar graph,

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:41.160 align:middle line:10%
we came up with all
this information

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:44.270 align:middle line:10%
that we had just looked at,
of the relationship of sound

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:46.125 align:middle line:10%
and light, and shape
and things that

00:41:46.125 --> 00:41:50.105 align:middle line:10%
were formed through this, the
harmonics of music and sound.

00:41:50.105 --> 00:41:51.980 align:middle line:84%
So I could have done it
the other way around.

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:53.420 align:middle line:84%
I could reverse all
the slides and say, OK,

00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:54.360 align:middle line:84%
we're starting with
here and now we're

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:55.460 align:middle line:90%
going to go the other way.

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:56.270 align:middle line:90%
But that isn't how I got it.

00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:57.810 align:middle line:90%
So that's how I gave it to you.

00:41:57.810 --> 00:42:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And so what you've just
seen is another one

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:04.730 align:middle line:84%
of the informational systems,
another way of superimposing

00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:09.230 align:middle line:84%
male energy over the female
energy, radio lines coming out.

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I've just
scratched the surface

00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:14.530 align:middle line:90%
just a little tiny bit.

00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:19.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we did not go into
depth of what it means,

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:23.630 align:middle line:84%
of what the harmonics
of sound means

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:27.310 align:middle line:84%
relative to one of these things,
or light or anything else.

00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:28.750 align:middle line:90%
We haven't deeply gone into it.

00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:30.166 align:middle line:84%
We've just shown
the relationship.

00:42:30.166 --> 00:42:32.670 align:middle line:90%


00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And there probably
are, I believe,

00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:39.680 align:middle line:84%
10 other sequences that
are associated with this.

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:40.970 align:middle line:90%
This is my belief.

00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:45.320 align:middle line:84%
10 and possibly 11 that
are associated with it.

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't even looked
into those areas either.

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:51.590 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm just looking.

00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:53.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm just skimming
along the surface here,

00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:54.340 align:middle line:90%
is all we're doing.

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:57.480 align:middle line:84%
>>What does it mean, that boat
that turns one way and not

00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.260 align:middle line:90%
the other way?

00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:05.060 align:middle line:84%
Does it relate to something
about the Merkaba?

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>>When you go into
the forest, you'll

00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:11.360 align:middle line:84%
see that if there's
a vortex coming out

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:13.770 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth that is
rotating clockwise,

00:43:13.770 --> 00:43:16.000 align:middle line:90%
it'll kill everything in it.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.140 align:middle line:84%
You'll go and just walk
through the forest.

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:20.570 align:middle line:90%
And be observant and watch.

00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:22.300 align:middle line:90%
And you'll see these spots.

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:25.350 align:middle line:84%
They could be anywhere from
the size of maybe this big,

00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:27.430 align:middle line:84%
to usually not much
bigger than this room.

00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:28.455 align:middle line:90%
Though there are some.

00:43:28.455 --> 00:43:30.580 align:middle line:84%
There's one in California,
called the Mystery Spot.

00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:33.975 align:middle line:90%
Anybody seen that one?

00:43:33.975 --> 00:43:34.897 align:middle line:90%
That's a big one.

00:43:34.897 --> 00:43:36.280 align:middle line:90%
>>Where is it?

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.462 align:middle line:90%
>>Two city blocks around.

00:43:38.462 --> 00:43:40.032 align:middle line:90%
>>Where is it?

00:43:40.032 --> 00:43:41.240 align:middle line:90%
>>If you've never been there.

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:43.450 align:middle line:90%
I highly recommend you go there.

00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:45.760 align:middle line:84%
Highly, highly, highly,
highly recommend you go there.

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:46.650 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:43:46.650 --> 00:43:47.095 align:middle line:90%
>>Where?

00:43:47.095 --> 00:43:48.025 align:middle line:90%
>>Where?

00:43:48.025 --> 00:43:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, it's near
San Jose, California.

00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:53.390 align:middle line:90%
Santa Cruz.

00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:55.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, Santa
Cruz, California.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:59.230 align:middle line:90%


00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:01.450 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, going
through the forest,

00:44:01.450 --> 00:44:03.860 align:middle line:84%
you'll see them
rotating this way.

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:04.950 align:middle line:90%
And it'll kill everything.

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:07.220 align:middle line:84%
If you see them
going the other way,

00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:09.300 align:middle line:84%
you'll still see the
distortion in things.

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:11.345 align:middle line:90%
But they'll be real alive.

00:44:11.345 --> 00:44:13.400 align:middle line:90%
They'll be super alive.

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:17.820 align:middle line:84%
But if the field
vortex goes clockwise,

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:19.930 align:middle line:84%
everything in it--
all the plant life,

00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:21.320 align:middle line:84%
everything else like
that-- will just be barren.

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:22.180 align:middle line:90%
It'll be dead.

00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:23.555 align:middle line:84%
There won't be
anything in there.

00:44:23.555 --> 00:44:25.420 align:middle line:84%
There won't even be
bugs in there, nothing.

00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:28.450 align:middle line:84%
Everything gets
out of that place.

00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:35.280 align:middle line:84%
The one in Santa Cruz is
rotating counterclockwise.

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's slightly
tilted at an angle.

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:40.850 align:middle line:84%
It's coming out of the
Earth so it's like this.

00:44:40.850 --> 00:44:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And you can really
study these things.

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:45.100 align:middle line:90%
They are so clear and sharp.

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:46.240 align:middle line:90%
It's like a piece of glass.

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:48.170 align:middle line:90%
It's like a glass wall.

00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And you go there and
they have a board.

00:44:50.110 --> 00:44:51.910 align:middle line:90%
They say, OK, here's the vortex.

00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:53.580 align:middle line:90%
It starts right there.

00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:55.170 align:middle line:90%
And they're not kidding.

00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:57.620 align:middle line:84%
They have this flat
board that's on there.

00:44:57.620 --> 00:45:00.320 align:middle line:90%
And they got a level on there.

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:03.850 align:middle line:84%
So you can see that the
board is absolutely flat.

00:45:03.850 --> 00:45:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And they'll gladly let
you bring your own level

00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:09.772 align:middle line:84%
and put it on there to check
that that board is flat.

00:45:09.772 --> 00:45:10.959 align:middle line:90%
It's a little platform.

00:45:10.959 --> 00:45:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And the line right
through the middle of it

00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:15.124 align:middle line:84%
where the vortex ends, on one
side, you're in the vortex.

00:45:15.124 --> 00:45:16.375 align:middle line:90%
In the other side, you're not.

00:45:16.375 --> 00:45:18.165 align:middle line:84%
And you can get two
people the same height.

00:45:18.165 --> 00:45:19.030 align:middle line:90%
And you get on this.

00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And the other person
gets on the other side.

00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:22.440 align:middle line:90%
And you look at each other.

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:26.104 align:middle line:84%
And the one in the vortex-- I
can't remember which way it is.

00:45:26.104 --> 00:45:28.395 align:middle line:84%
But I'll just say-- I think
it's the one in the vortex.

00:45:28.395 --> 00:45:31.558 align:middle line:90%


00:45:31.558 --> 00:45:34.057 align:middle line:90%
Which was is it?

00:45:34.057 --> 00:45:36.390 align:middle line:84%
I think the one in the vortex,
you looked at the person.

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And they appear to be somewhere
between four and six inches

00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:41.280 align:middle line:90%
taller.

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.565 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you go like that.

00:45:43.565 --> 00:45:44.690 align:middle line:90%
And then you switch around.

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:45.490 align:middle line:90%
You turn around.

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:48.966 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, you're
looking down at this guy.

00:45:48.966 --> 00:45:50.140 align:middle line:90%
And it's incredible.

00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:50.900 align:middle line:90%
And you can do it all you want.

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:52.233 align:middle line:90%
And you check this little thing.

00:45:52.233 --> 00:45:53.270 align:middle line:90%
And you get back on it.

00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And you're only just,
like, a foot apart.

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And yet, you really do
appear to be a lot smaller.

00:45:58.550 --> 00:46:01.430 align:middle line:84%
You appear to be
bigger and looking down

00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:02.585 align:middle line:90%
at the other person.

00:46:02.585 --> 00:46:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And when you go
in there, you can

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:07.050 align:middle line:84%
see all these trees,
just twisted around,

00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:08.830 align:middle line:90%
growing in these big spirals.

00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:09.740 align:middle line:90%
Everything in there.

00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And they got rooms in there
where you roll a ball,

00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:14.310 align:middle line:90%
and it goes uphill.

00:46:14.310 --> 00:46:16.720 align:middle line:84%
There's all this weird
stuff inside these things.

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:19.620 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a distortion of the
magnetic fields and everything

00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:21.920 align:middle line:90%
that's going on inside.

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:23.420 align:middle line:90%
It's a pretty interesting place.

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:24.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:27.046 align:middle line:90%


00:46:27.046 --> 00:46:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>>In terms of
spinning the energy

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:30.437 align:middle line:84%
fields clockwise and
counterclockwise,

00:46:30.437 --> 00:46:32.520 align:middle line:84%
what is the relationship
to what you've just said,

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:33.320 align:middle line:90%
in the forest?

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, if you spin the
energy fields clockwise--

00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:40.320 align:middle line:84%
if you spin them
counterclockwise-- no, let's

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:41.220 align:middle line:90%
put it this way.

00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:43.137 align:middle line:84%
It isn't which way
you're spinning.

00:46:43.137 --> 00:46:44.470 align:middle line:90%
It's that you've got two fields.

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:47.380 align:middle line:84%
You've got one going this
way and one going this way.

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:49.200 align:middle line:84%
What life has found
is the one that's

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:51.920 align:middle line:84%
going that way has
to be spinning faster

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:54.220 align:middle line:90%
than the one spinning this way.

00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And it needs to be spinning
Fibonacci ratio faster.

00:46:59.810 --> 00:47:02.507 align:middle line:84%
So you can't have
them equal speed.

00:47:02.507 --> 00:47:04.340 align:middle line:84%
That is one that you
can do, is equal speed.

00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:06.560 align:middle line:90%
And that won't do anything.

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:10.599 align:middle line:84%
But usually what life does,
is if this one's going 21,

00:47:10.599 --> 00:47:12.140 align:middle line:84%
then this one's
going to be going 34.

00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:13.800 align:middle line:90%
This one's going 3.

00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And this one's going
to have to go 5.

00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And if you do that, then that's
a ratio that life has found

00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:20.310 align:middle line:90%
works.

00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And life thrives
in that situation.

00:47:23.050 --> 00:47:24.780 align:middle line:90%
It just thrives in it.

00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:27.237 align:middle line:84%
And if you do that, you get
those kind of fields growing

00:47:27.237 --> 00:47:29.320 align:middle line:84%
around, where there's
plants and things like that,

00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:30.120 align:middle line:90%
they just go crazy.

00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:31.030 align:middle line:90%
They love it.

00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:32.780 align:middle line:84%
But if you reverse
it going around,

00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:34.970 align:middle line:84%
if you increase the
speed of this one--

00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:37.610 align:middle line:84%
see the difference is--
just so you get this clear--

00:47:37.610 --> 00:47:39.400 align:middle line:84%
say this one's
going 21 this way.

00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And this one's
going 34 that way.

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:44.480 align:middle line:90%
The difference is 13.

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:47.480 align:middle line:84%
So even though you've got
two fields going like this,

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:48.850 align:middle line:90%
the difference is 13.

00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And so you have this
overall slow rotational

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:57.700 align:middle line:84%
field of the entire structure
going counterclockwise.

00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:00.280 align:middle line:84%
This is the reason why
all the planets, which

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:03.012 align:middle line:84%
all have these Merkabas
rotating around them--

00:48:03.012 --> 00:48:04.720 align:middle line:84%
with the exception of
one that they think

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:08.210 align:middle line:84%
has been hit by another planet--
all the planets are rotating

00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:10.960 align:middle line:90%
counterclockwise.

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:14.510 align:middle line:84%
Because the Merkaba is
rotating over speed.

00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:17.100 align:middle line:84%
That planet that's rotating
the other way on there,

00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:18.780 align:middle line:84%
I'll betcha when they
get to it, they're

00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:21.440 align:middle line:84%
not going to find any
life on that planet.

00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:23.480 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be a
super, super dead planet.

00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:24.938 align:middle line:84%
>>Does that mean
that you shouldn't

00:48:24.938 --> 00:48:28.360 align:middle line:90%
spin a single field clockwise?

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:32.050 align:middle line:84%
>>If you did, and if
you spun a single field

00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:35.680 align:middle line:84%
clockwise for very long, you
would start getting very sick.

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:36.480 align:middle line:90%
And you would die.

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:39.820 align:middle line:90%


00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:49.060 align:middle line:84%
I'll just quickly
tell you what happened

00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:52.085 align:middle line:84%
the first time-- I talked
about this to somebody here.

00:48:52.085 --> 00:48:54.210 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think I talked
about this to the group.

00:48:54.210 --> 00:48:57.110 align:middle line:90%
Just to you, right?

00:48:57.110 --> 00:49:00.460 align:middle line:84%
There's an advance workshop
on this, which I'm not

00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:02.150 align:middle line:90%
allowed to give right now.

00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:03.325 align:middle line:90%
I gave it three times.

00:49:03.325 --> 00:49:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And maybe I'll be able
to give it in the future.

00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's how to join groups
together in a Merkaba.

00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And I had a group in
Colorado, about 20 people.

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:14.970 align:middle line:90%
And we were sitting there.

00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And it was the very first
time I'd ever done it.

00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:21.540 align:middle line:90%
And so I was learning.

00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:23.290 align:middle line:90%
And it's very complex patterns.

00:49:23.290 --> 00:49:25.030 align:middle line:84%
You're not using
just this one here.

00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:28.460 align:middle line:84%
You're using a series of
other geometrical patterns

00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:30.240 align:middle line:90%
that are out around the body.

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And you're spitting
some of them one way,

00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:34.540 align:middle line:84%
and some of them the other
way, and some one way.

00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:37.187 align:middle line:84%
And the overall speeds is
what creates the pattern.

00:49:37.187 --> 00:49:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And they have to be phase
locked and all the stuff

00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:43.060 align:middle line:84%
you have to do with them
to get this pattern going.

00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And so I got the start by
creating the original Merkaba

00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:48.510 align:middle line:90%
that we learned here.

00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:49.540 align:middle line:90%
So we all did that.

00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:50.373 align:middle line:90%
We created that one.

00:49:50.373 --> 00:49:53.140 align:middle line:84%
Then we created one for the
group, which was down there.

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And then I had to switch to a
different geometrical shape,

00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:57.610 align:middle line:90%
which was to go this way.

00:49:57.610 --> 00:49:58.480 align:middle line:90%
And I did that.

00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:00.220 align:middle line:90%
And I got it going this way.

00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:03.700 align:middle line:84%
So I had the overall effect
of the Merkaba of the group

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:05.350 align:middle line:90%
rotating clockwise.

00:50:05.350 --> 00:50:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And they told me when I did
this that you have to do that.

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:10.330 align:middle line:84%
But do it real quickly
and get into the next one.

00:50:10.330 --> 00:50:13.179 align:middle line:84%
So that even though you go
counterclockwise for a moment,

00:50:13.179 --> 00:50:15.470 align:middle line:84%
you just stay there for a
moment and immediately switch

00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:16.670 align:middle line:90%
to the other one.

00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I created the one
going this way for a moment,

00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:21.400 align:middle line:90%
I forgot how to do it.

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:23.860 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't remember
the exact speed.

00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:25.840 align:middle line:90%
And it's a little complicated.

00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't remember
exactly how to do it.

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:31.275 align:middle line:84%
So I was sitting there
going, ah, let's see--

00:50:31.275 --> 00:50:35.080 align:middle line:84%
and in that little
ah, let's see,

00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:37.925 align:middle line:84%
we were sitting in a clear
blue sky with everything

00:50:37.925 --> 00:50:40.140 align:middle line:90%
was absolutely calm outside.

00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:41.520 align:middle line:90%
And the wind took up.

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And it started going, a
counterclockwise wind.

00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:45.950 align:middle line:90%
And it started going faster.

00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And in about the
30 seconds which

00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:49.520 align:middle line:84%
it took for me to
do that, it went

00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:52.160 align:middle line:84%
from totally calm to
the trees were bent

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.710 align:middle line:84%
over like this,
ready to break off,

00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:55.237 align:middle line:84%
and garbage cancer were
flying through the air

00:50:55.237 --> 00:50:56.487 align:middle line:90%
and everything else like that.

00:50:56.487 --> 00:50:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And everybody in the rooms,
their eyes are about this big.

00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:02.637 align:middle line:90%
With my eyes about that big.

00:51:02.637 --> 00:51:03.720 align:middle line:90%
Let's see how you do this.

00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:07.000 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And I finally go, OK,
OK, OK, OK, I got it.

00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:09.310 align:middle line:90%
I got it.

00:51:09.310 --> 00:51:09.480 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:10.520 align:middle line:90%
And we told them what to do.

00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:11.145 align:middle line:90%
And we all went phew!

00:51:11.145 --> 00:51:12.686 align:middle line:84%
And we got this
thing going this way.

00:51:12.686 --> 00:51:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And instantly, all
the trees went whew!

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:16.248 align:middle line:90%
Just like that.

00:51:16.248 --> 00:51:17.215 align:middle line:90%
Just like that.

00:51:17.215 --> 00:51:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And I really learned
an incredible lesson.

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:23.470 align:middle line:84%
And one of the scientists
I was with saw that.

00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:25.310 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, wow.

00:51:25.310 --> 00:51:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And so he went back to his
lab and set up electronically,

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:36.700 align:middle line:84%
using a holographic sound, the
fields that we had created,

00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:39.060 align:middle line:84%
and got to that stage
where we had done it at.

00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And he just left it going
to see what would happen.

00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And on an absolute
clear day in Colorado,

00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:50.160 align:middle line:84%
with no clouds or anything,
within a few minutes,

00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:52.730 align:middle line:84%
a black funnel that you
couldn't even see through

00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:57.520 align:middle line:84%
formed about a mile above it and
came right down to the thing.

00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:59.760 align:middle line:84%
You could stand outside
and see this huge thing

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:02.220 align:middle line:84%
coming right down to it,
right down to a thing.

00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:04.130 align:middle line:84%
We obviously turned
this baby off.

00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:07.120 align:middle line:90%


00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:08.510 align:middle line:90%
But life cannot live.

00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:10.015 align:middle line:90%
It's the destructive force.

00:52:10.015 --> 00:52:14.724 align:middle line:90%
It's the force that destroys us.

00:52:14.724 --> 00:52:16.700 align:middle line:90%
>>Is that like [INAUDIBLE]?

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:21.640 align:middle line:90%


00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:23.540 align:middle line:84%
>>She says, so a
clock goes clockwise.

00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:25.490 align:middle line:90%
So it's like, dying.

00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:26.320 align:middle line:90%
That's very good.

00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:29.330 align:middle line:90%


00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:30.130 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:52:30.130 --> 00:52:32.290 align:middle line:84%
It's much more complex
than that though.

00:52:32.290 --> 00:52:37.410 align:middle line:84%
Because you see, when a physical
object is rotating clockwise,

00:52:37.410 --> 00:52:39.253 align:middle line:84%
the energy lines are
going counterclockwise.

00:52:39.253 --> 00:52:41.856 align:middle line:90%


00:52:41.856 --> 00:52:45.422 align:middle line:84%
And so when you start really
thinking about all this stuff,

00:52:45.422 --> 00:52:48.670 align:middle line:84%
it's like rubbing your hand
and patting your belly.

00:52:48.670 --> 00:52:50.580 align:middle line:90%
It's more complex.

00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:52.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>>With the Sufi
dervishes, I mean,

00:52:55.770 --> 00:52:57.070 align:middle line:90%
I've watched them on stage.

00:52:57.070 --> 00:52:59.950 align:middle line:84%
They all seem to be
spinning the same speed.

00:52:59.950 --> 00:53:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard them say
how to do it and tried it.

00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And you're trying to spin
out of 3D, evidently.

00:53:06.330 --> 00:53:08.850 align:middle line:84%
But they don't give you
a whole lot of details.

00:53:08.850 --> 00:53:11.110 align:middle line:90%
What actually is going on?

00:53:11.110 --> 00:53:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, you're talking about
the Mevlana Foundation,

00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:14.770 align:middle line:90%
of Reshad Feild's?

00:53:14.770 --> 00:53:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Is this what you're
talking about?

00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:53:15.830 --> 00:53:18.084 align:middle line:90%
Well no, not necessarily Reshad.

00:53:18.084 --> 00:53:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>>But you saw this
in the United States?

00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:21.970 align:middle line:84%
>>Yes, I saw them performing
in the United States.

00:53:21.970 --> 00:53:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And I forget what
we tried it with.

00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:31.295 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, I believe that they
are moving counterclockwise.

00:53:31.295 --> 00:53:33.545 align:middle line:84%
Because they're duplicating
the motion of the planets.

00:53:33.545 --> 00:53:36.440 align:middle line:90%


00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:39.890 align:middle line:90%
Isn't this what they're doing?

00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:41.374 align:middle line:84%
>>The only part I
could remember is

00:53:41.374 --> 00:53:43.140 align:middle line:84%
you have to keep
your one arm up.

00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:43.240 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:44.480 align:middle line:84%
What they do, is
they're watching

00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:46.640 align:middle line:84%
their hand as they're moving,
so they don't get dizzy.

00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.056 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, you're
watching your hand.

00:53:48.056 --> 00:53:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And you do get this
sense of going up.

00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>>It's a very, very
powerful, powerful thing just

00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:55.600 align:middle line:84%
to watch it, just to be
in the experience of it.

00:53:55.600 --> 00:54:00.525 align:middle line:84%
But even thought I was
friends with Reshad for awhile

00:54:00.525 --> 00:54:03.030 align:middle line:84%
and all that stuff--
I've sat right in here

00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:05.007 align:middle line:84%
and watched them do
this-- I've never done it.

00:54:05.007 --> 00:54:07.274 align:middle line:84%
So I can't tell you
what the experience is.

00:54:07.274 --> 00:54:08.130 align:middle line:90%
>>But are they?

00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:14.130 align:middle line:84%
>>I don't believe that they
truly understand the Merkaba.

00:54:14.130 --> 00:54:16.120 align:middle line:84%
I think that what
they are doing is

00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:21.260 align:middle line:84%
trying to replicate or
duplicate planetary motion

00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:25.570 align:middle line:84%
and cosmic motions, which
are Merkaba in nature.

00:54:25.570 --> 00:54:28.680 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think
that they truly

00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:35.036 align:middle line:84%
understand the hidden nature
behind what they're doing.

00:54:35.036 --> 00:54:36.160 align:middle line:90%
Though I may be wrong.

00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:37.350 align:middle line:90%
But I don't think so.

00:54:37.350 --> 00:54:40.040 align:middle line:84%
Because I know a
lot of those people.

00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And they're not taught
any of that stuff.

00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:46.760 align:middle line:84%
>>But they also
don't talk about it.

00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:53.205 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's only taught by
very high dervishes, evidently.

00:54:53.205 --> 00:54:57.400 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, maybe so.

00:54:57.400 --> 00:55:00.179 align:middle line:90%
But I don't think so.

00:55:00.179 --> 00:55:01.220 align:middle line:90%
>>Somethings [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:04.615 align:middle line:90%


00:55:04.615 --> 00:55:06.960 align:middle line:84%
>>No, I understand
what you're saying.

00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:08.380 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, it's
just my opinion.

00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:10.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
they know about that.

00:55:10.050 --> 00:55:11.466 align:middle line:84%
I don't think
anybody in the world

00:55:11.466 --> 00:55:13.910 align:middle line:84%
knows about it, with the
exception of one group.

00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:15.920 align:middle line:90%
And that's the Tibetans.

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And they won't talk
about hardly at all.

00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:19.670 align:middle line:84%
They're the only
ones that have been

00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:23.640 align:middle line:90%
able to truly demonstrate it.

00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:28.900 align:middle line:84%
Though the American Indians
are almost aware of it.

00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:31.530 align:middle line:84%
When you're ask them about it,
they can remember pieces of it.

00:55:31.530 --> 00:55:34.895 align:middle line:84%
They did have memory at one
point, like the Mayans also.

00:55:34.895 --> 00:55:38.210 align:middle line:84%
They call this little hole
up here the air window.

00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:40.686 align:middle line:84%
They have an American-Indian
name for the breathing

00:55:40.686 --> 00:55:42.170 align:middle line:90%
through the top of the head.

00:55:42.170 --> 00:55:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm sorry, weren't
the Native Americans

00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:45.910 align:middle line:84%
trying to do that
in the Ghost Dance,

00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:49.670 align:middle line:84%
so they would disappear
from the whites?

00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:50.470 align:middle line:90%
>>Could be.

00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:51.520 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:55.120 align:middle line:90%
I don't what that's about.

00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>>Because you know,
they were supposed

00:55:56.980 --> 00:55:58.900 align:middle line:90%
to be impervious to the bullets.

00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And they were going to join all
those who had already gone on.

00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And they were supposed to
pass into another dimension.

00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:09.750 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, there's a lot to that.

00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And that I do know from direct
experience, that that's real.

00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:14.959 align:middle line:90%


00:56:14.959 --> 00:56:17.500 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know what they were
doing because I wasn't there,

00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:18.958 align:middle line:84%
or what they were
attempting to do.

00:56:18.958 --> 00:56:22.330 align:middle line:84%
But in that same group
that we were working with,

00:56:22.330 --> 00:56:27.310 align:middle line:84%
what I was just talking
about, we had taken a tape.

00:56:27.310 --> 00:56:28.660 align:middle line:90%
I told her about this too.

00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:33.860 align:middle line:84%
We had taken a cassette tape
and programmed the speed ratios

00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:36.180 align:middle line:84%
in holographic sound,
which would take us

00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:41.080 align:middle line:84%
to the threshold
of this experience,

00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:44.190 align:middle line:84%
and then take us right to the
edge, where we could begin

00:56:44.190 --> 00:56:46.190 align:middle line:90%
to experience the interface.

00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:49.470 align:middle line:90%
That's what this tape had done.

00:56:49.470 --> 00:56:51.950 align:middle line:90%
We knew what was on the tape.

00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:54.384 align:middle line:84%
And so that was to
make sure that we

00:56:54.384 --> 00:56:56.425 align:middle line:84%
didn't go any further or
anything else like that.

00:56:56.425 --> 00:56:57.450 align:middle line:90%
And we put the tape in.

00:56:57.450 --> 00:57:00.030 align:middle line:90%
And we all did this experience.

00:57:00.030 --> 00:57:02.330 align:middle line:84%
That mistake thing I did was
one of the practice runs.

00:57:02.330 --> 00:57:04.120 align:middle line:84%
But at one point, we
had all got ready.

00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:05.500 align:middle line:90%
And we knew what we were doing.

00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:06.420 align:middle line:90%
We put this tape in.

00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And we were going
to take this up

00:57:07.050 --> 00:57:09.600 align:middle line:84%
to the threshold, where we
could look around a little bit

00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:12.140 align:middle line:84%
and see what some
of the stuff was.

00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:13.500 align:middle line:90%
Only God had a different idea.

00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:17.470 align:middle line:84%
And I still don't know what
the whole thing was about it.

00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:19.545 align:middle line:84%
It started going up
to the cycles though.

00:57:19.545 --> 00:57:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And it gets very,
very high cycles.

00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And the spinning ratio is
just going, (INCREASING PITCH)

00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:26.310 align:middle line:90%
way, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah!

00:57:26.310 --> 00:57:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And it got up to this one
where we were supposed to stop.

00:57:29.410 --> 00:57:32.780 align:middle line:84%
The tape kept going (HIGH
PITCH) wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.

00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:35.030 align:middle line:84%
It kept going higher and
higher and higher and higher.

00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And I looked over
at this other guy.

00:57:36.310 --> 00:57:37.143 align:middle line:90%
And he looked at me.

00:57:37.143 --> 00:57:38.560 align:middle line:90%
And we were all going, holy cow!

00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:39.000 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.083 align:middle line:90%
It's not even on the tape.

00:57:40.083 --> 00:57:41.640 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And finally, we realized we
were being taken somewhere.

00:57:44.970 --> 00:57:46.380 align:middle line:90%
We didn't have any choice.

00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:48.200 align:middle line:90%
It was just taking us somewhere.

00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:49.770 align:middle line:90%
And so we all just held on.

00:57:49.770 --> 00:57:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And I was just wondering
where we were going.

00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:52.540 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon, we
popped out into this kind

00:57:54.590 --> 00:57:56.670 align:middle line:90%
of a white foggy place.

00:57:56.670 --> 00:58:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And there were all these Anasazi
Indians there, lots of them.

00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And they came right
up to our group.

00:58:04.790 --> 00:58:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And the group all could
talk about this later.

00:58:09.870 --> 00:58:13.700 align:middle line:90%
They said, who are you?

00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:15.245 align:middle line:90%
And we said, who are you?

00:58:15.245 --> 00:58:19.300 align:middle line:90%


00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And we were right
near Mesa Verde,

00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:25.125 align:middle line:84%
when we were doing this, which
is where the Anasazis were.

00:58:25.125 --> 00:58:26.500 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know who they were.

00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And they said that
they were the Anasazi.

00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:33.882 align:middle line:90%
And they looked at us.

00:58:33.882 --> 00:58:35.840 align:middle line:84%
They said that we were
the first white men that

00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:39.880 align:middle line:90%
had ever been in this place.

00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And at first they
were real protective

00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:49.490 align:middle line:84%
and they were asking
us a bunch of things.

00:58:49.490 --> 00:58:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And there's something
I can't tell

00:58:52.970 --> 00:58:55.960 align:middle line:84%
you having to do with a crystal
he was holding in his hand.

00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:57.920 align:middle line:90%
But I knew what the crystal was.

00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And when I looked at the
crystal and I say it,

00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:04.142 align:middle line:84%
and I knew what it was, I
told him what the crystal was.

00:59:04.142 --> 00:59:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And when I told him
what the crystal was,

00:59:05.850 --> 00:59:09.520 align:middle line:84%
he just-- this was the
leader-- completely relaxed.

00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:10.890 align:middle line:90%
And he said, oh, OK.

00:59:10.890 --> 00:59:15.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, in that case-- and
became really friendly.

00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:18.544 align:middle line:84%
Gave us a name, gave
us a tribal name

00:59:18.544 --> 00:59:20.585 align:middle line:84%
and told us if we ever
wanted to come back, fine.

00:59:20.585 --> 00:59:22.560 align:middle line:90%
Come on back.

00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:24.380 align:middle line:90%
The Anasazis are alive.

00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And they've found
another parallel world

00:59:26.550 --> 00:59:28.480 align:middle line:90%
on the Earth to exist in.

00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing just fine
there, pretty much alone

00:59:32.730 --> 00:59:33.784 align:middle line:90%
by themselves.

00:59:33.784 --> 00:59:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And so what you're
saying in terms

00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:37.196 align:middle line:84%
of what they were
attempting to do

00:59:37.196 --> 00:59:39.320 align:middle line:84%
was something that their
brothers had already done.

00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:42.210 align:middle line:84%
So they knew that
this was possible.

00:59:42.210 --> 00:59:44.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:59:44.010 --> 00:59:54.010 align:middle line:84%
>>OK, are you familiar
with the Pleiadians?

00:59:54.010 --> 00:59:55.700 align:middle line:90%
>>Who?

00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:59.090 align:middle line:84%
Are you talking about
Billy Meier's work?

00:59:59.090 --> 01:00:00.230 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:03.540 align:middle line:84%
>>The other book, that is
called "Bringers of the Dawn."

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:04.340 align:middle line:90%
And it recommend--

01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:05.427 align:middle line:90%
>>Is this Billy Meier's work?

01:00:05.427 --> 01:00:05.600 align:middle line:90%
Does anybody know?

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:06.088 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

01:00:06.088 --> 01:00:06.888 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:00:06.888 --> 01:00:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>>Barbara Marciniak.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.220 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me just say one
thing before you even begin.

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:17.950 align:middle line:84%
The Pleiades is
a very big place.

01:00:17.950 --> 01:00:21.350 align:middle line:90%
It's huge and enormous.

01:00:21.350 --> 01:00:24.440 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about in terms of
polarity consciousness, right?

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:25.960 align:middle line:84%
Not in terms of
unity consciousness

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:30.110 align:middle line:84%
above all of that, they
are very, very beautiful

01:00:30.110 --> 01:00:31.210 align:middle line:90%
positive people there.

01:00:31.210 --> 01:00:33.200 align:middle line:84%
There are very
negative people there.

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And there are
neutral people there.

01:00:35.250 --> 01:00:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And there are also people
that are both ways.

01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:41.950 align:middle line:84%
So some people, they
say, like, the Pleiades,

01:00:41.950 --> 01:00:45.940 align:middle line:84%
that's like saying, are you
familiar with the Earth?

01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:48.470 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it could be anywhere.

01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:51.625 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know where this
person is referring to.

01:00:51.625 --> 01:00:54.050 align:middle line:84%
>>OK, because I
have an experience.

01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:57.030 align:middle line:90%
They recommend to do spinning.

01:00:57.030 --> 01:01:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And at the beginning, I did
counterclockwise spinning.

01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:05.090 align:middle line:90%
And I was able to 99 easily.

01:01:05.090 --> 01:01:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And after that, I realized
when I read the book, that it

01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:11.180 align:middle line:90%
was supposed to be clockwise.

01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And now I start to
do the clockwise.

01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:15.990 align:middle line:84%
But when I was
doing the clockwise,

01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:21.720 align:middle line:84%
it was very difficult. And I
wonder if it's related to this.

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:24.040 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, I'll tell you.

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:27.670 align:middle line:84%
The Pleiades is an
interesting place.

01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:31.085 align:middle line:84%
The Pleiades is the solar
plexus of the galaxy.

01:01:31.085 --> 01:01:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's where most
of the universities

01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:36.150 align:middle line:84%
and school and higher
learning takes place.

01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And you need to pass
through that place

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:41.390 align:middle line:84%
in order to get from
one place to another.

01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:42.190 align:middle line:90%
Usually.

01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:43.190 align:middle line:90%
It's not necessary.

01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:44.440 align:middle line:90%
But usually.

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And most of the Pleiadians
that are associated

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:51.780 align:middle line:84%
with the teaching
aspect of things

01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:55.530 align:middle line:84%
there are really beautiful,
super fourth-dimensional,

01:01:55.530 --> 01:01:57.150 align:middle line:90%
beautiful, beautiful people.

01:01:57.150 --> 01:02:00.510 align:middle line:84%
But there are some
there that-- you

01:02:00.510 --> 01:02:03.904 align:middle line:84%
see, when the Lucifer
Rebellion happened,

01:02:03.904 --> 01:02:05.320 align:middle line:84%
like, most people
just watched it.

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:07.427 align:middle line:84%
But there were some that
chose the light and some

01:02:07.427 --> 01:02:08.260 align:middle line:90%
that chose the dark.

01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:09.676 align:middle line:84%
And then there
were these groups--

01:02:09.676 --> 01:02:13.300 align:middle line:84%
a few-- that would play either
side, depending on what they

01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:15.420 align:middle line:90%
felt would be best for balance.

01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:19.407 align:middle line:84%
And for example, the
Billy Meiers people,

01:02:19.407 --> 01:02:21.240 align:middle line:84%
who are from Pleiadians,
and the information

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:23.670 align:middle line:84%
that they're releasing
there, these guys

01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:25.790 align:middle line:90%
are working with the dark side.

01:02:25.790 --> 01:02:30.450 align:middle line:90%
Though none would admit it.

01:02:30.450 --> 01:02:32.060 align:middle line:90%
And it's very, very subtle.

01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Even Billy Meiers, himself, is
not aware of what's going on.

01:02:35.690 --> 01:02:36.690 align:middle line:90%
He's not aware.

01:02:36.690 --> 01:02:39.710 align:middle line:84%
He's coming from pure
heart and pure intentions.

01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:43.045 align:middle line:90%
But they're using him.

01:02:43.045 --> 01:02:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And what they're
doing is they're

01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:47.780 align:middle line:84%
giving huge amounts
of information that

01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:51.520 align:middle line:84%
is accurate with little
tiny things in there

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:54.790 align:middle line:84%
which I would call like, a
virus for a computer, which

01:02:54.790 --> 01:03:00.790 align:middle line:84%
is designed to break
apart unity on the planet.

01:03:00.790 --> 01:03:04.080 align:middle line:84%
Because they also agree with
the Grays, in terms of it

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:10.260 align:middle line:84%
would be best to replace
us with another race.

01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:11.720 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know
what she's doing.

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:14.060 align:middle line:84%
But if anyone is
teaching a Merkaba that

01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:18.609 align:middle line:84%
rotates clockwise--
I'm not saying

01:03:18.609 --> 01:03:19.650 align:middle line:90%
that you shouldn't do it.

01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:21.275 align:middle line:84%
Because that's up to
you in your heart.

01:03:21.275 --> 01:03:22.860 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you
what you should do.

01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:24.460 align:middle line:84%
But I know from
direct experience

01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:29.610 align:middle line:84%
that that will, for most life
on this place, it'll kill it.

01:03:29.610 --> 01:03:32.060 align:middle line:90%
>>It is being taught.

01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:35.948 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, we'll see how long
the school stays around.

01:03:35.948 --> 01:03:38.936 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:38.936 --> 01:03:41.426 align:middle line:90%


01:03:41.426 --> 01:03:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>>Pay your tuition up front.

01:03:45.110 --> 01:03:45.910 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah?

01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:47.290 align:middle line:84%
>>I wanted to ask
about the Indians,

01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:49.248 align:middle line:84%
because you were talking
about that experience.

01:03:49.248 --> 01:03:54.635 align:middle line:84%
Now, from what you're saying is
they're existing on, probably,

01:03:54.635 --> 01:03:56.885 align:middle line:84%
an overtone higher than the
third dimension, not quite

01:03:56.885 --> 01:03:57.480 align:middle line:90%
the fourth.

01:03:57.480 --> 01:03:59.110 align:middle line:84%
But they're existing
in a world that

01:03:59.110 --> 01:04:00.410 align:middle line:90%
is in one of the overtones?

01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:02.380 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:03.892 align:middle line:84%
What the Indians
have found, it's

01:04:03.892 --> 01:04:08.680 align:middle line:84%
a certain area that
is generally held

01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:14.630 align:middle line:84%
for things like tree
spirits and things

01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:20.460 align:middle line:84%
that we call elves and
real simple spirits,

01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:26.770 align:middle line:84%
they've found how to live
peacefully in those areas.

01:04:26.770 --> 01:04:30.706 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of
about the fourth,

01:04:30.706 --> 01:04:33.540 align:middle line:84%
fifth, and sixth overtone
in the fourth dimension,

01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:35.202 align:middle line:90%
is where they are.

01:04:35.202 --> 01:04:36.560 align:middle line:90%
>>Fourth dimension.

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:39.427 align:middle line:84%
>>They're in the
fourth dimension, yes.

01:04:39.427 --> 01:04:41.010 align:middle line:84%
They're underneath
the angelic realms,

01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:43.480 align:middle line:84%
underneath the
[INAUDIBLE] realms.

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:45.105 align:middle line:84%
And once you're in
one of those worlds,

01:04:45.105 --> 01:04:46.797 align:middle line:90%
it's just as vast as this one.

01:04:46.797 --> 01:04:49.600 align:middle line:90%


01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:51.910 align:middle line:90%
And OK, one more question.

01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>>As you probably know,
the Native American people

01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:58.150 align:middle line:84%
in their ceremony and their Sun
dance, everything is clockwise.

01:04:58.150 --> 01:04:58.950 align:middle line:90%
Except for--

01:04:58.950 --> 01:05:00.630 align:middle line:84%
>>They move clockwise,
that's right.

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:02.170 align:middle line:90%
But that's a physical rotation.

01:05:02.170 --> 01:05:05.138 align:middle line:90%
Let me ask you one thing.

01:05:05.138 --> 01:05:06.013 align:middle line:90%
Are they physically--

01:05:06.013 --> 01:05:06.900 align:middle line:90%
>>It's a physical.

01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:08.090 align:middle line:90%
>>You're physically moving?

01:05:08.090 --> 01:05:08.370 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

01:05:08.370 --> 01:05:09.510 align:middle line:90%
>>You're rotating like this?

01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:10.100 align:middle line:90%
>>Uh-huh.

01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:11.170 align:middle line:90%
>>OK, that's different.

01:05:11.170 --> 01:05:12.283 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

01:05:12.283 --> 01:05:14.870 align:middle line:84%
>>Oh, [INAUDIBLE] to
spin the field clockwise.

01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:15.670 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, if you're spinning
the field clockwise,

01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:22.020 align:middle line:90%
that will do you in.

01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:25.490 align:middle line:84%
If you're physically rotating
clockwise or like the American

01:05:25.490 --> 01:05:27.450 align:middle line:84%
Indians move around
the sweat lodges,

01:05:27.450 --> 01:05:30.100 align:middle line:90%
physically move-- look at this.

01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:33.900 align:middle line:84%
If you've got a hose
of water, right?

01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And you want to create a field
that moves counterclockwise,

01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:41.560 align:middle line:90%
which way do you have to rotate?

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:44.860 align:middle line:90%


01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:47.770 align:middle line:84%
You have to physically
move clockwise

01:05:47.770 --> 01:05:50.546 align:middle line:84%
to create a field that
rotates counterclockwise.

01:05:50.546 --> 01:05:52.697 align:middle line:90%


01:05:52.697 --> 01:05:54.530 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't understand
what you were saying.

01:05:54.530 --> 01:05:56.360 align:middle line:90%
So what she's teaching is OK.

01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:59.074 align:middle line:90%


01:05:59.074 --> 01:06:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And what we're talking
here is the body,

01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:03.290 align:middle line:84%
the physical aspect
is staying still.

01:06:03.290 --> 01:06:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And we're creating the field
that rotates counterclockwise.

01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:09.950 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I
was trying to say.

01:06:09.950 --> 01:06:11.837 align:middle line:90%
It's tricky to understand.

01:06:11.837 --> 01:06:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I thought you
meant they were creating

01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:17.080 align:middle line:90%
fields that went clockwise.

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>>At every octave, isn't
there a change of the spin?

01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:23.930 align:middle line:90%
>>You mean, past the great wall?

01:06:23.930 --> 01:06:27.760 align:middle line:84%
>>No, like on the
physical level is OK.

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:30.080 align:middle line:90%
When you change to the next--

01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:33.399 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, that may be true.

01:06:33.399 --> 01:06:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>>Like when you're
coming from heart,

01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:36.148 align:middle line:90%
it would be going different--

01:06:36.148 --> 01:06:39.030 align:middle line:84%
>>My instructions
are only for here,

01:06:39.030 --> 01:06:41.260 align:middle line:84%
how to get from here
to the other one.

01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:44.340 align:middle line:84%
When you go up to
different levels,

01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:47.530 align:middle line:84%
there may be reversals
in spins and things.

01:06:47.530 --> 01:06:49.292 align:middle line:90%
I don't have that information.

01:06:49.292 --> 01:06:51.040 align:middle line:90%
So I can't help you on that.

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, all these questions
you guys have-- I'm

01:06:53.250 --> 01:06:57.660 align:middle line:84%
here to teach one subject--
but all of this information

01:06:57.660 --> 01:07:01.300 align:middle line:84%
can be taken out into
any subject whatsoever.

01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:04.010 align:middle line:84%
No matter what it is that you
are interested in, no matter

01:07:04.010 --> 01:07:05.917 align:middle line:84%
what you want to
do, you can take

01:07:05.917 --> 01:07:07.750 align:middle line:84%
what you're learning
here in sacred geometry

01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:09.270 align:middle line:90%
and apply to it.

01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And all knowledge
available is open.

01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:16.120 align:middle line:84%
All possibilities
can be opened to you.

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:17.640 align:middle line:84%
Everything that
you ever could ever

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:20.640 align:middle line:84%
want to know about any
subject whatsoever,

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:22.415 align:middle line:84%
both positive and
negative sides of it.

01:07:22.415 --> 01:07:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And so all you've
got to do is just

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:29.300 align:middle line:84%
start applying it into
your lives and take it out.

01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Once you start working with
it, you see how easy it is.

01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:35.701 align:middle line:84%
And this is what the
Pleiadian schools do.

01:07:35.701 --> 01:07:37.200 align:middle line:84%
They teach you all
this stuff first,

01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:40.120 align:middle line:90%
how it relates to everything.

01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:41.434 align:middle line:90%
