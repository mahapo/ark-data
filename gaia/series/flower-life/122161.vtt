00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.886 align:middle line:84%
>>And I'm just going to show
you some slides of where

00:00:22.886 --> 00:00:24.260 align:middle line:84%
the Flower of Life
has been found

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.146 align:middle line:84%
around the world and the
information associated with it.

00:00:27.146 --> 00:00:30.220 align:middle line:90%
And this is in Greece in Crete.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And you see the dolphins
here, and the Flowers

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.620 align:middle line:84%
of Life information on the
floor, and the original petal

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.420 align:middle line:90%
from it.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.230 align:middle line:90%
And this is in Ireland.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to show
you places all over.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.630 align:middle line:90%
This one's really good.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:51.190 align:middle line:84%
This is a door plate, so a
door handle goes through here.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And you say the 13 circles
of the Fruit of Life.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.420 align:middle line:84%
These three form a Star of
David around these three

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.476 align:middle line:84%
with a Star of
David in the middle.

00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:00.600 align:middle line:90%
And look carefully in here.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And you see the inner pattern
of the Flower of Life.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.459 align:middle line:84%
And more-- these three
all have the inner pattern

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:09.127 align:middle line:84%
of the Flower of
Life inside of here.

00:01:09.127 --> 00:01:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's a circle with two lines
around it and all this stuff.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.330 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty good.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.420 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, that came
out of Ireland.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.020 align:middle line:84%
This came out of Turkey,
the Six Days of Genesis.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.420 align:middle line:10%
You actually not only see
the Six Days of Genesis,

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.210 align:middle line:10%
but you see this panel of
the Six Days of Genesis

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.890 align:middle line:10%
and these two side-by-side.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.663 align:middle line:84%
This is the inner six-- this
is the-- where is that thing,

00:01:35.663 --> 00:01:36.463 align:middle line:90%
anyway?

00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:40.250 align:middle line:90%


00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.810 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the central
one, you see inner six petals.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:44.610 align:middle line:90%
>>Mhm.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>And you'll see this over,
and over, and over, and over

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.930 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.120 align:middle line:90%
You'll see that one.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.600 align:middle line:10%
And then right beside it,
it will show the inner one,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.770 align:middle line:10%
with these other
six loops around it,

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:57.720 align:middle line:10%
these six loops here.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.210 align:middle line:90%


00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.450 align:middle line:10%
And that's, like,
the minimum amount

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.540 align:middle line:10%
of information,
those three patterns,

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.500 align:middle line:10%
for the Flower of Life.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:27.570 align:middle line:90%


00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And another place that
you'll see those same three

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:36.160 align:middle line:84%
patterns all over is at the
Monastery of Saint Catherine.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.100 align:middle line:84%
When you go up to Sinai where
Moses found the Burning Bush

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.440 align:middle line:84%
and talked to God, there's
a Coptic monastery there.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And when I went in
there-- they won't

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.180 align:middle line:90%
let you take cameras in there.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.920 align:middle line:90%
But it's all over the ceiling.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.280 align:middle line:84%
We already know the Coptics
were involved in this.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.810 align:middle line:84%
But even in modern
day time, they still

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.310 align:middle line:84%
have the information
on the ceiling.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.590 align:middle line:90%


00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.840 align:middle line:10%
This thing here
in the background

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:20.770 align:middle line:10%
was an image that we took
off of a wooden box, which

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.870 align:middle line:10%
is the Seed of Life.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And the wooden box
was found in Tibet.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.519 align:middle line:90%
And it's Seed of Life.

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And what was found inside
of it was an instrument

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.408 align:middle line:90%
for planting seeds.

00:03:33.408 --> 00:03:34.300 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're going to keep
a seed planter in something,

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.530 align:middle line:84%
it would be very appropriate,
especially if you

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.980 align:middle line:90%
knew what that image was.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:56.190 align:middle line:90%


00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.864 align:middle line:84%
And this image here,
which we took out

00:03:57.864 --> 00:04:00.530 align:middle line:84%
of the Flower of Life-- remember
when we had that symbol and all

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.850 align:middle line:84%
that stuff-- when
you color it in,

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.170 align:middle line:84%
is the Yin Yang
of the Tao symbol.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And again, all though
I have not really

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:17.910 align:middle line:84%
gone into it, the "Tao Te
Ching" and the "I Ching,"

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.506 align:middle line:84%
and 64 changes to
the "I Ching," all

00:04:19.506 --> 00:04:21.339 align:middle line:84%
that information, which
is one of the oldest

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:25.070 align:middle line:84%
books in the world, is
all directly related

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.640 align:middle line:90%
to the Flower of Life.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:35.720 align:middle line:84%
This is Masada, Israel, which
is where the original 300

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.220 align:middle line:84%
Egyptian members of the Egyptian
Mystery School of Akhenaten

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.220 align:middle line:84%
after they had
risen to immortality

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.490 align:middle line:84%
in about approximately
500 BC went to this place

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.320 align:middle line:90%
and formed their little city.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And if you go into the
center of this ruins

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.720 align:middle line:84%
to this ancient church
and into the middle

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.310 align:middle line:84%
of that church-- and
this is the floor

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.560 align:middle line:90%
of the center of their church.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.410 align:middle line:84%
You can't see it here, because
this is a copy, of a copy,

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.034 align:middle line:90%
of a copy of the slide.

00:05:02.034 --> 00:05:03.200 align:middle line:90%
But I did have the original.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is the Flower
of Life pattern.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.350 align:middle line:90%
Most of the floor is gone.

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.900 align:middle line:10%
But this pattern right in here,
if you can clearly see it,

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.220 align:middle line:10%
is very, very clearly the outer
rim of the Flower of Life,

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.840 align:middle line:10%
showing that the Essene
brotherhood also knew

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.700 align:middle line:10%
with the Flower of Life was.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.450 align:middle line:84%
But then since the
Coptics and the Essenes

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.600 align:middle line:84%
are both, from
our point of view,

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.630 align:middle line:84%
coming from the same source,
it's not too unusual.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.046 align:middle line:90%
This is coming out of India.

00:05:31.046 --> 00:05:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And the Nakkal Mystery
School went into India

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.430 align:middle line:84%
a long time ago, giving all
the geometrical information

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.140 align:middle line:90%
from Atlantis.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And the Sri Yantra and
all these kinds of things

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.520 align:middle line:84%
are all the
geometrical patterns.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Like in here, of the
six stars around one

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.340 align:middle line:84%
and everything are all
the geometrical patterns

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.650 align:middle line:90%
of this information.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.900 align:middle line:84%
Their very temples are laid
out into this information--

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:56.881 align:middle line:90%
every stone.

00:05:56.881 --> 00:05:57.880 align:middle line:90%
It's just like in Egypt.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:17.570 align:middle line:90%


00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Those temples there are
also equally involved

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.940 align:middle line:90%
in this same information.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:23.850 align:middle line:90%
This is also Hindu.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.924 align:middle line:90%


00:06:27.924 --> 00:06:39.200 align:middle line:84%
This is my drawing, but I
copied it from a mandala.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.030 align:middle line:90%
It's a Hindu mandala on tantra.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.850 align:middle line:90%
And this is 2,000 years old.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And when you look carefully
at the information

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.930 align:middle line:84%
inside of here--
somebody take this thing.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that's
what's doing it or not.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.030 align:middle line:90%


00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.580 align:middle line:84%
You got these seven triangles
in here with the purple.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you guys know
now what that is, especially

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.610 align:middle line:90%
when you look at this thing.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.310 align:middle line:90%
It's the star tetrahedral field.

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Now this is Tantra
we're talking about.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And they're discussing Tantra
and simultaneously discussing

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.900 align:middle line:90%
conception.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And remember, the egg turns
into one of these things,

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.190 align:middle line:90%
the original eight cells.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And then it becomes
a cube, which

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.530 align:middle line:90%
is the cubicle nature of it.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And they show the star
tetrahedral field.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And another way of depicting
a cube on a flat field

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.030 align:middle line:90%
is two squares.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And all of that is
inside a round sphere

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:42.330 align:middle line:84%
with two lines going around it,
the inner and outer surface.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:46.980 align:middle line:84%
So they're showing-- this is the
metaphysics inside of the ovum.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And then out here,
you see eight organic

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:54.170 align:middle line:84%
looking cells that go to
16 organic looking cells,

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:57.640 align:middle line:84%
showing that they knew about the
binary sequence of the nature

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.140 align:middle line:84%
of life, which they
weren't supposed

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:01.460 align:middle line:90%
to know 2,000 years ago.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And then they also put a dot
on every other one, which

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.840 align:middle line:84%
to me is showing that the
original egg remained unique

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.370 align:middle line:90%
and to themselves.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And all of that goes back into
a sphere, which the process does

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.270 align:middle line:90%
do.

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:16.560 align:middle line:84%
It goes from a sphere to
these other forms in here

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.030 align:middle line:90%
and then back to a sphere.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And behind here,
you see the square

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:25.610 align:middle line:84%
that forms the Phi Ratio,
giving you the Ratio of Life.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's a remarkable piece of
work considering how ancient it

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.999 align:middle line:90%
is and what it's talking about.

00:08:33.999 --> 00:08:40.860 align:middle line:90%

going to let you see yet.

00:08:44.325 --> 00:08:45.790 align:middle line:84%

waiting so long.

This one's great.

will come up close.

You get to see this one finally.

00:08:56.366 --> 00:09:00.360 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember when we go
and we talked about Abydos.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And in Abydos, I
said there would

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.390 align:middle line:84%
