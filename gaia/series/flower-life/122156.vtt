00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.495 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.495 --> 00:00:16.480 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.080 align:middle line:84%
>>Now we have two kinds of
governments in the world.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.860 align:middle line:84%
We got the outer
governments of people

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.400 align:middle line:84%
that we know, like a Clinton,
and Bush, and these kind

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.560 align:middle line:84%
of guys and Gorbachev who
are out there on the TVs

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.910 align:middle line:84%
and appear to be running
everything but which are not.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And underneath this,
there is a group

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.770 align:middle line:84%
of people who are, in
essence, really the richest

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.512 align:middle line:84%
people in the world who have
been together a long time ago.

00:00:41.512 --> 00:00:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And it really goes
all the way back

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:49.520 align:middle line:84%
to Atlantis that have a great
deal of martian blood in them

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.690 align:middle line:84%
that can really
control the world

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.270 align:middle line:84%
and all that goes
on in the world.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.740 align:middle line:84%
They control the wars,
and when the wars start,

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.100 align:middle line:90%
and when the wars end.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.980 align:middle line:84%
They control the phantoms
and the [INAUDIBLE]--

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.121 align:middle line:84%
the famines and when they
start and when they end.

00:01:08.121 --> 00:01:11.840 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.990 align:middle line:84%
You'd be amazed at what
they could actually do

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.960 align:middle line:84%
and what they can't do, and
what they have done in the past.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And at this point in
the game, at least,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.760 align:middle line:84%
up until a few years
ago, they really

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.060 align:middle line:90%
weren't too concerned about us.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.880 align:middle line:84%
We were just being used
on a lot of levels.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.070 align:middle line:84%
When the secret government
found out about this in 1968

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.940 align:middle line:84%
and, probably, had a pretty
good indication even as far back

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:48.620 align:middle line:84%
as 1964, they decided
to make some changes.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.584 align:middle line:84%
Number one, it was determined
from the report and everything

00:01:52.584 --> 00:01:54.000 align:middle line:84%
else that, more
than likely, there

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.499 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't be a
building left standing

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:58.430 align:middle line:90%
on the planet from this thing.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.310 align:middle line:84%
That whole continents
would go up and down.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.290 align:middle line:84%
That there would be massive
changes under all of this.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.979 align:middle line:84%
And so the secret
government decided

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.080 align:middle line:84%
that they couldn't stay on
Earth, that they were going

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.540 align:middle line:84%
to get off the earth and
leave because the Earth was

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.710 align:middle line:90%
going to be devastated so much.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And so they joined the United
States and Russia together

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.990 align:middle line:90%
as one country a long time ago.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.710 align:middle line:84%
They blended a lot of our
money, and information,

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.110 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of things,
and put it all together.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And the race to the moon between
the United States and Russia

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.550 align:middle line:90%
was coordinated by them.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.600 align:middle line:90%
It was a race all right.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.930 align:middle line:84%
But it was, in
fact, a real race.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:54.180 align:middle line:84%
They needed the moon very bad
to do what they had to do.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.990 align:middle line:90%
So think about it for a moment.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.260 align:middle line:84%
Once they gained the moon,
were six trips from the United

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.350 align:middle line:90%
States in the late 60s.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.290 align:middle line:84%
I think the last one was '72
or '71 or something like that.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.424 align:middle line:84%
I really need to get those
dates clear in my mind.

00:03:09.424 --> 00:03:11.590 align:middle line:84%
But there was six of them
altogether from the United

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.310 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.268 align:middle line:84%
And then, after the last
one, once we got there

00:03:14.268 --> 00:03:17.095 align:middle line:84%
and we established everything
like that, total silence.

00:03:17.095 --> 00:03:20.190 align:middle line:90%


00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.330 align:middle line:84%
We don't even talk
about the moon anymore.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.130 align:middle line:90%
Nobody goes there.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.300 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.421 align:middle line:90%
There's no moon.

00:03:26.421 --> 00:03:28.780 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.130 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't exist, you know.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.426 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:03:33.426 --> 00:03:34.816 align:middle line:90%
Why haven't we gone there again?

00:03:34.816 --> 00:03:36.440 align:middle line:84%
You think that we've
learned everything

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.990 align:middle line:84%
about the moon
there is to learn?

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.400 align:middle line:84%
There's another reason why is
because they needed the moon.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.300 align:middle line:90%


00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.100 align:middle line:84%
If you want to go
deep into space,

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.090 align:middle line:84%
if you want to leave the
earth and go somewhere else

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.660 align:middle line:84%
with the technology
that we have,

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.600 align:middle line:84%
you need to build a space
station or a satellite

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.190 align:middle line:84%
out there to bring the materials
up and around like that

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.890 align:middle line:84%
to assemble the kinds
of things you need

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.800 align:middle line:84%
to go further if
you're going to bring

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.870 align:middle line:90%
lots of people and materials.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And why do that when you already
have a satellite up there

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.890 align:middle line:90%
called the moon.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And so they needed to get to the
moon to do what they had to do.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.070 align:middle line:84%
So the entire world's
energies and direction

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.170 align:middle line:84%
were aimed by the
secret government

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.959 align:middle line:90%
toward just getting to the moon.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And then, once they
got there, then

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.570 align:middle line:84%
they didn't want
you to know anymore.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.140 align:middle line:90%


00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.970 align:middle line:90%
We made six trips.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:34.790 align:middle line:90%
But Russia made 2,000 trips.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.230 align:middle line:90%
2,000 trips, a little different.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And what they did was they
went around the backside

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:43.920 align:middle line:90%
of the moon.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.060 align:middle line:84%
So we can't see them
because the backside stays

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.480 align:middle line:90%
hidden to us all the time.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And they built three major
installations back there.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.810 align:middle line:84%
One of which was a
great catastrophe

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.970 align:middle line:84%
because it collapsed and
killed a lot of people.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And to assemble all the
things that were needed

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.490 align:middle line:90%
for them leaving the earth.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And then, from there
once they got everything

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.274 align:middle line:84%
in place everything
and everything

00:05:08.274 --> 00:05:10.440 align:middle line:84%
they needed to know-- so
while they were doing this,

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.010 align:middle line:84%
they didn't want your
attention on the moon.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:18.110 align:middle line:84%
That's why they got your
attention away [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.800 align:middle line:90%
other places though.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:30.000 align:middle line:84%
They did, however, make a
very important trip to Mars,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.420 align:middle line:84%
which we saw the face
on Mars, and mapped

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.022 align:middle line:90%
every square inch of Mars.

00:05:35.022 --> 00:05:37.230 align:middle line:84%
They mapped the whole thing
except for the two Poles.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:38.188 align:middle line:90%
They mapped it all out.

00:05:38.188 --> 00:05:39.540 align:middle line:90%
They wanted a whole thing of it.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.550 align:middle line:90%
That was real important, too.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And then, once they got all this
together, they went to Mars.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.890 align:middle line:84%
That's where they
decided to go to,

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.660 align:middle line:84%
which is only appropriate, since
they were Martians, to go back

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.717 align:middle line:90%
to where they came from.

00:05:54.717 --> 00:05:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's the planet
that they chose.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.300 align:middle line:84%
There could have been
other places, I guess.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.210 align:middle line:84%
These wouldn't be very good when
you got a 900 degrees surface.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:11.732 align:middle line:84%
But Mars could easily
keep human life there.

00:06:11.732 --> 00:06:12.565 align:middle line:90%
There's water there.

00:06:12.565 --> 00:06:15.060 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of water
under the surfaces.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.950 align:middle line:84%
It's everything that they
need in certain ways.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.580 align:middle line:90%
And so they went to Mars.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.710 align:middle line:90%
And they built complexes there.

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.120 align:middle line:84%
Primarily, underground
but not totally.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And they built this whole
thing that took many years.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And by about 19--
I'm really guessing.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.010 align:middle line:90%
I don't know the exact time.

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.625 align:middle line:84%
But somewhere in
the 1980s, say 1985.

00:06:44.625 --> 00:06:45.750 align:middle line:90%
It's sort of in the middle.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.300 align:middle line:90%
Somewhere around in there.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.850 align:middle line:84%
They completed the structures
and everything they needed.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:56.230 align:middle line:84%
They built a structure that
would keep, approximately,

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:02.830 align:middle line:84%
10,000 people alive
indefinitely on Mars to make

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.760 align:middle line:84%
a total transformation
over to there for as long

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.410 align:middle line:90%
as is necessary.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
who we're bringing

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.764 align:middle line:84%
was just themselves, their
families, and their friends.

00:07:12.764 --> 00:07:15.550 align:middle line:90%


00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And once they had the
whole thing set up,

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.360 align:middle line:84%
they just sat back and just,
basically, didn't really

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.440 align:middle line:84%
care what happened
to us because they

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.569 align:middle line:84%
figured we didn't
stand a chance,

00:07:25.569 --> 00:07:26.610 align:middle line:90%
from their point of view.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:30.180 align:middle line:90%


00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.900 align:middle line:84%
These are the same
people that had,

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:38.010 align:middle line:84%
in the early part
of the century,

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:45.370 align:middle line:84%
very early-- probably about 1910
is my guest-- made connection

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:47.960 align:middle line:90%
with the Greys.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And though the Greys had
been here earlier than that,

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:58.830 align:middle line:84%
the secret government had begin
to make contracts with them

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:03.430 align:middle line:84%
to allow them to
do certain things.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:06.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take back off on
that what the secret government

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.940 align:middle line:84%
do with Grey's in just
a little while so you

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.150 align:middle line:90%
can understand all of that.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.564 align:middle line:90%
But that's another story.

00:08:13.564 --> 00:08:14.980 align:middle line:84%
I'll continue on
when [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:19.340 align:middle line:90%


00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.150 align:middle line:84%
It's another part of all
of this, which is actually

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:23.520 align:middle line:90%
still connected to Mars, too.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.772 align:middle line:90%


00:08:26.772 --> 00:08:27.980 align:middle line:90%
So they built all this stuff.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:32.299 align:middle line:84%
They came back here and said,
well, hope you guys made it.

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And there's no way they could
get everybody off the surface,

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:37.559 align:middle line:90%
even if they wanted to anyway.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:40.929 align:middle line:84%
So there's nothing they
figured they could do.

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:42.387 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't
really care anyway.

00:08:42.387 --> 00:08:46.830 align:middle line:90%


00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And then, about a few years
ago, and I remember the dates

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.110 align:middle line:84%
and times in this either,
it's not real important,

00:08:55.110 --> 00:09:01.140 align:middle line:84%
but I guess time has really
been going by here now.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:05.550 align:middle line:84%
I guess it's been-- it
was in the late 80s.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:08.050 align:middle line:84%
It was not too long after they
completed everything and got

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:08.850 align:middle line:90%
it all finished.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:10.880 align:middle line:84%
It was a-- I don't
know what it was.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:11.680 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.170 align:middle line:90%
It as '87, '88, '89.

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:14.870 align:middle line:90%
Somewhere around there.

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:19.130 align:middle line:84%
They became aware of
something that, I'm sure,

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:21.410 align:middle line:90%
shocked them to their bones.

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And that was that it
isn't just the earth that

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:28.190 align:middle line:84%
is going through a new
North and South Poles,

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:32.010 align:middle line:84%
but it's all the
planets, including Mars.

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:33.910 align:middle line:90%
All of them.

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And so all that work
was for nothing.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:39.720 align:middle line:90%
Just a waste of time.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Even though they have technology
beyond your imagination,

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:47.230 align:middle line:84%
they are technically incredible
with what they can do

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:52.610 align:middle line:84%
and what they can't do, and
what they're capable of doing,

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:55.690 align:middle line:84%
they still don't
have the ability,

00:09:55.690 --> 00:10:02.590 align:middle line:84%
no more than the Greys
do, to leave this place

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:05.610 align:middle line:84%
and go to the next
octave, which appears

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:10.792 align:middle line:84%
to be, by everyone's knowledge,
going to be a necessity.

00:10:10.792 --> 00:10:16.572 align:middle line:90%


00:10:16.572 --> 00:10:18.530 align:middle line:84%
It's just like if we were
in an airplane that's

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:20.090 align:middle line:84%
about ready to
run out of gas, we

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:23.110 align:middle line:84%
could all see that we're going
to have to land real soon.

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Well we're in a situation where
we're about to run out of gas.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.920 align:middle line:84%
Only it's not a real
good explanation.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
have to do something.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.790 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
to make a change.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.670 align:middle line:84%
But the way God has
done it is we're

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:39.290 align:middle line:84%
going to have to do
this all together.

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:41.950 align:middle line:84%
The concepts of polarity,
and good and evil,

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:45.300 align:middle line:84%
and such and the ideas
that you can just

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.410 align:middle line:84%
forget about part and
move toward another one

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:54.340 align:middle line:84%
won't work in the dynamics of
the situation that we're in.

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:57.530 align:middle line:90%
And then, become aware of this.

00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:01.570 align:middle line:84%
So because of that, they
have tried to rethink things.

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And they have tried to
allow certain changes

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.670 align:middle line:84%
to occur in the world
that normally would never

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:08.020 align:middle line:90%
be allowed.

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:11.560 align:middle line:84%
For example, it began with the
allowance of the Berlin Wall

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.330 align:middle line:84%
to fall down and all
the changes that's

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:18.125 align:middle line:84%
been going on in Russia and all
the incredible, rapid changes

00:11:18.125 --> 00:11:20.010 align:middle line:84%
that have been going
on politically.

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:22.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you don't realize
how fast things are gonna go.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.130 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you do.

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:28.870 align:middle line:84%
But usually, these kinds of
changes don't happen overnight.

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.530 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't
happen overnight only

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:32.510 align:middle line:84%
because the secret
government has allowed

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:36.049 align:middle line:84%
this to happen they've
allowed these changes which

00:11:36.049 --> 00:11:38.090 align:middle line:84%
should have been wanting
to be changed in any way

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:38.890 align:middle line:90%
by the people.

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:43.560 align:middle line:90%


00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.120 align:middle line:84%
So they've allowed the
situation to continue it.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.100 align:middle line:84%
If they could ever
figure out a way

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.620 align:middle line:84%
how to leave us behind
and make it through,

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:53.324 align:middle line:84%
they probably would,
still, at this point

00:11:53.324 --> 00:11:54.990 align:middle line:84%
though at this point,
they're right back

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:57.610 align:middle line:84%
to where they were when
they first got to Atlantis

00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:58.830 align:middle line:90%
and joined with us.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And that is they're
going to have

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:04.610 align:middle line:84%
to learn this feminine side,
which they didn't want to do.

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:07.310 align:middle line:84%
Then, they decided
during Atlantis

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:09.554 align:middle line:84%
that they were never
going to do that again.

00:12:09.554 --> 00:12:11.720 align:middle line:84%
None of this allowing the
stuff to happen, you know.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.620 align:middle line:84%
They were going to
control everything.

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And they were coming up
to the same conclusion

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:17.700 align:middle line:90%
that Grace can come up with.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:19.450 align:middle line:90%
It requires both sides.

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:23.240 align:middle line:84%
It requires male
and female to be

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:27.440 align:middle line:90%
able to make this translation.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And intellect alone, the male
side alone, can't do it alone.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And so even though they don't
like it, it's the way it is.

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:42.530 align:middle line:90%


00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:44.720 align:middle line:84%
So for a long time
when you go back

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:50.160 align:middle line:84%
and you look at the stuff
that happened when people were

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.370 align:middle line:84%
finding out about a
lot of these things--

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:56.374 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember what the
films were that came out.

00:12:56.374 --> 00:13:00.640 align:middle line:84%
MJ12 and all that
stuff that came out

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.390 align:middle line:84%
and the films that
came out for a while

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.280 align:middle line:84%
because what they were
doing for a long time

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:09.500 align:middle line:84%
is purposely going around
and looking for guys like me

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:13.680 align:middle line:84%
and people that were becoming
aware of the situation

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.110 align:middle line:84%
and killing them, getting
rid of every one of they

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:18.040 align:middle line:84%
could so that they
could continue

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.620 align:middle line:90%
doing what they're doing.

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.500 align:middle line:90%
Now it's a total reversal.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.220 align:middle line:84%
I guess I'll quickly
finish the story

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:31.308 align:middle line:84%
about the secret government
and what the Greys have done.

00:13:31.308 --> 00:13:37.710 align:middle line:90%


00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:44.240 align:middle line:84%
A few years ago,
we sent a satellite

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:48.890 align:middle line:84%
to Mars, which was
probably the one that

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:53.440 align:middle line:84%
brought back the photographs
when the face of Mars came out.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And when it went by,
one of the moons--

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.610 align:middle line:84%
there's two moons
going around Mars.

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:00.750 align:middle line:84%
But it went by one of the
moons, and it recorded

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:02.790 align:middle line:90%
photographs of this moon.

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:03.860 align:middle line:90%
This moon was so weird.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:10.600 align:middle line:84%
It just defies all kinds
of-- I don't know how

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.290 align:middle line:90%
it could do what it was doing.

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:16.340 align:middle line:84%
It was just skimming
over the surface of Mars.

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Just skimming over the mountain
tops you might say, almost.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:21.630 align:middle line:90%
Real fast.

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:24.550 align:middle line:84%
It's so low to the
surface that if you

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:28.110 align:middle line:84%
were sitting at the
North Pole of Mars,

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:30.770 align:middle line:90%
you couldn't see the moon.

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:32.610 align:middle line:84%
The moon would be
down below the horizon

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:34.053 align:middle line:90%
going around the planet.

00:14:34.053 --> 00:14:37.040 align:middle line:90%


00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:41.820 align:middle line:84%
So it's just barely off the
surface going really, really

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.804 align:middle line:90%
fast.

00:14:43.804 --> 00:14:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know--
they've calculated

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:55.840 align:middle line:84%
how, you know, according to
its weight and everything

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.975 align:middle line:90%
else like that, it's impossible.

00:14:57.975 --> 00:15:00.090 align:middle line:84%
The only calculations
they could come up with

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:03.360 align:middle line:90%
is that it was hollow.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.440 align:middle line:84%
This is the only thing
that they could figure out.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.600 align:middle line:90%
And so it's a weird.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.480 align:middle line:90%
It's a weird moon.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.520 align:middle line:84%
But then, they saw some
other weird things on it

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.320 align:middle line:90%
when it went by.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And they found
these cuts on lines.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:21.190 align:middle line:90%
There's like slashes.

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:26.860 align:middle line:90%
This was the moon.

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:39.350 align:middle line:84%
They found these
things all over it.

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:43.339 align:middle line:84%
And they are in a
v-shape from the side.

00:15:43.339 --> 00:15:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And I think they're about 120
feet wide and 75 feet deep.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.016 align:middle line:84%
Something like that, and
they run for a long distance

00:15:56.016 --> 00:15:57.670 align:middle line:90%
and real straight.

00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And they're covered with
some kind of, inside the v,

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:05.296 align:middle line:84%
it's some kind of
silvery, substance.

00:16:05.296 --> 00:16:06.670 align:middle line:84%
So they don't know
what they are.

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:08.128 align:middle line:84%
They'd never seen
anything like it.

00:16:08.128 --> 00:16:09.730 align:middle line:84%
They just falls
into a new category

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:13.920 align:middle line:90%
of a phenomenon [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:18.330 align:middle line:84%
They sent another
one by recently.

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:26.360 align:middle line:84%
I guess this is in, probably--
I'm guessing here, again--

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:30.410 align:middle line:90%
earlier part of 1980.

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:31.210 align:middle line:90%
Maybe even later.

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:32.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:36.875 align:middle line:84%
And they took photographs
of the moon again.

00:16:36.875 --> 00:16:38.500 align:middle line:84%
The only thing is
that when they looked

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.320 align:middle line:84%
at one photograph of
the old one that went by

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.160 align:middle line:84%
and the new one
that went by, there

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:47.289 align:middle line:84%
were more of these lines
that weren't there before,

00:16:47.289 --> 00:16:49.080 align:middle line:84%
which is, kind of,
impossible by everything

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.460 align:middle line:84%
we know because there's no
wind, and there's no water,

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.950 align:middle line:84%
and there's no air, and
there's no way for erosion

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:56.316 align:middle line:84%
to take place and
everything else like that.

00:16:56.316 --> 00:16:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And there's no
way for them to be

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:00.770 align:middle line:90%
formed that we can conceive of.

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:04.972 align:middle line:84%
And so that sparked the
interest of some people.

00:17:04.972 --> 00:17:08.490 align:middle line:90%


00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:10.880 align:middle line:84%
So Russia, and
the United States,

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.970 align:middle line:84%
and England, and
France, I think--

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:16.880 align:middle line:84%
there might have been some other
countries involved in there--

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:23.010 align:middle line:84%
sent two satellites up
there to check this out.

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:25.756 align:middle line:90%
This was much newer now.

00:17:25.756 --> 00:17:27.089 align:middle line:90%
Does anybody know when this was?

00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:30.330 align:middle line:84%
It was 1990, maybe, or
something like that.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:33.240 align:middle line:84%
'89 or '90, somewhere
around there.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.100 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:35.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure exactly
when this was.

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.130 align:middle line:90%
I need to check my dates again.

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:43.493 align:middle line:84%
And one of the satellites
just disappeared.

00:17:43.493 --> 00:17:45.860 align:middle line:90%
Don't know where it is.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:46.725 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:17:46.725 --> 00:17:48.350 align:middle line:90%
Who knows.

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And the second one
reached the planet.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And when it got to
the Mars planet,

00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:57.410 align:middle line:90%
it only had one video camera.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And the video camera was locked
into the surface of Mars.

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And when it came into
the surface of Mars,

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:08.756 align:middle line:84%
it moved in between Mars
and this low flying moon.

00:18:08.756 --> 00:18:11.319 align:middle line:90%


00:18:11.319 --> 00:18:13.610 align:middle line:84%
I really don't know how many
miles it is between there.

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:20.710 align:middle line:84%
But it can't be a whole lot
considering you can't see it

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:23.610 align:middle line:90%
from the North or South Poles.

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:25.850 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, it moved in
between the middle of it.

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's next purpose was
to rotate 180 degrees,

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.790 align:middle line:84%
lock on the surface
of the moon, move up

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:33.940 align:middle line:84%
to within 100 yards
of the moon, and start

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:38.475 align:middle line:84%
photographing these things
six square inches at a time.

00:18:38.475 --> 00:18:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Now considering that they can
pick up the date of a dime

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:54.180 align:middle line:84%
from a satellite
around the planet,

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:58.290 align:middle line:84%
to be 100 yards away from
something is like being there.

00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:01.850 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, they could get
really good photographs blown up

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:04.940 align:middle line:84%
full size and just
stamp it on there.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And that was their
intention to look carefully

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.230 align:middle line:90%
at what this was.

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And probably look in more
ways than just light.

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.320 align:middle line:84%
There's other ways to
look, other aspects

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.570 align:middle line:84%
of the electromagnetic
spectrum and things to look at.

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:21.390 align:middle line:90%


00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:24.540 align:middle line:84%
However, it never got
a chance because as it

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:29.530 align:middle line:84%
was looking down
at the surface--

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:30.714 align:middle line:90%
let me get something here.

00:19:30.714 --> 00:19:34.580 align:middle line:90%


00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.530 align:middle line:84%
Zecharia Sitchin
wrote about this.

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:38.730 align:middle line:90%
But he's not the only one.

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:40.534 align:middle line:90%
There's other people.

00:19:40.534 --> 00:19:46.450 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to get these on a
slide, actually, on a drawing.

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:49.770 align:middle line:84%
Two things happened
very quickly.

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:55.080 align:middle line:84%
The first thing is that,
suddenly, something appeared

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.890 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of the earth.

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:58.430 align:middle line:90%
And what it was was this.

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:00.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
can see this or not.

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:02.532 align:middle line:90%
But it looks like a building.

00:20:02.532 --> 00:20:03.810 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:04.884 align:middle line:90%
>>It's an installation.

00:20:04.884 --> 00:20:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>>On the surface
of Mars or Earth?

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:07.552 align:middle line:90%
>>On the surface of Mars.

00:20:07.552 --> 00:20:09.510 align:middle line:84%
There's cameras looking
on the surface of mars.

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:12.880 align:middle line:84%
You can see it looks
like building and complex

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:16.530 align:middle line:84%
with a road coming in and this
whole thing sitting directly

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:17.444 align:middle line:90%
below it.

00:20:17.444 --> 00:20:20.710 align:middle line:90%


00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:23.080 align:middle line:90%
This is on page 81.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And the very next
thing that happened

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:28.930 align:middle line:84%
is, you see this
elliptical shadow?

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:33.950 align:middle line:84%
A 16 mile long elliptical shadow
appears on the surface of Mars.

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:37.815 align:middle line:84%
Something between the sun and
Mars but wasn't in the camera.

00:20:37.815 --> 00:20:40.340 align:middle line:90%


00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.720 align:middle line:84%
This big thing appears,
comes into place, a shadow.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And then, something
comes from whatever.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.439 align:middle line:84%
The thing that was causing
the shadow, probably.

00:20:47.439 --> 00:20:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And now we know for sure cause
of what just happened recently,

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.830 align:middle line:90%
and knocked out the satellite.

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:55.440 align:middle line:90%


00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And it was all on
the last six frames.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And this was all
shown in Europe.

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:03.136 align:middle line:84%
And they re-showed it just
recently, I understand.

00:21:03.136 --> 00:21:05.135 align:middle line:84%
And they've even showed
the last six frames now.

00:21:05.135 --> 00:21:07.260 align:middle line:84%
But for a long time, they
wouldn't let the last six

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:08.080 align:middle line:90%
frames out.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And the military
wouldn't allow them out.

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:11.580 align:middle line:84%
All the military would say is
there's something there's not

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:12.790 align:middle line:90%
supposed to be there.

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:14.700 align:middle line:84%
They've now shown
what's up there.

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:19.980 align:middle line:84%
What I've been told is they
now have released that.

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And it shows this 21 mile
long cigar shaped thing,

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:25.149 align:middle line:90%
I think it is, in the sky.

00:21:25.149 --> 00:21:27.190 align:middle line:84%
But it's something that
comes over and knocks out

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:29.410 align:middle line:90%
the satellite.

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:33.420 align:middle line:84%
This was the first time
that the outer governments

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.640 align:middle line:84%
became absolutely
clear that there really

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.790 align:middle line:90%
was life out there.

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:41.500 align:middle line:84%
Before that, they'd
never been able to get

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:47.090 align:middle line:84%
into the aspect of what
the secret government has

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:48.167 align:middle line:90%
been running.

00:21:48.167 --> 00:21:50.500 align:middle line:84%
Berry Goldwater has been
trying to get in the blue room.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.240 align:middle line:84%
I think he tried 30
times, which is where

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:56.310 align:middle line:84%
a lot of this secret
planning was done

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:57.408 align:middle line:90%
and was never allowed in.

00:21:57.408 --> 00:21:58.208 align:middle line:90%
He was the senator.

00:21:58.208 --> 00:22:03.330 align:middle line:90%


00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:07.810 align:middle line:84%
So the outer governments knew
about stuff about to the level

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:10.980 align:middle line:84%
that we know about stuff,
or maybe a little bit more.

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:14.250 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think they had any
absolute, definite, hardcore

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:15.050 align:middle line:90%
proof.

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:17.350 align:middle line:90%
And now they did.

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:22.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I guess this goes
back earlier than that

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:26.410 align:middle line:84%
now that I think
about it because when

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:27.570 align:middle line:90%
was Reagan's last year?

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:30.546 align:middle line:90%


00:22:30.546 --> 00:22:32.040 align:middle line:90%
>>'88.

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.146 align:middle line:90%
>>'88?

00:22:33.146 --> 00:22:34.544 align:middle line:90%
>>'88.

00:22:34.544 --> 00:22:37.070 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, '88.

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:39.840 align:middle line:84%
>>This must have taken
place right before

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:44.380 align:middle line:84%
because Reagan was just in
the last part of this primary.

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:49.790 align:middle line:84%
Remember he made a
statement to Gorbachev?

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:55.292 align:middle line:84%
What would we do if we
were attacked by aliens?

00:22:55.292 --> 00:22:57.250 align:middle line:84%
The guy in the papers
kind of laughed about it.

00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:58.890 align:middle line:90%
Ha, ha, ha.

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:00.530 align:middle line:90%
What will we do?

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:05.454 align:middle line:84%
Well according to the Russians,
when Gorbachev got back

00:23:05.454 --> 00:23:07.870 align:middle line:84%
from that, that was supposed
to be just a little statement

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:10.570 align:middle line:84%
that he passed off
as a joke, Gorbachev

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:15.614 align:middle line:84%
talked about it to the Russians
seriously for two hours.

00:23:15.614 --> 00:23:17.290 align:middle line:90%
Seriously discussed it.

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:20.560 align:middle line:90%
What would they do?

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And there was other a couple
other times or, at least,

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.020 align:middle line:84%
one other time when Reagan
talked about it also.

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is
they knew, for certain,

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:33.050 align:middle line:84%
that there was
somebody out there

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:34.300 align:middle line:90%
and that they were aggressive.

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:37.970 align:middle line:84%
They blew one of our
satellites out of space.

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:41.650 align:middle line:84%
So as far as our
governments was concerned,

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:46.840 align:middle line:84%
we were at war with whoever
this was that was out there.

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And they came back,
and the United Nations

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:59.910 align:middle line:84%
came back, and made this
whole document, which was not

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:03.345 align:middle line:84%
what to do if we ever
find ET life or any

00:24:03.345 --> 00:24:07.832 align:middle line:84%
of those other kinds of
things or [INAUDIBLE] to do,

00:24:07.832 --> 00:24:09.665 align:middle line:84%
how to look for them
or something like that.

00:24:09.665 --> 00:24:10.873 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how to put this.

00:24:10.873 --> 00:24:15.770 align:middle line:84%
But it was what to do when
the world became aware

00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:18.270 align:middle line:90%
that there was E.T life.

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:23.380 align:middle line:84%
What do the world
governments do?

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:26.064 align:middle line:84%
It was already a given
that it had happened.

00:24:26.064 --> 00:24:27.480 align:middle line:84%
Now they were
trying to figure out

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:30.090 align:middle line:84%
what to do when the
rest of us find out.

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:34.602 align:middle line:84%
Do they impose martial
law or what happens?

00:24:34.602 --> 00:24:36.810 align:middle line:84%
They've worked out every
detail, exactly what they're

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:41.017 align:middle line:90%
going to do when we find out.

00:24:41.017 --> 00:24:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And there's even more on the
books in the United Nations

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:45.754 align:middle line:84%
that if any person in
the United States--

00:24:45.754 --> 00:24:47.670 align:middle line:84%
and they're not going
to enforce it right now,

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:50.760 align:middle line:84%
but it's there when they have
to-- if anybody is approached

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:57.480 align:middle line:84%
by an E.T they must,
by law, report it

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.860 align:middle line:84%
because they know
this is real now,

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:02.947 align:middle line:84%
and so they're thinking
along these lines.

00:25:02.947 --> 00:25:04.780 align:middle line:84%
This is why when Richard
Hoagland was trying

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:09.280 align:middle line:84%
to push to see if we can send
another satellite back there

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:14.285 align:middle line:84%
now, which is carefully going
to map the entire surface again

00:25:14.285 --> 00:25:17.390 align:middle line:84%
and with cameras that are 50
times clearer than anything

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:19.920 align:middle line:90%
we've ever had before.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:22.590 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, they can
really get down there

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:25.490 align:middle line:90%
and see what's there.

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:26.960 align:middle line:90%
And those are on their way.

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:31.134 align:middle line:84%
They'll be there in
August of this year.

00:25:31.134 --> 00:25:31.934 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:25:31.934 --> 00:25:35.430 align:middle line:90%


00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:37.640 align:middle line:84%
>>And now Richard
Hoagland has been

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:41.010 align:middle line:84%
trying to get them to
give them photographs

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:42.760 align:middle line:90%
of the face on Mars.

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And the United
Nations and NASA have

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:48.410 align:middle line:90%
been trying to shut him up.

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:52.580 align:middle line:84%
They don't want us to
have our focus on Mars.

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And they refused to give
them or even talk to him.

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:58.434 align:middle line:84%
When he gave his
thing to NASA, they

00:25:58.434 --> 00:25:59.850 align:middle line:84%
were not going to
let him in there

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:04.620 align:middle line:84%
because I was just talking to
Keith right before he got that.

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:06.790 align:middle line:90%
Keith Morgan of ABC.

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:07.740 align:middle line:90%
I talked to him.

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:10.550 align:middle line:84%
He called me on the phone,
and we were discussing this.

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And the United
Nations was not going

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.940 align:middle line:84%
to allow Richard
Hoagland to even present

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:18.414 align:middle line:84%
the information that he
had about the face on Mars

00:26:18.414 --> 00:26:19.330 align:middle line:90%
in the United Nations.

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And the only reason they
did was because ABC said,

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:25.310 align:middle line:90%
if they didn't, they would.

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And so when they
found out that ABC

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:32.600 align:middle line:84%
was going to air
what Richard said,

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:36.460 align:middle line:84%
then the United Nations
agreed, reluctantly,

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:40.414 align:middle line:90%
to let him do that.

00:26:40.414 --> 00:26:42.830 align:middle line:84%
But now, they've announced,
and I've got the article here,

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:45.790 align:middle line:84%
that they're going
to allow him to have

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:48.230 align:middle line:84%
the information, this
photograph, of the face

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:49.590 align:middle line:90%
because to shut people up.

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:51.595 align:middle line:84%
And they can ask him to
go back the other way.

00:26:51.595 --> 00:26:53.220 align:middle line:84%
But the reason they
don't want to do it

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:56.181 align:middle line:90%
is that's a military mission.

00:26:56.181 --> 00:26:57.650 align:middle line:90%
It's a military mission.

00:26:57.650 --> 00:26:59.480 align:middle line:90%
It's a reconnaissance mission.

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:03.287 align:middle line:84%
They're going to try to see
what's really out there.

00:27:03.287 --> 00:27:04.370 align:middle line:90%
Now while that's going on.

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:05.316 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm confused.

00:27:05.316 --> 00:27:08.160 align:middle line:90%
You said [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>>We've got to have a-- or
maybe I can just repeat it.

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:12.974 align:middle line:90%
>>Did you mean--

00:27:12.974 --> 00:27:14.210 align:middle line:90%
>>There it is.

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>>--invitation to get
to NASA [INAUDIBLE]?

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.436 align:middle line:90%
>>There it is.

00:27:19.436 --> 00:27:21.560 align:middle line:84%
>>I can't quite understand
what you're saying there

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:25.310 align:middle line:84%
because you mentioned that
it was a military operation,

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:27.264 align:middle line:84%
but the United
Nations didn't want

00:27:27.264 --> 00:27:28.430 align:middle line:90%
him to present the material?

00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:28.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NASA didn't.

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:29.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NASA.

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:30.520 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I think you
said [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:32.850 align:middle line:84%
>>The very first
one a long time ago.

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:37.271 align:middle line:90%
NASA didn't want him to talk.

00:27:37.271 --> 00:27:41.330 align:middle line:90%


00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:45.360 align:middle line:84%
NASA didn't want
him to talk at NASA.

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And it was ABC television that
forced that issue to take place

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:50.004 align:middle line:90%
if Keith Morgan is correct.

00:27:50.004 --> 00:27:50.804 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:27:50.804 --> 00:27:52.650 align:middle line:90%


00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:53.450 align:middle line:90%
>>Huh?

00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:54.470 align:middle line:90%
I said United Nations?

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:55.270 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:27:55.270 --> 00:28:04.660 align:middle line:90%


00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:11.540 align:middle line:84%
So here's-- this is so
transparent what the world is

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:12.356 align:middle line:90%
doing right now.

00:28:12.356 --> 00:28:15.372 align:middle line:90%


00:28:15.372 --> 00:28:16.830 align:middle line:84%
Let me turn this
on, just a minute.

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:21.730 align:middle line:90%


00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:23.200 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:35.960 align:middle line:90%


00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>>Just recently about
a year ago or so,

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:47.306 align:middle line:84%
someone announced that there
was going to be a comet.

00:28:47.306 --> 00:28:50.570 align:middle line:90%
Oh boy, copy.

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:52.935 align:middle line:84%
There was a comet coming
in called Swift-Tuttle.

00:28:52.935 --> 00:28:54.514 align:middle line:90%
Anybody heard of this?

00:28:54.514 --> 00:28:55.502 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:28:55.502 --> 00:28:56.399 align:middle line:90%
>>No?

00:28:56.399 --> 00:28:58.440 align:middle line:84%
This comet is supposed to
hit the earth on August

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:03.132 align:middle line:90%
14th in 2126, they think.

00:29:03.132 --> 00:29:04.400 align:middle line:90%
>>Swift-Tuttle.

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.650 align:middle line:90%
>>That's what they suspect.

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:06.450 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:11.330 align:middle line:90%


00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>>Well on course,
we're doomed, maybe.

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:18.200 align:middle line:84%
This was first announced in--
I don't know when they did it.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.620 align:middle line:84%
They announced this
about a year ago.

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And they have blown
this thing way up.

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:30.780 align:middle line:84%
So this is the actual photograph
of Swift-Tuttle coming in

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:33.440 align:middle line:84%
in a computer
enhanced photograph

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:36.350 align:middle line:90%
October 22nd, I think, 1988.

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:41.520 align:middle line:90%
I mean, 1992, probably.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.000 align:middle line:90%
Or no, maybe '91.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.004 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:29:44.004 --> 00:29:45.740 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:47.740 align:middle line:84%
>>It's all getting to
be a blur these days.

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.097 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:49.097 --> 00:29:51.180 align:middle line:84%
>>But anyway, this is the
actual photograph of it.

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:53.138 align:middle line:84%
And so they said this
thing is going to come in

00:29:53.138 --> 00:29:57.080 align:middle line:84%
and may hit us in 2146
or whatever it is.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And now they're saying now
they think it will miss.

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:02.137 align:middle line:84%
It's not even gonna
hit us anymore.

00:30:02.137 --> 00:30:04.220 align:middle line:84%
They're pretty sure that
it's going to come close,

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:05.810 align:middle line:90%
but it's not gonna hit us.

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:09.546 align:middle line:84%
And then, there's always
articles and things coming up.

00:30:09.546 --> 00:30:11.590 align:middle line:90%
The next one came out.

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:17.020 align:middle line:84%
All this press stuff coming out
showing how these comets have

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:20.530 align:middle line:84%
hit all over the earth,
asteroids, and here's

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:22.380 align:middle line:90%
a whole map of them.

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:25.010 align:middle line:84%
All these hits that
happened all over the earth.

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And they're telling us
that we're in real trouble.

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.400 align:middle line:84%
That we better prepare ourselves
because we're going to get

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.150 align:middle line:90%
hit by another comet someday.

00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:36.277 align:middle line:84%
And so the governments
of the world

00:30:36.277 --> 00:30:38.110 align:middle line:84%
are now-- this is one
of the latest article,

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:40.900 align:middle line:84%
but this is in one of the
science things of time,

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:42.810 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:46.140 align:middle line:84%
The governments of the
world are now building,

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:49.910 align:middle line:84%
or in the process of building,
a huge complex of missiles

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:53.110 align:middle line:84%
all over the world,
spending a fortune.

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:57.010 align:middle line:84%
The missiles are designed
to blow the comets out

00:30:57.010 --> 00:31:01.112 align:middle line:84%
of space when this
mythological comet comes along.

00:31:01.112 --> 00:31:02.470 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:05.188 align:middle line:84%
>>The next one in 2100 and
something years from now.

00:31:05.188 --> 00:31:06.860 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:08.925 align:middle line:84%
>>But they're going to
get prepared right now.

00:31:08.925 --> 00:31:10.170 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:10.970 align:middle line:90%


00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:13.640 align:middle line:84%
>>I mean, really, they're
really doing this.

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:16.410 align:middle line:84%
They're going to build this
whole complex of missiles

00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:19.820 align:middle line:84%
all over the world aimed
out in all directions.

00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:26.540 align:middle line:10%
And these are gonna have atomic
warheads and neutron bombs.

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:28.290 align:middle line:90%
Neutron bombs on them.

00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:30.240 align:middle line:84%
Right in there, it
talks all about it

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.050 align:middle line:84%
how they've decided
neutron bombs would

00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:34.724 align:middle line:84%
be really good for
deflecting these things.

00:31:34.724 --> 00:31:36.170 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:37.620 align:middle line:90%


00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:38.855 align:middle line:90%
>>This is just a scam.

00:31:38.855 --> 00:31:40.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what
they're really doing

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:45.490 align:middle line:84%
is trying to prepare
for war for the best

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:50.440 align:middle line:84%
that they can because they know
that somebody is out there.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.050 align:middle line:90%
And they're scared to death.

00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:54.430 align:middle line:84%
>>But I thought
they [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:57.080 align:middle line:84%
>>No, we're talking about
the outer governments now.

00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:00.540 align:middle line:90%
Clinton, these guys.

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:02.520 align:middle line:84%
Not too far removed
from you and me, really.

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.490 align:middle line:84%
>>Does Clinton not
really know about-- I

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:05.988 align:middle line:84%
mean, the Bushes
and Clintons know

00:32:05.988 --> 00:32:09.150 align:middle line:84%
about the secret government
and all this stuff?

00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>>I think they have a real
good idea about it, you know.

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.990 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know
if they know what

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:19.865 align:middle line:90%
they know on all the levels.

00:32:19.865 --> 00:32:23.590 align:middle line:84%
>>And who did all the work
with the secret government

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:25.620 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] building
all these facilities?

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:26.990 align:middle line:90%
>>Which facilities?

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:30.130 align:middle line:90%
>>On mars and the moon.

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:33.850 align:middle line:84%
>>Well I don't
know who this was.

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:38.456 align:middle line:84%
Mostly, I think it was
Russia, not the United States.

00:32:38.456 --> 00:32:41.400 align:middle line:84%
I think these were
mostly, primarily,

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:45.960 align:middle line:84%
since they were the 2,000 trips
that came up off of Russia

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.210 align:middle line:90%
were Russian based.

00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:48.320 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't use us.

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:53.416 align:middle line:84%
We're too exposed or
whatever you want to say.

00:32:53.416 --> 00:32:55.165 align:middle line:84%
>>There was a video
that came on in London

00:32:55.165 --> 00:32:58.588 align:middle line:84%
about all the British scientists
and European scientists that

00:32:58.588 --> 00:33:02.011 align:middle line:84%
have disappeared in the
same place [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:02.011 --> 00:33:03.530 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:04.363 align:middle line:90%
>>Alternative three.

00:33:04.363 --> 00:33:05.821 align:middle line:84%
Well that's another
example of what

00:33:05.821 --> 00:33:10.000 align:middle line:84%
happened before the
secret government became

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.600 align:middle line:84%
aware of the situation
that we're in.

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.430 align:middle line:84%
At that time, they
would eliminate

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:21.610 align:middle line:84%
anyone that tried to
expose what was going on.

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:24.610 align:middle line:84%
>>Oh, I thought they were saying
that those people had been

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:26.541 align:middle line:90%
taken up to mars to work there.

00:33:26.541 --> 00:33:28.926 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, that's what [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:28.926 --> 00:33:30.834 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, all right.

00:33:30.834 --> 00:33:33.350 align:middle line:90%
I did see part of that.

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:34.150 align:middle line:90%
I didn't get that.

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:36.044 align:middle line:90%
Is that what they said they did?

00:33:36.044 --> 00:33:37.002 align:middle line:90%
The took them up there?

00:33:37.002 --> 00:33:38.400 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE] mars.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.219 align:middle line:90%
>>They abducted them?

00:33:40.219 --> 00:33:42.191 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:42.191 --> 00:33:44.636 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:33:44.636 --> 00:33:46.750 align:middle line:84%
Some of the scientists
agree that there

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:48.110 align:middle line:90%
are others who they abducted.

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:52.151 align:middle line:84%
And they did some kind
of work on their brain

00:33:52.151 --> 00:33:55.280 align:middle line:84%
so that they don't
have memory or recall

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:57.930 align:middle line:84%
so they can program them,
reprogram, and then send them

00:33:57.930 --> 00:33:58.730 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:33:58.730 --> 00:33:59.580 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, there was a lot.

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:01.200 align:middle line:84%
They didn't even have to
do those kind of things,

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:02.000 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.570 align:middle line:90%
They got other things.

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:10.170 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, this is, I think, if
you just look into this deeper,

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:12.485 align:middle line:84%
you'll see this whole
complex of the money, and all

00:34:12.485 --> 00:34:14.610 align:middle line:84%
the scientists and everything
else that's going in.

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:16.690 align:middle line:84%
The incredible amount
of energy that's

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:19.290 align:middle line:84%
about to be entered
into this is just to,

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:24.436 align:middle line:90%
uh-- you know, maybe I'm wrong.

00:34:24.436 --> 00:34:28.506 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, to spend
the billions of dollars

00:34:28.506 --> 00:34:30.630 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking about,
the billions and billions

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:33.110 align:middle line:84%
of dollars, for the
possible comet that's

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:39.560 align:middle line:84%
going to come 150 years into
the future is pretty silly,

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:40.360 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:45.139 align:middle line:90%


00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:46.370 align:middle line:90%
And this is another one.

00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:50.000 align:middle line:84%
I realize I didn't get the
whole thing on here, are they.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.780 align:middle line:84%
NASA has also put up
a whole network now.

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Powerful radio and
telescope antennas

00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:00.130 align:middle line:84%
worldwide when they are
setting up specifically

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:06.380 align:middle line:84%
to listen to see if there's
any aliens out there.

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:11.590 align:middle line:84%
Very, very complex things
specifically looking what's

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:12.660 align:middle line:90%
going on.

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:15.250 align:middle line:90%
UN will decide how to answer.

00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:17.090 align:middle line:90%
This is the Palm Beach Post.

00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:23.280 align:middle line:84%
But I think they're
talking about certain Alpha

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Centauri and certain [INAUDIBLE]
that's something else.

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:34.250 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, they have
a problem right now.

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:37.129 align:middle line:84%
They have a real problem
because, I guess,

00:35:37.129 --> 00:35:38.670 align:middle line:84%
this is going to be
real interesting.

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:42.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you should follow the
satellite that's going to Mars

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:44.280 align:middle line:90%
and see what happens.

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'll bet you know anything
that those photographs are

00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:48.566 align:middle line:90%
going to be censored.

00:35:48.566 --> 00:35:50.440 align:middle line:84%
That we're probably not
going to see anything

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:53.760 align:middle line:84%
that comes back from
there, if it even does

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:56.140 align:middle line:90%
get any photographs.

00:35:56.140 --> 00:36:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And the may give Richard his
one photograph of what he wants.

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:05.460 align:middle line:84%
But I bet you're not
going to get anything

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:07.961 align:middle line:90%
like you might expect.

00:36:07.961 --> 00:36:11.440 align:middle line:84%
>>Have you seen a
current video of the new

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:14.422 align:middle line:90%
faces they found on mars?

00:36:14.422 --> 00:36:16.410 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:17.901 align:middle line:90%
>>I just--

00:36:17.901 --> 00:36:19.889 align:middle line:90%
>>Who's they?

00:36:19.889 --> 00:36:21.449 align:middle line:84%
>>I don't want to
give any names.

00:36:21.449 --> 00:36:23.490 align:middle line:84%
>>What I'm saying is how
could they because there

00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:26.250 align:middle line:90%
hasn't been any satellites.

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:30.434 align:middle line:84%
>>Well there's-- OK, I just
came from one of those UFO

00:36:30.434 --> 00:36:31.234 align:middle line:90%
conferences.

00:36:31.234 --> 00:36:33.218 align:middle line:84%
And so avoid going
to one of those.

00:36:33.218 --> 00:36:38.178 align:middle line:84%
You can get all the
proof you want for this.

00:36:38.178 --> 00:36:42.642 align:middle line:84%
It's just that the energy is
so based on fear and anger.

00:36:42.642 --> 00:36:44.130 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:47.110 align:middle line:90%
>>There was--

00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:49.130 align:middle line:84%
>>Well I don't mean to
put you on the spot.

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:52.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying
there hasn't been

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:56.120 align:middle line:84%
a satellite that's made it
to Mars, that I know of,

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:59.130 align:middle line:90%
for some time.

00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:00.130 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:05.900 align:middle line:84%
I will get the information
and then, and get it to you.

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:07.450 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:12.070 align:middle line:90%
