00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:50.655 align:middle line:90%


00:00:50.655 --> 00:00:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>>As far back as I can remember
into earliest childhood,

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.840 align:middle line:84%
I've always been
absolutely fascinated

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.220 align:middle line:90%
with the idea of death.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.580 align:middle line:84%
Now you may think
that's kind of morbid.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.600 align:middle line:84%
But you know when
a child at night

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.585 align:middle line:84%
says the phrase "if I
should die before I wake?"

00:01:14.585 --> 00:01:18.260 align:middle line:84%
There's something about it
that's absolutely weird.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.900 align:middle line:84%
What would it be like to go
to sleep and never wake up?

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.440 align:middle line:90%


00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.520 align:middle line:84%
Now most reasonable people
just dismiss the thought.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.740 align:middle line:84%
They say, you
can't imagine that.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.650 align:middle line:84%
They shrug their shoulders and
say, well, that'll be that.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.680 align:middle line:84%
But I suppose I'm one of
those ornery people who

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.610 align:middle line:84%
aren't content with
and answer like that.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.310 align:middle line:90%


00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.920 align:middle line:84%
Not that I'm trying to find
something else beyond that,

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.200 align:middle line:84%
but that I'm just absolutely
fascinated with what it would

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.570 align:middle line:84%
be like to go to sleep
and never wake up.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean-- Lots of
people think it will

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.170 align:middle line:84%
be like going into the dark
forever or being buried alive.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.880 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, it wouldn't
be like that at all.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.880 align:middle line:90%


00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:19.350 align:middle line:84%
Because we know darkness by
contrast, and only by contrast,

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.370 align:middle line:90%
with light.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.880 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend,
a girl, who's very

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.330 align:middle line:84%
intelligent and articulate,
and she was born blind.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.085 align:middle line:84%
And she hasn't the faintest
idea what darkness is.

00:02:31.085 --> 00:02:34.120 align:middle line:90%


00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.050 align:middle line:84%
The word means as little
to her as the word light.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.590 align:middle line:90%


00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.110 align:middle line:84%
So if you went to
sleep, you're not

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.110 align:middle line:84%
aware of darkness
when you're asleep.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.730 align:middle line:90%


00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And so if you went into
sleep, into unconsciousness

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.300 align:middle line:84%
for always and
always and always,

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.550 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't be at all
like going into the dark.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.585 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't be at all
like being buried alive.

00:03:01.585 --> 00:03:05.150 align:middle line:90%


00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.820 align:middle line:84%
It would be as if,
as a matter of fact,

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:14.310 align:middle line:84%
you had never existed
at all-- not only you,

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.520 align:middle line:90%
but everything else as well.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:24.320 align:middle line:84%
You would be in that state
as if you had never been.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And there, of course,
there would be no problems.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.680 align:middle line:84%
There would be no one to
regret the loss of anything.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.320 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't even
call it a tragedy,

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.930 align:middle line:84%
because there would be no one
to experience it as a tragedy.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:49.520 align:middle line:84%
It would be simple, nothing
at all forever and for never.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.420 align:middle line:84%
Because not only would
you have no future,

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.265 align:middle line:84%
you would also have no
past and no present.

00:03:56.265 --> 00:04:00.737 align:middle line:90%


00:04:00.737 --> 00:04:02.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, you would think that
that was the point where

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.450 align:middle line:84%
we would say, well, let's
talk about something else.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.450 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not content with that.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.930 align:middle line:90%
I demure.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Because this makes me
think of two other things.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.285 align:middle line:84%
This state of nothingness
makes me think, first

00:04:20.285 --> 00:04:27.010 align:middle line:84%
of all-- the only
thing I get anywhere

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.880 align:middle line:84%
in my experience that's
close to nothingness

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.135 align:middle line:84%
is the way my head
looks to my eyes.

00:04:32.135 --> 00:04:36.310 align:middle line:90%


00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Because I seem to feel that
there is a world out there,

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.240 align:middle line:90%
as it were, confronting my eyes.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And then behind my eyes
there isn't a black spot.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.320 align:middle line:90%
There isn't even a hazy spot.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.960 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing at all.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm not aware of my head,
as it were, as a black hole

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.845 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of all this
luminous visual experience.

00:05:04.845 --> 00:05:08.460 align:middle line:90%


00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.400 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't even have
very clear edges,

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.860 align:middle line:84%
because the field of
vision is an oval.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And if I run my fingers
along my field of vision,

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:18.550 align:middle line:90%
it's like this.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is the point
where my fingers just

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.130 align:middle line:84%
disappear from
sight, vague-edged.

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:30.840 align:middle line:84%
But then behind this oval of
vision there is nothing at all,

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.620 align:middle line:90%
just from the sense of sight.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.100 align:middle line:84%
Of course, if I use
my fingers and touch,

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.350 align:middle line:84%
I can feel something
behind my eyes.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.090 align:middle line:84%
But if I use the
sense of sight alone,

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.570 align:middle line:84%
there's just nothing
there at all.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.680 align:middle line:90%


00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:55.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, nevertheless, out
of that blankness I see.

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.040 align:middle line:90%


00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the first
thing it makes me think of.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.810 align:middle line:84%
Now the next thing it
makes me think of is this.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:09.750 align:middle line:84%
If when I'm dead I am
as if I never had been,

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.360 align:middle line:84%
then that's the way I
was before I was born.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.000 align:middle line:84%
Because just as if I try
to go back behind my eyes

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.450 align:middle line:84%
and find what is there
I come to a blank,

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.000 align:middle line:84%
if I try to remember
back and back

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.290 align:middle line:84%
and back and back, I've got
my earliest memories and then

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:32.810 align:middle line:84%
behind them nothing,
total blank.

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.650 align:middle line:84%
But just as I know there's
something behind my eyes

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.390 align:middle line:84%
by using my fingers
on my head, so I

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:41.390 align:middle line:84%
know through other
sources of information

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.520 align:middle line:84%
that before I was born there
was something going on.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.180 align:middle line:84%
There were my
father and my mother

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.850 align:middle line:84%
and their fathers and mothers
and the whole material

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.020 align:middle line:84%
environment of the
Earth and its life

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.380 align:middle line:84%
out of which they came and
behind that the solar system

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:03.910 align:middle line:84%
and behind that the galaxy and
behind that all the galaxies

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:07.915 align:middle line:84%
and behind that
another blank, space.

00:07:07.915 --> 00:07:12.380 align:middle line:90%


00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:19.320 align:middle line:84%
So, I reason that
if I go back when

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:25.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm dead to the state where
I was before I was born,

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:28.180 align:middle line:90%
couldn't I happen again?

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.660 align:middle line:84%
What has happened once can
very well happen again.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:35.020 align:middle line:84%
If it happened once,
it's extraordinary,

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.430 align:middle line:84%
and it's not really very
much more extraordinary

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:41.820 align:middle line:90%
if it happened all over again.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:45.790 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, I
do know for certain,

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:49.020 align:middle line:84%
because I've seen
people die and I've

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.960 align:middle line:84%
seen people born
after them, that

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:59.730 align:middle line:84%
at any rate after I die not
only somebody but myriads

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:01.330 align:middle line:90%
of other beings will be born.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.990 align:middle line:90%


00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.650 align:middle line:90%
That I know.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:05.860 align:middle line:90%
We all know that.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:06.980 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt about it.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.910 align:middle line:90%


00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:18.560 align:middle line:84%
But what worries us is
that when we're dead

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:23.430 align:middle line:84%
there could be nothing
at all forever,

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:27.590 align:middle line:84%
as if that was something
to worry about.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.480 align:middle line:84%
Before you were born, there
was this same nothing at all

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.059 align:middle line:90%
forever, and yet you happened.

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:35.169 align:middle line:90%


00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:38.159 align:middle line:84%
And if you happen once,
you can happen again.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:41.059 align:middle line:90%


00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:44.400 align:middle line:90%
Now what does that mean?

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, we'll get at it first
in its very simplest way.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And to explain myself, I
must invent a new verb.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:57.990 align:middle line:84%
This is the verb to I.
And in the first place,

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:02.020 align:middle line:84%
we'll spell that
with the letter I,

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:06.000 align:middle line:84%
but instead of having it as a
pronoun we'll call it a verb.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.600 align:middle line:90%
The universe I-s.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.690 align:middle line:84%
It has I-ed in me
and it I-s in you.

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:17.830 align:middle line:84%
Now let's re-spell
the word E-Y-E.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:20.790 align:middle line:84%
When I talk about
to eye something,

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:24.776 align:middle line:84%
it means to look at something,
to be aware of something.

00:09:24.776 --> 00:09:26.400 align:middle line:84%
So we'll change the
spelling, and we'll

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.880 align:middle line:90%
say the universe eyes.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.470 align:middle line:84%
It becomes aware of
itself in each one of us.

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:36.360 align:middle line:90%
And it keeps on eyeing.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And every time it eyes, every
one of us in whom it eyes

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:44.300 align:middle line:84%
feels that he is the
center of the whole thing

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:48.850 align:middle line:84%
and that I know that
you feel that you are I

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:53.210 align:middle line:84%
in just the same way
that I feel that I am I.

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And we all have the same
background of nothing.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.830 align:middle line:84%
We don't remember
having done it before,

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:03.250 align:middle line:84%
and yet it has been done before,
again and again and again.

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:05.800 align:middle line:84%
Not only before in
time, but all around us

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.280 align:middle line:84%
everywhere else in
space is everybody,

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.550 align:middle line:90%
is the universe eyeing.

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:12.180 align:middle line:90%


00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, look, let me try and
make this clear in this way.

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:21.520 align:middle line:84%
When I say it's the universe
I-ing, who is I-ing?

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.049 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by I?

00:10:24.049 --> 00:10:25.965 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are two
things you can mean by it.

00:10:25.965 --> 00:10:31.690 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand, you could
mean what's called your ego,

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:33.930 align:middle line:90%
your personality.

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:39.100 align:middle line:84%
But that's not your real
I-ing, because your personality

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:40.840 align:middle line:90%
is your idea of yourself.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.790 align:middle line:90%
It's your image of yourself.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's made up of
how you feel yourself,

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.550 align:middle line:84%
how you think about
yourself, thrown in

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.920 align:middle line:84%
with what all your friends
and relations have told you

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.545 align:middle line:90%
about yourself.

00:10:53.545 --> 00:10:56.390 align:middle line:90%


00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:59.780 align:middle line:84%
So your image of yourself,
however, obviously

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:04.852 align:middle line:84%
isn't you any more than
your photograph is you

00:11:04.852 --> 00:11:11.220 align:middle line:84%
or any more than the
image of anything is it.

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:15.620 align:middle line:84%
All our images of ourselves are
nothing more than caricatures.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.640 align:middle line:84%
They contain no
information, for most of us,

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:22.260 align:middle line:84%
on how we grow our brains,
how we work our nerves,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.820 align:middle line:84%
how we circulate our blood,
how we secrete with our glands,

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.680 align:middle line:90%
and how we shape our bones.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.450 align:middle line:84%
That isn't contained in
the sensation or the image

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:32.950 align:middle line:90%
we call the ego.

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:36.110 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, then, the
ego image is not myself.

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:40.890 align:middle line:90%


00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:46.370 align:middle line:84%
So myself contains
all these factors

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:49.550 align:middle line:84%
that we could say
the body is doing.

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:53.180 align:middle line:84%
The circulation of the
blood, the breathing,

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:57.290 align:middle line:84%
the electrical activity of
the nerves, all this is me,

00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:59.400 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know
anything about it.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
it came together.

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:03.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
it's constructed.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.023 align:middle line:90%
And yet I do all that.

00:12:06.023 --> 00:12:08.860 align:middle line:90%


00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:12.300 align:middle line:84%
If it is true also
to say I breathe.

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:13.200 align:middle line:90%
I walk.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:13.760 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.720 align:middle line:90%
I am conscious.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how I managed to
be, but I do it in the same way

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:21.610 align:middle line:90%
as I grow my hair.

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:25.240 align:middle line:90%


00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:34.750 align:middle line:84%
So I must, therefore, locate
the center of me, my I-ing,

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:38.180 align:middle line:84%
at a deeper level
than my ego, which

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:41.760 align:middle line:90%
is my image or idea of myself.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.530 align:middle line:90%
But how deep do we go?

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:53.230 align:middle line:84%
We can say the body is the
I, but the body comes out

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:56.810 align:middle line:84%
of the rest of the universe,
comes out of all its energy.

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:59.220 align:middle line:84%
So it's the universe
that's I-ing.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:03.200 align:middle line:84%
The universe I-s in the
same way that a tree apples

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.470 align:middle line:90%
or that a star shines.

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And the center of the
appling is the tree.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:13.070 align:middle line:84%
The center of the
shining is the star.

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And so the basic center or self
of the I-ing which is called,

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:23.950 align:middle line:84%
in this case, Alan
Watts, which is

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:29.060 align:middle line:84%
only a name for this
particular physical organism

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:35.990 align:middle line:84%
flowering from, shining out of
this particular environment,

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:41.560 align:middle line:84%
makes the center of all this
I-ing the eternal universe.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.420 align:middle line:90%
Oh, eternal.

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:47.580 align:middle line:84%
The thing has existed
for 10,000 million years

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:51.990 align:middle line:84%
and will probably go on for
at least that much more,

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:56.490 align:middle line:84%
so we won't worry about
how long it goes on.

00:13:56.490 --> 00:14:04.690 align:middle line:84%
But repeatedly,
it I-s, so that it

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:06.720 align:middle line:84%
seems to me
absolutely reasonable

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:13.330 align:middle line:84%
to assume that when I die
and this physical body

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:18.000 align:middle line:84%
evaporates and the whole
memory system with it,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:25.370 align:middle line:84%
then it will be all over once
again the awareness that I

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:29.860 align:middle line:84%
had before, not exactly the same
way, but of a baby being born.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:34.680 align:middle line:90%


00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.650 align:middle line:84%
There will, of course, be
myriads of babies born,

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:43.000 align:middle line:84%
not only baby human beings but
baby frogs, baby rabbits, baby

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.400 align:middle line:84%
fruit flies, baby
viruses, baby bacteria.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And which one of them
am I going to be?

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.430 align:middle line:90%


00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:57.400 align:middle line:84%
Only one of them, and
yet every one of them--

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.460 align:middle line:84%
because this
experience comes always

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:04.150 align:middle line:84%
in the singular, one at a time--
but certainly one of them.

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:05.950 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it doesn't
make much difference.

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:09.990 align:middle line:84%
Because if I were born
again as a fruit fly,

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:11.950 align:middle line:84%
I would think that
being a fruit fly

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:14.950 align:middle line:84%
was the normal, ordinary
course of events.

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And naturally, I would think
that I was an important person,

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:22.440 align:middle line:84%
a highly cultured being,
because fruit flies obviously

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.130 align:middle line:90%
have a high culture.

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:26.350 align:middle line:84%
We don't even know
how to look for it,

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:30.420 align:middle line:84%
but probably they have all
sorts of symphonies and music

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.050 align:middle line:84%
and artistic performances
in the way light

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:35.600 align:middle line:84%
is reflected on their
wings in different ways,

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.380 align:middle line:90%
the way they dance in the air.

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:38.710 align:middle line:90%
And they say, oh, look at her.

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:40.230 align:middle line:90%
She has real style.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:43.180 align:middle line:84%
Look how the sunlight
comes off her wings.

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And they, in their
world, think they're

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:48.650 align:middle line:84%
as important and as civilized
as we do in our world,

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:51.260 align:middle line:84%
so that if I were to
wake up as a fruit fly,

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.090 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't feel any
different, as it

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:56.110 align:middle line:84%
were, than I do when I
wake up as a human being.

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:59.410 align:middle line:90%
I would be used to it.

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:02.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, you say, though,
it wouldn't be me.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:05.140 align:middle line:84%
Because if it would
be me again, I

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:09.122 align:middle line:84%
would have to remember
how I was before.

00:16:09.122 --> 00:16:09.625 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:16:09.625 --> 00:16:13.920 align:middle line:84%
But you don't now remember
how you were before,

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:19.610 align:middle line:84%
and yet you're content enough
to be the me that you are.

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:23.580 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's a thoroughly
good arrangement in this world

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:26.150 align:middle line:84%
that we don't remember
what it was before.

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:27.470 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:32.690 align:middle line:84%
Because variety is the spice
of life, and if we remembered,

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:36.000 align:middle line:84%
remembered, remembered having
done this again and again

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.720 align:middle line:84%
and again and again,
we should get bored.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.970 align:middle line:90%


00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And just as a memory is a
beautiful thing to have,

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:49.990 align:middle line:84%
to remember, without memory
we can't be intelligent.

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:54.900 align:middle line:84%
But just as I have explained
that in order to see the figure

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:58.260 align:middle line:84%
you have to have the background,
in order that a memory be

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.960 align:middle line:84%
valuable, you've also
got to have a forgetory.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.310 align:middle line:84%
That's why we sleep every
night to refresh ourselves.

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:08.319 align:middle line:84%
We go into the unconscious
so that coming back

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:12.069 align:middle line:84%
to the conscious is
again a great experience.

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:16.339 align:middle line:84%
Well, when that's gone on long
enough, when day after day we

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:19.420 align:middle line:84%
remember the days that have
gone before, even though there's

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:23.290 align:middle line:84%
the interval of sleep,
there comes a point when,

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:28.250 align:middle line:84%
really, if we consider
what is to our true liking,

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:32.900 align:middle line:84%
we will want to forget
everything that went before so

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.930 align:middle line:84%
that we can have the
extraordinary experience

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:39.940 align:middle line:84%
of seeing the world once again
through the eyes of a baby,

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:44.320 align:middle line:84%
whatever kind of baby, so
that it's completely new.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.800 align:middle line:84%
We have all the startling
wonder that a child

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.970 align:middle line:84%
has, all the vividness
of perception,

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:53.010 align:middle line:84%
which we can't have if we
remember everything forever.

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:54.490 align:middle line:90%
So do you see what happens?

00:17:54.490 --> 00:18:02.070 align:middle line:84%
The universe is a system
which not only forgets itself

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:07.860 align:middle line:84%
and then again remembers
anew so that there's always

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:11.330 align:middle line:84%
this constant change
and constant variety

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:16.290 align:middle line:84%
in the span of time, but it also
does it in the span of space

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:21.290 align:middle line:84%
by looking at itself through
every different living organism

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:25.960 align:middle line:84%
to give, as it were,
an all round view.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.900 align:middle line:84%
That's a way of getting
rid of prejudice,

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.440 align:middle line:90%
getting rid of a one-sided view.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.400 align:middle line:90%


00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:41.220 align:middle line:84%
So death, in that sense,
is a tremendous release

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.740 align:middle line:90%
from monotony.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:46.220 align:middle line:84%
It puts an interval
of total forgetting

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:50.860 align:middle line:84%
in a rhythmic process of
on and off, on and off so

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:57.240 align:middle line:84%
that you can begin all over
again and never be bored.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:00.700 align:middle line:84%
But the point is
that if you fantasize

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:04.120 align:middle line:84%
the idea of being nothing
for always and always

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:11.580 align:middle line:84%
and always, what you're really
saying is after I'm dead,

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:12.470 align:middle line:90%
the universe stops.

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:17.150 align:middle line:90%


00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm saying
is, no, it goes on,

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:24.420 align:middle line:84%
just as it did
when you were born.

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:27.300 align:middle line:84%
You see, you may say that
you think it incredible

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:30.360 align:middle line:84%
that you have more
than one life.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:33.230 align:middle line:84%
But I say, first of
all, isn't it incredible

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:36.270 align:middle line:90%
that you have this one?

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:39.790 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it incredible that
out of the nothing that

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:42.621 align:middle line:90%
is your past, here you are?

00:19:42.621 --> 00:19:45.550 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's astonishing.

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:49.595 align:middle line:84%
So if that's astonishing, it can
always happen again and again

00:19:49.595 --> 00:19:50.095 align:middle line:90%
and again.

00:19:50.095 --> 00:19:53.560 align:middle line:90%


00:19:53.560 --> 00:20:01.700 align:middle line:84%
Now what this is
saying, then, is

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:07.940 align:middle line:84%
that just as you don't know
how you manage to be conscious,

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:14.360 align:middle line:84%
how you manage to grow and
shape this body of yours,

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:18.120 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't mean to say
that you're not doing it.

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:27.060 align:middle line:84%
Equally, you don't know how
the universe shines the stars,

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:31.410 align:middle line:84%
constellates the constellation,
and galactifies the galaxies.

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:34.370 align:middle line:90%
You don't know.

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:39.360 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean to
say that you aren't doing it

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.340 align:middle line:84%
in just the same way
as you're breathing

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.840 align:middle line:90%
without knowing how you breathe.

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.430 align:middle line:90%


00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:50.400 align:middle line:84%
If I say really and truly
I am this whole universe,

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.940 align:middle line:84%
or put it in another way,
this particular organism

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:57.732 align:middle line:84%
is an I-ing being done
by the whole universe,

00:20:57.732 --> 00:20:59.190 align:middle line:84%
and somebody could
say to me, well,

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:00.740 align:middle line:84%
who the hell do
you think you are?

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.100 align:middle line:90%
Are you God?

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.720 align:middle line:90%
Do you warm up the galaxies?

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:09.270 align:middle line:84%
Canst thou bind the sweet
influences of the Pleiades

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:11.910 align:middle line:90%
or loosen the bonds of Orion?

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And I reply to that, who the
hell do you think you are?

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell me how
you grow your brain,

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:22.390 align:middle line:84%
how you shape your eyeballs,
and how you manage to see?

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you can't tell
me that, I can't tell you

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:29.670 align:middle line:84%
how I warm up the
galaxy, only I've

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:34.910 align:middle line:84%
located the center of myself
at a deeper and a more

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:41.790 align:middle line:84%
universal level than we are in
our culture accustomed to do.

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:44.620 align:middle line:90%


00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:52.140 align:middle line:84%
So then, if that
universal energy

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:57.010 align:middle line:84%
is the real me,
the real self which

00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:00.280 align:middle line:84%
I-s as all these different
organisms spread out

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:04.070 align:middle line:84%
in different spaces or
places and happening

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:09.080 align:middle line:84%
again and again and
again at different times,

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:12.630 align:middle line:84%
we've got a marvellous
system going

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:16.770 align:middle line:84%
in which you can be
eternally surprised.

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:18.870 align:middle line:84%
The universe is
really a system which

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:20.350 align:middle line:90%
keeps on surprising itself.

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:24.030 align:middle line:90%


00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:26.870 align:middle line:84%
The ambition that many
of us have, especially

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:30.080 align:middle line:84%
in an age of
technological competence,

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:36.060 align:middle line:84%
to have everything
under our control

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:38.150 align:middle line:84%
is a false ambition,
because you've only

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:41.430 align:middle line:84%
got to think for one moment
what would it be like if you did

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:43.650 align:middle line:84%
really know and
control everything.

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:46.690 align:middle line:84%
Supposing we had a super
colossal technology

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:49.310 align:middle line:84%
which could go to
our wildest dreams

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:52.020 align:middle line:84%
of technological competence
so that everything that

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:55.510 align:middle line:84%
is going to happen would
be foreknown, predicted,

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:57.285 align:middle line:84%
and everything would
be under our control.

00:22:57.285 --> 00:23:00.520 align:middle line:90%


00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:05.900 align:middle line:84%
Why, you know, it would be like
making love to a plastic woman.

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:11.950 align:middle line:84%
There would be no surprise in
it, no sudden answering touch,

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:13.540 align:middle line:84%
as when we touch
another human being

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:15.800 align:middle line:84%
it's not like touching
something made of plastic.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:19.980 align:middle line:84%
There comes out a response,
something unexpected.

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
really want when

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:26.270 align:middle line:90%
we want to relate to the other.

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:28.650 align:middle line:84%
You see, you can't
experience the feeling

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:33.690 align:middle line:84%
you call self unless
it's in contrast

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:35.620 align:middle line:90%
with the feeling of other.

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:38.270 align:middle line:84%
It's like known and
unknown, light and dark,

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:40.020 align:middle line:90%
positive and negative.

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:44.820 align:middle line:84%
Other is necessary in
order for you to feel self.

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:49.980 align:middle line:90%


00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:55.210 align:middle line:84%
So then, isn't that the
arrangement you want?

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And so, in the same
way, couldn't you

00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:00.640 align:middle line:84%
say the arrangement you
want is not to remember.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Memory is always, remember,
a form of control.

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:04.740 align:middle line:90%
I've got it in mind.

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:05.450 align:middle line:90%
I remember it.

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:07.020 align:middle line:90%
I know your number.

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:08.560 align:middle line:90%
You're under control.

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Now if you go on remembering
and remembering and remembering,

00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:14.180 align:middle line:84%
it's like writing
on a piece of paper

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:16.680 align:middle line:84%
and going on writing and writing
and writing until there's

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.240 align:middle line:84%
no white space
left on the paper.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:25.090 align:middle line:84%
Your memory is
filled up, and so you

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:30.240 align:middle line:84%
need to wipe it all clean so
that you have a white paper

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:34.327 align:middle line:84%
all over again and can begin
to write on it once more.

00:24:34.327 --> 00:24:37.190 align:middle line:90%


00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:41.110 align:middle line:84%
So that's what
death does for us.

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:42.580 align:middle line:90%
It wipes the slate clean.

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And also, looking at it from
the point of view of population

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:53.590 align:middle line:84%
and the human organism
on the planet,

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:56.630 align:middle line:90%
it keeps cleaning us out.

00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of a
technology which

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:02.230 align:middle line:84%
would enable each one
of us to be immortal

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:04.290 align:middle line:84%
would be something that
would progressively

00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:09.730 align:middle line:84%
crowd the planet with
people with hopelessly

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:12.780 align:middle line:90%
crowded memories.

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:15.580 align:middle line:84%
They would, as it were, be
like people living in a house

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:18.540 align:middle line:84%
where they'd accumulated
so much property,

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:23.130 align:middle line:84%
so many books, so many vases, so
many sets of knives and forks,

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:26.690 align:middle line:84%
so many tables and chairs,
so many newspapers that there

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:29.650 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't be any
room to move around.

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:35.920 align:middle line:84%
To live we need space, and
space is a kind of nothingness,

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.510 align:middle line:84%
and death is a kind
of nothingness.

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:39.540 align:middle line:90%
It's all the same principle.

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And by putting blocks, as it
were, or spaces of nothingness,

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:48.090 align:middle line:84%
spaces of space in between
spaces of something,

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:52.450 align:middle line:84%
we get life properly spaced
out, to use the German word

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:55.680 align:middle line:90%
lebensraum, room for living.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:26:00.860 align:middle line:84%
That's what's space gives us,
and that's what death gives us.

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:02.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, look, notice that
in everything I've

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:06.800 align:middle line:84%
said about death, I
haven't brought in anything

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:09.680 align:middle line:90%
that I could call spookery.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.090 align:middle line:84%
I haven't brought in any
information about anything

00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:13.470 align:middle line:90%
that you don't already know.

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:16.110 align:middle line:90%


00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:18.960 align:middle line:84%
I haven't invoked any
mysterious knowledge

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:25.270 align:middle line:84%
about souls, memory of former
lives, anything like that.

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:27.030 align:middle line:84%
I've just talked
about it in terms

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:30.060 align:middle line:84%
that we already know
so that if you say,

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:34.360 align:middle line:84%
well, all this idea that people
have of life beyond the grave

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:39.640 align:middle line:84%
is just wishful thinking,
I say, OK, I'll grant that.

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.510 align:middle line:84%
Let's assume that that
is wishful thinking

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:46.391 align:middle line:84%
and that when we're dead
there just won't be anything.

00:26:46.391 --> 00:26:46.890 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:50.059 align:middle line:90%
Let's face that fact.

00:26:50.059 --> 00:26:50.850 align:middle line:90%
That'll be the end.

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:53.400 align:middle line:90%


00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.639 align:middle line:84%
Now notice, first of
all, that's the worst

00:26:55.639 --> 00:26:56.680 align:middle line:90%
thing you've got to fear.

00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:00.860 align:middle line:90%


00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:03.280 align:middle line:90%
Does it frighten you?

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:06.280 align:middle line:84%
Who's going to be
afraid supposing

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:07.545 align:middle line:90%
it ends, no more problems?

00:27:07.545 --> 00:27:12.540 align:middle line:90%


00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:16.730 align:middle line:84%
But then you will see that this
nothingness, if you followed

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:20.710 align:middle line:84%
my argument, is something,
as it were, you bounce off

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:22.970 align:middle line:84%
from again, just as you
bounced in the first place

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:23.840 align:middle line:90%
when you were born.

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:25.630 align:middle line:90%
You bounced out of nothingness.

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:31.240 align:middle line:84%
Nothingness is a kind of
bounce, because it implies--

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.900 align:middle line:90%
the nothing implies something.

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:38.400 align:middle line:84%
So you bounce back all
new, all different, nothing

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.270 align:middle line:84%
to compare it with before,
a refreshing experience.

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:44.330 align:middle line:90%


00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And if, therefore,
you get this sense,

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:54.510 align:middle line:84%
just like you've got the sense
of nothing behind your eyes,

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:58.050 align:middle line:84%
get the sense of
nothingness, very powerful,

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:03.340 align:middle line:84%
frisky nothingness
underlying your whole being

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:06.670 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing in that
nothing to be afraid of,

00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:09.050 align:middle line:84%
then with that sense
you can come on

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:12.930 align:middle line:84%
like a person for
whom the rest of life

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:15.710 align:middle line:84%
is gravy because
you're already dead.

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:17.026 align:middle line:90%
You know you're going to die.

00:28:17.026 --> 00:28:18.400 align:middle line:84%
We say there's
one thing certain,

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.820 align:middle line:90%
which is death and taxes.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And the death of
each one of us now

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:28.310 align:middle line:84%
is as certain as
it would be if we

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:32.780 align:middle line:84%
were going to die
five minutes from now.

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:33.850 align:middle line:90%
So where's your anxiety?

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:35.740 align:middle line:90%
Where's your hang-up?

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:40.230 align:middle line:84%
Regard yourself
as dead already so

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:42.492 align:middle line:90%
that you have nothing to lose.

00:28:42.492 --> 00:28:45.430 align:middle line:84%
A Turkish proverb says,
"he who sleeps on the floor

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:47.890 align:middle line:90%
will not fall out of bed."

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:49.620 align:middle line:84%
So, in the same
way, the person who

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:54.000 align:middle line:90%
regards himself as already dead.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, you are
virtually nothing.

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:59.830 align:middle line:84%
100 years from now, you'll
be a handful of dust.

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:01.220 align:middle line:90%
That'll be for real.

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:01.720 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.880 align:middle line:90%
Act on that reality.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And out of that nothing, you
will suddenly surprise yourself

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:12.840 align:middle line:84%
that the more you
know you're nothing,

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:15.360 align:middle line:84%
the more you'll
amount to something.

00:29:15.360 --> 00:30:02.000 align:middle line:90%
