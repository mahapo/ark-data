[GONG]

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:26.920 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.890 align:middle line:90%
>>Welcome to my home.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.240 align:middle line:84%
We're aboard the
ferry boat "Vallejo,"

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.970 align:middle line:84%
which is tied up at the
north end of Sausalito,

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.070 align:middle line:90%
close to San Francisco.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.140 align:middle line:90%
And this is where I live.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And you may think this
place is rather weird.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.210 align:middle line:84%
But that's because I've
always loved weird things.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.230 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I was
a little boy, people

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.880 align:middle line:84%
used to say to me,
Alan, you're so weird.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.930 align:middle line:84%
Why can't you be
like other people?

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, I thought that
was just plain dull,

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.030 align:middle line:84%
like having the same thing
for dinner every day.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And as is well said, variety
is the spice of life.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.080 align:middle line:84%
So, you will indeed find
this place rather strange.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:18.070 align:middle line:90%


00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.001 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
things that are weird

00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:24.430 align:middle line:84%
are weird because
they are just obvious

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.470 align:middle line:90%
and nobody ever thinks of them.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.130 align:middle line:84%
Some of the most fascinating
scientific discoveries

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.610 align:middle line:84%
have been made by people who
called ordinary common sense

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.680 align:middle line:90%
in question.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Like, anybody can see
that the earth is flat,

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.190 align:middle line:90%
and people know it's flat.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.979 align:middle line:84%
And calling that fundamental
assumption in question

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.520 align:middle line:84%
is really the
beginning of geography.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.720 align:middle line:90%


00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And when I think
over the weirdest

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.510 align:middle line:84%
of all things I can think
of, you know what it is?

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:55.010 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.640 align:middle line:90%


00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.480 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea of
nothing is something

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.750 align:middle line:84%
that has bugged people
for centuries, especially

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.650 align:middle line:90%
in the West.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.310 align:middle line:84%
Because we have a
saying in Latin,

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.120 align:middle line:84%
ex nihilo nihil fit, which
means that out of nothing

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.810 align:middle line:90%
comes nothing.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.600 align:middle line:84%
You can't, in other words,
get something out of nothing.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's occurred
to me that this

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.045 align:middle line:84%
is a fallacy of
tremendous proportions

00:02:28.045 --> 00:02:32.210 align:middle line:84%
that lies at the root
of all our common sense,

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.450 align:middle line:84%
not only in the West, but in
many parts of the East as well.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.447 align:middle line:84%
And it comes up as a kind of
terror of nothing, a put down

00:02:39.447 --> 00:02:41.780 align:middle line:84%
on nothing, on everything to
do with nothing, everything

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.020 align:middle line:84%
associated with nothing, such
as sleep, passivity, rest,

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.670 align:middle line:84%
and even the feminine
principle is often

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.390 align:middle line:84%
equated with the
negative principal.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.140 align:middle line:84%
Although women's lib people
don't like that kind of thing,

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.010 align:middle line:84%
but when they get through
understanding what

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell you, I
don't think they'll object.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.760 align:middle line:84%
Because what has struck
me is that nothing,

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.780 align:middle line:84%
the negative, the empty,
is exceedingly powerful.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.820 align:middle line:90%


00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.590 align:middle line:84%
I would say, not ex nihilo
nihil fit, out of nothing

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.290 align:middle line:84%
comes nothing, but I would
say you can't have something

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.360 align:middle line:90%
without nothing.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.450 align:middle line:84%
So, how do we basically
begin to think

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.880 align:middle line:84%
about the difference between
something and nothing?

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.340 align:middle line:84%
I can say, there is a
cigar in my right hand

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.870 align:middle line:84%
and there is no cigar
in my left hand.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And so we get the idea of is
here and isn't, or empty, here.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.820 align:middle line:84%
But behind that, of course, lies
the far more obvious contrast

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.590 align:middle line:90%
of solid and space.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.760 align:middle line:90%


00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, we tend to think
of space as nothing.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.320 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about
the conquest of space,

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.810 align:middle line:84%
there's a little
element, notice,

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.250 align:middle line:90%
of hostility in that phrase.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.610 align:middle line:84%
But actually, we are talking
about the conquest of distance.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.380 align:middle line:84%
Space, as such, that
is to say, whatever

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.880 align:middle line:84%
it is that lies between
the earth and the moon,

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.350 align:middle line:84%
and the earth and the sun,
is considered, especially

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.480 align:middle line:84%
since the Michelson-Morley
experiment, which

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.190 align:middle line:84%
proved there was no
ether, is considered

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.410 align:middle line:90%
to be just nothing at all.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.010 align:middle line:90%


00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.160 align:middle line:84%
But to suggest how very powerful
and important this nothing

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.360 align:middle line:84%
at all is, let me
point out to you

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.200 align:middle line:84%
that if you didn't
have space, you

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.250 align:middle line:90%
couldn't have anything solid.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.820 align:middle line:84%
To begin with, without
space outside the solid,

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.290 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't know where
the solid's edges were.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.320 align:middle line:84%
For example, you can
see me on the camera

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.050 align:middle line:84%
because you see a background
here and all around me.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And that background
shows up my outline.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.710 align:middle line:90%


00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.320 align:middle line:84%
But if that wasn't
there, then you

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.800 align:middle line:84%
would notice, say, only the
beads and the microphone here.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And this would become
the background.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.672 align:middle line:84%
But you always have to have
a background to see a figure.

00:05:16.672 --> 00:05:19.630 align:middle line:90%
You just can't do without it.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:25.840 align:middle line:84%
So that means that the figure
and the ground, the solid

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.130 align:middle line:84%
and the space, in some way are
inseparable and go together.

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, we find this very
commonly in the phenomenon

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.260 align:middle line:90%
of magnetism and electricity.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.300 align:middle line:84%
A magnet has a north
pole and a south pole.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And a battery has a positive
pole and a negative pole.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.020 align:middle line:84%
There is no such thing as a
magnet with one pole only.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.790 align:middle line:84%
That's supposing we equate north
with south and-- north with

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.130 align:middle line:90%
"is" and south with "isn't."

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.700 align:middle line:84%
Then we see we can't do
without the two of them.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.940 align:middle line:84%
You can chop the magnet in two,
supposing it's a bar magnet,

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.210 align:middle line:84%
and you'll just get another
north pole and south

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.505 align:middle line:90%
pole on the end of each piece.

00:06:04.505 --> 00:06:07.020 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And so, in the
same way, a current

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.840 align:middle line:84%
will not flow through
an electric circuit

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.240 align:middle line:84%
until the negative
pole is connected

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.150 align:middle line:90%
as well as the positive.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.020 align:middle line:84%
Because the current does not
wait in the wire like water

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.480 align:middle line:84%
in a hose and then begin to
flow when you, as it were,

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.120 align:middle line:84%
connect it with the
negative pole like turning

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.950 align:middle line:90%
on the nozzle.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.550 align:middle line:84%
There won't be any
current in the wire at all

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:36.890 align:middle line:84%
until its endpoint, which is
the negative, is established.

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:41.940 align:middle line:84%
So, what this is trying to get
into our basic logic is this.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:48.260 align:middle line:84%
That there isn't a sort of fight
between something and nothing.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.540 align:middle line:84%
You know the famous
words of Hamlet,

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.090 align:middle line:84%
to be or not to be,
that is the question.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.080 align:middle line:90%
It isn't.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.120 align:middle line:84%
To be or not to be
is not the question.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.510 align:middle line:84%
Because, as I think
I've shown, you

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:05.681 align:middle line:84%
can't have a solid
without space.

00:07:05.681 --> 00:07:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And therefore you
can't have an "is"

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.780 align:middle line:84%
without an "isn't," a
something without a nothing,

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.350 align:middle line:90%
a figure without a background.

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And we can turn that
right the other way around

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:21.890 align:middle line:84%
and say you can't have
space without solid.

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Because imagine
nothing but space.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.230 align:middle line:84%
Space, space, space, with
nothing in it at all, forever.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:28.790 align:middle line:90%
But there you are imagining it.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:29.970 align:middle line:90%
And you are something in it.

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:32.620 align:middle line:90%


00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.590 align:middle line:84%
To have the whole idea of there
being only space and nothing

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.240 align:middle line:84%
else at all is not
only inconceivable

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.200 align:middle line:90%
but perfectly meaningless.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.250 align:middle line:84%
Because we always know
what we mean by contrasts.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:49.810 align:middle line:84%
We know what we mean by white
in comparison with black.

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:53.620 align:middle line:84%
We know life in
comparison with death.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:57.300 align:middle line:84%
We know pleasure in comparison
with pain, up in comparison

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.230 align:middle line:90%
with down.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:00.330 align:middle line:84%
But you will notice
of all these things

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.815 align:middle line:84%
that they must come
into being together.

00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:05.330 align:middle line:90%


00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.990 align:middle line:84%
You don't have first
something and then nothing,

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.670 align:middle line:84%
or first nothing
and then something.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:16.120 align:middle line:84%
Something and nothing are
two sides of the same coin.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And as you know,
if you take a coin

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.960 align:middle line:84%
and you file away
the tails side of it,

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.200 align:middle line:84%
and you file that side
of it away completely,

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.100 align:middle line:84%
the head side will
disappear as well.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.620 align:middle line:90%


00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:32.440 align:middle line:84%
So, in this sense, the
positive and the negative,

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.570 align:middle line:84%
the something and the
nothing are inseparable.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:37.429 align:middle line:90%
They go together.

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And in this way you could
say that the nothing

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:46.760 align:middle line:84%
is the force whereby the
something can be manifested.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.290 align:middle line:84%
Without space, we could
not see the stars.

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:53.140 align:middle line:84%
The stars not only
occupy space but have

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:58.380 align:middle line:84%
space between one point of the
sphere and the opposite point.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.879 align:middle line:84%
So the space everywhere
is absolutely

00:09:00.879 --> 00:09:02.420 align:middle line:84%
basic to there being
anything at all.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:05.250 align:middle line:90%


00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, ordinarily
we think that what

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:12.860 align:middle line:84%
is basic to the physical world
is something we call matter.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And then matter
has various shapes.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:21.680 align:middle line:84%
We think of tables
as made of wood.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.680 align:middle line:84%
We think of pots
as made of clay.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.960 align:middle line:84%
But I ask you, is a tree
made of wood in the same way

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.982 align:middle line:90%
as a table is?

00:09:30.982 --> 00:09:32.440 align:middle line:84%
No, that would be
stupid, isn't it?

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.210 align:middle line:90%
Because a tree is wood.

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:35.490 align:middle line:90%
It isn't made of wood.

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:40.850 align:middle line:84%
Wood and tree are two different
names for the same thing.

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:44.360 align:middle line:84%
But there's in the back
of our mind the notion,

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.880 align:middle line:84%
as a root of common sense,
that everything in the world

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.630 align:middle line:84%
is made of something, made
of some kind of basic stuff.

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:54.630 align:middle line:90%


00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And physicists
through the centuries

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.750 align:middle line:84%
have, of course, wanted
to know what that was.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And physics began as a quest
to discover the basic stuff out

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.710 align:middle line:90%
of which the world is made.

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And with all our advances in
physics, we've never found it.

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:19.600 align:middle line:84%
What we have found is
not stuff, but form.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.360 align:middle line:90%
We have found shapes.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.150 align:middle line:90%
We have found structures.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.610 align:middle line:84%
Because when you turn
up the microscope

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:31.550 align:middle line:84%
and you look at things,
where you thought

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:34.320 align:middle line:84%
there was some
sort of stuff, you

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.180 align:middle line:84%
find instead form,
pattern, structure.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.520 align:middle line:90%
You find the shapes of crystals.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And you go in beyond
the shapes of crystals

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.010 align:middle line:90%
and you find molecules.

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And you go in beyond
molecules and you find atoms.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And you go in
beyond atoms and you

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.900 align:middle line:84%
find electrons and
positrons, between which

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.940 align:middle line:90%
there are vast spaces.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And we can't make up our
minds as to these electrons,

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:02.240 align:middle line:84%
whether they're waves or
whether they're particles.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.170 align:middle line:90%
And so we call them wavicles.

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:08.060 align:middle line:90%
But they're very tiny.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to ask what
stuff are electrons made,

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:15.150 align:middle line:84%
of we might be able to
make a further analysis,

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:18.180 align:middle line:84%
but what we will come up
with will never be stuff;

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:23.160 align:middle line:84%
it will always be a pattern,
a moving pattern which

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.030 align:middle line:90%
can be described and measured.

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:29.160 align:middle line:84%
But we never get to any
stuff, for the simple reason

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.160 align:middle line:90%
that there isn't any.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:38.840 align:middle line:84%
You see what stuff is, actually,
is when you see something

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:43.610 align:middle line:84%
unclearly or out of
focus, it becomes fuzzy.

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:45.200 align:middle line:84%
We could say stuffing
in something,

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:50.250 align:middle line:84%
like kapok in a cushion,
or stuffed like clay.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:52.235 align:middle line:84%
Because when we look at
it with the naked eye

00:11:52.235 --> 00:11:53.840 align:middle line:90%
it looks just like goo.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.710 align:middle line:84%
We can't make out any
significant shape to it.

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:59.840 align:middle line:84%
But then when you put it
down on the microscope

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.400 align:middle line:90%
you suddenly see shapes.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:05.570 align:middle line:84%
It comes into clear
focus as shape.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And you can go on
and on and on looking

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:11.230 align:middle line:84%
into the nature of the
world, and you will never

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.930 align:middle line:90%
find anything except form.

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:17.864 align:middle line:90%
Because, think of stuff.

00:12:17.864 --> 00:12:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Why, you wouldn't
know how to talk

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.450 align:middle line:90%
about it even if you found it.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:24.690 align:middle line:84%
How would you describe
what it was like?

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:27.520 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't say anything
about a structure in it.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.550 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't say anything about
a pattern or a process in it

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:35.026 align:middle line:84%
because it would be just
absolute primordial goo.

00:12:35.026 --> 00:12:39.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, what else is there
besides form in the world?

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:45.870 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, between the
shape, the significant shapes

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:49.680 align:middle line:90%
of any form, there is space.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And space and form,
in that sense,

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.010 align:middle line:84%
go together as the
fundamental things

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:57.460 align:middle line:84%
we're dealing with
in this universe.

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's why there's
a Buddhist saying.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.520 align:middle line:84%
Really, the whole
of Buddhism is based

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:08.950 align:middle line:84%
on this saying, which is "that
which is void is precisely form

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:14.200 align:middle line:84%
and that which is form
is precisely void."

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Let me illustrate this to you
in an extremely simple way.

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:19.420 align:middle line:90%


00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:24.110 align:middle line:84%
When you use the word clarity,
what do you mean by clarity?

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:27.620 align:middle line:84%
What's the first thing you
think of when I say clarity?

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:33.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, it might be a perfectly
polished lens, or mirror,

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:37.260 align:middle line:84%
or a clear day when
there's no smog and the air

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.830 align:middle line:84%
is perfectly
transparent like space.

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:42.660 align:middle line:90%


00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:46.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's the next thing
you think of, clarity?

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:50.630 align:middle line:84%
The next thing you think
of is form in clear focus.

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:54.730 align:middle line:84%
All the details
articulate and perfect.

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:57.520 align:middle line:84%
So the one word,
clarity, suggests to you

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:03.990 align:middle line:84%
these two apparently completely
opposite things: the clarity

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:10.830 align:middle line:84%
of the lens or the mirror and
the clarity of articulate form.

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And it is in the
sense, then, you see,

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:16.370 align:middle line:84%
that the Buddhists say
form is void, void is form.

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:18.050 align:middle line:84%
Or we could put
it in another way.

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Instead of saying is
we could say implies.

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:26.440 align:middle line:84%
Or the word that I invented,
goeswith, spelled all in one.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.980 align:middle line:90%
Like a front goeswith a back.

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.430 align:middle line:84%
A male goeswith a
female, and so on.

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:38.110 align:middle line:90%
So form always goeswith void.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And there really isn't, in
this whole universe, any stuff.

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:49.440 align:middle line:84%
Form, indeed, is inseparable
from the idea of energy.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And frisky form,
especially when it's

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:56.980 align:middle line:84%
moving in a very circumscribed
area, appears to us as solid.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:00.530 align:middle line:84%
In the same way, for example,
when you spin an electric fan,

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:02.790 align:middle line:84%
the empty spaces
between the blades

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:04.910 align:middle line:90%
sort of disappear into a blur.

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And you can't push a pencil,
much less your finger,

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:09.820 align:middle line:90%
through the fan.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:12.480 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way, you
can't push your finger

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.650 align:middle line:84%
through the floor because
the floor's going too fast.

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:19.460 align:middle line:84%
But basically, what
you have down there

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:23.570 align:middle line:84%
is nothing except nothing,
and form in motion.

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.300 align:middle line:90%


00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.900 align:middle line:84%
I know there was a physicist
at the University of Chicago.

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.150 align:middle line:84%
He was rather crazy,
like some scientists.

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And this impressed him so much,
the insolidity, the instability

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.060 align:middle line:84%
of the physical
world, that he used

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:44.465 align:middle line:84%
to go around in enormous
padded slippers for fear

00:15:44.465 --> 00:15:48.050 align:middle line:84%
he should fall
through the floor.

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:51.500 align:middle line:84%
But here it is, this common
sense notion that the world is

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:56.850 align:middle line:84%
made of some kind
of stuff is shown

00:15:56.850 --> 00:16:01.530 align:middle line:84%
to be a nonsense idea in
the back of our minds.

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:04.570 align:middle line:90%
It isn't there at all.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:09.430 align:middle line:90%
But instead, form and emptiness.

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:20.960 align:middle line:90%


00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, we all know that energy
is always vibration, pulsation.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:34.900 align:middle line:84%
Whether it be the energy of
light or the energy of sound,

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:40.770 align:middle line:90%
it's always on and off.

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And in the case
of light, say you

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:49.190 align:middle line:84%
get very fast light,
very strong light, even,

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:52.060 align:middle line:84%
say, with alternating
current, you

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:56.410 align:middle line:84%
don't notice the discontinuity
because your retina retains

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:59.790 align:middle line:90%
the impression of the on pulse.

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And so that carries over
during the off pulse.

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And you don't
notice the off pulse

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:08.450 align:middle line:84%
except in a slow light
like an arc lamp.

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's exactly the
same thing with sound.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:17.420 align:middle line:84%
When you hear a high
note that goes oh, it

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:19.730 align:middle line:90%
seems much more continuous.

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:23.329 align:middle line:84%
That's because the vibrations
are faster than a low note,

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:25.124 align:middle line:90%
as when I go ah.

00:17:25.124 --> 00:17:32.279 align:middle line:90%


00:17:32.279 --> 00:17:36.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, in that you can hear
a kind of grainy-ness.

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And that grainy-ness
is because you

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:41.300 align:middle line:84%
are hearing the rapid
alternations of on and off

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:47.120 align:middle line:84%
on a lower note, so that all
wave motion is this process.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:53.080 align:middle line:90%


00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's curious, isn't
it, when we think of waves,

00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:01.290 align:middle line:84%
and talk about waves, we
think about the crests.

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:04.000 align:middle line:90%
We think about this point.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.250 align:middle line:90%
And we say that is waves.

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And that is because
the crests stand out

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:15.550 align:middle line:84%
from the underlying uniform bed
of water, which is relatively

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:18.730 align:middle line:84%
solid in comparison
with the space

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:23.240 align:middle line:84%
above, so that these
crests are perceived

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:26.880 align:middle line:84%
as the things, the
forms, the waves.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:32.240 align:middle line:84%
But isn't it obvious that you
cannot have the ups without

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.150 align:middle line:90%
the downs?

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:39.290 align:middle line:84%
You could call-- you see you
get this dividing line here

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:42.300 align:middle line:90%
between above and below.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:45.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, isn't it
obvious, first of all,

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:51.530 align:middle line:84%
you cannot have the emphasis,
called a crest, the concave,

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:57.280 align:middle line:84%
without the deemphasis, or
convex, called the trough.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:00.850 align:middle line:84%
They necessarily go
with one another.

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:04.270 align:middle line:84%
So as to have anything standing
out, there must be, as it were,

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:09.090 align:middle line:84%
something standing
down, or standing back.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:14.460 align:middle line:84%
So in this way, we must
realize that if you

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:22.040 align:middle line:84%
had this part alone, the
up part, that would not

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.590 align:middle line:84%
excite your senses in
any way because there

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:26.780 align:middle line:90%
would be no contrast.

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:31.070 align:middle line:84%
In other words, when
sound comes upon your ear,

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:33.580 align:middle line:90%
the eardrum vibrates.

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:36.970 align:middle line:84%
When the on pulse
of the sound comes,

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:39.200 align:middle line:84%
the eardrum is
driven in a little.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:44.380 align:middle line:84%
When the off succeeds, the
eardrum comes out again.

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.110 align:middle line:90%
And so the eardrum wiggles.

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:49.910 align:middle line:84%
If you just pushed it in
uniformly and left it there,

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:51.930 align:middle line:90%
you wouldn't hear anything.

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:53.790 align:middle line:84%
In the same way, if
there is no sound

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:55.930 align:middle line:84%
and the eardrum is not
being pushed at all,

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:59.280 align:middle line:90%
you have silence.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:03.050 align:middle line:84%
But to have sound, you
must have the alternation

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:06.860 align:middle line:84%
of sound, silence, sound,
silence, sound, silence.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And so you get that ah which you
can hear on a very deep note.

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, the same thing is
true of all life together.

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:22.090 align:middle line:84%
We shouldn't really contrast
existence with non-existence,

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:27.480 align:middle line:84%
because, actually, existence
is the alternation of to be

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:32.160 align:middle line:84%
and not to be, of positive
or negative, of on and off.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.670 align:middle line:84%
So, you could say
existence is eternal,

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:40.130 align:middle line:84%
if we are to consider existence
as this alternation of now you

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:42.760 align:middle line:84%
see it, now you
don't, now you see it,

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:46.424 align:middle line:84%
now you don't, now you
see it, now you don't.

00:20:46.424 --> 00:20:50.230 align:middle line:84%
It is that contrast
that presents

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:53.660 align:middle line:84%
the sensation of there
being anything at all.

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:56.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, in light and
sound, these waves

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:58.780 align:middle line:84%
are extraordinarily
rapid so that we

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.190 align:middle line:84%
don't hear the
interval between them.

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:02.830 align:middle line:84%
But there are
other circumstances

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:05.310 align:middle line:84%
in which the waves are
extraordinarily slow,

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:07.510 align:middle line:84%
as in the alternation
of day and night,

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:12.640 align:middle line:84%
light and darkness, and the
much vaster alternations of life

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:17.510 align:middle line:84%
and death, of the great
slow cycles of the world.

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:19.640 align:middle line:84%
But these alternations
are just as

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.420 align:middle line:84%
necessary to the
being of the universe

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:26.280 align:middle line:84%
as in the very fast motions
where we get it in light,

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:30.880 align:middle line:84%
and in sound, and in the sense
of solid contact, where it's

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:36.400 align:middle line:84%
going so rapidly that we noticed
the continuity, or the is side,

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:40.080 align:middle line:84%
and we ignore the intervention
of the isn't side.

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.170 align:middle line:90%
But it's there just the same.

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:45.651 align:middle line:84%
Just as there are vast
spaces within the very heart

00:21:45.651 --> 00:21:46.150 align:middle line:90%
of the atom.

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:54.140 align:middle line:90%


00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, another thing that
goes along with all this

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:00.600 align:middle line:84%
is that it's perfectly
obvious that the universe is

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.890 align:middle line:84%
a system which is
aware of itself.

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:10.060 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we,
as living organisms,

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:12.760 align:middle line:84%
are forms of the
energy of the universe

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:16.120 align:middle line:84%
just as much as the
stars and the galaxies.

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And through our sense
organs, this system of energy

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:25.390 align:middle line:90%
becomes aware of itself.

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:29.770 align:middle line:84%
But there's a puzzle in this,
which again relates back

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:34.600 align:middle line:84%
to our basic contrast
between on and off,

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:38.180 align:middle line:84%
and something and
nothing, which is this.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:46.190 align:middle line:84%
That the aspect of the universe
which is aware of itself,

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:48.670 align:middle line:84%
that is to say,
the aspect which,

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:53.230 align:middle line:84%
to put it in a very clumsy
phrase, does the awaring,

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:56.080 align:middle line:90%
does not see itself.

00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:03.282 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you can't look
at your eyes with your eyes.

00:23:03.282 --> 00:23:05.470 align:middle line:90%
You can't kiss your own lips.

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:07.715 align:middle line:90%
You can't bite your own teeth.

00:23:07.715 --> 00:23:13.200 align:middle line:84%
You can't observe yourself
in the act of observing.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:17.170 align:middle line:84%
All scientists,
neurologists, physicists,

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:20.140 align:middle line:84%
have wanted to do that,
but they can't do it.

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:22.970 align:middle line:84%
Just as you can't touch
the tip of this finger

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:27.730 align:middle line:84%
with the tip of this finger,
no matter how hard you try.

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And that therefore
creates, on the backside

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:34.360 align:middle line:84%
of all observation,
a blank spot.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Just, for example,
as behind your eyes,

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:42.730 align:middle line:84%
from the point of view of your
eyes, however you look around,

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:46.330 align:middle line:90%
there is blankness behind them.

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:47.140 align:middle line:90%
That's the unknown.

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:49.730 align:middle line:90%


00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:53.560 align:middle line:84%
That's the part of the universe,
in other words, which does not

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:57.780 align:middle line:90%
see itself because it is seeing.

00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And so we always get this
division of experience

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:05.560 align:middle line:84%
into one half known,
one half unknown.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:08.260 align:middle line:84%
We would like-- of course,
it would be fascinating

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:11.840 align:middle line:84%
if we could know
the always unknown.

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.950 align:middle line:84%
But if we, say, examine
the brain and the structure

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:17.010 align:middle line:84%
of the nerves behind
the eyes, we're

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:20.990 align:middle line:84%
always looking at somebody
else's brain out there.

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:25.090 align:middle line:84%
We're never looking at our
own brain at the same time

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:27.350 align:middle line:84%
as we're investigating
somebody else's brain.

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:32.390 align:middle line:84%
So there always remains this
blank side of experience.

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:34.942 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I'm suggesting
to you is this.

00:24:34.942 --> 00:24:38.630 align:middle line:84%
That the blank
side of experience

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:43.030 align:middle line:84%
has the same relationship
to the conscious side

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:46.780 align:middle line:84%
as the off principle
of vibration

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:50.040 align:middle line:90%
has to the on principle.

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.370 align:middle line:90%
Do you see that?

00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:53.430 align:middle line:90%
There's a fundamental division.

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:57.200 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese call them--
the positive side, the yang

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.990 align:middle line:90%
and the negative side, the yin.

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:08.450 align:middle line:84%
That corresponds to the idea of
one, in our language, and zero.

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:11.190 align:middle line:84%
All numbers can be
made of one zero.

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:16.580 align:middle line:84%
That's called binary arithmetic,
which is used for computers.

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And so it's all made up of
off and on, and therefore

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:23.680 align:middle line:84%
equally of conscious
and unconscious.

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:28.890 align:middle line:84%
But the unconscious
is, so to say,

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:33.230 align:middle line:84%
the part of experience which
is doing consciousness,

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:37.590 align:middle line:84%
just as the trough
manifests the wave,

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:43.120 align:middle line:84%
the space manifests the
solid, the background

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:46.020 align:middle line:90%
manifests the figure.

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And so all that side
of life which you call

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:52.520 align:middle line:84%
unconscious,
unknown, impenetrable

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.290 align:middle line:84%
is unconscious, and
is unknown, and is

00:25:55.290 --> 00:26:00.690 align:middle line:84%
impenetrable because
it's really you.

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:07.710 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the deepest
you is the nothing side,

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:11.610 align:middle line:84%
is the side which
you don't know.

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:16.122 align:middle line:84%
So in this sense, don't
be afraid of nothing.

00:26:16.122 --> 00:26:17.580 align:middle line:84%
I could make a joke
and say there's

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:19.830 align:middle line:84%
nothing in nothing
to be afraid of.

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:23.170 align:middle line:84%
But people in our culture
are terrified of nothing.

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:25.500 align:middle line:90%
They are terrified of death.

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:27.670 align:middle line:84%
They are uneasy about
sleep because they

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:29.240 align:middle line:90%
think it's a waste of time.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And they have a lurking fear
in the back of their minds

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.560 align:middle line:84%
that all this
universe is eventually

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:37.880 align:middle line:84%
going to run down
and end in nothing.

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.705 align:middle line:84%
And it will all be
forgotten, buried, and dead.

00:26:40.705 --> 00:26:44.090 align:middle line:90%


00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:47.390 align:middle line:84%
But this is a completely
unreasonable fear

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:50.350 align:middle line:84%
because it is just
precisely this nothing which

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:52.400 align:middle line:84%
is always the
source of something.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:57.620 align:middle line:84%
Think of it, once again,
in the image of clarity.

00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:58.940 align:middle line:90%
We say crystal clear.

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:03.570 align:middle line:90%


00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:09.610 align:middle line:84%
Nothing is what brings
something into focus.

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And this nothingness,
symbolized by the crystal,

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:19.380 align:middle line:84%
is your own eyeball,
your own consciousness,

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:24.100 align:middle line:84%
and the clear space in
which all the stars have

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:25.110 align:middle line:90%
freedom to be seen.

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:28.110 align:middle line:90%
