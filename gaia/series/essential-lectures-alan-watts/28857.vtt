00:00:47.712 --> 00:00:50.497 align:middle line:84%
>>When I was a boy
in London, I used

00:00:50.497 --> 00:00:54.100 align:middle line:84%
to love to visit
the British Museum.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And in the neighborhood
of the museum,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.620 align:middle line:84%
there were a number of
old shops-- some of them,

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.600 align:middle line:84%
I think, dating from the
end of the 18th century.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And on the inscription
over the shop window,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.075 align:middle line:84%
it said they sold
"philosophical instruments."

00:01:09.075 --> 00:01:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't
for the life of me

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.790 align:middle line:84%
make out what "philosophical
instruments" could

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.940 align:middle line:84%
be because I thought
philosophers were people who

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.460 align:middle line:84%
simply sat thinking
and wouldn't have

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.160 align:middle line:84%
any need for any
special instruments.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.800 align:middle line:84%
But when I went
up to these shops,

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.160 align:middle line:84%
I found that what
they had in the window

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.490 align:middle line:84%
were telescopes, slide
rules, chronometers,

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.460 align:middle line:84%
and all sorts of what we would
now call scientific instruments

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.940 align:middle line:84%
because, you see, the
original name for science

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.910 align:middle line:84%
was "natural philosophy" because
a philosopher is a person who

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.130 align:middle line:90%
is curious about everything.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.880 align:middle line:84%
He's not only curious
about theoretical matters,

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.880 align:middle line:84%
but he's also curious
about what we should now

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.150 align:middle line:90%
call "practical matters."

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And I regard myself
as a philosopher

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.800 align:middle line:84%
in exactly that
sense because aside

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.600 align:middle line:84%
from being interested in
changed states of consciousness,

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.080 align:middle line:84%
in problems of death,
problems of time and space,

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.180 align:middle line:84%
in the practice
of meditation, I'm

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.510 align:middle line:84%
also interested in what you
would call down-to-earth things

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.990 align:middle line:84%
such as food, clothing,
housing, problems of ecology

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.720 align:middle line:84%
and population because all this
is part of natural curiosity

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.120 align:middle line:90%
or philosophy.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, now today, I want to begin
with the subject of clothing.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.410 align:middle line:84%
You see me now arrayed
in what has become

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.030 align:middle line:84%
the standard,
official man's dress

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.880 align:middle line:84%
for the whole world--
the business suit.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.940 align:middle line:84%
Derived from England,
popularized by the Americans,

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.780 align:middle line:84%
adopted by the Japanese, the
Indonesians, the Indians,

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.050 align:middle line:84%
the Persians, the
Arabs-- everybody

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.460 align:middle line:84%
on the face of the
Earth is now tending

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.390 align:middle line:84%
to go around dressed like this,
in a peculiar form of clothing

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.310 align:middle line:84%
which derives from
military uniforms

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.570 align:middle line:84%
because you will notice that
it has buttons on the sleeve.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.836 align:middle line:84%
Now, what do you
suppose those are for?

00:03:02.836 --> 00:03:05.510 align:middle line:84%
No, they don't
fasten to anything.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Originally, though,
on the uniforms

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.540 align:middle line:84%
from which these
coats are derived,

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.480 align:middle line:84%
there were a whole row of
buttons all the way up.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And they were on military
uniforms or uniforms

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.050 align:middle line:84%
worn by servitors
to prevent them

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.090 align:middle line:84%
from wiping their
noses on their sleeves.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And then it has
these curious lapels.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And goodness knows what
purpose these serve.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, sometimes,
people turn them up

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.760 align:middle line:84%
to try and protect
themselves from rain,

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.600 align:middle line:84%
but they're not
really very effective.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to wear
this extraordinary shirt which

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.740 align:middle line:84%
is extremely difficult to
fold up if you've tried,

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.090 align:middle line:84%
and you're not an
expert laundress.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And you have to strangle
yourself with a necktie.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:52.690 align:middle line:84%
Also, you have to wear pants,
British trousers, which

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.960 align:middle line:84%
is the most devastating
garment for men.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.930 align:middle line:84%
Trousers are worn
by Chinese women.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Chinese men, in the old times
before the era of Mao Zedong,

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.070 align:middle line:84%
wore skirts because
trousers are a garment

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.320 align:middle line:90%
suitable for shapely women.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.310 align:middle line:84%
They are not at all
suitable for men

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:19.019 align:middle line:84%
because they're castrative
and extremely uncomfortable,

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.070 align:middle line:84%
especially if you want
to sit on the floor.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.620 align:middle line:84%
To wear a business suit
and be comfortable,

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.790 align:middle line:84%
you invariably have
to sit on a chair

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.430 align:middle line:84%
because if you don't, your
trousers will become baggy

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.090 align:middle line:90%
at the knees.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And a coat, as you know, when
you try to put it in a suitcase

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.100 align:middle line:90%
is very difficult to fold.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And the problem of the
business suit coat is this.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.380 align:middle line:84%
That it's made to fit the
contours of the human body.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.180 align:middle line:90%


00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.000 align:middle line:84%
You see, it has to be tailored
so that it fits you here

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.860 align:middle line:84%
and it fits you here and
it fits across your back.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And all this requires
a very complex process

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.350 align:middle line:84%
so that it will snugly
fit around you like this

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.770 align:middle line:84%
and show up your form, which
is all very well if you have

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.160 align:middle line:84%
a slim form and you haven't
begun, in later age,

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.350 align:middle line:84%
to develop a protuberance
here as we naturally do.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, also, how
about keeping these trousers

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:17.730 align:middle line:90%
suspended?

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.490 align:middle line:90%
I still can wear a belt.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.140 align:middle line:84%
But the time is
going to come when

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have to
wear suspenders, which

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.490 align:middle line:84%
is a kind of block-and-tackle
contraption underneath here,

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.410 align:middle line:84%
which is another and
further inconvenience.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.310 align:middle line:84%
But it just does astonish me
that all over the world, men

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.720 align:middle line:84%
are putting up with this drab,
futerial-- funereal uniform,

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.560 align:middle line:84%
looking like undertakers and
ministers, when they could

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.560 align:middle line:84%
be much more comfortable
so that I could be just

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.030 align:middle line:84%
as respectable, just as proper,
just as demure, and instead

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.610 align:middle line:84%
of this, come on
like this, which

00:05:53.610 --> 00:06:00.980 align:middle line:84%
is the Japanese kimono as worn
not so much in modern times as

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.660 align:middle line:84%
50 years ago by all
Japanese gentleman.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is one of the
most extraordinary garments

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.220 align:middle line:90%
ever made.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.690 align:middle line:84%
To begin with, it's
completely comfortable.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.480 align:middle line:84%
You feel absolutely
relaxed underneath it.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.580 align:middle line:84%
Nothing is restricting
you anywhere.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And it has these tremendously
capacious sleeves

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.707 align:middle line:84%
which are immense
pockets into which you

00:06:23.707 --> 00:06:24.790 align:middle line:90%
can put anything you want.

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, you can
put your wallet in there

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:33.680 align:middle line:84%
and a pipe and tobacco and
cigarettes and money-- anything

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.820 align:middle line:90%
you want.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.310 align:middle line:84%
You, also, can put
things in here.

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And then it's quite proper
for you to carry a fan.

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And when the weather is too hot,
you can just cool yourself off.

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And this outward
garment, here, is a coat

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.531 align:middle line:84%
for cooler weather or for
rather proper occasions

00:06:54.531 --> 00:06:55.780 align:middle line:90%
when you should be wearing it.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.380 align:middle line:90%
It's called a haori.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:02.300 align:middle line:84%
You could take the haori off
and just wear what's underneath.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And you see, more or
less, the same thing as

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.790 align:middle line:84%
before with the big sleeves
and the enormous pockets.

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to notice a
peculiar thing about a kimono.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And we can show
it from the haori.

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And that is, that
it's entirely cut

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:23.550 align:middle line:84%
from rectangular
pieces of cloth.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.840 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:31.560 align:middle line:84%
The cloth has not been
shaped to fit the human body.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.360 align:middle line:84%
Cloth is naturally
rectangular because of its

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:39.365 align:middle line:84%
being woven material with
a perpendicular worf--

00:07:39.365 --> 00:07:42.220 align:middle line:90%
warp and a horizontal woof.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And so cloth, of its own
accord, comes out in rectangles.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, in designing
this form of clothes,

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:53.830 align:middle line:84%
we do not alter the rectangular
nature of the cloth.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.740 align:middle line:84%
We do not attempt to
shape it in any other way

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:01.100 align:middle line:84%
so as to force it to fit the
curves of the human body.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:04.400 align:middle line:84%
But if we honor the nature
of cloth in that way

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.130 align:middle line:84%
and respect its nature,
curiously enough,

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:12.260 align:middle line:84%
it respects our nature because,
if you hang rectangular cloth

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.400 align:middle line:84%
upon you, it falls
and folds which

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.530 align:middle line:84%
give you a kind of
natural dignity.

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.260 align:middle line:84%
When you shape the
cloth to you, you

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.940 align:middle line:84%
begin to look more and
more like a monkey.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.320 align:middle line:84%
But when you allow the
cloth to hang upon you

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.680 align:middle line:84%
and follow its own nature,
you look more and more

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.830 align:middle line:90%
like a prince.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.330 align:middle line:84%
So this is the essential
principle of Japanese clothing.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Japanese,
as I said, have

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.260 align:middle line:90%
been abandoning this clothing.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.760 align:middle line:90%
And I asked one of them, why?

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.299 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first
thing he said is,

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:43.780 align:middle line:84%
it's impossible to run
for a bus in a kimono.

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:44.960 align:middle line:90%
And that's perfectly true.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.910 align:middle line:90%
You cannot run in this garment.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:49.665 align:middle line:84%
You have to walk at
a dignified pace.

00:08:49.665 --> 00:08:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
very good for us.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't think any
self-respecting person should

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.750 align:middle line:90%
ever run for a bus.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:02.120 align:middle line:84%
That we need, above all things,
to slow down and get ourselves

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.150 align:middle line:84%
to amble through life instead
of to rush through it.

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, I consider
that this garment, commonly

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:11.590 align:middle line:84%
worn by men, would have an
enormously beneficent effect

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:13.840 align:middle line:90%
on American civilization.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.840 align:middle line:84%
We should be much more
comfortable, much more at ease,

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.120 align:middle line:90%
much more dignified.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.120 align:middle line:84%
I wear one all the time--
not quite as formal as this,

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:25.300 align:middle line:84%
but I always wear a
kimono around my home.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And next, I'm going to show
you the exact style of kimono

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.700 align:middle line:84%
that I would wear for normal
purposes of relaxation.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:35.170 align:middle line:90%
And that is called the yukata.

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:39.150 align:middle line:84%
It is a cotton kimono which
the Japanese businessman, who

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.550 align:middle line:84%
would have worn the clothes
that I was just showing you,

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:42.680 align:middle line:90%
would don.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.750 align:middle line:84%
When he gets home, he
takes a very hot bath

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:50.365 align:middle line:84%
in an enormous tub where
practically all the family can

00:09:50.365 --> 00:09:51.610 align:middle line:90%
sit together.

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:52.890 align:middle line:90%
It's a wonderful institution.

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:56.950 align:middle line:84%
That's the first thing you do
when you get back from work.

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:58.610 align:middle line:90%
You don't wash inside the tub.

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:01.610 align:middle line:84%
You wash outside the
tub by taking a bucket

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:04.470 align:middle line:84%
and sloshing yourself
with water from the tub.

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And then you soap
yourself and rinse off.

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:08.470 align:middle line:90%
Then you go and sit in the bath.

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And the steam rises
all around you.

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And you smoke cigarettes and
chat with all the family.

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's the greatest
kind of bath in the world.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And then back you get,
afterwards, into your yukata.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And in this, it is
perfectly permissible

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.810 align:middle line:84%
to go out strolling in the
streets in the evening.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:30.080 align:middle line:84%
This, of course, is a warm
weather yukata made of cotton.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.040 align:middle line:84%
There is a cold weather
yukata, which is different.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.500 align:middle line:90%
It's called a tanzen.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's made, very often,
of silk and is padded.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.170 align:middle line:84%
But this light garment has
exactly the same principles

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:43.320 align:middle line:84%
as the other kimono I
showed you because it

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.830 align:middle line:84%
has still the same big
pocket sleeves and still

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:51.930 align:middle line:84%
the possibility of sticking
things inside here.

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:56.280 align:middle line:84%
Now then, also, you
can wear it, too,

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.900 align:middle line:84%
with the same sash that
you wear with a kimono.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.980 align:middle line:90%
This is called an obi.

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:04.410 align:middle line:84%
There are men's
obi, which are made

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:07.930 align:middle line:84%
with tie-dye
ornamentations on the end.

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And women's obi, which
are much more stiff,

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.964 align:middle line:84%
are made of very,
very heavy silk.

00:11:13.964 --> 00:11:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And they're not nearly
as comfortable to wear.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.130 align:middle line:84%
But again, you see, this is an
absolutely, perfectly relaxed

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:20.990 align:middle line:90%
dress for men.

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And I myself, since I'm a writer
and do most of my work at home,

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:30.350 align:middle line:84%
I wear one of these
almost all of the time

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.530 align:middle line:84%
because it is not
constricting and because

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:35.560 align:middle line:84%
of the extreme convenience
of its pockets.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And if I stand up, I'll show
you how the sash fastens

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:42.980 align:middle line:84%
in a sort of elegant
bow at the back.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And you may think that
that, along with the absence

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.690 align:middle line:84%
of pants, is a little
bit effeminate.

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:53.260 align:middle line:84%
But you know, men,
especially in America

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.310 align:middle line:84%
and I will say this
also to men in England,

00:11:55.310 --> 00:12:00.370 align:middle line:84%
they're terribly uptight
about coming on in a way

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:02.515 align:middle line:84%
that they suppose
to be feminine.

00:12:02.515 --> 00:12:06.870 align:middle line:84%
They say skirts are for
women-- sissy stuff.

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:10.010 align:middle line:84%
But you know, if you
are biologically male,

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:13.450 align:middle line:84%
you don't need to
prove that you are.

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:17.010 align:middle line:84%
It's so strange to me how
an enormous number of men

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:20.080 align:middle line:84%
don't seem to be able to
realize that they're men

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.830 align:middle line:84%
unless they can, in some way
or through some sort of medium,

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:26.380 align:middle line:90%
go vrrroom!

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And come on with tremendous
energy-- very strong, see,

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.630 align:middle line:90%
that shows I'm a man.

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:35.637 align:middle line:84%
But if you're a real man, you
don't need to show that at all.

00:12:35.637 --> 00:12:37.970 align:middle line:84%
All you need to do to find
out whether you're a real man

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:38.710 align:middle line:90%
is ask a woman.

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:43.950 align:middle line:90%


00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:46.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's something
else altogether.

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:53.230 align:middle line:84%
This is the ancient Greek
chlamys, C-H-L-A-M-Y-S.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:58.640 align:middle line:84%
A long linen garment that has
come down to us in modern times

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.900 align:middle line:84%
through the Roman Catholic
Church in the form of what is

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:06.990 align:middle line:84%
called an alb, which a
priest wears at mass.

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:11.600 align:middle line:84%
Only, he puts it on
over his ordinary suit,

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.670 align:middle line:84%
or he takes off the
coat, and he puts

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:18.080 align:middle line:84%
on a long, heavy black garment
called a cassock, which

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.600 align:middle line:90%
is a kind of a wretched thing.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.830 align:middle line:84%
Then he puts this extra
suit of clothes over it.

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:25.610 align:middle line:84%
But any sensible priest,
in celebrating mass,

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:28.660 align:middle line:84%
would take off all his clothes
underneath and simply wear

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:32.240 align:middle line:84%
his underpants and his
chlamys, which is his alb.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And then this thing
here is a hood,

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:36.380 align:middle line:84%
which you can pull
up over your head.

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And I won't do it now--
it's a bit of a nuisance--

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:41.800 align:middle line:84%
but it just sort of
makes a comfortable thing

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:42.470 align:middle line:90%
around the neck.

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.710 align:middle line:90%
It catches the sweat.

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:49.550 align:middle line:84%
It's called an amice--
amicitia in Latin.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:51.830 align:middle line:84%
But this is what men
in our Western world

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:58.940 align:middle line:84%
commonly wore back in
about, I should say, 400 BC

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.330 align:middle line:90%
and onwards in Greece.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:03.710 align:middle line:84%
They wore the toga in Rome,
which was a somewhat more

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:07.176 align:middle line:84%
inconvenient garment because
you had to throw it over you.

00:14:07.176 --> 00:14:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And all those things were always
dropping down and falling off.

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.174 align:middle line:84%
But this is
extremely comfortable

00:14:11.174 --> 00:14:12.680 align:middle line:90%
and very convenient.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, along with the amys,
a priest of the Catholic

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.640 align:middle line:84%
Chur-- along with the
alb or the chlamys,

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.430 align:middle line:84%
a priest of the Catholic
Church, when celebrating mass,

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:25.640 align:middle line:84%
will wear over this a
garment called a chasuble

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.660 align:middle line:90%
in English, casula in Latin.

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And the word "casula"
means a little house;

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:33.600 align:middle line:90%
or in other words, a tent.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.350 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, a
poncho, a garment

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:40.580 align:middle line:84%
which you could tie to
a pole, spread it out,

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.630 align:middle line:84%
put stones on it, and rest
under it during the night

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:45.030 align:middle line:90%
and keep the rain off you.

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:47.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's a casula,
a little house.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.780 align:middle line:84%
But now, you can make
a poncho by taking

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:54.704 align:middle line:84%
simply a perfectly
square a piece of cloth.

00:14:54.704 --> 00:14:56.120 align:middle line:84%
All you have to
do is hem it-- you

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.840 align:middle line:84%
don't have to fit it in any
way-- and cut a slit in it,

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.530 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:01.250 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:04.670 align:middle line:84%
And then you have a
casula, a little tent.

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And I can get into
it, like that.

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:09.910 align:middle line:90%
And we pull this outside.

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:15.410 align:middle line:90%


00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:18.344 align:middle line:84%
And you see, without any
tailoring or fitting,

00:15:18.344 --> 00:15:23.830 align:middle line:84%
you at once have a really very
dignified and becoming garment.

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And these things
are of enormous use.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.146 align:middle line:90%
You can wear them with anything.

00:15:27.146 --> 00:15:29.770 align:middle line:84%
They keep you beautifully warm,
especially if you make them out

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:31.400 align:middle line:90%
of some heavy material.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:35.130 align:middle line:84%
This one happens to be
made out of camel's hair.

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:40.365 align:middle line:84%
And actually, once when I wore
this, I was stopped in a bar

00:15:40.365 --> 00:15:43.530 align:middle line:84%
by an Irishman who said,
where have I seen that before?

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, I said, you saw a priest
wearing it at mass, [CHUCKLES]

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:49.190 align:middle line:90%
which he thought was very funny.

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:52.820 align:middle line:84%
But this is the
essential poncho.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And it gives, again, a great
freedom of movement, your hands

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:58.690 align:middle line:90%
are free, and it's very warm.

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And you can wear it over such
loose-fitting clothes as these

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:06.770 align:middle line:84%
and be extremely
comfortable, not castrated,

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:09.450 align:middle line:90%
and at your ease.

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:11.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, of all the
outlandish garments

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:14.090 align:middle line:84%
which I have shown you,
the most outlandish

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:16.850 align:middle line:90%
is the Philippine sarong.

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:21.270 align:middle line:84%
My Japanese friends of modern
times objecting to the kimono

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:24.660 align:middle line:84%
said, well, you can't run for
a bus in a kimono, all right.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:27.630 align:middle line:84%
You could sure run for a
bus in a Philippine sarong

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:31.600 align:middle line:84%
because it gives you complete
freedom of your legs.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.600 align:middle line:84%
Get them right up, either
way because, you see,

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.370 align:middle line:84%
it's essentially a divided
skirt, very floppy,

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:38.770 align:middle line:90%
made of cotton.

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:40.480 align:middle line:90%
And it wraps around your waist.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.280 align:middle line:90%
And you tuck it in.

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And you can secure
it with a safety pin.

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And over it, you simply
wear a colorful shirt.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't know whether
this matches very good;

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:54.270 align:middle line:84%
but at any rate, one just
sees how many different jazzy

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:56.550 align:middle line:90%
things you could put together.

00:16:56.550 --> 00:17:00.980 align:middle line:84%
But this, the sarong
with variations,

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:02.850 align:middle line:90%
is worn all over South Asia.

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:05.810 align:middle line:84%
But this particular Philippine
design with the divide

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:08.150 align:middle line:84%
is the most comfortable,
the most elastic

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:09.490 align:middle line:90%
that I've ever discovered.

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And I do not know any more
comfortable form of dress

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.880 align:middle line:90%
in the world than this.

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, the thing is, you can
make it of any material.

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:20.880 align:middle line:84%
You could make this same
thing out of heavier material,

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:23.349 align:middle line:84%
say, out of worsted,
out of silk,

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:26.550 align:middle line:84%
in order to be warm
in cold weather

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:29.600 align:middle line:84%
and have a completely
comfortable and, I think,

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.880 align:middle line:84%
reasonably dignified
form of clothing.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:37.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, what is
the problem with us?

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:42.790 align:middle line:84%
What's the problem with Western
man and even Western woman

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:46.620 align:middle line:84%
that they dress so
damned uncomfortably?

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:48.120 align:middle line:84%
I've thought about
this a great deal

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.500 align:middle line:84%
because it comes down to
some pretty fundamental

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:53.501 align:middle line:90%
philosophical matters.

00:17:53.501 --> 00:17:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And I've discovered
that one of them

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.041 align:middle line:84%
is this-- that when people
get up in the morning,

00:17:57.041 --> 00:17:59.670 align:middle line:90%
they put on a bathrobe.

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:05.026 align:middle line:84%
After a little time goes by,
they feel slightly guilty.

00:18:05.026 --> 00:18:08.440 align:middle line:90%


00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And why do they feel
slightly guilty?

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:18.780 align:middle line:84%
Because when you've got
loose-fitting clothes on,

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:27.280 align:middle line:84%
you may have a slight suspicion
that you don't really exist.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.740 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
you're not strapped

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:34.728 align:middle line:84%
in because all people of action
wear big belts like military,

00:18:34.728 --> 00:18:37.010 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Boots, things that
clutch you tightly.

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And then you feel because of
the pressure upon your skin,

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.430 align:middle line:90%
you're really there.

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:47.864 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a very
serious mistake, especially

00:18:47.864 --> 00:18:48.405 align:middle line:90%
for soldiers.

00:18:48.405 --> 00:18:52.470 align:middle line:90%


00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:56.510 align:middle line:84%
I maintain that the German army
lost two world wars because

00:18:56.510 --> 00:19:01.390 align:middle line:84%
of the goose step, because
of military pomp and swagger,

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:06.440 align:middle line:84%
because of such things as brass
bands and close order drill,

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:10.480 align:middle line:84%
because a really
effective army should

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.445 align:middle line:90%
be invisible and inaudible.

00:19:12.445 --> 00:19:15.440 align:middle line:90%


00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:20.210 align:middle line:84%
But you cannot get men who
are on the machismo kick,

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:21.920 align:middle line:84%
who have to prove
that they are men,

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:24.710 align:middle line:90%
to be invisible and inaudible.

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:28.660 align:middle line:84%
But a truly effective army,
an army of guerrillas,

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:32.790 align:middle line:84%
should dress with complete
comfort, complete practicality,

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:36.880 align:middle line:84%
and no kind of tying
themselves together in knots

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.717 align:middle line:84%
so that the pressure
on you will assure you

00:19:38.717 --> 00:19:40.550 align:middle line:84%
that you're there
because, after all, that's

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:43.040 align:middle line:90%
like sleeping on a bed of nails.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.820 align:middle line:84%
But a great many
people in our culture

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:50.740 align:middle line:84%
don't feel that they are really
alive unless, in some way,

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:56.340 align:middle line:84%
they are uncomfortable
or suffering.

00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for
that is that we

00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:03.470 align:middle line:84%
have a profound built-in sense
of guilt about our existence.

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.160 align:middle line:84%
You see, we have
a profound sense

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.000 align:middle line:84%
of guilt about our
existence because we

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.800 align:middle line:84%
feel that we don't really
belong to the universe.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:17.290 align:middle line:84%
There was a wonderful story
about a Japanese mystic,

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:22.100 align:middle line:84%
a kind of wandering
holy man who, one night,

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.910 align:middle line:84%
stopped in a Buddhist
temple for shelter.

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And he went up to
the high altar.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And there were all
these kneeling cushions

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:31.055 align:middle line:84%
which the priests use for
celebrating the service.

00:20:31.055 --> 00:20:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And he arranged them all
and made a comfortable bed

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:36.190 align:middle line:90%
and went to sleep.

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And early in the
morning, the priest

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:40.200 align:middle line:84%
came in to celebrate the
early morning service

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.500 align:middle line:84%
and saw this apparent bum lying
on all the cushions in front

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:44.150 align:middle line:90%
of the altar.

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:46.280 align:middle line:90%
He said, What are doing here?

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:50.140 align:middle line:84%
Such disrespectful conduct
in front of the altar!"

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And the holy man looked up
at him and said, "Oh, so?

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.340 align:middle line:90%
You must be stranger here.

00:20:56.340 --> 00:21:00.060 align:middle line:84%
You cannot belong
to the family."

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And so likewise, in
an Italian church,

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:06.459 align:middle line:84%
little children are running
around, in and out of the pews,

00:21:06.459 --> 00:21:08.750 align:middle line:84%
ducking back and forth, while
their mother was offering

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:11.510 align:middle line:84%
candles at the shrine
of St. Anthony.

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And two American
spinsters from New England

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:15.919 align:middle line:84%
were viewing the
church and were very

00:21:15.919 --> 00:21:18.210 align:middle line:84%
shocked at the way these
children were playing and went

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:21.070 align:middle line:84%
over and touched the
mother on her shoulder

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:24.035 align:middle line:84%
and said, "Don't you think these
children should be controlled?"

00:21:24.035 --> 00:21:25.980 align:middle line:84%
"Well," she said, "it
is their father's house.

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.055 align:middle line:90%
Can't they pray here?

00:21:27.055 --> 00:21:28.910 align:middle line:90%
Can't they play here?"

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:31.292 align:middle line:84%
See I made a very interesting
slip of the tongue.

00:21:31.292 --> 00:21:34.664 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:21:34.664 --> 00:21:36.455 align:middle line:84%
But that's a most
curious things, isn't it?

00:21:36.455 --> 00:21:39.990 align:middle line:84%
You see, our clothing, as
I said at the beginning

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:45.400 align:middle line:84%
in exhibiting the business
suit, is undertaker clothing,

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:50.970 align:middle line:84%
ministerial clothing, military
clothing-- for all those things

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:57.620 align:middle line:84%
which in our culture we
cultivate an uptight attitude.

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:00.460 align:middle line:90%
[GRUNTS] Hold yourself in.

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.900 align:middle line:84%
Restrain yourself,
[GRUNTS] like this.

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:06.740 align:middle line:90%


00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:10.115 align:middle line:84%
But in doing this, you see,
we are constantly at war

00:22:10.115 --> 00:22:11.170 align:middle line:90%
with ourselves.

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:13.129 align:middle line:84%
It is as if you were
moving your arm,

00:22:13.129 --> 00:22:15.420 align:middle line:84%
and you want to move your
arm very strongly in one way,

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:16.586 align:middle line:90%
all right, you go like that.

00:22:16.586 --> 00:22:20.260 align:middle line:84%
You immediately
tighten the bicep.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And that would be the
natural thing to do.

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:24.830 align:middle line:84%
In lifting something heavy, you
immediately tighten the bicep,

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:26.920 align:middle line:90%
and up it comes.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.560 align:middle line:84%
But supposing you tighten the
tricep at the same time, which

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.880 align:middle line:84%
is the muscle here on the
back, then you get this.

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:36.460 align:middle line:90%


00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:39.280 align:middle line:84%
You're fighting
with yourself, see?

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And although this
movement may look, oh,

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:45.450 align:middle line:84%
very tough and strong,
it isn't at all

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:48.790 align:middle line:84%
because you're fighting with
yourself while you do it.

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:51.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, in this way,
all the time, we

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:53.070 align:middle line:84%
have been taught to
fight with ourselves

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:55.776 align:middle line:84%
because our personalities
have been split.

00:22:55.776 --> 00:22:59.010 align:middle line:84%
Our culture tells us that
we are, on the one hand,

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:02.860 align:middle line:84%
a nasty little animal that has
to be controlled and beaten

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:04.860 align:middle line:84%
into submission; and
that on the other hand,

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:08.480 align:middle line:84%
we are a rational soul, which
is the sort of higher self which

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:11.174 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to take
control of the lower self.

00:23:11.174 --> 00:23:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And for this reason,
we are always

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:16.070 align:middle line:84%
at cross purposes
with ourselves.

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:17.710 align:middle line:84%
Freud, for example,
distinguished

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:19.640 align:middle line:84%
between the pleasure
principle, which

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:22.680 align:middle line:84%
he located in the
genital region,

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:26.020 align:middle line:84%
and the reality principle,
which he located

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:29.220 align:middle line:84%
in the cortical
region in the brain.

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.580 align:middle line:84%
So there's a distance
between these two centers.

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:32.960 align:middle line:90%
This is the pleasure center.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.720 align:middle line:90%
This is the intelligence center.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.172 align:middle line:84%
And because they are
not in the same place,

00:23:37.172 --> 00:23:39.130 align:middle line:84%
for some reason or other,
it seems there always

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:42.150 align:middle line:90%
has to be a fight between them.

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:45.900 align:middle line:84%
In a plant, like a flower,
its mind and its sex organ

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:47.380 align:middle line:90%
is the same place.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And so it doesn't
have that conflict.

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:52.080 align:middle line:84%
But in the human
being, they're divided.

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And so we think they're
divided, at least,

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.660 align:middle line:84%
simply because they
are at a distance

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:58.990 align:middle line:90%
from each other in space.

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:02.210 align:middle line:84%
But they are not
really divided at all.

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:03.100 align:middle line:90%
They look different.

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:06.050 align:middle line:84%
The head looks very
different from the genitals.

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:11.220 align:middle line:84%
But in the same way, bees look
very different from flowers.

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:14.050 align:middle line:84%
One flies freely in
the air and buzzes,

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:16.260 align:middle line:84%
and the other is
rooted to the ground

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:18.940 align:middle line:84%
and colorfully perfumes
the environment,

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:21.010 align:middle line:90%
so the bee is attracted to it.

00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:24.640 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is that these two
very different-looking things

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.750 align:middle line:84%
are, in fact, one
single organism

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:29.290 align:middle line:84%
because if there are no
bees, there are no flowers.

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And if there are no
flowers, there are no bees.

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:35.200 align:middle line:84%
They come together as the
Chinese have a phrase,

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:38.040 align:middle line:90%
"to arise mutually."

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:39.950 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way,
when you were born,

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:43.060 align:middle line:84%
your head and your feet,
your head and your genitals

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:44.460 align:middle line:90%
arose mutually.

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:46.070 align:middle line:90%
They came in together.

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:49.080 align:middle line:84%
They are not really
separate from each other.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, this
idea that discipline,

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:58.740 align:middle line:84%
that living an
ordered life consists

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:00.160 align:middle line:90%
in controlling yourself.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.490 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, by
having one self that

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:05.300 align:middle line:84%
needs to be controlled and
another part of yourself,

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.650 align:middle line:84%
which is the controlling
one, is nothing

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:13.110 align:middle line:84%
but creating a conflict and a
disturbance inside yourself.

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:18.650 align:middle line:84%
You have to get with yourself
in order to control yourself.

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:22.560 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if I
want to open my hand,

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:23.690 align:middle line:90%
it opens like that.

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:26.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how it does it,
but it just does it like that.

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:34.580 align:middle line:84%
But if it were necessary for
me to open my hand to do this,

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:35.080 align:middle line:90%
you see?

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And then when I had to
pick up something like,

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:42.810 align:middle line:84%
well, here's a cigar
and I need to pick it up

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:45.180 align:middle line:84%
with my right hand,
so I have to do this.

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:55.780 align:middle line:90%


00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:58.580 align:middle line:90%
I mean, wouldn't that be absurd?

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:00.960 align:middle line:84%
But that's what we are
doing all the time when

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:04.810 align:middle line:84%
we divide ourselves into
two parts-- the spiritual

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:07.770 align:middle line:84%
and the material, the
angelic and rational,

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:10.850 align:middle line:90%
and the animal or irrational.

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And so constantly, we're
holding clubs over ourselves.

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And that is one of the
reasons, therefore,

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:20.760 align:middle line:84%
why when you get
up in the morning

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:24.520 align:middle line:84%
and you put on your bathrobe
and you feel at ease,

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:29.530 align:middle line:84%
that after a while, you begin
to feel guilty because you feel

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:35.140 align:middle line:84%
you should be, as we say,
dressed and in your right mind

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:40.140 align:middle line:84%
so that you can go out
and be a person of action.

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:46.469 align:middle line:84%
You can go to the office
and feel that there it is.

00:26:46.469 --> 00:26:48.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's another
thing which makes

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:50.820 align:middle line:84%
the philosopher comment in
connection with clothing

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:51.840 align:middle line:90%
is commuting.

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:56.840 align:middle line:90%


00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:00.330 align:middle line:84%
Every day in the urban
areas, millions of people

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:04.030 align:middle line:84%
are absolutely wearing
themselves out,

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:06.980 align:middle line:84%
tearing their nerves
to distraction

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:11.790 align:middle line:84%
by going along the
freeways in a car,

00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:15.360 align:middle line:84%
fouling the atmosphere
to do their work.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And their work, you
see, is completely

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.140 align:middle line:84%
divorced-- something quite
separate from their play.

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:22.846 align:middle line:90%


00:27:22.846 --> 00:27:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is one of the great
insanities of our civilization.

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.970 align:middle line:84%
Every sensible person
should get paid for playing.

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:33.150 align:middle line:90%


00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:34.640 align:middle line:84%
If you don't get
paid for playing,

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.560 align:middle line:90%
something's wrong with you.

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:39.140 align:middle line:84%
You haven't learned
the art of life.

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And furthermore, in
most kinds of business,

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:45.280 align:middle line:84%
especially clerical
forms of business

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:48.130 align:middle line:84%
where you need an office
for paperwork and so on,

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:52.180 align:middle line:84%
you don't need an office
if you've got a telephone.

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.730 align:middle line:84%
The telephone
company can show you

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:55.200 align:middle line:84%
how to do anything
in the world you

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.400 align:middle line:84%
want to do by way
of business by phone

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.440 align:middle line:84%
so that you can cut down the
enormous amount of time wasted

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:03.190 align:middle line:90%
in rushing around, commuting.

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:07.960 align:middle line:84%
You can stay at home and
do you work from there.

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:09.750 align:middle line:84%
But we have got
this idea that work

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:11.650 align:middle line:84%
is one thing and
play is another.

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:14.440 align:middle line:90%
Therefore, we have work clothes.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And the business suit is not a
practical form of work clothes.

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:20.650 align:middle line:90%
And we have play clothes.

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And I suggest, and we will
develop this in future talks,

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.560 align:middle line:84%
that one of the most
important things

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.830 align:middle line:84%
is to get our heads
together with our genitals,

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:31.030 align:middle line:84%
our genitals together our
heads, and our work together

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:33.910 align:middle line:84%
with our play, and make
our life unified and one.

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:37.810 align:middle line:90%
