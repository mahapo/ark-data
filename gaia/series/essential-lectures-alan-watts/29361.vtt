00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:23.830 align:middle line:90%
[GONG SOUNDING]

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>>Time is a very difficult
thing to pin down.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.080 align:middle line:84%
There's a famous saying of
Saint Augustine of Hippo,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.030 align:middle line:84%
that when he was asked,
what is time, he said,

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.140 align:middle line:84%
"I know what it is, but
when you ask me, I don't."

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.292 align:middle line:84%
And yet it seems absolutely
fundamental to our life.

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:43.850 align:middle line:90%
Time is money, we say.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.550 align:middle line:90%
I don't have enough time.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:46.600 align:middle line:90%
Time flies.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.315 align:middle line:90%
Time drags.

00:00:47.315 --> 00:00:50.189 align:middle line:90%


00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think we should go into
the question of what this

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.070 align:middle line:84%
is, because in our ordinary
common sense, we think of time

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.380 align:middle line:84%
as a one-way motion, from the
past, through the present,

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.580 align:middle line:90%
and on into the future.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And that carries along
with it another impression,

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.870 align:middle line:84%
which is to say that life moves
from the past to the future

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:21.090 align:middle line:84%
in such a way that what happens
now and what will happen

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.560 align:middle line:84%
is always the result of what
has happened in the past.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.391 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we seem
to be driven along.

00:01:32.391 --> 00:01:37.620 align:middle line:84%
You know, once upon a time it
was fashionable in psychology

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.890 align:middle line:84%
for people to speak of man's
and animals' instincts.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.460 align:middle line:84%
That we have, for example,
an instinct for survival,

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.640 align:middle line:84%
an instinct to make
love, and so on.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.750 align:middle line:84%
But nowadays, that word
has become unfashionable,

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.400 align:middle line:84%
and psychologists tend instead
to use the word drives.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And to speak of
the need for food

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.789 align:middle line:84%
as a drive, the need for
survival or for sex as drives.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very significant
word, because it's brought out,

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.860 align:middle line:84%
isn't it, by people
who feel driven.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.410 align:middle line:90%


00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.900 align:middle line:84%
I must say, personally,
if I feel hungry,

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.620 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel driven.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Also, if I feel lusty,
I don't feel driven.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.940 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't say, oh,
excuse me, but I have to eat.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Or excuse me, but
I need to fulfill

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.900 align:middle line:84%
my sexual urges, my
biological impulses.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.790 align:middle line:90%
I say, hurray.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.810 align:middle line:84%
I identify myself
with my drives.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.480 align:middle line:90%
They're me.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And I don't take a passive
attitude towards them,

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.320 align:middle line:90%
and apologize for them.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.090 align:middle line:90%


00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.980 align:middle line:84%
So the whole idea
of our being driven

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.900 align:middle line:84%
is connected with the
idea of causality.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Of life moving under
the power of the past.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.420 align:middle line:90%


00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.180 align:middle line:84%
And that is so ingrained
in our common sense

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.460 align:middle line:84%
that it's very difficult
to get rid of it.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Because I want to turn the
thing 'round completely

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.880 align:middle line:84%
the other way, and
say that the past

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.860 align:middle line:90%
is the result of the present.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Let us suppose, just
for the sake of example,

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.610 align:middle line:84%
that this universe
started with a big bang,

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.250 align:middle line:90%
as some cosmologists believe.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.744 align:middle line:84%
Now, when that bang happened,
it was the present, wasn't it?

00:03:41.744 --> 00:03:44.350 align:middle line:90%


00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And so the universe began in
what we will call a now moment.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.870 align:middle line:90%
Then it goes on doing its stuff.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And always, when any event
that we now call past

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.200 align:middle line:84%
came into being, it came
into being in the present

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.430 align:middle line:90%
and out of the present.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.630 align:middle line:90%


00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.580 align:middle line:90%
That's one way of seeing it.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.080 align:middle line:84%
But before we get
further involved in this,

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.220 align:middle line:84%
I want to draw your
attention to a fallacy

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.550 align:middle line:84%
in the very common
sense idea of causality.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:32.790 align:middle line:84%
That events are caused by
previous events from which they

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.220 align:middle line:90%
flow, or result, necessarily.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.710 align:middle line:90%


00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.810 align:middle line:84%
To understand the
fallacy of that idea,

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.310 align:middle line:84%
we have to begin by asking,
what do you mean by an event?

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.870 align:middle line:90%


00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.780 align:middle line:84%
Let's take the event of a human
being coming into the world.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.870 align:middle line:90%
Now, when does that event begin?

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.560 align:middle line:84%
Does it occur at the
moment of parturition,

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.960 align:middle line:84%
when the baby actually
comes out of its mother?

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.705 align:middle line:84%
Or does the baby begin at
the moment of conception?

00:05:08.705 --> 00:05:11.710 align:middle line:90%


00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Or does the baby
begin when it was

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.010 align:middle line:84%
an evil gleam in
its father's eye?

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:23.120 align:middle line:84%
Or does a baby begin
when the spermatozoa

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:30.296 align:middle line:84%
are generated in the father,
or the ovum in the mother?

00:05:30.296 --> 00:05:33.255 align:middle line:84%
Or could you say a baby begins
when its father is born,

00:05:33.255 --> 00:05:36.450 align:middle line:90%
or when its mother is born?

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:41.490 align:middle line:84%
All these things can be
thought of as beginnings.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.350 align:middle line:84%
But we decide for purposes
of legal registration

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.020 align:middle line:84%
that a life begins at the
moment of parturition.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.025 align:middle line:84%
And that is a purely
arbitrary decision.

00:05:50.025 --> 00:05:52.830 align:middle line:90%


00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And it has validity only
because we all agree about it.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:03.030 align:middle line:84%
Let me show you the same
phenomenon in the dimension

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.290 align:middle line:84%
of space instead of
the dimension of time.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.945 align:middle line:90%
Let's ask, how big is the sun?

00:06:07.945 --> 00:06:10.490 align:middle line:90%


00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:17.080 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to define
the sun as limited

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.620 align:middle line:90%
by the extent of its fire?

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.130 align:middle line:90%
That's one possible definition.

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.510 align:middle line:84%
But we could equally well
define the sphere of the sun

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.400 align:middle line:90%
by the extent of its heat.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.120 align:middle line:84%
We could also define
the sphere of the sun

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.200 align:middle line:90%
by the extent of its light.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And each of these would
be reasonable choices,

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:40.970 align:middle line:84%
except that it's
rather difficult

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.290 align:middle line:84%
to keep track of the
extent of its light

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.640 align:middle line:90%
because we are inside it.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we
have arbitrarily

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:54.480 align:middle line:84%
agreed to define the sun by
the limit of its visible fire.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:59.330 align:middle line:84%
But you will see in all
these-- by these analogies

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:04.855 align:middle line:84%
that how big a thing is,
or how long an event is

00:07:04.855 --> 00:07:06.780 align:middle line:84%
is simply a matter
of definition.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.660 align:middle line:90%


00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.290 align:middle line:84%
Now therefore, when
by simple definition,

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:17.830 align:middle line:84%
for purposes of discussion,
we have divided events

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.450 align:middle line:84%
into certain periods--
we'll say the first World

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:24.990 align:middle line:84%
War began in 1914,
and it ended in 1918.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:28.390 align:middle line:84%
Now actually, all those things
which led up to the first World

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.860 align:middle line:90%
War started long before 1914.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And the repercussions
of that war

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:37.440 align:middle line:90%
have continued long beyond 1918.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:42.430 align:middle line:84%
How are we to distinguish an
event from its repercussions?

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:46.610 align:middle line:84%
So you will see that because
we have divided events

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:51.130 align:middle line:84%
from one another in this
arbitrary way, we do that,

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:55.130 align:middle line:84%
and then we sort of
forget we did it.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.180 align:middle line:90%
And then we have a puzzle.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.630 align:middle line:84%
How do events lead
to each other?

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:04.930 align:middle line:84%
Because you see, in reality,
there are no separate events.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:09.750 align:middle line:90%
Life moves along like water.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's all connected,
as the source of a river

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:17.180 align:middle line:84%
is connected to the
mouth and to the ocean.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And all the events
or things going on

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:22.960 align:middle line:84%
are like whirlpools
in the stream.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Because you go there today
and you see a whirlpool.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:28.900 align:middle line:84%
You go there tomorrow
and you see a whirlpool.

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.280 align:middle line:84%
But it isn't the same
whirlpool, because all the water

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.179 align:middle line:90%
is changing every second.

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:36.299 align:middle line:84%
What is happening
is not really what

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:41.110 align:middle line:84%
we should call a whirlpool,
but rather a whirlpooling.

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:44.690 align:middle line:90%
It is an activity, not a thing.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, every so-called
thing can be called an event.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.990 align:middle line:90%
We call, say, a house housing.

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:57.340 align:middle line:90%
We call a mat matting.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And we could equally
call a cat a catting.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.780 align:middle line:84%
So we could say the
catting sat on the matting.

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And we would thereby have
a world in which there

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:09.220 align:middle line:90%
were no things, but only events.

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.740 align:middle line:90%
To give another illustration.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:15.310 align:middle line:84%
A flame is something we say,
there is a flame on the candle.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:17.680 align:middle line:84%
But it would be
more correct to say

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.280 align:middle line:84%
there is a flaming
on the candle,

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.152 align:middle line:84%
because the flame is
a stream of hot gas.

00:09:23.152 --> 00:09:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Let's take another
amusing example.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.680 align:middle line:90%
We say fist.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.490 align:middle line:90%
And fist is a noun.

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:30.840 align:middle line:90%
And fist looks like a thing.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:35.260 align:middle line:84%
But suddenly, what happens to
the fist when I open my hand?

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:40.650 align:middle line:84%
See I was fisting,
now I'm handing.

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:42.540 align:middle line:90%
Handing it to you.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:47.660 align:middle line:84%
So every kind of so-called thing
can be spoken of as an event.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And because events
flow into each other,

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.250 align:middle line:84%
the fisting flows
into the handing,

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:59.680 align:middle line:84%
we cannot say exactly where
one ends and the other begins.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.610 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, if
we remember that,

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:08.110 align:middle line:84%
we shall see that we do not
need the idea of causality

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:14.050 align:middle line:84%
to explain how a prior event
influences a following event.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:16.540 align:middle line:90%
Because it's like this.

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Supposing I'm looking through
a narrow slit in a fence,

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:25.750 align:middle line:90%
and a snake goes by.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:29.290 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen a snake
before, and this is mysterious.

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And I see through
the slit in the fence

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:34.070 align:middle line:90%
first the snake's head.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:38.700 align:middle line:84%
Then I see a long,
trailing body,

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.942 align:middle line:90%
and then finally the tail.

00:10:41.942 --> 00:10:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well,
that was interesting.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Then the snake turns
around and goes back.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And again, I see first
the head, and then

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.280 align:middle line:90%
after an interval, the tail.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I call the head one
event and the tail another,

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:58.530 align:middle line:84%
it will seem to me
that the event head

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:02.580 align:middle line:90%
is the cause of the event tail.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.950 align:middle line:90%
And the tail is the effect.

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:08.850 align:middle line:84%
But if I look at
the whole snake,

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:11.260 align:middle line:90%
I will see a head tailed snake.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:15.132 align:middle line:84%
And it would be simply absurd to
say that the head of the snake

00:11:15.132 --> 00:11:17.090 align:middle line:84%
is the cause of the tail,
as if the head came--

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:20.930 align:middle line:84%
as if the snake came into
being first the head and then

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:21.430 align:middle line:90%
the tail.

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:24.430 align:middle line:90%


00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:28.330 align:middle line:84%
The snake comes into being
out of its egg as a head

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.830 align:middle line:90%
tailed snake.

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And so in exactly the
same way, all events

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.470 align:middle line:90%
are really one event.

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:40.360 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about
different events,

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.050 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at different
sections or parts

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:48.050 align:middle line:90%
of one continuous happening.

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the
idea of separate events

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.980 align:middle line:84%
which have to be linked
by a mysterious process

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:58.915 align:middle line:84%
called cause and effect
is completely unnecessary.

00:11:58.915 --> 00:12:02.100 align:middle line:90%


00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:07.720 align:middle line:84%
But having thought that way,
we think of present events

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.660 align:middle line:90%
as being caused by past events.

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:14.790 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we tend
to regard ourselves

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:21.030 align:middle line:84%
as the puppets of the past,
as driven along by something

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:22.490 align:middle line:90%
that is always behind us.

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:26.440 align:middle line:90%


00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, to overcome this
impression, it's very simple.

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:33.600 align:middle line:84%
You begin again
with an experiment

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:40.830 align:middle line:84%
which I suggested in a
previous talk about meditation.

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:42.775 align:middle line:84%
Approach the world
through your ears.

00:12:42.775 --> 00:12:46.430 align:middle line:90%


00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:51.760 align:middle line:84%
If you shut your eyes and
make contact with reality,

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.510 align:middle line:84%
purely with your ears-- I
mean, it's kind of silly

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:57.020 align:middle line:84%
perhaps to shut your eyes when
you're looking at television,

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.130 align:middle line:90%
but do it just for a moment.

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:04.771 align:middle line:84%
And you will realize that
the sounds you are hearing

00:13:04.771 --> 00:13:08.220 align:middle line:90%
are all coming out of silence.

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:14.660 align:middle line:84%
You hear [GONG SOUND],
and it fades away.

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:18.825 align:middle line:84%
Fades, fades, fades, fades,
and finally disappears.

00:13:18.825 --> 00:13:22.060 align:middle line:90%


00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:23.730 align:middle line:84%
It's a curious world
this, isn't it?

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:26.530 align:middle line:84%
Because you hear all
the realities in it,

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:31.340 align:middle line:84%
the sounds, suddenly
coming out of nothing.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.830 align:middle line:84%
You don't see any reason
for them to begin,

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:37.160 align:middle line:84%
they just appear, and
then they echo way

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:42.520 align:middle line:84%
through the corridors of the
mind which we call memory.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:47.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you open your
eyes, it's a little harder

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:52.970 align:middle line:84%
to see this with your eyes
because unlike sounds, the eyes

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:54.100 align:middle line:90%
sound static.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.610 align:middle line:90%


00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:00.480 align:middle line:90%
Or rather, they look static.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.340 align:middle line:84%
Everything looks
still to your eyes.

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:07.790 align:middle line:84%
But you must understand that the
world you are looking at-- say,

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:08.890 align:middle line:90%
when you look at a light.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.500 align:middle line:90%
That light is vibrating.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:15.350 align:middle line:84%
All material things
are vibrations,

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:17.650 align:middle line:84%
and they are
vibrating at you now

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:22.500 align:middle line:84%
in the same way as the sound
was vibrating on your ears.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:26.840 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
present world that you see

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:32.110 align:middle line:84%
is a vibration coming-- just as
the sound comes out of silence,

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:34.780 align:middle line:84%
the light is coming
out of space.

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:37.290 align:middle line:84%
It's coming out of
nothing straight at you

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:41.920 align:middle line:84%
now, and echoing
away into the past.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:46.370 align:middle line:84%
So the course of
time is really very

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:51.640 align:middle line:84%
much like the course
of a ship in the ocean.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.550 align:middle line:84%
Because here's
the ship, you see.

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:56.960 align:middle line:90%
And it leaves behind it a wake.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:02.870 align:middle line:90%


00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:09.120 align:middle line:90%
And the wake fades out.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And that tells us
where the ship has

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:17.310 align:middle line:84%
been in just the
same way as the past,

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:21.290 align:middle line:84%
and our memory of the past,
tells us what we have done.

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:24.940 align:middle line:84%
But as we go back into the
past, and we go back and back

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:28.150 align:middle line:84%
to prehistory, and we use
all kinds of instruments

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:31.500 align:middle line:84%
and scientific methods for
detecting what happened,

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:35.750 align:middle line:84%
we eventually reach a point
where all record of the past

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:41.520 align:middle line:84%
fades away in just the same
way as the wake of the ship.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, the important thing to
remember in this illustration

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:48.680 align:middle line:84%
is that the wake
doesn't drive the ship

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.500 align:middle line:84%
any more than the
tail wags the dog.

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:55.990 align:middle line:90%


00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Supposing there's a
neurotic, difficult child.

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And one school of thought used
to say, well, bang him about.

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:04.350 align:middle line:90%
Beat him up.

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:06.300 align:middle line:90%
And maybe he'll change.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.609 align:middle line:90%
But then they said, oh no.

00:16:07.609 --> 00:16:09.400 align:middle line:84%
That's not fair to the
child to beat him up

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.230 align:middle line:90%
because it was his parents.

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:12.870 align:middle line:84%
They didn't bring
him up properly.

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And so then they say,
well, punish the parents.

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:16.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, the parents
say, excuse me,

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.070 align:middle line:84%
but our parents
were neurotic too.

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And they brought us up badly,
so we couldn't help what we did.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And so since the grandparents
are dead, we can't get at them.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And in any case,
supposing we could,

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.380 align:middle line:84%
we would pass the whole
blame back to Adam and Eve

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:30.520 align:middle line:90%
in the Garden of Eden.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And they'd say, they
started all this mess.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:35.990 align:middle line:90%
But then Eve would say, no.

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:38.200 align:middle line:84%
The serpent tempted
me and I did eat.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.340 align:middle line:90%
And it was the serpent's fault.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Well you know, when God, in the
story of Genesis, asked Eve,

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:47.880 align:middle line:84%
didst thou eat the
fruit of the tree

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.430 align:middle line:84%
where of I told thee
thou should not eat?

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:53.520 align:middle line:84%
She said, oh, but the serpent
tempted me and I did eat.

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.410 align:middle line:90%
And God looked at the serpent.

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And the serpent didn't
make any excuse.

00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:01.240 align:middle line:90%
He probably winked.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:07.470 align:middle line:84%
Because the serpent,
being an angel,

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:11.780 align:middle line:84%
was wise enough to know
where the present begins.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:18.619 align:middle line:84%
So you see, if you insist on
being moved, being determined

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:22.270 align:middle line:90%
by the past, that's your game.

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:27.290 align:middle line:84%
But the fact of the matter
is, it all starts right now.

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:34.480 align:middle line:84%
But we like to establish a
connectivity with the past,

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:40.280 align:middle line:84%
because that gives other people
the impression that we're sane.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:44.090 align:middle line:84%
If you ask me then, why am I
talking, well, I could say,

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:45.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm making a living this way.

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Or I have a message that I
want to get across to you.

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:50.790 align:middle line:90%
But that is not the reason.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:53.510 align:middle line:84%
I am talking for the same
reason that birds sing

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:57.730 align:middle line:84%
and for the same reason that
the stars shine, is, I dig it.

00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:00.000 align:middle line:90%
Why do you dig it?

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, I could go on answering
all sorts of questions

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:05.920 align:middle line:84%
about human motivation
and psychology,

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.570 align:middle line:84%
but they wouldn't
explain a thing.

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:10.090 align:middle line:84%
Because explaining
things by the past

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:12.910 align:middle line:84%
is really a refusal to
explain them at all.

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:15.480 align:middle line:84%
All you're doing is
postponing the explanation.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.640 align:middle line:84%
You're putting it back and
back and back and back,

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.723 align:middle line:90%
and that explains nothing.

00:18:18.723 --> 00:18:22.480 align:middle line:90%


00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:27.000 align:middle line:84%
What does explain
things is the present.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.540 align:middle line:90%
Why do you do it now?

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:36.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a slight cheat,
because that doesn't explain it

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:37.580 align:middle line:90%
either.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens now,
just as the sound comes out

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:44.060 align:middle line:84%
of silence, all this
comes out of nowhere.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.960 align:middle line:84%
This is in connection with
what I explained to you

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.550 align:middle line:84%
in another talk about
the power of nothingness.

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:52.520 align:middle line:84%
All life suddenly
emerges out of space.

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:56.040 align:middle line:90%
Bang, right now.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:19:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And to ask again,
why does it happen,

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:03.820 align:middle line:84%
is an unprofitable question,
because the interesting thing

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:06.160 align:middle line:90%
is not why, but what.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.030 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:10.290 align:middle line:90%
Not why does it happen?

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:17.800 align:middle line:84%
I can say, well, I am doing this
now because I did that then.

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm producing for you
a continuous line of thought.

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:26.190 align:middle line:84%
But actually I'm
doing it backwards.

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:29.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing it always from
now, and connecting up

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:31.640 align:middle line:84%
what I do now with
what I did so that you

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.830 align:middle line:90%
can see a consistent story.

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:36.660 align:middle line:90%


00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:41.000 align:middle line:84%
If I define myself as the
whole field of events,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.620 align:middle line:84%
we'll say the organism
environment field, which

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:47.050 align:middle line:84%
is the real me, then all
the things that happen to be

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:49.000 align:middle line:90%
may be called my doing.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.220 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
real sense of karma.

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:55.410 align:middle line:84%
But when we speak about
freedom from karma,

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:58.430 align:middle line:84%
freedom from being the
puppet of the past,

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:02.620 align:middle line:84%
that simply involves a
change in your thinking.

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:05.600 align:middle line:84%
It involves, in
other words, your

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.680 align:middle line:84%
getting rid of the
habit of thought

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:12.420 align:middle line:84%
whereby you define yourself
as the result of what

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.940 align:middle line:90%
has gone before.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And instead, get into the more
plausible and more reasonable

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:21.701 align:middle line:84%
habit of thought in terms of
which you don't define yourself

00:20:21.701 --> 00:20:23.200 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what
you've done before,

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:26.700 align:middle line:84%
but in terms of what
you're doing now.

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And that is liberation from
the ridiculous situation

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:34.630 align:middle line:84%
of being a dog
wagged by its tail.

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:37.200 align:middle line:90%
