00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:33.240 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.130 align:middle line:90%
>>It's astonishing.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.667 align:middle line:84%
All this is only
20 or 30 minutes

00:00:37.667 --> 00:00:39.000 align:middle line:90%
from the heart of San Francisco.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.850 align:middle line:90%


00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Not a human habitation
in sight anywhere.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.620 align:middle line:90%


00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.000 align:middle line:84%
I've been living out
here for some months

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.580 align:middle line:84%
to write and to absorb
an atmosphere that

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.870 align:middle line:84%
is different from the
city, to try and find out

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.700 align:middle line:84%
what is the essential difference
between the world of nature

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.870 align:middle line:90%
and the world of man.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.040 align:middle line:84%
Because there's an
obvious difference,

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.700 align:middle line:84%
like the difference
of artistic styles.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.480 align:middle line:84%
No one, for example, would
confuse a painting by Leonardo

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.160 align:middle line:84%
with a painting by
Picasso, or music by Bach

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.830 align:middle line:90%
with music by Shostakovich.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way, there seems
to be a complete difference

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:32.370 align:middle line:84%
of style between the
things that human beings do

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.280 align:middle line:84%
and the things that nature
does, even though human beings

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.580 align:middle line:90%
are themselves part of nature.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.240 align:middle line:90%


00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.700 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand,
nature is wiggly.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.030 align:middle line:90%
Everything wiggles.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.940 align:middle line:84%
The outlines of the hills,
the shapes of the trees,

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.440 align:middle line:84%
the way the wind brushes
the grass, the clouds,

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.170 align:middle line:84%
tracks of streams--
it all wiggles.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.190 align:middle line:90%


00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.699 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason or
other, we find wiggly things

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:14.650 align:middle line:90%
very difficult to keep track of.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, we say
to people, keep still

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.557 align:middle line:90%
so that I can see you.

00:02:18.557 --> 00:02:19.640 align:middle line:90%
Keep still for the camera.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.750 align:middle line:90%


00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And we say, well, let's get
things straightened out.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.050 align:middle line:90%
Let's get this ironed out.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.250 align:middle line:90%
Let's get it all squared away.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And then somehow we think
we understand things

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.030 align:middle line:84%
when we have translated them
into terms of straight lines

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.720 align:middle line:90%
and squares.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's why they call
rather rigid people squares.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.900 align:middle line:90%


00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.140 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't fit nature.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.870 align:middle line:90%


00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.467 align:middle line:84%
Wherever human beings have been
around and done their thing

00:02:59.467 --> 00:03:00.300 align:middle line:90%
you find rectangles.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.820 align:middle line:90%


00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.878 align:middle line:90%
We live in boxes.

00:03:05.878 --> 00:03:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Our streets, especially
across states

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.970 align:middle line:84%
like Kansas and Nebraska, are
laid out in a grid pattern.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Why, they even
dropped a grid pattern

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.270 align:middle line:84%
on top of San Francisco
with all those hills

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.770 align:middle line:90%
so that cars run away.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.370 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems that
the human being really

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.274 align:middle line:84%
has a very simple kind of
mind, and all this wiggliness

00:03:34.274 --> 00:03:35.065 align:middle line:90%
is too complicated.

00:03:35.065 --> 00:03:38.710 align:middle line:90%


00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it
really is complicated.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Because, after all,
it's very simple

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:50.730 align:middle line:84%
to move, say, to raise something
or to open and close your hand.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.580 align:middle line:84%
It's perfectly easy because we
don't have to think about it.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Things become complicated
only when we think about them.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's because we're
trying to translate them

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.650 align:middle line:84%
into a form of life which
is very much simpler

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.320 align:middle line:84%
and cruder than the forms
of life we're talking about.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.070 align:middle line:84%
A triangle is very much simpler
and cruder than a mountain,

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.680 align:middle line:84%
even though you may represent
a mountain with a triangle.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.340 align:middle line:90%


00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.670 align:middle line:84%
Human beings are just
as wiggly as nature,

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.904 align:middle line:84%
and our brains are an
incredible mess of wiggles.

00:04:32.904 --> 00:04:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's the part
of ourselves that we

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:35.645 align:middle line:90%
understand least of all.

00:04:35.645 --> 00:04:40.000 align:middle line:90%


00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid the problem is partly
due to Mr. Euclid, who invented

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.330 align:middle line:84%
geometry, because he didn't
really measure the Earth.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.740 align:middle line:84%
He measured and gave us ideas
about the very simple forms

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.300 align:middle line:90%
in his own mind.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps we should
come to the conclusion

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.200 align:middle line:84%
that he really had a
rather weak intellect.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.740 align:middle line:90%


00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes when I'm
in the middle of all this,

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.820 align:middle line:84%
I feel as if I were in the
middle of an amazing brain.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.860 align:middle line:90%


00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.420 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the brain is
a network of interconnected

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.530 align:middle line:84%
neurons, and each
one of those neurons

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.760 align:middle line:84%
is a fairly simple
affair, because it either

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.860 align:middle line:90%
fires or it doesn't fire.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.480 align:middle line:84%
It gives you the message
on or off, yes or no.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.100 align:middle line:90%


00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:36.290 align:middle line:84%
But what we call things,
the plants, birds, trees,

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.590 align:middle line:84%
are far more complicated
than a neuron,

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.610 align:middle line:84%
and their are billions
of them, and they are all

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:44.970 align:middle line:90%
living together in a network.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.260 align:middle line:90%


00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.840 align:middle line:84%
Just as there is an
interdependence of flowers

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.919 align:middle line:84%
and bees-- where there are no
flowers, there are no bees,

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:55.335 align:middle line:84%
and where there
are no bees, there

00:05:55.335 --> 00:05:57.435 align:middle line:84%
are no flowers-- they're
really one organism.

00:05:57.435 --> 00:06:00.290 align:middle line:90%


00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And so, in the same way,
everything in nature

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.230 align:middle line:90%
depends on everything else.

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.350 align:middle line:90%
So it's interconnected.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And so the many, many
patterns of interconnections

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.740 align:middle line:84%
lock it all together into unity,
which is, however, much too

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.230 align:middle line:84%
complicated for us
to think about except

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.070 align:middle line:84%
in very, very
simple, crude ways.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.635 align:middle line:90%


00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:29.040 align:middle line:90%
But I am part of all this.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.860 align:middle line:84%
I am, as it were, one all the
cells in this tremendous brain

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.590 align:middle line:84%
which I can't understand,
because the part cannot

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:38.623 align:middle line:90%
comprehend the whole.

00:06:38.623 --> 00:06:41.520 align:middle line:90%


00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And yet, at the
same time, I don't

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:48.370 align:middle line:84%
feel, like so many
people seem to feel,

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.780 align:middle line:84%
that I'm a foreigner or
a stranger in this world.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.430 align:middle line:90%


00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.810 align:middle line:84%
Its aesthetic forms
somehow appeal to me

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:02.590 align:middle line:84%
more than most of the aesthetic
forms which men produce.

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:06.820 align:middle line:90%


00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:12.170 align:middle line:84%
I feel in it as
if-- in the same way

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.460 align:middle line:84%
when you see a flower
in a field it's really

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.920 align:middle line:84%
the whole field
that is flowering,

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.640 align:middle line:84%
because the flower couldn't
exist in that particular place

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.145 align:middle line:84%
without the special surroundings
of the field that it has.

00:07:24.145 --> 00:07:27.300 align:middle line:84%
You only find flowers
in surroundings

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.530 align:middle line:90%
which will support them.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:32.710 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way, you
only find human beings

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:35.420 align:middle line:84%
on a planet of this kind with
an atmosphere of this kind

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.710 align:middle line:84%
with temperature of
this kind supplied

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.270 align:middle line:84%
by a convenient
neighboring star.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.320 align:middle line:90%


00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And so just as the flower
is a flowering of the field,

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:51.090 align:middle line:84%
I feel myself as a
personing, a manning,

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:57.000 align:middle line:84%
a peopling of the
whole universe.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.930 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I seem,
like everything else,

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:11.650 align:middle line:84%
to be a center, a sort of
vortex at which the whole energy

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:16.730 align:middle line:84%
of the universe realizes itself,
comes alive, a sort of aperture

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.610 align:middle line:84%
through which the whole
universe is conscious of itself.

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:22.810 align:middle line:90%


00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:26.425 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I go with it
as a center to a circumference.

00:08:26.425 --> 00:08:30.540 align:middle line:90%


00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.309 align:middle line:84%
The astrologers,
in theory at least,

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:36.230 align:middle line:84%
may not have been
so far wrong when,

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:40.460 align:middle line:84%
in trying to draw a picture
of a human mind or soul,

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:44.360 align:middle line:84%
they drew a very crude map of
the whole universe centered

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:48.370 align:middle line:84%
on the time and
place of the birth

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:49.540 align:middle line:90%
of that particular person.

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:54.330 align:middle line:84%
It's not a bad idea, but I
don't think the astrologers know

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:59.070 align:middle line:84%
how to read their maps because
the maps are too crude.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:03.790 align:middle line:84%
But the essential point is
obviously that each one of us,

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:09.490 align:middle line:84%
not only human beings but
every leaf, every weed,

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:12.090 align:middle line:84%
exists in the way it does
only because everything

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:13.390 align:middle line:90%
else around it does.

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:15.100 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
there's a relationship

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:20.459 align:middle line:84%
between the center
and the circumference,

00:09:20.459 --> 00:09:22.000 align:middle line:84%
which is rather like
the relationship

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.080 align:middle line:90%
between the poles of a magnet.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.130 align:middle line:84%
Without the center,
no circumference.

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:28.810 align:middle line:84%
Without the
circumference, no center.

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:31.430 align:middle line:90%


00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And although we say of poles
that they're the poles apart,

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:42.960 align:middle line:84%
that is to say
extremely different,

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.030 align:middle line:84%
there's something
between them, just

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.350 align:middle line:84%
as the north and south
poles of a magnet

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:49.870 align:middle line:90%
are united by the magnet.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:56.180 align:middle line:84%
So the individual and the
universe are inseparable.

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:59.990 align:middle line:90%


00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:03.100 align:middle line:84%
But the curious thing
is that while that's

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.840 align:middle line:84%
rather easy to see in
theory, very few people

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:11.360 align:middle line:84%
are aware of it in an
important, strong way

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.450 align:middle line:84%
like one is aware
of blue in blue sky

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:18.300 align:middle line:90%
or of the heat in fire.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.516 align:middle line:84%
It's more of an idea than
it is of a realization.

00:10:20.516 --> 00:10:25.200 align:middle line:90%


00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And so it strikes
me more and more

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:38.265 align:middle line:84%
that our failure to feel at
home in this astonishing brain

00:10:38.265 --> 00:10:50.225 align:middle line:84%
in which we live is the result
of a basic initial mistake

00:10:50.225 --> 00:10:54.430 align:middle line:84%
in our thinking about
the world and is,

00:10:54.430 --> 00:11:00.490 align:middle line:84%
in turn, the cause
of what is beginning

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:05.870 align:middle line:84%
to look like the failure of
our technology, of the fact

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:10.540 align:middle line:84%
that everything we're doing
to try to improve the world

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.250 align:middle line:84%
was a success in
the short run, made

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:16.750 align:middle line:84%
amazing initial improvements,
but in the long run

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:22.770 align:middle line:84%
we seem to be destroying the
planet by our very efforts

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:25.840 align:middle line:90%
to control it and improve it.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And it strikes me that that
is because we are really

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:33.010 align:middle line:84%
too simple-minded to
understand what we're

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:38.610 align:middle line:84%
doing when we interfere with
the natural world strongly

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:40.870 align:middle line:90%
and on a vast scale.

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:42.459 align:middle line:84%
We don't really
interfere with it,

00:11:42.459 --> 00:11:44.500 align:middle line:84%
because that would suggest
that we were something

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:48.190 align:middle line:84%
different from it,
something outside.

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:59.745 align:middle line:84%
But I think what we're doing
is we are understanding it

00:11:59.745 --> 00:12:11.690 align:middle line:84%
in terms of languages, numbers,
in terms of a logic which

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:15.092 align:middle line:84%
is too simple for the job,
too crude for the job.

00:12:15.092 --> 00:12:18.070 align:middle line:90%


00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:23.660 align:middle line:84%
To begin with, we
understand everything

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.630 align:middle line:84%
in terms of words or
numbers, and they're

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:29.710 align:middle line:90%
stretched out in rows and lines.

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And our eyes have to
scan those lines in order

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.040 align:middle line:90%
to understand them.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.540 align:middle line:84%
But when I scan
this view, I don't

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:42.300 align:middle line:90%
do it line by line by line.

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:43.650 align:middle line:90%
I see the whole thing at once.

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:47.140 align:middle line:90%


00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:51.435 align:middle line:84%
I take it in with, as it
were, a wide-angle lens.

00:12:51.435 --> 00:12:55.880 align:middle line:90%


00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:00.520 align:middle line:84%
But when I try to understand
the world through literature

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:04.850 align:middle line:84%
and through mathematics,
I have to scan lines.

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:08.670 align:middle line:84%
That's why it takes us so long
to get educated in school,

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:13.040 align:middle line:84%
because our eyes have
to scan and organize

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:17.410 align:middle line:84%
miles and miles of print,
and that takes us 20 years

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:21.690 align:middle line:90%
or more to get through it.

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:28.880 align:middle line:84%
But life happens, changes
go on too rapidly for that.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.610 align:middle line:84%
Because, you see, in
the world everything

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:32.640 align:middle line:84%
is happening altogether
everywhere at once.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.150 align:middle line:90%


00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, we with
our myopic little minds

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:40.464 align:middle line:90%
are working it out step by step.

00:13:40.464 --> 00:13:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we are
greatly assisted

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.213 align:middle line:90%
by the rapidity of the computer.

00:13:43.213 --> 00:13:45.790 align:middle line:90%


00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:50.040 align:middle line:84%
But even so, the computer is
still looking at things in rows

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.790 align:middle line:84%
as the magnetic tape
goes through and is

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.240 align:middle line:90%
scanned by the computer.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.310 align:middle line:84%
It's still all going
along in a single track.

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:58.810 align:middle line:90%


00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And I suppose, then,
there are difficulties

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:05.390 align:middle line:84%
that we have, lamentably,
one-track minds

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:11.660 align:middle line:84%
in an infinitely
many-tracked universe.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And we may have to come
to the alarming conclusion

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:17.920 align:middle line:84%
that the universe is
smarter than we are.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:30.470 align:middle line:90%


00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:34.170 align:middle line:84%
I've just come back
from Los Angeles.

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:37.580 align:middle line:84%
I was down there to meet
with a group of rather

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:41.710 align:middle line:84%
important people, people
in the movie industry,

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:48.170 align:middle line:84%
scientists, and so on,
who were considering

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:52.500 align:middle line:84%
calling a congress of the
best minds in the world

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:56.860 align:middle line:84%
to meet in Los Angeles
in the near future

00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:01.120 align:middle line:84%
to be a kind of planetary
alarm conference.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.930 align:middle line:84%
They wanted scientists
and statesmen,

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:09.780 align:middle line:84%
religious leaders
to do something

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:15.130 align:middle line:84%
to impress upon the world
through all the media

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:21.360 align:middle line:84%
that we are in very serious
danger of destroying

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.940 align:middle line:84%
the biosphere, that is to say
the whole envelope of living

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:27.120 align:middle line:84%
creatures which
covers this planet,

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.700 align:middle line:84%
through pollution,
over-population, nuclear

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:36.270 align:middle line:84%
fallout, poisoning of our
food, and very lack of food.

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And we met to
discuss the problem

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:39.890 align:middle line:90%
of organizing this conference.

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And here were all
these brilliant people,

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.710 align:middle line:84%
and it came over
us that we really

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:49.210 align:middle line:84%
didn't know what
we ought to say.

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:51.216 align:middle line:84%
You can scream and
create a state of panic,

00:15:51.216 --> 00:15:52.340 align:middle line:90%
but that won't do any good.

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:55.070 align:middle line:90%


00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And when it came
down it, we didn't

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:01.030 align:middle line:84%
know what we ought to
say because we really

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:04.330 align:middle line:90%
don't know what to do.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:06.440 align:middle line:84%
Some things that we
might do, for example,

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.970 align:middle line:84%
to increase the food supply
with high-yield crops

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:11.445 align:middle line:90%
may be ecological mistakes.

00:16:11.445 --> 00:16:14.200 align:middle line:90%


00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And so the consensus of almost
everybody at the meeting

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:21.060 align:middle line:84%
was that in some way
or other the human race

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:24.660 align:middle line:84%
has to learn how to leave
the world alone and let what

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:27.250 align:middle line:84%
is called the natural
homeostasis, that

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:32.567 align:middle line:84%
is the self-balancing process of
nature, take care of the mess.

00:16:32.567 --> 00:16:33.900 align:middle line:90%
Now how are we going to do that?

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:41.180 align:middle line:90%


00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:46.620 align:middle line:90%
This is Japanese ceremonial tea.

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:48.074 align:middle line:90%
It's good on a cold day.

00:16:48.074 --> 00:16:51.706 align:middle line:90%


00:16:51.706 --> 00:16:54.610 align:middle line:84%
See, our problem is we don't
really know how to stop.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:56.090 align:middle line:84%
We've got something
started, and we

00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:58.430 align:middle line:84%
see it's going in
a wrong direction.

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
difficulty is, to borrow

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:05.390 align:middle line:84%
an old Chinese saying, that
when the wrong man uses

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:08.566 align:middle line:84%
the right means, the right
means work in the wrong way.

00:17:08.566 --> 00:17:09.940 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
there's something

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:11.950 align:middle line:90%
wrong with the way we think.

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And while that is
there, everything we do

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.153 align:middle line:90%
will be a mess.

00:17:16.153 --> 00:17:17.319 align:middle line:90%
Now what is it that's wrong?

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:21.890 align:middle line:90%


00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:24.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, as far as I can
see, the basic mistake

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:30.880 align:middle line:84%
is that we've invented this
wonderful system of language

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:37.940 align:middle line:84%
and calculation and that
it is at once too simple

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:41.820 align:middle line:84%
to deal with the
complexity of the world,

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:46.180 align:middle line:84%
and also we are liable to
confuse that system of symbols

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.610 align:middle line:84%
with the world itself,
just as we confuse,

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:50.765 align:middle line:90%
say, money with wealth.

00:17:50.765 --> 00:17:52.390 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are
in business to make

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:54.070 align:middle line:90%
money instead of wealth.

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:56.611 align:middle line:84%
When they make the money, they
don't know what to do with it.

00:17:56.611 --> 00:18:02.470 align:middle line:90%


00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And so, in the same way, we
confuse happiness with status,

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.730 align:middle line:84%
and we confuse ourselves
as living organisms

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:14.670 align:middle line:84%
which are one with this
whole universe with something

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:18.070 align:middle line:90%
we call our personality.

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:21.186 align:middle line:90%
Now what is our personality?

00:18:21.186 --> 00:18:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Our personality is what we
call our image, our image

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.720 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves, and also our
thought about ourselves,

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.870 align:middle line:90%
our idea of ourselves.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:33.170 align:middle line:90%
This is the person.

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:36.560 align:middle line:84%
In other words, what
people meet and understand

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:39.160 align:middle line:84%
and what I understand
as Alan Watts

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:43.910 align:middle line:84%
is a big act which
is not really me.

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:46.810 align:middle line:84%
Because in the
image of Alan Watts,

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:49.360 align:middle line:84%
there are not all my
unconscious processes,

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.650 align:middle line:90%
both psychological and physical.

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:53.470 align:middle line:84%
The construction
of my brain is not

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:56.360 align:middle line:84%
contained in the
concept Alan Watts.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And the concept
Alan Watts does not

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.900 align:middle line:84%
contain the inseparable
relationships

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:03.500 align:middle line:84%
which I have with all
the rest of the universe.

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, that
concept is a fraud.

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And when it's mistaken for the
real me, there's a confusion.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:14.100 align:middle line:84%
Because if somebody
says to me, Alan Watts,

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.270 align:middle line:84%
do something about it,
the concept Alan Watts

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:19.490 align:middle line:90%
can't do anything.

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:22.860 align:middle line:84%
In other words, because
it's only a concept,

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.640 align:middle line:84%
you can't make it
lift a weight, just

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:28.220 align:middle line:84%
a three is a concept,
three the number.

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:31.460 align:middle line:84%
You can't make just
plain three do anything.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:34.410 align:middle line:84%
So also you can't wrap up
parcels with the equator.

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:39.150 align:middle line:84%
It's a useful imaginary line,
but it can't do anything.

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:42.000 align:middle line:84%
But we all feel that
this concept of ourselves

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.510 align:middle line:84%
which we call our
personality or our ego

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:47.142 align:middle line:84%
can do something, because
we think it really exists.

00:19:47.142 --> 00:19:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you why
we think it exists.

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:52.250 align:middle line:90%


00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:55.120 align:middle line:84%
What happens if I
were to say to you,

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.200 align:middle line:84%
now look hard at the
television screen?

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.770 align:middle line:90%
Really look at it.

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:01.965 align:middle line:84%
What do you as distinct
from just watching it

00:20:01.965 --> 00:20:03.340 align:middle line:84%
in the ordinary
way when you say,

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:04.673 align:middle line:90%
now I've really got to see that?

00:20:04.673 --> 00:20:07.060 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:10.120 align:middle line:84%
Notice that you tighten
muscles all around here,

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.982 align:middle line:90%
that you frown a little.

00:20:11.982 --> 00:20:14.390 align:middle line:90%
You clench your teeth perhaps.

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:17.360 align:middle line:84%
Now what has that got to do
with seeing anything clearly?

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.510 align:middle line:84%
It has absolutely
nothing to do with it.

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:21.405 align:middle line:84%
The same thing when
you listen carefully.

00:20:21.405 --> 00:20:22.650 align:middle line:90%
Now listen.

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:24.330 align:middle line:90%
Catch everything that's said.

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:27.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, you start tightening
up around your ears.

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:30.270 align:middle line:84%
That has nothing to do
with hearing clearly.

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:32.340 align:middle line:84%
Now from the moment we
were little children,

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:35.610 align:middle line:84%
when teachers in class
screamed at us, pay attention,

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:40.920 align:middle line:84%
we go to tight in various ways,
either to see or hear more

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.630 align:middle line:84%
clearly, to concentrate,
or to will something, which

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:47.700 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to be
difficult to do.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And that constitutes
a habitual tension

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:53.570 align:middle line:84%
over the whole body that's
there almost all the time.

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And that feeling of
unnecessary tension

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:59.950 align:middle line:84%
is, as it were, the material
sensation upon which we fasten

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:05.600 align:middle line:84%
this concept of I. We
hang it onto that feeling.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.510 align:middle line:90%
The concept is not us.

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:10.240 align:middle line:84%
The feeling of tension
is completely phony.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.900 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to
do with success

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.410 align:middle line:90%
in seeing, hearing, or acting.

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And so we get the marriage of
an illusion with a falsehood,

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.125 align:middle line:90%
and that we call ourselves.

00:21:21.125 --> 00:21:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And no wonder we feel
cut off from everything,

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:28.050 align:middle line:84%
alienated, frightened
of life and death.

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:33.260 align:middle line:84%
So what has to happen
is we have to come back

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:42.980 align:middle line:84%
to a sane view of our own life,
which is the way we really

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:47.370 align:middle line:84%
are, an organism functioning in
terms of the whole environment

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:49.380 align:middle line:84%
with the whole
environment instead

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:51.580 align:middle line:84%
of this funny little
separate personality.

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:53.810 align:middle line:90%
But how are we going to do that?

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:57.080 align:middle line:84%
People say, oh, you can't
change human nature overnight.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.880 align:middle line:84%
You're asking us
to give up the ego,

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.470 align:middle line:84%
and that's the most difficult
of all things to do.

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:08.040 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it isn't, because
the ego doesn't exist.

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:11.450 align:middle line:84%
But of course, if you try to
give up your ego with your ego,

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:15.270 align:middle line:84%
then it'll take you
till the end of time.

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:17.740 align:middle line:90%
Because this is the point.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:20.620 align:middle line:90%
You can't transform yourself.

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:22.550 align:middle line:90%
You can't make yourself sane.

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:24.430 align:middle line:90%
You can't make yourself loving.

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:25.975 align:middle line:84%
You can't make
yourself unselfish.

00:22:25.975 --> 00:22:28.740 align:middle line:90%


00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And yet it's absolutely
necessary that we be that way.

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:36.660 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely necessary.

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:41.115 align:middle line:84%
If we are going to hand
over the direction of nature

00:22:41.115 --> 00:22:44.900 align:middle line:84%
to nature, which is
what it comes to,

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:48.960 align:middle line:84%
it's absolutely necessary
that we let go of ourselves.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And it can't be
done, not by anything

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:57.150 align:middle line:84%
that we call doing it, acting,
willing, or even just accepting

00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:58.060 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:59.390 align:middle line:90%
You can't do it.

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:01.290 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:04.895 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't really exist
as that kind of a separate ego

00:23:04.895 --> 00:23:05.930 align:middle line:90%
or personality.

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:08.560 align:middle line:84%
It's just an idea based
on a phony feeling.

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.550 align:middle line:90%


00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:19.560 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes down to it,
it's shocking news for us,

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:23.560 align:middle line:84%
for the human race,
for our pride.

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:28.460 align:middle line:84%
You're only making a mess by
trying to put things straight.

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.620 align:middle line:84%
You're trying to straighten
out a wiggly world,

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:34.050 align:middle line:90%
and no wonder you're in trouble.

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:36.360 align:middle line:90%
So you can't do anything.

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:39.740 align:middle line:90%
So you can't transform yourself.

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:41.920 align:middle line:90%
And what can you do?

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:42.670 align:middle line:90%
What happens then?

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:44.420 align:middle line:84%
If you actually
realize you've come

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:47.100 align:middle line:84%
to a dead end--
and the human race

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:51.096 align:middle line:84%
has come to a dead end,
in my opinion-- what then?

00:23:51.096 --> 00:23:51.720 align:middle line:90%
Commit suicide?

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:55.700 align:middle line:90%


00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.290 align:middle line:90%
Or is there something else?

00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:00.760 align:middle line:90%
What happens when you just wait?

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.130 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing you can do.

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:03.710 align:middle line:90%
You watch.

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:07.130 align:middle line:90%


00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And all you see is what goes
on that is happening of itself.

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:13.642 align:middle line:90%
You are breathing.

00:24:13.642 --> 00:24:16.420 align:middle line:90%
The wind is blowing.

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:18.370 align:middle line:90%
The trees are waving.

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:19.690 align:middle line:90%
Your blood is circulating.

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:21.030 align:middle line:90%
Your nerves are tingling.

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:25.090 align:middle line:90%
It's all going on of itself.

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:26.680 align:middle line:90%
But do you know that's you?

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:30.370 align:middle line:84%
That's the real you, the
you that goes on of itself.

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:34.860 align:middle line:90%


00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:38.460 align:middle line:90%
It's not the symbol.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.970 align:middle line:90%
It's not the person.

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:44.410 align:middle line:84%
It's you that's happening,
as when you breathe.

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:46.030 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you can get
the feeling that I

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:48.400 align:middle line:84%
am breathing by
shoving your breath.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:52.590 align:middle line:84%
But your breath goes on day
in and day out without your

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:54.597 align:middle line:84%
doing anything about it
or even thinking of it,

00:24:54.597 --> 00:24:56.180 align:middle line:84%
the same way your
brain is functioning

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:58.990 align:middle line:90%
without your forcing it.

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:02.350 align:middle line:84%
So when you come to a dead
end-- and we are, individually

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:10.470 align:middle line:84%
and socially, now in
1971 at a dead end--

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:12.120 align:middle line:84%
this is the moment
of which it is

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.275 align:middle line:84%
said man's extremity
is God's opportunity.

00:25:14.275 --> 00:25:17.220 align:middle line:90%


00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:19.920 align:middle line:90%
Because we have to stop.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And when we stop,
we find a world

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:27.160 align:middle line:84%
that is happening rather than
being done, being shoved.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And that happening, as
distinct from doing,

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:32.720 align:middle line:90%
is our fundamental self.

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.695 align:middle line:84%
And our fundamental self is not
something just inside the skin.

00:25:35.695 --> 00:25:38.510 align:middle line:90%


00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:44.030 align:middle line:84%
It's everything around
us with which we connect.

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:48.590 align:middle line:84%
When you look out of your eyes
at nature happening out there,

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:52.010 align:middle line:90%
you're looking at you.

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:53.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
say what we should

00:25:53.830 --> 00:26:01.070 align:middle line:84%
do from then on but simply
that before we think

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:07.300 align:middle line:84%
of doing anything in
this critical situation,

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:11.400 align:middle line:84%
we realize the completely
illusory nature of the beings

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:16.910 align:middle line:84%
that we think we are and
get back again to the beings

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:26.770 align:middle line:84%
that we really are,
which includes all this,

00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:31.492 align:middle line:84%
outside world no
longer left outside.

00:26:31.492 --> 00:28:01.867 align:middle line:90%
