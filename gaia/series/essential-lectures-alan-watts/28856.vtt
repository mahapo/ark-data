00:00:11.385 --> 00:00:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>>The Electronic University
presents "Cosmic Drama"

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.385 align:middle line:90%
with Alan Watts.

00:00:16.385 --> 00:00:57.710 align:middle line:90%


00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, we're still on the
ferry boat, Vallejo, my home.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And as it happens to be
a rather nice afternoon,

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.779 align:middle line:84%
we decided to come out
onto the patio instead

00:01:05.779 --> 00:01:06.820 align:middle line:90%
of working in the studio.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.480 align:middle line:90%


00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.450 align:middle line:84%
I've been talking to
you about the mystery

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.435 align:middle line:84%
of the curious
sensation of nothingness

00:01:18.435 --> 00:01:21.770 align:middle line:90%
that lies behind ourselves.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.720 align:middle line:90%


00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.680 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I gave
you the illustration

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.210 align:middle line:84%
of the blank space
behind the eyes,

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.660 align:middle line:84%
about the silence out of
which all sound comes,

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.590 align:middle line:84%
and about empty space out of
which all the stars appear.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And you remember that
in the last talk,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.350 align:middle line:84%
I likened this curious
emptiness behind everything

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.790 align:middle line:84%
to God, an imageless,
non-idolatrous God of which we

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.090 align:middle line:90%
could have no conception at all.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And I've also pointed
out that basically,

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.170 align:middle line:84%
when you really get down to
it, that emptiness is yourself.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.210 align:middle line:90%


00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, it sounds very odd in
our civilization to say,

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.770 align:middle line:90%
therefor I am God.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.650 align:middle line:90%
Or for that matter, you are God.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.540 align:middle line:84%
But you will
remember, of course,

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:29.470 align:middle line:84%
that this exactly is
what Jesus Christ felt.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And he was crucified for
it because, in his culture,

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.650 align:middle line:84%
God was conceived as the
royal monarch of the universe.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, anybody who gets
up and says, "Well, I am God,"

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.930 align:middle line:90%
is blasphemous.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.670 align:middle line:90%
He's subversive.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.990 align:middle line:84%
He's claiming to be if
not the boss himself,

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.680 align:middle line:90%
at least the boss's son.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's a put-down
for everybody else.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.510 align:middle line:84%
But Jesus had to say it that
way because, in his culture,

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.730 align:middle line:84%
they did not have, as the Hindus
have, the idea that everybody--

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.730 align:middle line:84%
not only human beings,
but animals and plants,

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.520 align:middle line:84%
all sentient beings whatsoever--
are God in disguise.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.500 align:middle line:90%


00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, let me try to explain
this a little more clearly.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:29.720 align:middle line:84%
Because I cannot help thinking
of myself identical with,

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.520 align:middle line:84%
continuous with, one with the
whole energy that expresses

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.050 align:middle line:90%
itself as this universe.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.550 align:middle line:84%
If the universe
is made of stars,

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.450 align:middle line:84%
a star is a center from
which energy flows.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.700 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
there's the middle,

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.600 align:middle line:84%
and all the rays
come out from it.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.560 align:middle line:84%
And so, I feel that as the
image of the whole thing,

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.970 align:middle line:84%
that all energy is a center
from which rays come out.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, each one
of us is an expression

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.410 align:middle line:84%
of what is basically
the whole thing.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.640 align:middle line:84%
Now therefore,
whereas in the West

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.279 align:middle line:84%
in the Jewish, Christian,
and Islamic religions,

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:24.230 align:middle line:84%
we have thought of God
not only as a monarch,

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.450 align:middle line:90%
but as the maker of the world.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of that, we look
upon the world as an artifact,

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:38.260 align:middle line:84%
a sort of machine created
by a great engineer.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.100 align:middle line:84%
There's a different
conception in India,

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:47.010 align:middle line:84%
where the world is not seen as
an artifact, but as a drama.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, God is not
to maker and architect

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.230 align:middle line:84%
of the universe,
but the actor of it,

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.440 align:middle line:84%
and therefore is playing
all the parts at once.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And this connects
up with the idea

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:12.760 align:middle line:84%
of each one of us as persons,
because a person is a mask,

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.270 align:middle line:84%
from the Latin word
persona, the mask worn

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.850 align:middle line:84%
by the actors in
Greco-Roman drama.

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.950 align:middle line:84%
So this is an entirely different
conception of the world.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And as I think I shall
be able to show you,

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.270 align:middle line:84%
it makes an amazing
amount of sense.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:37.420 align:middle line:84%
So we start from the
premise that you-- and you

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.620 align:middle line:90%
don't know who you are.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.410 align:middle line:90%
You can't see yourself.

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And as I pointed
out, you don't know

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:46.090 align:middle line:84%
how you grow your body, how you
make your nervous system work,

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.870 align:middle line:84%
how you managed to emerge in
this environment of nature.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And so this unknown you,
the you that is not you,

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.390 align:middle line:84%
the you that is not
the ego, this is God.

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.780 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, not
the cosmic boss,

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.320 align:middle line:84%
but the fundamental ground of
being-- the reality that always

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.720 align:middle line:84%
was, is, and will be-- that
lies at the basis of reality--

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.920 align:middle line:90%
that's you.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:20.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's go into a more
mythological kind of imagery.

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.510 align:middle line:90%
Suppose you are God.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.070 align:middle line:84%
Suppose you have all
time, all eternity,

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.180 align:middle line:90%
and all power at your disposal.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.080 align:middle line:90%
What would you do?

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:36.220 align:middle line:90%


00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.750 align:middle line:84%
I believe you would say
to yourself after a while,

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.130 align:middle line:90%
man, get lost.

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.380 align:middle line:84%
It's like asking
another question, which

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.380 align:middle line:84%
is supposing you
were given the power

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.070 align:middle line:84%
to dream any dream you
wanted to dream every night.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.500 align:middle line:90%


00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.090 align:middle line:84%
Naturally, you could
dream any span of time.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.150 align:middle line:84%
You could dream 75 years of time
in one night, 100 years of time

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.600 align:middle line:84%
in one night, 1,000 years
of time in one night.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And it could be
anything you wanted.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.122 align:middle line:84%
You make up your mind
before you went to sleep.

00:07:13.122 --> 00:07:14.830 align:middle line:84%
Tonight, I'm going to
dream of so and so.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, naturally,
you would start out

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.430 align:middle line:90%
by fulfilling all your wishes.

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.620 align:middle line:84%
You would have all the
pleasures you could imagine,

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.490 align:middle line:84%
the most marvelous meals, the
most entrancing love affairs,

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.770 align:middle line:90%
the most romantic journeys.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:35.470 align:middle line:84%
You could listen to music
such as no mortal has heard

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:40.830 align:middle line:84%
and see landscapes beyond
our wildest dreams.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And for several
nights, oh, maybe

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.240 align:middle line:84%
for a whole month
of nights, you would

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.870 align:middle line:84%
go on that way having
a wonderful time.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:51.335 align:middle line:84%
But then a while, you'd
begin to think, well,

00:07:51.335 --> 00:07:54.280 align:middle line:90%
I have seen quite a bit.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.830 align:middle line:90%
Let's spice it up.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.710 align:middle line:90%


00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:01.410 align:middle line:90%
Let's have a little adventure.

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, you
would dream of yourself

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:07.140 align:middle line:84%
being threatened by
all sorts of dangers.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:11.180 align:middle line:84%
You would rescue
princesses from dragons.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:17.710 align:middle line:84%
You would perhaps engage
in notable battles.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:20.570 align:middle line:90%
You would be a hero.

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And then, as time
went on, you would

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.540 align:middle line:84%
dare yourself to do more
and more outrageous things.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And at some point
in the game, you

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:36.240 align:middle line:84%
would say tonight I am
going to dream in such a way

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:41.980 align:middle line:84%
that I don't know
that I'm dreaming,

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.990 align:middle line:84%
so that you would
take the experience

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.060 align:middle line:84%
of the dream for
complete reality.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:49.550 align:middle line:90%


00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And what a shock
when you woke up.

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:56.210 align:middle line:90%
And you really scare yourself.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And then on
successive nights, you

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.780 align:middle line:84%
might dare yourself
to experience the most

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.190 align:middle line:84%
extraordinary things just for
the contrast when you woke up.

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:06.660 align:middle line:84%
You could, for
example, dream yourself

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.280 align:middle line:84%
in situations of extreme
poverty, disease, agony.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:16.620 align:middle line:84%
You could, as it were, work
on the vibration of suffering

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.570 align:middle line:84%
to its most intense
point, and then suddenly

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:22.860 align:middle line:84%
wake up and find it was after
all nothing but a dream.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.610 align:middle line:90%
And everything's perfectly OK.

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:25.580 align:middle line:90%
And you would say, wow.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:26.830 align:middle line:90%
Man, that was a gas.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:30.220 align:middle line:90%


00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.027 align:middle line:84%
Well, how do you
know that that's not

00:09:32.027 --> 00:09:33.110 align:middle line:90%
what you're doing already?

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:36.260 align:middle line:90%


00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.840 align:middle line:84%
You sitting there with
all your problems,

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.110 align:middle line:84%
with all your whole
complicated life situation,

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:47.830 align:middle line:84%
listening to me, it may
just be the very dream

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:51.040 align:middle line:90%
you decided to get into.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.780 align:middle line:90%
If you like it, crazy.

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:58.671 align:middle line:84%
If you don't like it, what fun
it will be when you wake up.

00:09:58.671 --> 00:09:59.170 align:middle line:90%
Do you see?

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:02.520 align:middle line:90%
This is the essence of drama.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:06.930 align:middle line:84%
In drama, all the people
who come there know it's

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:08.810 align:middle line:90%
only a play.

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:12.390 align:middle line:84%
The proscenium arch,
the cinema screen

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:15.810 align:middle line:90%
tells us this is an illusion.

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:18.900 align:middle line:90%
It is not for real.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:22.530 align:middle line:84%
But the actors are
trying to give us

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:26.110 align:middle line:84%
the sensation that
it is for real.

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:30.810 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they are going
to act their part so convincing

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:32.450 align:middle line:84%
that they are going
to have us sitting

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:34.400 align:middle line:84%
on the edge of our
seats in anxiety.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.120 align:middle line:90%
They're going to make us laugh.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.980 align:middle line:90%
They're going to make us cry.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.890 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
make us feel horror.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.690 align:middle line:84%
Even though we know in
the back of our minds,

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:45.740 align:middle line:84%
even though we
have what in German

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:49.410 align:middle line:84%
is called a hintergedanke,
which is the thought way, way,

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:52.160 align:middle line:84%
way in the back of your mind
that you're hardly aware of,

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.640 align:middle line:84%
but you really
know all the time.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.820 align:middle line:84%
In the theatre, we have a
hintergedanke that it's only

00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:58.970 align:middle line:90%
a play.

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:01.740 align:middle line:84%
But the mastery of
the actor is that he

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:08.330 align:middle line:84%
is going to try almost to
convince us that it's real.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore,
imagine a situation

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:14.710 align:middle line:84%
where you have the best of all
possible actors, namely God,

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:17.800 align:middle line:84%
and the best of all possible
audiences ready to be taken in

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:22.090 align:middle line:84%
and convinced that
it's real, namely God.

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And that you are all
many, many masks,

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:31.760 align:middle line:84%
which the basic consciousness,
the basic mind of the universe

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.550 align:middle line:90%
is assuming.

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:38.930 align:middle line:84%
To use a verse from
G.K. Chesterton,

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:43.320 align:middle line:84%
"and now a great thing in the
street seems any human nod,

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:49.780 align:middle line:84%
where move in strange democracy
the million masks of God."

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:53.010 align:middle line:90%
And of course, here it is.

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:58.960 align:middle line:84%
This is the mask of Vishnu,
the preserver of the universe.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And you see it is
a multiple mask

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:11.060 align:middle line:84%
to illustrate the fact that the
one who looks out of my eyes

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:14.530 align:middle line:84%
and out of all your
eyes is the same center.

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:18.100 align:middle line:90%


00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:24.640 align:middle line:84%
So if I look at
another human being,

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:29.540 align:middle line:84%
and I look straight into their
eyes, isn't that curious?

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.820 align:middle line:90%
We don't like doing that.

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:35.710 align:middle line:84%
There's something embarrassing
about looking into our eyes

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:37.990 align:middle line:90%
too closely.

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:40.370 align:middle line:84%
As if, don't look
at me that closely,

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:43.330 align:middle line:84%
because I might
give myself away.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.950 align:middle line:84%
You might find out
who I really am.

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:48.095 align:middle line:84%
And what do you
suppose that would be?

00:12:48.095 --> 00:12:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Do you suppose that another
person who looks deeply

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:56.690 align:middle line:84%
into your eyes will read all the
things you're ashamed of, all

00:12:56.690 --> 00:13:01.780 align:middle line:84%
your faults, all the
things you're guilty about?

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:05.360 align:middle line:84%
Or is there some deeper
secret than that?

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:09.570 align:middle line:84%
The eyes are our
most sensitive organ.

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And when you look and look
and look into another person's

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:14.200 align:middle line:84%
eyes, you're first
of all, looking

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:19.010 align:middle line:84%
at the most beautiful
jewels in universe.

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And if you look
down beyond that,

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:27.670 align:middle line:84%
you see of course-- it's
the most beautiful jewel

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:32.720 align:middle line:84%
in the universe because that's
the universe looking at you.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.850 align:middle line:90%
We are the eyes of the cosmos.

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:41.120 align:middle line:84%
So that in a way, when you look
deeply into somebody's eyes,

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.270 align:middle line:84%
you're looking
deep into yourself.

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And the other person
is looking deeply

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:54.040 align:middle line:84%
into the same self, which
many-eyed, as this mask is

00:13:54.040 --> 00:14:00.060 align:middle line:84%
many-faced, is looking
out everywhere.

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:06.130 align:middle line:84%
One energy playing myriads
of different parts.

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:06.630 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:10.240 align:middle line:90%


00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.320 align:middle line:90%
It's perfectly obvious.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:21.540 align:middle line:84%
Because if you were God, and
you knew everything, and were

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:24.400 align:middle line:84%
in control of everything,
you would be bored to death.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.950 align:middle line:90%


00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:32.370 align:middle line:84%
As I said, it would be like
making love to a plastic woman.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:36.190 align:middle line:84%
Everything would be completely
predictable, completely known,

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:40.510 align:middle line:84%
completely clear, no mystery,
no surprise whatever.

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:42.340 align:middle line:90%
Look at it in still another way.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:50.300 align:middle line:84%
The object of our technology is
to control the world, to have,

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:55.670 align:middle line:84%
as it were, a super electronic
push-button universe where

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:59.250 align:middle line:84%
we can get anything we want,
fulfill any desire simply

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:01.195 align:middle line:90%
by pushing a button.

00:15:01.195 --> 00:15:02.820 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're
Aladdin with the lamp.

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:06.310 align:middle line:84%
You rub it, the djinn comes
and says, "Assalamu alaikum.

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:07.490 align:middle line:90%
I am your humble servant.

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.710 align:middle line:90%
What do you wish?

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:11.990 align:middle line:90%
Anything you want."

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And after a while
at that, just as you

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:17.350 align:middle line:84%
would in those
dreams I described,

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:19.660 align:middle line:84%
decide one day to forget
that you were dreaming,

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:23.820 align:middle line:84%
you would say to the
genie of the lamp,

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:26.850 align:middle line:90%
I would like a surprise.

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Or God in the court of heaven
might turn to his vizier

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.415 align:middle line:84%
and say, "Oh, Commander of
the Faithful, we are bored."

00:15:38.415 --> 00:15:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And the vizier of the court
would reply, "Oh, King,

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.490 align:middle line:90%
live forever.

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:44.240 align:middle line:84%
But surely, out of the
infinitude of your wisdom,

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:50.760 align:middle line:84%
you can discover some
way of not being bored."

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And the King would reply, "Oh,
vizier, give us a surprise."

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:59.650 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's the whole basis
of the story of The Arabian

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:00.630 align:middle line:90%
Nights.

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:06.240 align:middle line:84%
Here was a very powerful
sultan who was bored.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, he
challenged by Scheherazade

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:17.170 align:middle line:84%
to tell him a new
story every night,

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:20.880 align:middle line:84%
so that the telling of tales,
getting involved in adventures,

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:21.940 align:middle line:90%
would never, never end.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:25.930 align:middle line:90%


00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And it isn't that the reason
why we go to the theatre,

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:31.360 align:middle line:90%
why we go to the movies?

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Because we want to
get out of ourselves.

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:36.770 align:middle line:90%
We want a surprise.

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And a surprise means that
you have to other yourself.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:45.350 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, there has to
enter into your experience

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:49.420 align:middle line:84%
some element that is
not under your control.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:54.760 align:middle line:84%
So if our technology were
to succeed completely,

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:59.740 align:middle line:84%
and everything were to
be under our control,

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:04.550 align:middle line:84%
we should eventually say
we need a new button.

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:07.020 align:middle line:84%
In all these control
buttons, we always

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:10.400 align:middle line:84%
have to have a button
labeled surprise.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And just so that it doesn't
become too dangerous,

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.420 align:middle line:90%
we'll put a time limit on it.

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:21.150 align:middle line:84%
Surprise for 15 minutes,
for an hour, for a day,

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:24.024 align:middle line:90%
for a month, a year, a lifetime.

00:17:24.024 --> 00:17:27.069 align:middle line:90%


00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And then in the end, when the
surprise circuit is finished,

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:33.995 align:middle line:84%
we'll be back in control, and
we'll all know what we are.

00:17:33.995 --> 00:17:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And we'll heave
a sigh of relief.

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:37.990 align:middle line:90%


00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:42.500 align:middle line:84%
But after a while, we'll press
the button labeled surprise

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:45.620 align:middle line:90%
once more.

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:48.290 align:middle line:84%
So then, there's a
curious rhythm to this

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:50.320 align:middle line:84%
if you'll notice what
I've been explaining.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:58.606 align:middle line:84%
And this rhythm corresponds
to the Hindu idea

00:17:58.606 --> 00:18:02.940 align:middle line:84%
of the course of time and
the way evolution works.

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And their idea is
backwards from ours.

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:11.250 align:middle line:84%
First of all, Hindus
think of time as circular,

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:12.479 align:middle line:90%
as going round.

00:18:12.479 --> 00:18:13.270 align:middle line:90%
Look at your watch.

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:14.880 align:middle line:90%
After all, it goes round.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.310 align:middle line:84%
But Westerners tend
to think of time

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:21.280 align:middle line:84%
in a straight line,
one-way street.

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And we got that idea
from the Hebrew religion

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.050 align:middle line:84%
and from, in particular,
Saint Augustin.

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:31.940 align:middle line:84%
The idea that there is
a time of creation, then

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:34.270 align:middle line:84%
a course of history,
which leads up

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:37.770 align:middle line:84%
to a final eschatological
catastrophe,

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:39.010 align:middle line:90%
the end of the world.

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And after that, the
judgment in which

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:45.640 align:middle line:84%
all things will be put to
right, all questions answered,

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.700 align:middle line:84%
and justice dealt
out to everyone

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:50.640 align:middle line:90%
according to his merit.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.550 align:middle line:90%
And that'll be that.

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:55.010 align:middle line:84%
Thereafter, the universe
will be, in a way, static.

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:58.140 align:middle line:84%
There will be the eternally
saved and eternally damned.

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:00.650 align:middle line:90%


00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:03.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, many of us may
not believe that today,

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:07.200 align:middle line:84%
but that has been a dominating
belief throughout the course

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.840 align:middle line:84%
of Western history,
and it has had

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.750 align:middle line:84%
a tremendously powerful
influence on our culture.

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:13.940 align:middle line:84%
But the Hindus
think of the world

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:16.400 align:middle line:84%
as going round, and
round, and round

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.840 align:middle line:84%
for always and
always in a rhythm.

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And they calculate the rounds
in periods that in Sanskrit are

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:33.220 align:middle line:84%
called kalpas, K-A-L-P-A. And
each kalpa lasts for 4,320,000

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:35.890 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And so a kalpa is the
period or manvantara

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:47.300 align:middle line:84%
during which the world as
we know it is manifested.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And it is followed
by a period, also

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:55.790 align:middle line:84%
a kalpa long-- 4,320,000
years-- which is called pralaya.

00:19:55.790 --> 00:20:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And this means when the world
is not manifested anymore.

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And these are the days and
nights of Brahma, the Godhead.

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:11.280 align:middle line:84%
During the manvantara, when
the world is manifested,

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:15.350 align:middle line:84%
Brahma is asleep,
dreaming that he is all us

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:17.520 align:middle line:90%
and everything that's going on.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And during the pralaya,
which is his day,

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:25.950 align:middle line:84%
he's awake and knows
himself-- or itself,

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:27.620 align:middle line:84%
because it's beyond
sex or anything

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:35.550 align:middle line:84%
like that-- for who and
what he, she, it is.

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And then, once again,
press button surprise.

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:43.505 align:middle line:84%
And as in the course
of our dreaming,

00:20:43.505 --> 00:20:47.100 align:middle line:84%
we would very naturally dream
the most pleasant and rapturous

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:51.960 align:middle line:84%
dreams first, and then get
more adventurous and experience

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.900 align:middle line:84%
and explore the hot
dimensions of experience.

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:58.240 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way,
the Hindus think

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.110 align:middle line:84%
of a kalpa of the
manifested universe,

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:06.370 align:middle line:84%
of the manvantara, as
divided into four periods.

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And these four periods
are of different length.

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:11.720 align:middle line:90%
The first is the longest.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.320 align:middle line:90%
And the last, the shortest.

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And they are named in
accordance with the throws

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.830 align:middle line:90%
in the Hindu game of dice.

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:23.760 align:middle line:84%
There are four throws, the throw
of four, the throw of three,

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:26.620 align:middle line:84%
the throw of two,
the throw of one.

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:30.040 align:middle line:84%
The throw of four is always
the best throw, like the six

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.250 align:middle line:90%
in our game.

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And the throw of
one, the worst throw.

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:41.250 align:middle line:84%
Now therefore, the first
throw is called Krta.

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:46.198 align:middle line:84%
And the epoch, the
long, long period

00:21:46.198 --> 00:21:50.360 align:middle line:84%
for which this throw
lasts is called a yuga.

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:53.130 align:middle line:84%
So we'll translate
yuga, an epoch.

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And we'll translate
kalpa, an eon.

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:05.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, the word Krta means done,
as when we say, well done.

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And that is a period of
the world's existence

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:13.124 align:middle line:84%
that we call the golden age,
when everything is perfect,

00:22:13.124 --> 00:22:13.915 align:middle line:90%
done to perfection.

00:22:13.915 --> 00:22:16.850 align:middle line:90%


00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:19.930 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to an
end, we get Treta yuga.

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:22.980 align:middle line:90%
That means the throw of three.

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And in this period
of manifestation,

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:27.610 align:middle line:90%
something is a little off.

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:30.200 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there's an
element of the uncertain,

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:34.130 align:middle line:84%
an element of insecurity, an
element of adventure in things.

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:36.170 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you know,
a three-legged stool

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:38.640 align:middle line:84%
is not as secure as
a four-legged one.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.150 align:middle line:84%
You're a little bit more liable
to be thrown off balance.

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:44.216 align:middle line:90%


00:22:44.216 --> 00:22:46.350 align:middle line:84%
That lasts for a
very long time, too.

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:50.300 align:middle line:84%
But then we get next what
is called Dvapara yuga.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:54.840 align:middle line:90%
Dva, that means two.

00:22:54.840 --> 00:23:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And in this period,
the good and the bad,

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:04.920 align:middle line:84%
the pleasurable and the
painful are equally balanced.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:08.550 align:middle line:90%


00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:13.480 align:middle line:84%
But then finally in the
end, there comes Kali yuga.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:17.470 align:middle line:84%
And this means, Kali, the
worst throw, the throw of one.

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And this lasts for
the shortest time.

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And this is the period
of manifestation

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:32.650 align:middle line:84%
in which the unpleasurable,
painful, diabolical principle

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:36.830 align:middle line:90%
finally takes over.

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:41.760 align:middle line:84%
But notice that it has
the shortest innings.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.890 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if
you add up the periods

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:46.940 align:middle line:84%
of years which they assign
to all the different yugas,

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.910 align:middle line:84%
you will see that the
bad principle only

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:54.450 align:middle line:84%
has the stage for about
one third of the time.

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the
Kali yuga, the myth

00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:01.980 align:middle line:84%
goes on to say that the great
destroyer of the worlds, God

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:06.680 align:middle line:84%
manifested as the destructive
principle, Shiva, does

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.770 align:middle line:90%
a dance called the Tandava.

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And he appears blue-bodied with
10 arms with lightning and fire

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.690 align:middle line:84%
appearing from every
pore in his skin,

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:22.310 align:middle line:84%
and does a dance in which the
universe is finally destroyed.

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:26.710 align:middle line:84%
There is that moment of cosmic
death, which is nevertheless

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:29.670 align:middle line:84%
the waking up of
Brahma the creator.

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:33.990 align:middle line:84%
For as Shiva turns
round and walks off

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:40.480 align:middle line:84%
the stage, seen from behind,
he is Brahma, the creator,

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.340 align:middle line:90%
the beginning of it all again.

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And Vishnu, whose mask I've been
showing you, is the preserver.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:51.560 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, the going on
of it all, the whole state

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:56.130 align:middle line:84%
of the Godhead being
manifested as many, many faces.

00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:59.270 align:middle line:90%


00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:05.610 align:middle line:84%
So do you see that this is a
philosophy of the role of evil

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:13.356 align:middle line:84%
in life, which is in a
way rational and merciful?

00:25:13.356 --> 00:25:21.280 align:middle line:84%
You see, if we thought God
is playing with the world,

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:24.870 align:middle line:84%
he has created it
for his pleasure,

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:30.590 align:middle line:84%
and he has created all these
other beings than himself,

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:35.590 align:middle line:84%
and they go through the most
horrible torments-- you know,

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:40.550 align:middle line:84%
terminal cancer, children
being burned with napalm,

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:46.670 align:middle line:84%
concentration camps,
the Inquisition,

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:54.260 align:middle line:84%
the horrors that human beings go
through-- how is that possibly

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:56.680 align:middle line:84%
justifiable under
any system where

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.680 align:middle line:84%
we say, well, some
God created it?

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And if a god didn't create it,
and there's nobody in charge,

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:05.140 align:middle line:84%
and there's no rationality
to the whole thing,

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:09.320 align:middle line:84%
but it's just a tale told by
an idiot full of sound and fury

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:13.250 align:middle line:84%
signifying nothing, then you're
liable to say the only out

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:14.340 align:middle line:90%
is suicide.

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:16.930 align:middle line:90%
It's a ridiculous system.

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:19.060 align:middle line:90%
But suppose it isn't that.

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:22.350 align:middle line:84%
Suppose it's the kind of
thing I've described to you.

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:30.060 align:middle line:84%
Supposing that it isn't that
God has all these victims

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:34.850 align:middle line:84%
and is pleasing
himself, showing off

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:38.155 align:middle line:84%
his justice by either
rewarding them or punishing

00:26:38.155 --> 00:26:40.430 align:middle line:84%
them, supposing it's
quite different from that,

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:44.570 align:middle line:84%
supposing that God is the
one playing all the parts,

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:48.890 align:middle line:84%
that God is the child being
burned to death with napalm,

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:53.780 align:middle line:84%
there is no victim
except the victor.

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:56.130 align:middle line:84%
All the different roles
which are being experienced,

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:58.580 align:middle line:84%
all the different feelings
which are being felt,

00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:07.440 align:middle line:84%
are being felt by the one who
originally desires, decides,

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.735 align:middle line:84%
wills to go into
that very situation.

00:27:10.735 --> 00:27:14.200 align:middle line:90%


00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.120 align:middle line:84%
Curiously enough, there's
something parallel

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:17.780 align:middle line:90%
to this in Christianity.

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:21.070 align:middle line:90%
Very few people know about it.

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:23.540 align:middle line:84%
There's a passage in
Saint Paul's Epistle

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:29.880 align:middle line:84%
to the Philippians in which
he says a very curious thing.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.030 align:middle line:84%
He says, "let this
mind be in you,

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:40.030 align:middle line:84%
which was also in Christ Jesus
who, being in the form of God,

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:43.860 align:middle line:84%
did not think identity
with God a thing

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:49.410 align:middle line:84%
to be clung to, but humbled
himself and made himself

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:52.625 align:middle line:84%
of no reputation and was
found in fashion as a man

00:27:52.625 --> 00:27:54.910 align:middle line:84%
and became obedient
to death even

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:57.832 align:middle line:90%
to the death of the cross."

00:27:57.832 --> 00:28:01.190 align:middle line:84%
You see here, you have
exactly the same process,

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:06.540 align:middle line:84%
the idea of God becoming
human, suffering all

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:10.460 align:middle line:84%
that human beings can
suffer, even death.

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And Saint Paul is saying,
"let this mind be in you."

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:17.560 align:middle line:84%
That is to say let the
same kind of consciousness

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.970 align:middle line:84%
be in you that was
in Jesus Christ.

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:20.470 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:22.660 align:middle line:90%
Jesus Christ knew he was God.

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Wake up and find out
eventually who you really are.

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:30.610 align:middle line:84%
In our culture, of course,
they'll say you're crazy,

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:32.000 align:middle line:90%
or you're blasphemous.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And they'll either
put you in jail

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:36.120 align:middle line:84%
or in the nut house,
which is the same thing.

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.860 align:middle line:84%
But if you wake up in India,
and you tell your friends

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:43.330 align:middle line:84%
and relations, my goodness, I've
just discovered that I'm God,

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:47.810 align:middle line:84%
they'll laugh and say,
oh, congratulations.

00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:48.990 align:middle line:90%
At last, you've found out.

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:52.750 align:middle line:90%
