00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>>The art of meditation is
a way of getting into touch

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.870 align:middle line:90%
with reality.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for it is
that most civilized people

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.300 align:middle line:84%
are out of touch with
reality because they

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.970 align:middle line:84%
confuse the world as
it is with the world

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.790 align:middle line:84%
as they think about it and
talk about it and describe it.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.990 align:middle line:84%
For, on the one hand,
there is the real world

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.890 align:middle line:84%
and, on the other,
a whole system

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:31.470 align:middle line:84%
of symbols about that world,
which we have in our minds.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.070 align:middle line:84%
These are very,
very useful symbols.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.870 align:middle line:84%
All civilization
depends on them.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.020 align:middle line:84%
But like all good things,
they have their disadvantages.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.310 align:middle line:84%
And the principal
disadvantage of symbols

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.520 align:middle line:84%
is that we confuse
them with reality,

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.670 align:middle line:84%
just as we confuse
money with actual wealth

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.070 align:middle line:84%
and our names, about ourselves,
our ideas of ourselves,

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.960 align:middle line:84%
our images of ourselves
with ourselves.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.880 align:middle line:90%


00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, reality, from
a philosopher's point of view,

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.470 align:middle line:90%
is a dangerous word.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.340 align:middle line:84%
A philosopher will ask me,
what do I mean by reality?

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.590 align:middle line:84%
Am I talking about the
physical world of nature?

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.890 align:middle line:84%
Or am I talking about a
spiritual world or what?

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And to that, I have
a very simple answer.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.690 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about
the material world,

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.410 align:middle line:84%
that is actually a
philosophical concept.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.580 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way if I say
that reality is spiritual,

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.490 align:middle line:84%
that's also a
philosophical concept.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And reality itself
is not a concept.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.380 align:middle line:90%
Reality is [GONG].

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.990 align:middle line:90%


00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.250 align:middle line:90%
And we won't give it a name.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.430 align:middle line:90%


00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's amazing what doesn't
exist in the real world.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:12.660 align:middle line:84%
For example, in the real
world, there aren't any things

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.360 align:middle line:90%
nor are there any events.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.880 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean to say
that the real world is

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.870 align:middle line:90%
a perfectly featureless blank.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:29.600 align:middle line:84%
It means that it is a marvelous
system of wiggles in which we

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.600 align:middle line:84%
descry things and
events in the same way

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.840 align:middle line:84%
as we would project
images on a Rorschach blot

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.390 align:middle line:84%
or pick out particular
groups of stars in the sky

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.910 align:middle line:84%
and call them
constellations as if they

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.910 align:middle line:90%
were separate groups of stars.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're groups of
stars in the mind's eye,

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.130 align:middle line:90%
in our system of concepts.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.800 align:middle line:84%
They are not out there
as constellations

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.755 align:middle line:90%
already grouped in the sky.

00:03:59.755 --> 00:04:02.460 align:middle line:90%


00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.700 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way the
difference between myself

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.500 align:middle line:84%
and all the rest of the universe
is nothing more than an idea.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.080 align:middle line:90%
It is not a real difference.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.339 align:middle line:84%
And meditation is
the way in which

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:22.700 align:middle line:84%
we come to feel our
basic inseparability

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.470 align:middle line:90%
from the whole universe.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:32.786 align:middle line:84%
And what that requires
is that we shut up.

00:04:32.786 --> 00:04:38.100 align:middle line:84%
That is to say that we
become interiorly silent

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.780 align:middle line:84%
and cease from the
interminable chatter that

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.200 align:middle line:90%
goes on inside our skulls.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.620 align:middle line:84%
Because, you see, most
of us think compulsively

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.855 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:04:49.855 --> 00:04:52.880 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, we
talk to ourselves.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when I was a
boy, we had a common saying,

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.430 align:middle line:84%
talking to yourself is
the first sign of madness.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:07.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, obviously, if
I talk all the time,

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.715 align:middle line:84%
I don't hear what
anyone else has to say.

00:05:09.715 --> 00:05:12.700 align:middle line:90%


00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And so in exactly the same way,
if I think all the time, that

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.360 align:middle line:84%
is to say, if I talk
to myself all the time,

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't have anything to
think about except thoughts.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, I'm
living entirely

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.730 align:middle line:84%
in the world of
symbols and am never

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.000 align:middle line:90%
in relationship with reality.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.570 align:middle line:84%
All right, now, that's the first
basic reason for meditation.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.240 align:middle line:84%
But there is another
sense-- and this

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.950 align:middle line:84%
is going to be a little bit
more difficult to understand--

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:47.460 align:middle line:84%
why we could say that meditation
doesn't have a reason.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.370 align:middle line:90%
Or it doesn't have a purpose.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And in this respect, it's
unlike almost all other things

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:58.530 align:middle line:84%
that we do except perhaps
making music and dancing.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Because when we make
music, we don't do it

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.360 align:middle line:84%
in order to reach
a certain point,

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.700 align:middle line:84%
such as the end of
the composition.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.810 align:middle line:84%
If that were the
purpose of music,

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.140 align:middle line:84%
to get to the end of the
piece, then, obviously,

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.900 align:middle line:84%
the fastest players
would be the best.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And so likewise,
when we're dancing,

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.370 align:middle line:84%
we are not aiming to arrive at
a particular place on the floor

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.840 align:middle line:84%
as we would be if we
were taking a journey.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:34.520 align:middle line:84%
When we dance, the journey
itself is the point.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.880 align:middle line:84%
When we play music, the
playing itself is the point.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And exactly the same thing
is true in meditation.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:49.020 align:middle line:84%
Meditation is the discovery
that the point of life

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:54.530 align:middle line:84%
is always arrived at in
the immediate moment.

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, if you meditate
for an ulterior motive, that

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:04.320 align:middle line:84%
is to say to improve your mind,
to improve your character,

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.420 align:middle line:84%
to be more efficient
in life, you've

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:11.330 align:middle line:84%
got your eye on the future,
and you are not meditating.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:16.880 align:middle line:90%
Because the future is a concept.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.250 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't exist.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:23.070 align:middle line:84%
As the proverb says,
tomorrow never comes.

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:24.900 align:middle line:84%
There is no such
thing as tomorrow.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.800 align:middle line:90%
There never will be.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.900 align:middle line:90%
Because time is always now.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
things we discover

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.990 align:middle line:84%
when we stop talking to
ourselves and stop thinking.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:42.830 align:middle line:84%
We find there is only a
present, only an eternal now.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:47.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's funny, then, isn't
it, that one meditates

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.190 align:middle line:84%
for no reason at
all except we could

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:51.790 align:middle line:90%
say for the enjoyment of it.

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And here I would interpose
the essential principle

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:01.530 align:middle line:84%
that meditation is
supposed to be fun.

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:06.010 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
you do as a grim duty.

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:07.740 align:middle line:84%
The trouble with
religion as we know

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:13.140 align:middle line:84%
it is that it is so mixed
up with grim duties.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.060 align:middle line:84%
We do it because
it's good for you.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:18.060 align:middle line:90%
It's a kind of self punishment.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, meditation,
when correctly done,

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.820 align:middle line:90%
has nothing to do with all that.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.420 align:middle line:84%
It's a kind of
digging the present.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:29.660 align:middle line:84%
It's a kind of grooving
with the eternal now

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:35.789 align:middle line:84%
and brings us into
a state of peace

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:40.590 align:middle line:84%
where we can understand
that the point of life,

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:45.110 align:middle line:84%
the place where it's at,
is simply here and now.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:48.490 align:middle line:90%


00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Well now, in the
art of meditation

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:55.060 align:middle line:84%
there are various
props, supports.

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.450 align:middle line:84%
One thing that
we're going to use

00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:02.340 align:middle line:84%
as a means of stilling chatter
in the mind is pure sound.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And for that reason, it's
useful to have a gong.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:10.020 align:middle line:90%


00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:13.360 align:middle line:84%
This is a Japanese Buddhist
gong made of bronze

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.620 align:middle line:90%
and shaped like a bowl.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.410 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have
one of these, you

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:21.780 align:middle line:84%
can get the rounded
end of an oxygen tank.

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Have a machinist
saw it off roughly

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.630 align:middle line:90%
into the shape of a bowl.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.840 align:middle line:90%
And use that.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Or you can use your
own voice, chanting.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.770 align:middle line:90%


00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:39.270 align:middle line:84%
Another prop in meditation
is the use of incense.

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And that is because the sense
of smell is our repressed sense.

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And because it's
our repressed sense,

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.850 align:middle line:84%
it has a very powerful
influence on us.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we
associate certain smells

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:55.170 align:middle line:90%
with certain states of mind.

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And so the smell of
incense is associated

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.900 align:middle line:90%
with peace and contemplation.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And so it's advantageous to
burn incense in meditation.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:10.170 align:middle line:84%
The other prop is
a string of beads.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And these beads are
used in meditation

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.600 align:middle line:84%
for an unconscious method
of timing yourself.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.100 align:middle line:84%
Instead of looking
at a watch, you

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:23.200 align:middle line:84%
move a bead each time
you breathe in and out

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.990 align:middle line:84%
so that, at a
certain rate, you see

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:27.770 align:middle line:84%
there are always 108
beads on a rosary.

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And when you get to
slow breathing, halfway

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:33.360 align:middle line:84%
around the rosary
is about 40 minutes.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
usual length of time

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:39.650 align:middle line:84%
for which one sits
in meditation.

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:41.940 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise,
you get uncomfortable.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And you get stiff legs
and problems of that kind.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.920 align:middle line:90%


00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.660 align:middle line:84%
Now then, the other thing, first
of all, that we have to go into

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.290 align:middle line:84%
is, how does one
sit in meditation?

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.680 align:middle line:90%
You can sit any way you want.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:57.740 align:middle line:90%
You can sit in a chair.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.660 align:middle line:84%
Or you can sit like
I'm sitting, which

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.010 align:middle line:90%
is the Japanese way of sitting.

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Or you can sit in the
lotus posture, which

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.420 align:middle line:84%
is more difficult,
which is cross-legged

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:15.320 align:middle line:84%
with the feet on the
thighs, soles upwards.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And the younger you start that
in life, the easier you'll

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.600 align:middle line:90%
find it to do.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.350 align:middle line:84%
Or you can just sit
cross-legged on a raised

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.150 align:middle line:90%
cushion above the floor.

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:30.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, the point of this is that,
if you keep your back erect,

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:34.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean stiff like
this nor slumped like this,

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:41.600 align:middle line:84%
but just easily erect, you are
centered and easily balanced.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And you have a feeling of
being thoroughly rooted

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:48.900 align:middle line:90%
to the ground.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And that sort of
physical stability

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:58.210 align:middle line:84%
is very important for the
avoidance of distraction

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:03.800 align:middle line:84%
and generally feeling
settled here and now.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.740 align:middle line:84%
Je suis juste, as
the French say.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:07.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm here.

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:08.410 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to stay.

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:11.050 align:middle line:90%


00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:21.330 align:middle line:84%
Well now, the easiest way to
get into the meditative state

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.510 align:middle line:90%
is to begin by listening.

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:27.330 align:middle line:90%


00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:34.550 align:middle line:84%
If you simply close your
eyes and allow yourself

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:40.930 align:middle line:84%
to hear all the sounds that
are going on around you,

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:46.710 align:middle line:84%
just listen to the general
hum and buzz of the world

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:48.380 align:middle line:84%
as if you were
listening to music.

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:51.080 align:middle line:90%


00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Don't try to identify the
sounds you're hearing.

00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:00.220 align:middle line:90%
Don't put names on them.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:04.030 align:middle line:84%
Simply allow them to
play with your eardrums.

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:09.020 align:middle line:90%


00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:14.020 align:middle line:90%
And let them go.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.470 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
you could put it,

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:18.770 align:middle line:84%
let your ears hear
whatever they want to hear.

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:21.620 align:middle line:90%


00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:24.970 align:middle line:90%
Don't judge the sounds.

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:28.780 align:middle line:84%
There are no, as it were, proper
sounds or improper sounds.

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter if
somebody coughs or sneezes

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:35.160 align:middle line:90%
or drops something.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.915 align:middle line:90%
It's all just sound.

00:13:36.915 --> 00:13:41.150 align:middle line:90%


00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And if I am talking to you
right now and you're doing this,

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:49.170 align:middle line:84%
I want you to listen to
the sound of my voice

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:51.490 align:middle line:90%
just as if it were noise.

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:54.960 align:middle line:84%
Don't try to make any sense
out of what I'm saying.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Because your brain will take
care of that automatically.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:01.100 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to try
to understand anything.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.256 align:middle line:90%
Just listen to the sound.

00:14:02.256 --> 00:14:06.710 align:middle line:90%


00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:10.350 align:middle line:84%
As you pursue that experiment,
you will very naturally

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:17.990 align:middle line:84%
find that you can't help naming
sounds, identifying them,

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:20.550 align:middle line:84%
that you will go
on thinking, that

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:23.480 align:middle line:84%
is to say talking to
yourself inside your head,

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.160 align:middle line:90%
automatically.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.300 align:middle line:84%
But it's important
that you don't

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:34.320 align:middle line:84%
try to repress those thoughts by
forcing them out of your mind.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.980 align:middle line:84%
Because that will have precisely
the same effect as if you

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:41.876 align:middle line:84%
were trying to smooth rough
water with a flat iron.

00:14:41.876 --> 00:14:44.220 align:middle line:84%
You're just going to
disturb it all the more.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.760 align:middle line:90%
What you do is this.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:51.690 align:middle line:84%
As you hear sounds coming
up in your head, thoughts,

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:56.310 align:middle line:84%
you simply listen to them as
part of the general noise going

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:58.270 align:middle line:84%
on, just as you
would be listening

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:01.930 align:middle line:84%
to the sound of my voice or
just as you would be listening

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:07.290 align:middle line:84%
to cars going by or to birds
chattering outside the window.

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:13.260 align:middle line:84%
So look at your own
thoughts as just noises.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And soon you will find that
the so-called outside world

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:22.510 align:middle line:84%
and the so-called inside
world come together.

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:25.420 align:middle line:90%
They are a happening.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:28.730 align:middle line:84%
Your thoughts are
a happening, just

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:31.190 align:middle line:84%
like the sounds
going on outside.

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And everything is
simply a happening.

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:35.915 align:middle line:84%
And all you're doing
is watching it.

00:15:35.915 --> 00:15:40.300 align:middle line:90%


00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, in this process,
another thing

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:45.820 align:middle line:84%
that is happening
that is very important

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.880 align:middle line:90%
is that you're breathing.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And as you start meditation,
you allow your breath

00:15:54.690 --> 00:16:00.960 align:middle line:90%
to run just as it wills.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:05.880 align:middle line:84%
In other words, don't do, at
first, any breathing exercise.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:08.420 align:middle line:84%
But just watch your
breath breathing

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:09.675 align:middle line:90%
the way it wants to breathe.

00:16:09.675 --> 00:16:14.350 align:middle line:90%


00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And then notice a
curious thing about this.

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:20.540 align:middle line:90%


00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:24.860 align:middle line:84%
You say, in the
ordinary way, I breathe.

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:27.510 align:middle line:84%
Because you feel that
breathing is something

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:32.070 align:middle line:84%
that you are doing voluntarily,
just in the same way as you

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:36.300 align:middle line:90%
might be walking or talking.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:39.080 align:middle line:84%
But you will also notice
that when you are not

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.290 align:middle line:84%
thinking about breathing,
you're breathing

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:42.810 align:middle line:90%
goes on just the same.

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:45.360 align:middle line:90%


00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.380 align:middle line:84%
So the curious
thing about breath

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:51.690 align:middle line:84%
is that it can be looked
at both as a voluntary

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:54.410 align:middle line:90%
and an involuntary action.

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:57.670 align:middle line:84%
You can feel, on the
one hand, I am doing it.

00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And on the other hand,
it is happening to me.

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:05.069 align:middle line:84%
And that is why breathing
is a most important part

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:06.599 align:middle line:90%
of meditation.

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:10.030 align:middle line:84%
Because it is going to
show you, as you become

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:14.400 align:middle line:84%
aware of your breath, that
the hard and fast division

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:18.650 align:middle line:84%
that we make between what
we do on the one hand

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:22.454 align:middle line:84%
and what happens to us on
the other is arbitrary.

00:17:22.454 --> 00:17:25.200 align:middle line:90%


00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.800 align:middle line:84%
So that as you watch
your breathing,

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:33.690 align:middle line:84%
you will become aware
that both the voluntary

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:37.910 align:middle line:84%
and the involuntary
aspects of your experience

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:41.640 align:middle line:90%
are all one happening.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, that may, at first,
seem a little scary.

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Because you may think,
well, am I just the puppet

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:51.340 align:middle line:84%
of a happening, the mere
passive witness of something

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:55.210 align:middle line:84%
that's going on completely
beyond my control?

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:59.500 align:middle line:84%
Or, on the other hand,
am I really doing

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.400 align:middle line:90%
everything that's going along?

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I were,
I should be God.

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:05.739 align:middle line:84%
And that would be
very embarrassing.

00:18:05.739 --> 00:18:07.530 align:middle line:84%
Because I would be in
charge of everything,

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:09.363 align:middle line:84%
that would be terribly
responsible position.

00:18:09.363 --> 00:18:11.790 align:middle line:90%


00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:14.300 align:middle line:84%
The truth of the matter,
as you will see it,

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:19.270 align:middle line:90%
is that both things are true.

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:23.430 align:middle line:84%
You can see it that everything
is happening to you.

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And on the other hand,
you're doing everything.

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:30.110 align:middle line:84%
For example, it's your eyes that
are turning the sun into light.

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:32.550 align:middle line:84%
It's the nerve ends
in your skin that

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:36.660 align:middle line:84%
are turning electric
vibrations in the air

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:39.460 align:middle line:90%
into heat and temperature.

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:43.500 align:middle line:84%
It's your eardrums that are
turning vibrations in the air

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:44.100 align:middle line:90%
into sound.

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.515 align:middle line:84%
And in that way, you
are creating the world.

00:18:46.515 --> 00:18:49.480 align:middle line:90%


00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:53.610 align:middle line:84%
But when we're not
talking about it,

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:57.020 align:middle line:84%
when we're not
philosophizing about it,

00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:04.090 align:middle line:84%
then there is just this
happening, this [GONG].

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:05.530 align:middle line:90%
And we won't give it a name.

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:08.680 align:middle line:90%


00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Now then, when you breathe for
a while, just letting it happen.

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:20.080 align:middle line:90%


00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm not forcing it in any way.

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:25.990 align:middle line:84%
You will discover
a curious thing.

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:29.110 align:middle line:84%
That without making
any effort, you

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:30.735 align:middle line:84%
can breathe more
and more deeply.

00:19:30.735 --> 00:19:33.610 align:middle line:90%


00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:37.790 align:middle line:84%
In other words, supposing
you simply are breathing out,

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:39.920 align:middle line:84%
and breathing out is
important because it's

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:44.750 align:middle line:84%
the breath of relaxation,
as when we say, [PHEW]

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:47.970 align:middle line:90%
and heave a sigh of relief.

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:53.160 align:middle line:84%
So when you are breathing
out, you get the sensation

00:19:53.160 --> 00:20:00.450 align:middle line:84%
that your breath is falling
out, dropping, dropping,

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:03.960 align:middle line:84%
dropping out with the same
sort of feeling you have

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.840 align:middle line:84%
as if you were settling
down into an extremely

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.070 align:middle line:90%
comfortable bed.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And you just get as heavy as
possible and let yourself go.

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And you let your breath
go out in just that way.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And when it's thoroughly
comfortably out,

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:22.970 align:middle line:84%
and it feels like
coming back again,

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:25.290 align:middle line:90%
you don't pull it back in.

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:31.120 align:middle line:84%
You let it fall back in, letting
your lungs expand, expand,

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:36.450 align:middle line:84%
expand until they feel
very comfortably full.

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And you wait a moment
and let it stay there.

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And then, once again,
you let it fall out.

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And so in this way
you will discover

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:51.790 align:middle line:84%
that your breath gets quite
naturally easier and easier

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:55.475 align:middle line:84%
and slower and slower and
more and more powerful.

00:20:55.475 --> 00:20:59.160 align:middle line:90%


00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:07.980 align:middle line:84%
So that with these various
aids, listening to sound,

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:11.740 align:middle line:84%
listening to your own
interior feelings and thoughts

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:14.220 align:middle line:84%
just as if they were
something going on,

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:17.310 align:middle line:84%
not something you're
doing but just happenings,

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:19.500 align:middle line:84%
and watching your breath
as a happening that

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.960 align:middle line:84%
is neither voluntary
nor involuntary,

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.930 align:middle line:84%
you are simply aware of
these basic sensations.

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:30.890 align:middle line:84%
Then, you begin to be in
the state of meditation.

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:33.560 align:middle line:90%
But don't hurry anything.

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.590 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about the future.

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:38.530 align:middle line:84%
Don't worry about what
progress you're making.

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:45.220 align:middle line:84%
Just be entirely content
to be aware of what is.

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:47.400 align:middle line:84%
Don't be terribly
selective, particular.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:49.840 align:middle line:84%
Say, I should think of
this and not of that.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.350 align:middle line:84%
Just watch whatever
is happening.

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:55.350 align:middle line:90%


00:21:55.350 --> 00:22:05.020 align:middle line:84%
Now then, to make this somewhat
easier to have the mind free

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:12.760 align:middle line:84%
from discursive verbal
thinking, sound or chanted sound

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.660 align:middle line:90%
is extremely useful.

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:27.580 align:middle line:84%
If you, for example, simply
listen to the gong [GONG]

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:30.920 align:middle line:84%
and let that sound be the
whole of your experience,

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:31.810 align:middle line:90%
it's quite simple.

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:32.970 align:middle line:90%
It requires no effort.

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:37.770 align:middle line:90%


00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:43.890 align:middle line:90%
[GONG]

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And then along with
that, especially

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:48.830 align:middle line:84%
if you don't have
a gong, we can use,

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:53.280 align:middle line:84%
what are called in the
Sanskrit language, mantra.

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:57.330 align:middle line:84%
Mantra are chanted sounds
which are used not so

00:22:57.330 --> 00:23:02.860 align:middle line:84%
much for their meaning
as for the simple tone.

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And they go along with that
easy kind of slow breath.

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:13.820 align:middle line:84%
One of the basic mantras is,
of course, the sound, aum.

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:19.950 align:middle line:84%
That sound is used because
if you spell it out, A-U-M,

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:23.590 align:middle line:84%
it runs from the back of
your throat to your lips.

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it contains
the whole range of the voice.

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And for that reason, it
represents the total energy

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.440 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.670 align:middle line:84%
This word is called
the pranava, the name

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:40.090 align:middle line:84%
for the ultimate
reality for the which--

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:44.060 align:middle line:90%
than which there is no whicher.

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:49.951 align:middle line:84%
And so in this way, then,
[GONG] if you'll chant it,

00:23:49.951 --> 00:23:50.576 align:middle line:90%
[CHANTING AUM].

00:23:50.576 --> 00:24:13.190 align:middle line:90%


00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's varied, like this
[GONG] [CHANTING "AUM"].

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:37.054 align:middle line:90%


00:24:37.054 --> 00:24:39.496 align:middle line:90%
[GONG]

00:24:39.496 --> 00:24:54.748 align:middle line:90%
[CHANTING, "AUM"]

00:24:54.748 --> 00:25:03.150 align:middle line:90%


00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And you can keep that up
for quite a long time.

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, you will
find, as you go on chanting,

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:21.500 align:middle line:84%
that the words of the chant will
simply have become pure sound.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And you won't be
thinking about it.

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:26.920 align:middle line:84%
You won't have any images
about the sound going on

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:28.070 align:middle line:90%
in your mind.

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:32.660 align:middle line:84%
You will simply become
completely absorbed in sound.

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, you will find
yourself living in an eternal

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:40.750 align:middle line:90%
now in which there is no past.

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:42.890 align:middle line:90%
And there is no future.

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And there is no thing
called difference

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:53.040 align:middle line:84%
between what you are as knower
and what you are as the known,

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:56.760 align:middle line:84%
between yourself and the
world of nature outside you.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:02.390 align:middle line:84%
It all becomes one
doing, one happening.

00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:05.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, in addition to
those slow-moving chants,

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:08.940 align:middle line:84%
you may find it, according
to your temperament,

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:12.250 align:middle line:90%
easier to do a fast moving one.

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:16.480 align:middle line:84%
These have a sort
of rhythm to them

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:23.360 align:middle line:84%
that is absorbing, say
a chant that many of you

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.427 align:middle line:90%
have heard that goes,

00:26:25.427 --> 00:26:26.510 align:middle line:90%
[CHANTING "HARE KRISHNA"].

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't
matter what it means.

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:10.930 align:middle line:84%
Actually, Krishna and Rama are
the names of Hindu divinities.

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:12.950 align:middle line:90%
But that's not the point.

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:15.190 align:middle line:84%
The point is just to
get with that thing that

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:17.340 align:middle line:90%
is running, running, running.

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:23.680 align:middle line:90%
[SINGING "HARE KRISHNA"]

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:24.430 align:middle line:90%
And so on.

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And if you're a Christian or a
Jew and you feel more inclined

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:33.240 align:middle line:84%
to use a meditation word that
it is more congenial to you,

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.425 align:middle line:84%
you can use say,
[CHANTING, HALLELUJAH].

00:27:35.425 --> 00:27:58.390 align:middle line:90%


00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:05.280 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're a Mohammedan, you
can use Allah, the name of God.

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:08.473 align:middle line:84%
They have a way of doing it, you
know, which gets very exciting.

00:28:08.473 --> 00:28:09.540 align:middle line:90%
Goes, [CHANTING, ALLAH].

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:29.610 align:middle line:90%


00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:30.900 align:middle line:90%
And it gets faster and faster.

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:34.050 align:middle line:84%
You could keep that
up for 40 minutes.

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:37.140 align:middle line:90%
And you'll be out of your mind.

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:43.790 align:middle line:84%
But, you see, to go out of
your mind, at least once a day,

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:45.220 align:middle line:90%
is tremendously important.

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Because by going out of your
mind, you come to your senses.

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And if you stay in
your mind all the time,

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:54.910 align:middle line:90%
you are over rational.

00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:57.690 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you're
like a very rigid bridge

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:00.449 align:middle line:84%
which, because it has got
no give, no craziness in it,

is going to be blown down
in the first hurricane.
