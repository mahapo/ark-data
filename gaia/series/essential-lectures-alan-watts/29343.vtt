00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:49.890 align:middle line:90%


00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.080 align:middle line:90%
>>Everybody loves a box.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.180 align:middle line:84%
Especially an
exciting-looking box.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.510 align:middle line:84%
Something absolutely fascinating
about what is in the box.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is a box--
mm-- full of goodies.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.350 align:middle line:90%


00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.475 align:middle line:84%
Because it contains some of
the most priceless oriental

00:01:10.475 --> 00:01:10.975 align:middle line:90%
incenses.

00:01:10.975 --> 00:01:15.010 align:middle line:90%


00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.370 align:middle line:84%
It's like when the
wise men brought

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.250 align:middle line:84%
the baby Jesus gold,
frankincense and myrrh.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.430 align:middle line:84%
These treasures,
including a pair

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.800 align:middle line:84%
of scissors for dealing
with these things.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.850 align:middle line:84%
I think they're actually
17th century English

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.050 align:middle line:90%
candle-snuffers.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.750 align:middle line:84%
But they handle
incense very well.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And then there's very exotic
incense from Nepal in here,

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.350 align:middle line:84%
of which we'll see
something more about later.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.180 align:middle line:90%


00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, it seems sort
of ridiculous to talk

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.420 align:middle line:90%
about incense on TV.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.670 align:middle line:84%
In England, you know,
they call TV the telly.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to try
and make it the smelly.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.870 align:middle line:84%
Although that's electronically
impossible and probably

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.226 align:middle line:90%
will be possible someday.

00:02:02.226 --> 00:02:03.850 align:middle line:84%
There's a curious
reason why we haven't

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.770 align:middle line:90%
investigated that kind of thing.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.690 align:middle line:84%
Because I wonder if you
realize that the sense of smell

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.800 align:middle line:90%
is our repressed sense.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.480 align:middle line:84%
The one that we aren't
really very proud of.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.740 align:middle line:84%
For example, if I ask you, do
you smell-- it seems somehow

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.035 align:middle line:90%
a little bit of a rude question.

00:02:28.035 --> 00:02:29.410 align:middle line:84%
There's a famous
story, you know,

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.790 align:middle line:84%
about that great
British literatus,

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.610 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Johnson, who got onto
a stagecoach one day--

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.590 align:middle line:84%
and this was in the 18th
century, when people didn't

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.460 align:middle line:90%
bathe as much as they do today.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And shortly after a lady
got onto the stagecoach

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.280 align:middle line:84%
and sat opposite him and said
to him, "Sir, you smell."

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.950 align:middle line:84%
He said, "On the contrary,
madam, you smell!

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.410 align:middle line:90%
I stink."

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And so you see how, in this
way, even in those times,

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.100 align:middle line:90%
the word "smell" had a bad odor.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's curious
also there are only

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.600 align:middle line:84%
four adjectives in the
English language that

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.330 align:middle line:84%
apply specifically to
the sense of smell.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:27.140 align:middle line:84%
We have acrid, pungent,
fragrant, and putrid.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.310 align:middle line:84%
We have ever so many
adjectives from taste,

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.690 align:middle line:84%
which we apply to
smell-- from plants,

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.180 align:middle line:84%
when we say something is musky--
or something of that kind.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.590 align:middle line:84%
But we really aren't
very conscious

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.520 align:middle line:90%
of the sense of smell.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.025 align:middle line:84%
And yet, although we're
not conscious of it,

00:03:46.025 --> 00:03:49.980 align:middle line:84%
it exercises an enormous
influence upon us,

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.260 align:middle line:84%
just because we're
not conscious of it.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.790 align:middle line:84%
I believe that instant
likes and dislikes

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.430 align:middle line:84%
that we have for other people
that are sometimes completely

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.450 align:middle line:84%
irrational are based on an
unconscious apprehension

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.174 align:middle line:84%
of whether we do or
don't like their smell.

00:04:08.174 --> 00:04:13.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, too, how smells are
so powerful in evoking memories.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.079 align:middle line:84%
Something you
smelled as a child.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.290 align:middle line:84%
Say, the smell of fresh
coffee being cooked early

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:26.160 align:middle line:84%
in the morning, or
bacon frying, or leaves

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.780 align:middle line:84%
being burned on an autumn
day-- all these things

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.560 align:middle line:84%
evoke very vivid
emotions and feelings

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.540 align:middle line:90%
of our childhood in the past.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.540 align:middle line:90%


00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.190 align:middle line:84%
But you know, when people
talk about very deep things,

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.350 align:middle line:84%
they never talk about
the sense of smell.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.740 align:middle line:84%
They talk about touch,
vision, and even taste.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:52.850 align:middle line:90%
And hearing.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:58.490 align:middle line:84%
For example, we hear
about the vision of God.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.350 align:middle line:84%
In the Catholic
church it is said

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.096 align:middle line:84%
that the highest thing
to which man can attain--

00:05:04.096 --> 00:05:06.420 align:middle line:84%
or to which the
angels can attain--

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.500 align:middle line:90%
is the beatific vision.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.340 align:middle line:90%
To see God.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And the prophets would
hear the word of the lord.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And in one of the
psalms it says,

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.150 align:middle line:84%
"Oh, taste and see how
excellent the lord is."

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.470 align:middle line:90%
Taste and see.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:30.410 align:middle line:84%
But no one ever had the
idea of smelling God,

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:35.590 align:middle line:84%
of having not just the beatific
vision but the beatific smell.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.530 align:middle line:90%
This has never been brought out.

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And yet, curiously enough,
throughout the whole history

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.580 align:middle line:84%
of religions--
until we got to what

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.690 align:middle line:84%
is called the phenomenon of
the Protestant nose-- we've

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:48.240 align:middle line:90%
had incense.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.930 align:middle line:90%


00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.410 align:middle line:84%
Hindus use incense,
Buddhists use incense,

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Mohammedans use incense,
Catholics use incense.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.380 align:middle line:84%
But there came a break at
the time of the Reformation

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.480 align:middle line:84%
when incense was
somehow given up.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.250 align:middle line:90%
Oh, Hebrews use incense, too.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.280 align:middle line:90%
Or used to.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.610 align:middle line:90%
And why is this?

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.050 align:middle line:84%
Why this repression
of the sense of smell?

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.390 align:middle line:90%


00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't fully know the
answer to that question,

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.760 align:middle line:84%
except to say that I do
know that it is repressed.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And that it's a shame
we're depriving ourselves

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.670 align:middle line:90%
of a whole world of wonder.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:33.760 align:middle line:84%
Because the nose is just
as sensitive as the ears.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And there can be
music for the nose

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.520 align:middle line:84%
in the same way as
music for the ears.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And the same way as there
can be glories for the eyes,

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.520 align:middle line:84%
there can be glories
for the nose.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know why we're
so diffident, so uptight,

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.400 align:middle line:84%
about admitting
that we have noses.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.990 align:middle line:84%
Because, of course,
we very well recognize

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:03.030 align:middle line:84%
that animals have the most
incredible senses of smell

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:06.000 align:middle line:84%
and can detect all
sorts of things.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.930 align:middle line:84%
Open up to themselves
a whole new world

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.060 align:middle line:84%
of experience by simply
using their noses.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you don't
use your nose, you

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.300 align:middle line:84%
are really in just as
pitiable a condition

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.460 align:middle line:84%
as somebody who was
born blind or deaf.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.050 align:middle line:90%


00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.540 align:middle line:90%
You've lost a whole sense.

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:30.555 align:middle line:84%
And so there is a
whole art of smell.

00:07:30.555 --> 00:07:33.480 align:middle line:90%


00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.200 align:middle line:90%
I don't know one half of it.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
art of perfumery.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.495 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that a
very skilled manufacturer

00:07:40.495 --> 00:07:47.040 align:middle line:84%
of perfumes is a person who
gets a very beautiful lady

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.810 align:middle line:84%
and gently and
unostentatiously sniffs

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:52.420 align:middle line:90%
the natural odor of her body.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.070 align:middle line:90%


00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And then he combines the
natural odor of her body

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:05.620 align:middle line:84%
with a perfume ingredient that
will be its perfect partner.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And therefore make some
entirely individual scene

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.894 align:middle line:90%
this is her own authentic smell.

00:08:10.894 --> 00:08:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
why you shouldn't

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:15.050 align:middle line:84%
have your own authentic
smell, just as you might have

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:19.170 align:middle line:84%
your own authentic voice, your
own authentic face, and indeed,

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:22.000 align:middle line:90%
your own authentic character.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.090 align:middle line:84%
But the mysteries of
perfumery are closed to me.

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:26.780 align:middle line:84%
Not, however, the
mysteries of incense.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And I know quite
a bit about them.

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I would
try-- although television

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:34.510 align:middle line:84%
is kind of an
inconsistent medium

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:39.580 align:middle line:84%
to use-- to show you some
of the mysteries of incense.

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Now of course everybody
knows that incense is widely

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:46.680 align:middle line:84%
sold in the United States
of America and in Europe.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And you can buy it
in the dime store.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.680 align:middle line:84%
But the ordinary incense
which is sold to you

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:59.990 align:middle line:84%
is usually black in
color or purple in color.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And although there
are good incenses that

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.660 align:middle line:84%
are black and purple, I
advise you on the whole

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.560 align:middle line:84%
never to buy a black
or a purple incense,

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.590 align:middle line:84%
unless you're buying from
somebody like my friend Kim von

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:14.750 align:middle line:84%
Tempsky, who really
understands incense,

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.050 align:middle line:90%
who can advise you what to buy.

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:21.220 align:middle line:84%
But ordinarily black
or purple incenses

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.720 align:middle line:90%
smell like cheap perfume.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.280 align:middle line:84%
Bad incense always
has at the back of it

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:30.770 align:middle line:84%
a soapy smell, whereas
a good instance has

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:36.510 align:middle line:84%
a woodsy or resinous
or floral smell.

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.550 align:middle line:84%
But it should never
have that feeling

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:40.670 align:middle line:90%
of having a soapy ingredient.

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Now absolutely basic incense,
for the Orient, is sandalwood.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is a
trunk of sandalwood

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:57.730 align:middle line:84%
on which I've written the
Chinese characters bird, sound,

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:00.670 align:middle line:90%
flower, perfume.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.950 align:middle line:90%
So from the bird, sound.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:06.510 align:middle line:90%
From the flower, perfume.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:09.670 align:middle line:90%
That's basic sandalwood.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes a piece of this
type is made into a statute,

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.080 align:middle line:90%
as this charming Hindu goddess.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.210 align:middle line:90%


00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:30.080 align:middle line:84%
But, generally
speaking, sandalwood

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.060 align:middle line:90%
is the basic incense.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:36.730 align:middle line:90%
And it comes in various forms.

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:37.265 align:middle line:90%
In chips.

00:10:37.265 --> 00:10:40.350 align:middle line:90%


00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:43.340 align:middle line:90%
And it comes in powder.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.530 align:middle line:90%
And it comes in sticks.

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, in order to burn incense,
you need a basis of charcoal.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.060 align:middle line:90%
The thing to do is this.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:56.090 align:middle line:90%


00:10:56.090 --> 00:11:00.515 align:middle line:84%
The best way to burn incense is
to have a bowl with sand in it.

00:11:00.515 --> 00:11:03.130 align:middle line:90%


00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And get charcoal, which you can
buy from ecclesiastical shops,

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:14.540 align:middle line:84%
which is impregnated
with saltpeter so

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.142 align:middle line:90%
that it lights itself.

00:11:17.142 --> 00:11:17.642 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:11:17.642 --> 00:11:21.020 align:middle line:90%


00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:25.040 align:middle line:84%
You can use ordinary charcoal
that you use for a barbecue.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.040 align:middle line:90%
But I don't recommend it.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.849 align:middle line:90%
It will work.

00:11:29.849 --> 00:11:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And then you get
this charcoal going.

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:36.820 align:middle line:90%


00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:37.390 align:middle line:90%
Fanning it.

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:42.870 align:middle line:90%


00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.980 align:middle line:84%
It's fun, because it sputters
and spits all over the place.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.781 align:middle line:90%


00:11:49.781 --> 00:11:50.280 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:55.700 align:middle line:90%


00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Then, after that, you take a--
say, a chip of incense wood.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:01.570 align:middle line:90%


00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:03.420 align:middle line:90%
And just place it on it.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:05.660 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And slowly it will
heat up and you'll

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:12.980 align:middle line:84%
find the whole room
marvelously impregnated

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:20.530 align:middle line:84%
with this curiously sweet woodsy
smell that isn't icky sweet.

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, really, there are
two basic kinds of-- well,

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.640 align:middle line:90%
three basic kinds of incense.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:31.500 align:middle line:84%
Temple incense, punk,
for scaring off insects,

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.750 align:middle line:90%
and boudoir incense.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:40.600 align:middle line:84%
Boudoir incense is very,
very erotic in perfume.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.395 align:middle line:90%
Temple incense is very pure.

00:12:42.395 --> 00:12:47.020 align:middle line:84%
It has the feeling of
high mountain forests,

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:47.845 align:middle line:90%
of loneliness.

00:12:47.845 --> 00:12:50.950 align:middle line:90%


00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:54.589 align:middle line:84%
And so thus is the chip
form of sandalwood.

00:12:54.589 --> 00:12:56.380 align:middle line:84%
Then there's the powder
form of sandalwood.

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:59.560 align:middle line:90%


00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.150 align:middle line:84%
You just put a
pinch on, like that.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:03.790 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:07.260 align:middle line:84%
Also you can use
powdered sandalwood

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.950 align:middle line:90%
for rubbing into your hands.

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:17.310 align:middle line:84%
See, now, I have around my neck
what the Japanese call a juzu.

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:21.180 align:middle line:84%
It's a Buddhist-- a
Zen Buddhist rosary.

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.135 align:middle line:84%
And you rub a little
sandalwood powder

00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:24.385 align:middle line:90%
into your hands like this.

00:13:24.385 --> 00:13:27.260 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.800 align:middle line:90%
And then you play with it.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:33.660 align:middle line:84%
These are actually used
for counting your breath

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:37.160 align:middle line:84%
during meditation, so that
you don't have to figure.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.830 align:middle line:84%
You just breathe in
and out on each bead.

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:45.100 align:middle line:90%
Once out.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.720 align:middle line:90%
And once in.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And at a certain pace--
there are 108 beads.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:57.420 align:middle line:84%
At a certain pace, once around
the rosary is half an hour.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.837 align:middle line:84%
Which is sort of a
standard meditation period.

00:13:59.837 --> 00:14:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have
to count, you don't

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:04.122 align:middle line:84%
have to think about
anything except breathing.

00:14:04.122 --> 00:14:06.110 align:middle line:84%
But after you've got
through with it--

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:09.034 align:middle line:84%
and you do this very
often-- your whole rosary

00:14:09.034 --> 00:14:10.200 align:middle line:90%
is perfumed with sandalwood.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:15.940 align:middle line:90%


00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:19.581 align:middle line:84%
Now another very wonderful
kind of wooden incense--

00:14:19.581 --> 00:14:21.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to move
this off for a moment.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:24.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, incense comes in the
most extraordinarily beautiful

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:24.810 align:middle line:90%
packages.

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:27.070 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:31.210 align:middle line:84%
This is from a great
incense shop in Kyoto,

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:33.500 align:middle line:84%
on Teramachi, or
Temple Street, where

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:37.090 align:middle line:84%
they sell every kind
of exciting incense,

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:40.220 align:middle line:90%
marvelous inks, brushes, paper.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:43.080 align:middle line:90%
All sorts of goodies.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And you see how they
fold the package?

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:53.240 align:middle line:84%
And inside are
these little squares

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:58.700 align:middle line:84%
of a wood which they
call in Japanese jinkoh.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:03.390 align:middle line:84%
You don't confuse that
with the ginkgo tree.

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:06.130 align:middle line:90%
Jinkoh is aloeswood.

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And aloeswood is a tree that
is found in the Orient that

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:15.600 align:middle line:84%
gets a disease which causes the
wood to become extremely hard.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And that very hard wood is an
enormously expensive luxury.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.150 align:middle line:84%
It's, you know-- the
disease of the tree

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:25.720 align:middle line:84%
is like the pearls
in the oyster.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:29.720 align:middle line:84%
That somehow, out of disease,
comes something beautiful.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And you also can burn
aloeswood on charcoal.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And this has one of the
most marvelous perfumes

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:35.870 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:39.700 align:middle line:90%
This really is the high forest.

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And old Doctor Suzuki-- he
was the great authority on Zen

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Buddhism-- said
the smell of jinkoh

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:47.000 align:middle line:90%
Is the smell of Buddhism.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Because they use this throughout
Buddhist temples in China

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:55.470 align:middle line:84%
and Japan when they're-- shall
we say, putting on the dog,

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:57.521 align:middle line:84%
and using the very
best that they have.

00:15:57.521 --> 00:15:59.680 align:middle line:90%
Jinkoh.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:05.370 align:middle line:90%
It comes in these flat squares.

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:10.490 align:middle line:84%
But it also comes
in granular form.

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:15.129 align:middle line:84%
And this is really rather
easier to use when you can just

00:16:15.129 --> 00:16:16.295 align:middle line:90%
sprinkle it on the charcoal.

00:16:16.295 --> 00:16:25.640 align:middle line:90%


00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:31.170 align:middle line:84%
Now besides this we have so
many other fantastic varieties.

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:35.270 align:middle line:84%
There is a special
incense which the Japanese

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:38.630 align:middle line:90%
use in tea ceremony.

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:42.270 align:middle line:84%
The tea ceremony is
a peculiar thing.

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:46.410 align:middle line:84%
It's a ceremony that is,
as it were, non-religious,

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:47.440 align:middle line:90%
and yet very religious.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.350 align:middle line:90%


00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:54.070 align:middle line:84%
All we're doing in tea
ceremony is just drinking tea.

00:16:54.070 --> 00:17:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And there are no images, icons,
or religious symbols present.

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:04.910 align:middle line:84%
There is just drinking of
tea in a completely, fully

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:07.670 align:middle line:90%
attentive way.

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.069 align:middle line:84%
In which everything
that you do is

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:12.520 align:middle line:84%
done as if it were the
only important thing

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.859 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:16.069 align:middle line:84%
You see, tea ceremony
is completely

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:18.750 align:middle line:90%
living in the present.

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:22.200 align:middle line:84%
Being absolutely with
what you're doing.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:26.520 align:middle line:84%
But in a kind of
relaxed, easy way.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:30.590 align:middle line:84%
Living in the eternal now,
which is actually the only place

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:33.350 align:middle line:90%
there is to live.

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:middle line:84%
This particular vase, with
its curious little ivory top,

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:45.950 align:middle line:84%
was originally a jar used
for pills or herbal medicine

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:47.506 align:middle line:90%
in Japan.

00:17:47.506 --> 00:17:49.530 align:middle line:84%
But the masters of
the tea ceremony

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:53.530 align:middle line:84%
felt that these were so
elegant that they used them

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:57.467 align:middle line:84%
as incense containers
for the ceremony.

00:17:57.467 --> 00:17:59.300 align:middle line:84%
This isn't quite the
right way to do things,

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:02.700 align:middle line:84%
because this is using
a-- people get fussy

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:07.630 align:middle line:84%
because I'm using a non-Japanese
thing for a Japanese object.

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:11.520 align:middle line:90%


00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:17.830 align:middle line:84%
But this incense is made
of very small, black balls.

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And I've never been
able to figure out

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:21.580 align:middle line:90%
what on Earth they put into it.

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:25.090 align:middle line:84%
But it has an absolutely
distinctive smell

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:28.550 align:middle line:84%
associated with
the tea ceremony.

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:29.700 align:middle line:90%
It's lovely stuff.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:37.550 align:middle line:90%


00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:39.910 align:middle line:84%
Then, of course, the
other principal form

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:42.700 align:middle line:84%
of incense which one is
familiar with is stick incense.

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:45.270 align:middle line:90%


00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And here again things come
in wonderful packages.

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:53.072 align:middle line:90%


00:18:53.072 --> 00:18:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Don't you like the way
the Japanese pack things

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:56.415 align:middle line:90%
in these white, wooden boxes?

00:18:56.415 --> 00:18:59.240 align:middle line:90%


00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And then the incense itself
comes in a package like this.

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:08.400 align:middle line:90%


00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And you extract a stick-- you
have to do it very subtly,

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:14.920 align:middle line:84%
because it breaks
off at the top.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:18.250 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:19.810 align:middle line:90%
And you light it.

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:24.640 align:middle line:90%


00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.596 align:middle line:90%
Blow it out.

00:19:25.596 --> 00:19:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And again, stick it
in a bowl of sand.

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:29.120 align:middle line:84%
That's the easiest
way to handle it.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:33.690 align:middle line:90%


00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:37.950 align:middle line:84%
This particular incense
is based on sandalwood.

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:41.110 align:middle line:90%


00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:44.960 align:middle line:84%
When you buy Japanese incense,
usually the green sticks

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:48.630 align:middle line:90%
are based on pine.

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And the-- there are
some very fine ones.

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.550 align:middle line:84%
The most expensive incense
you can buy is this.

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:58.600 align:middle line:90%
It comes in this sort of a box.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:04.335 align:middle line:84%
And you open up, inside,
an elaborate package.

00:20:04.335 --> 00:20:07.942 align:middle line:90%


00:20:07.942 --> 00:20:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And you find inside
this container.

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And you find inside that
the sticks themselves.

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:20.595 align:middle line:84%
And this most luxurious of
all types of Japanese incense

00:20:20.595 --> 00:20:24.280 align:middle line:84%
is based on musk,
although it's green.

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And, as I said, green
is generally pine.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:30.540 align:middle line:90%


00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.136 align:middle line:90%
This is particularly lovely.

00:20:32.136 --> 00:20:39.920 align:middle line:90%


00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:47.986 align:middle line:84%
Then you can find amazing
stick incense from Tibet.

00:20:47.986 --> 00:20:51.215 align:middle line:90%


00:20:51.215 --> 00:20:53.510 align:middle line:90%
Look at that one.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:54.610 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that a beauty?

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:55.235 align:middle line:90%
It's a whopper.

00:20:55.235 --> 00:20:57.880 align:middle line:90%


00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:58.910 align:middle line:90%
Let's set that one up.

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:07.090 align:middle line:90%


00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:13.070 align:middle line:84%
This is more-- I
regard this as a punk.

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:15.970 align:middle line:84%
That's not to say-- that's
not a bad thing to say,

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:17.300 align:middle line:90%
like you say someone is a punk.

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.830 align:middle line:90%


00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:25.780 align:middle line:84%
Punk has the sort of
smell of autumn leaves.

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.255 align:middle line:84%
And this is just
a little richer.

00:21:27.255 --> 00:21:30.020 align:middle line:84%
But it's very good for
keeping away mosquitoes.

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And you can set that up
in a thing like this.

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:38.200 align:middle line:84%
This is a jar full of earth,
so that it will hold the thing.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Then the similar,
marvelous incense

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:45.026 align:middle line:84%
sticks from-- these
are from Nepal.

00:21:45.026 --> 00:21:53.200 align:middle line:90%


00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.009 align:middle line:84%
But it's rather
floppy and dangerous,

00:21:55.009 --> 00:21:57.300 align:middle line:84%
and I'm a little afraid that
it might be a fire hazard.

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.090 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to double it over.

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:14.360 align:middle line:90%


00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is a--
a coarse incense.

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And I have a special
liking for coarse incense.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:28.870 align:middle line:84%
As distinct from the ones
that are too icky perfumed.

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:32.020 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
extraordinary ones from Nepal

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:35.976 align:middle line:90%
is this, which is a rope.

00:22:35.976 --> 00:22:37.370 align:middle line:90%
A little piece of rope.

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:40.370 align:middle line:90%


00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:47.250 align:middle line:84%
This has a very, very-- what I
would call a good-sweet flavor,

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:49.830 align:middle line:90%
as distinct from icky-sweet.

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:56.520 align:middle line:84%
It's like the sweetness of fresh
strawberries or fine honey,

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.755 align:middle line:84%
as compared with the
sweetness of cheap candy.

00:22:58.755 --> 00:23:05.700 align:middle line:90%


00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:10.760 align:middle line:84%
It's frustrating that I can't
convey these smells to you

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.320 align:middle line:90%
in words.

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Same sort of
frustration one gets

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:21.530 align:middle line:84%
in trying to describe
color to the blind.

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:23.610 align:middle line:84%
Although sometimes you
can get very close to it.

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:26.530 align:middle line:90%


00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:32.370 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend, a girl
who was born blind.

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I mentioned her on
one of these programs.

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:37.770 align:middle line:84%
But she has no idea
what darkness is.

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to try to give her
an idea of what the stars are.

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:46.010 align:middle line:90%
Why we love the stars.

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:51.450 align:middle line:84%
So I said, look,
imagine-- when you

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:54.950 align:middle line:84%
touch the edge of something,
you feel the edge.

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And then you move your hand
away and nothing obstructs

00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:58.410 align:middle line:90%
your hand.

00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:00.850 align:middle line:90%
So there is space.

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:02.710 align:middle line:90%
Nothing obstructing.

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:06.970 align:middle line:84%
Now imagine if you could put
your hands out and feel around

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:14.030 align:middle line:84%
yourself a large collection of
randomly distributed prickles.

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:16.850 align:middle line:90%
Sharp points.

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:19.520 align:middle line:90%
Only they don't hurt you.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.460 align:middle line:84%
They don't hurt you like
the point of a needle.

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:27.300 align:middle line:90%
They're a kind of pleasure pain.

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:30.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if I were to give you
a friendly smack on the behind,

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.410 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't interpret
it as being an assault.

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:37.170 align:middle line:84%
You would say it was a friendly
smack, and therefore it was OK.

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:39.610 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way we
get this impression

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:46.350 align:middle line:84%
with the things we call our eyes
of a friendly prickle coming

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:51.380 align:middle line:84%
at us from all over space
when we can see them at night.

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:56.330 align:middle line:84%
So we try and translate
the language of sight

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:58.831 align:middle line:90%
into the language of touch.

00:24:58.831 --> 00:25:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And so, likewise, we
have this difficulty

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:08.040 align:middle line:84%
in talking about smell to people
who, as GK Chesterton said,

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:11.640 align:middle line:84%
"they haven't got no
noses, and goodness only

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:17.550 align:middle line:84%
knowses the
noselessness of man,"

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:20.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, there are other
interesting things here,

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:24.070 align:middle line:84%
of different
varieties of incense.

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:29.790 align:middle line:84%
I want to introduce you
to this particular thing.

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:34.510 align:middle line:84%
Have to be careful when handling
incense, as it gets hot.

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And I shall have to
use my fire magic.

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.690 align:middle line:90%
You know people walk on fire?

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And you do this by
making friends with fire.

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:52.960 align:middle line:84%
You mustn't be too
frightened of it.

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:56.560 align:middle line:90%
Here's a wonderful gadget.

00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:01.740 align:middle line:84%
It's spiral incense,
which comes from Pakistan.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:05.770 align:middle line:84%
This, again, is a punk, used
for keeping away mosquitoes.

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:15.030 align:middle line:84%
You can light that
and burn it for hours,

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:16.062 align:middle line:90%
keep your insects away.

00:26:16.062 --> 00:26:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
another interesting form

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:23.410 align:middle line:84%
of spiral incense,
which is this, where

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:25.280 align:middle line:90%
a symbol is laid out in incense.

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:29.110 align:middle line:90%


00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:34.030 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes a-- you know, a
religious symbol or whatever.

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:37.302 align:middle line:84%
And you light it
at the beginning.

00:26:37.302 --> 00:26:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And it crawls all the way
along until the symbol

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:40.940 align:middle line:90%
is outlined in black.

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:47.390 align:middle line:90%


00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:52.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the West, the principal
incense in use is a resin.

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Frankincense is really
basic to incenses

00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:57.770 align:middle line:84%
used in the Christian
churches, both of the East

00:26:57.770 --> 00:26:59.570 align:middle line:90%
and of the West.

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And the delightful thing
about using frankincense

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:07.510 align:middle line:84%
is the censer, or thurible,
with which you swing it.

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:10.620 align:middle line:90%
And I mean swing it.

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:13.020 align:middle line:84%
It's just as charming to
use-- as you remember,

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:14.780 align:middle line:84%
in the last program,
we got fascinated

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:16.550 align:middle line:90%
with swinging an orange.

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way you
can swing this thing.

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And even swing it right
around without it coming out.

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:27.280 align:middle line:84%
But this is the way
it's used throughout

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.160 align:middle line:90%
the Western churches.

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And which, for reasons unknown
to me, the Protestants gave up.

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And they lost all the
joy of doing this thing

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:39.650 align:middle line:90%
to the greater glory of God.

00:27:39.650 --> 00:28:32.667 align:middle line:90%
