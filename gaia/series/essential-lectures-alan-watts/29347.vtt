00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:44.710 align:middle line:90%


00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.010 align:middle line:84%
>>I suppose the most fascinating
question in the whole world

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.810 align:middle line:90%
is who am I or what am I?

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.190 align:middle line:90%


00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.990 align:middle line:84%
Because, as I've
suggested in several

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:05.170 align:middle line:84%
of the previous talks,
the seer, the knower,

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.130 align:middle line:84%
the one whom you are is
the most inaccessible

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.010 align:middle line:84%
of all experiences, completely
mysterious and hidden.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.540 align:middle line:90%


00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.630 align:middle line:90%
And yet we talk about our egos.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.080 align:middle line:90%
We use the word I.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And I've always been
tremendously interested in what

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.960 align:middle line:84%
people mean by the word
I, because it comes out

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:42.660 align:middle line:84%
in curious lapses of speech,
like we don't say I am a body.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.160 align:middle line:90%
We say I have a body.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.070 align:middle line:90%


00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And somehow we don't seem
to identify ourselves

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.120 align:middle line:90%
with all of ourselves.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.750 align:middle line:84%
We say my feet,
my hands, my teeth

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.850 align:middle line:84%
as if they were something
somehow outside me.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And as far as I can
make out, most people

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.400 align:middle line:84%
feel that they are something
or other about halfway

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.090 align:middle line:84%
between the ears and a
little way behind the eyes

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.990 align:middle line:84%
inside the head, and from
this center the rest of them

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.870 align:middle line:90%
sort of dangles.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And that governing principle in
there is what you call the ego,

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.980 align:middle line:90%
and that's-- that's me.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.530 align:middle line:90%


00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And I just can't
get rid of the idea

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.960 align:middle line:90%
that that's a hallucination.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.600 align:middle line:90%
That's not what you are at all.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
dangerous hallucination

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.050 align:middle line:84%
because it gives you
the idea that you

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:57.020 align:middle line:84%
are a center of consciousness,
of energy and responsibility

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.730 align:middle line:84%
that stands over, against and in
opposition to everything else.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.120 align:middle line:90%


00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.500 align:middle line:84%
You're a chauffeur
inside your own body,

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.770 align:middle line:84%
as if your body
were an automobile

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.050 align:middle line:84%
and you are the chauffeur
principle inside it.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.520 align:middle line:84%
But you feel caught in a
trap because your body's kind

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.730 align:middle line:90%
of a mess.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.835 align:middle line:84%
It gets sick, tired, hurt, and
eventually wears out and dies.

00:03:27.835 --> 00:03:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And you feel caught in the
thing because you feel different

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.510 align:middle line:84%
from it, and you feel the
world outside your body,

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.925 align:middle line:84%
furthermore, is an awful trap,
full of stupid people who

00:03:38.925 --> 00:03:41.890 align:middle line:84%
are sometimes nice to you but
mostly aren't, because they're

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.890 align:middle line:84%
all out for themselves,
like you are,

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.470 align:middle line:84%
and therefore there's one
hell of a conflict going on.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of it
aside from people

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:54.370 align:middle line:84%
is absolutely dumb, animals,
plants, mere vegetables, rocks,

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.970 align:middle line:84%
and finally, behind
the whole thing,

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.775 align:middle line:84%
blazing centers of
radioactivity called stars.

00:03:59.775 --> 00:04:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And out there where
there's no air,

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.930 align:middle line:84%
there's no place for
a person to live.

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And so we have come
to feel ourselves

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:22.780 align:middle line:84%
as centers of very, very tender,
sensitive, vulnerable conscious

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:31.090 align:middle line:84%
confronted with a world that
doesn't give a damn about us

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.170 align:middle line:84%
and that therefore
we have to pick

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.000 align:middle line:84%
a fight with this
external world and beat it

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.245 align:middle line:90%
into submission to our wills.

00:04:38.245 --> 00:04:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And so we talk about
the conquest of nature.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.740 align:middle line:90%
We conquer everything.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.430 align:middle line:84%
We talk about the conquest
of mountains like Everest,

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.315 align:middle line:84%
the conquest of space,
the conquest of cancer,

00:04:49.315 --> 00:04:50.190 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, et cetera.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.680 align:middle line:84%
We're at war because
inside we feel ourselves

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:04.660 align:middle line:84%
to be these lonely ego
principles trapped in,

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.240 align:middle line:84%
somehow inextricably
bound up with a world that

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.120 align:middle line:84%
doesn't go our way
unless somehow we

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.840 align:middle line:90%
can manage to force it to do so.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.640 align:middle line:90%


00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, as I
have said, I feel

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.685 align:middle line:84%
that this sensation of ourselves
as an ego is a hallucination.

00:05:24.685 --> 00:05:28.660 align:middle line:90%


00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And I feel, let me say,
as against this completely

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.960 align:middle line:84%
false conception of ourselves
as an ego inside a bag of skins,

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.710 align:middle line:84%
that what we really
are is, first of all,

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.150 align:middle line:90%
we are the whole of our body.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.870 align:middle line:90%


00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Beyond that, however,
the body, although it

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.940 align:middle line:84%
is bounded by a
skin and I can, say,

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.100 align:middle line:84%
differentiate in a way between
my outside and my inside--

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:07.030 align:middle line:84%
although is this part
here outside or inside?

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.760 align:middle line:84%
It gets a little tricky
there, doesn't it--

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:17.450 align:middle line:84%
but my body cannot exist except
in a certain kind of natural

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.330 align:middle line:90%
environment.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.790 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, it requires
air, and that air

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.110 align:middle line:84%
must be at a
certain temperature.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.250 align:middle line:90%
It requires nutrition.

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.480 align:middle line:84%
It requires, therefore, that it
be on a certain kind of planet

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.480 align:middle line:84%
near a certain
kind of warm star,

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:42.650 align:middle line:84%
spinning regularly around it in
a harmonious and rhythmical way

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.230 align:middle line:90%
so that life can go on.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And all that arrangement
is just as essential

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.220 align:middle line:84%
to the existence of my body
as its own internal organs,

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.530 align:middle line:84%
as, say, my heart, my brain,
my lungs, and so forth.

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.940 align:middle line:84%
So there really is no
way of separating myself

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.890 align:middle line:84%
as a physical body from the
natural environment in which I

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:05.390 align:middle line:90%
live.

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:09.750 align:middle line:90%


00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:21.590 align:middle line:84%
Now that means that I as a body
go with my natural environment

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:26.230 align:middle line:84%
in the same way exactly as,
say, that bees go with flowers.

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.680 align:middle line:84%
Bees look very
different from flowers.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.200 align:middle line:84%
The flower grows out
of the ground, colors

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.220 align:middle line:90%
and perfumes the air.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.630 align:middle line:84%
The bee is independent and
buzzes around and flies.

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:41.120 align:middle line:84%
But where there are no
bees, there are no flowers,

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.250 align:middle line:84%
and where there are no
flowers, there are no bees.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.150 align:middle line:84%
They go together,
and in that sense

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:50.710 align:middle line:90%
they make up a single system.

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:54.280 align:middle line:84%
Substitute for the word
system is the word organism,

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.660 align:middle line:84%
a single lifeform, a single
individual, bees and flowers,

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.060 align:middle line:90%
however different they look.

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.570 align:middle line:84%
Now naturally my feet
look very different

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:08.410 align:middle line:84%
from my head, of course,
the string's joining them.

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we say, well,
it's all one, obviously.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:16.100 align:middle line:84%
But yet they are very
different, but they're both me.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And the feet and the
head, though different,

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.710 align:middle line:84%
are like the bees
and the flowers.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:22.220 align:middle line:90%
They go with each other.

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.660 align:middle line:90%


00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.920 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, if I'm to define
myself in a scientific way,

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:35.980 align:middle line:84%
I will find that if I am to make
a clear description of my body,

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:41.370 align:middle line:84%
my organism, my behavior
and say what it's doing,

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:45.730 align:middle line:84%
I find that I cannot describe
what my body is doing unless I

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:51.160 align:middle line:84%
also describe the surroundings,
the environment in which it is

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.120 align:middle line:90%
doing it.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.320 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it would be
meaningless to describe myself

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.680 align:middle line:84%
as walking if I didn't
describe the ground.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.320 align:middle line:84%
Because if I didn't
describe the ground,

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.280 align:middle line:84%
my description of
walking would simply

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:05.282 align:middle line:84%
be of a person swinging
his legs like this

00:09:05.282 --> 00:09:06.490 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of empty space.

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.300 align:middle line:90%
That wouldn't be walking.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:13.500 align:middle line:84%
I have to describe the
ground in which I walk.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:18.550 align:middle line:84%
So what I am is a
transaction or an interaction

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:21.800 align:middle line:84%
between this organism and
its surrounding environment,

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.180 align:middle line:84%
and they go together
and they constitute

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:29.400 align:middle line:84%
what we call in physics a
unified field for which we

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:33.150 align:middle line:84%
at present have only the
very awkward name organism

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.860 align:middle line:90%
environment.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.660 align:middle line:84%
Put it all together,
that's what I

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.830 align:middle line:84%
am from a purely physical
scientific point of view.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.380 align:middle line:90%


00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.060 align:middle line:84%
It may involve many
more things than that,

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.420 align:middle line:90%
but so far is enough.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:52.580 align:middle line:84%
I am an organism
environment, but that's not

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.910 align:middle line:90%
what my ego feels like.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:10:02.760 align:middle line:84%
That's not the average
commonsensical conception of I.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:07.445 align:middle line:84%
Because I is associated
with the organism and not

00:10:07.445 --> 00:10:08.320 align:middle line:90%
with the environment.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.010 align:middle line:90%
It is opposing the environment.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:13.209 align:middle line:84%
And furthermore, it
is not associated

00:10:13.209 --> 00:10:14.250 align:middle line:90%
with all of the organism.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:16.950 align:middle line:90%


00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:20.050 align:middle line:84%
Because, as I
said, the ego tends

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:24.065 align:middle line:84%
to regard the rest of the
organism as the chauffeur

00:10:24.065 --> 00:10:24.815 align:middle line:90%
to the automobile.

00:10:24.815 --> 00:10:27.790 align:middle line:90%


00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, how do we get this false
sensation of being an ego?

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:37.059 align:middle line:84%
Well, it seems to me that
it's made up of two things.

00:10:37.059 --> 00:10:38.808 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
we have to understand,

00:10:38.808 --> 00:10:40.850 align:middle line:84%
which I have explained
before in a previous talk,

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:42.880 align:middle line:84%
but it's worth
going over it again,

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.550 align:middle line:84%
is that in the course
of civilization

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:51.780 align:middle line:84%
we make a confusion
between our ideas and words

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.380 align:middle line:84%
and symbols about the
world and the world itself.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:58.500 align:middle line:90%


00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:02.140 align:middle line:84%
The General Semantics people
founded by Dr. Korzybski,

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:03.500 align:middle line:90%
they have a little song.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.570 align:middle line:84%
[SINGING] Oh, the
word is not the thing.

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.330 align:middle line:90%
The word is not the thing.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.980 align:middle line:84%
Hi-ho, the dairy-o, the
word is not the thing.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.630 align:middle line:84%
Because obviously you can't
get wet in the sound water.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:16.920 align:middle line:90%


00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:23.030 align:middle line:84%
So the image, the idea,
the symbol, the word

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:26.180 align:middle line:90%
is not the reality.

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:32.790 align:middle line:84%
So the ego, what we feel as
I, consists of two elements.

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:36.225 align:middle line:84%
Number one is our image
or idea of ourselves.

00:11:36.225 --> 00:11:39.500 align:middle line:90%


00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:47.210 align:middle line:84%
This is made up mostly of things
that other people have told us

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:51.220 align:middle line:84%
about ourselves or by looking
at ourselves in the mirror

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:53.670 align:middle line:84%
or by listening to
ourselves played back

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:56.650 align:middle line:84%
on a tape recorder
or television,

00:11:56.650 --> 00:12:00.152 align:middle line:84%
and we get an
image of ourselves.

00:12:00.152 --> 00:12:01.610 align:middle line:84%
When I was a little
boy, I remember

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:04.050 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend up the
street called Peter,

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:05.750 align:middle line:90%
and I admired Peter very much.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I came home and
I imitated Peter's behavior.

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And my mother said to
me, Alan, that's not you.

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:14.019 align:middle line:90%
That's Peter.

00:12:14.019 --> 00:12:16.310 align:middle line:84%
Because, you see, she was
giving me an image of myself.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And when I did anything
terrible, she said,

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:22.290 align:middle line:84%
Alan, it's just not
like you to do that.

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:22.790 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:25.500 align:middle line:84%
She was busy building
in me an image,

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:29.860 align:middle line:84%
an idea of the kind of act
I was supposed to put on,

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:31.960 align:middle line:84%
the kind of person I
was supposed to be.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And you know the word person
comes from the Latin persona,

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:40.940 align:middle line:84%
which means that through which,
per, sonum, the sound goes.

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And it referred
originally to the mask

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:47.000 align:middle line:84%
worn by actors in
classical drama,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.900 align:middle line:84%
because those masks had
megaphonic mouths so

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:53.740 align:middle line:84%
that in the open air theater
they would project the sound.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.850 align:middle line:84%
So the persona, the
person, is the mask,

00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:58.990 align:middle line:90%
is the role you're playing.

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And all your friends
and relations

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:03.510 align:middle line:84%
and parents and teachers
are busy telling you

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:06.180 align:middle line:84%
who you are, what
your role in life is,

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.690 align:middle line:84%
and you know there are a certain
number of acceptable roles

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:09.360 align:middle line:90%
you can play.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.940 align:middle line:90%


00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:17.650 align:middle line:84%
So first of all
then, your sense of I

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:21.170 align:middle line:84%
is your sense of who
you are, whether you're

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:23.690 align:middle line:84%
a tinker, tailor, soldier,
sailor, rich man, poor man,

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:25.240 align:middle line:84%
beggar man, thief,
whether you're

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:29.140 align:middle line:84%
a clown type, a strong silent
man type, a clinging vine

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.180 align:middle line:84%
feminine type, et
cetera, et cetera.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.820 align:middle line:90%
We can name dozens of them.

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:36.600 align:middle line:84%
But you identify yourself
with a certain way of acting.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.060 align:middle line:84%
It's quite complicated,
but nevertheless there's

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:42.330 align:middle line:84%
a certain way of acting with
which you identify yourself

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:46.030 align:middle line:84%
and which constitutes
your image.

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:49.230 align:middle line:84%
Now that image of
yourself that you have

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:56.490 align:middle line:84%
is a social institution in
the same way, for example,

00:13:56.490 --> 00:14:02.830 align:middle line:84%
as it is a social institution
to divide the day into 24 hours

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:06.480 align:middle line:84%
or to divide the
foot into 12 inches

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.170 align:middle line:84%
or to draw lines of
latitude and longitude,

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:13.130 align:middle line:84%
which are purely imaginary,
over the surface of the Earth.

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:15.740 align:middle line:84%
It's very useful to do
that, because by means

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:18.250 align:middle line:84%
of that we navigate,
but there are

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:20.860 align:middle line:84%
no lines of latitude and
longitude over the Earth.

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.080 align:middle line:90%
They are imaginary.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:30.100 align:middle line:84%
You cannot, for example, use
the equator to tie up a package

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:33.590 align:middle line:84%
because it's an
abstract imaginary line.

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And so in just the same
way, your image of yourself

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:50.250 align:middle line:84%
as ego is an imaginary concept
that is not this organism

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:54.040 align:middle line:84%
and is, furthermore,
not this organism

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:57.461 align:middle line:84%
in its inseparable relationship
to its whole physical

00:14:57.461 --> 00:14:58.460 align:middle line:90%
and natural environment.

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.620 align:middle line:90%


00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:05.280 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, the image
of yourself that you have

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:12.480 align:middle line:84%
is simply a caricature, just
when we make a caricature, say,

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.020 align:middle line:84%
of Adolf Hitler and
we pull down the hair

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:17.990 align:middle line:84%
and put a comb instead
of a mustache, you know?

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:20.760 align:middle line:84%
We just associate
Adolf Hitler's image

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:27.860 align:middle line:84%
with the shock of hair and
the toothbrush mustache.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:31.850 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way,
our image of ourselves

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:34.880 align:middle line:84%
is a caricature of ourselves
because it does not

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:39.790 align:middle line:84%
include almost all the important
things about ourselves.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:41.630 align:middle line:84%
It does not include
all the goings

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:43.780 align:middle line:90%
on inside the physical organism.

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:45.780 align:middle line:84%
Oh, we get belly rumbles,
and occasionally we're

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:46.740 align:middle line:90%
aware of that.

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Occasionally we're
aware of our breathing.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.750 align:middle line:84%
Occasionally we're aware
of it hurts somewhere.

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:52.420 align:middle line:84%
But for the most
part, we are totally

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:55.360 align:middle line:84%
unconscious of everything
going on inside us.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.340 align:middle line:84%
We're unconscious of our
brains and how they work.

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:01.640 align:middle line:84%
We are unconscious
of our relationships

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.350 align:middle line:90%
to the external world.

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:05.450 align:middle line:84%
Many of our relationships
to other people

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:07.560 align:middle line:90%
are completely unconscious.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:12.910 align:middle line:84%
We depend, say, on telephone
operators, electricians

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:16.910 align:middle line:84%
supplying our electricity,
on all kinds of services

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:19.980 align:middle line:90%
that we never even think about.

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:23.110 align:middle line:84%
We don't think
about air pressure.

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:25.830 align:middle line:84%
We don't think about the
chemical constitution

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:27.180 align:middle line:90%
of the air we breathe.

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:31.950 align:middle line:84%
We don't think about cosmic
rays, gamma rays, x-rays,

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:33.180 align:middle line:90%
the output of the sun.

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:36.520 align:middle line:84%
All these things are absolutely
essential to our life,

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.610 align:middle line:84%
but they are not included
in the ego image.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:44.810 align:middle line:84%
So the ego image
is very incomplete.

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:47.750 align:middle line:90%
In fact, it's an illusion.

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:50.700 align:middle line:84%
But we say, now look,
it can't be that way,

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:57.120 align:middle line:84%
because I feel I. It's not
just an image of myself I have.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:02.606 align:middle line:84%
I have a solid feeling behind
the word I. When I think I,

00:17:02.606 --> 00:17:06.339 align:middle line:90%
I feel there's something there.

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:12.250 align:middle line:84%
So I feel, don't I, that
behind this image, this symbol

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:17.270 align:middle line:84%
of myself there is what we
would call a concrete referent.

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:23.410 align:middle line:84%
There is a feeling, a solid
sensation to which it refers.

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:26.609 align:middle line:90%
Now what is that?

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:28.000 align:middle line:90%
Interesting question.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.720 align:middle line:84%
Because the first thing,
if your brain is your ego,

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.850 align:middle line:84%
you have very little in
the way of direct sensation

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:39.280 align:middle line:90%
of your brain.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.060 align:middle line:84%
In fact, operations
can be performed

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:45.812 align:middle line:84%
on the brain with only
surface anesthesia,

00:17:45.812 --> 00:17:47.770 align:middle line:84%
because there's no feeling
in the brain itself.

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:50.690 align:middle line:90%


00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:51.835 align:middle line:90%
Try that one out for size.

00:17:51.835 --> 00:17:55.900 align:middle line:90%


00:17:55.900 --> 00:18:00.560 align:middle line:84%
You don't feel all these
interior operations.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:03.560 align:middle line:84%
They, therefore, cannot
be the sensation of ego.

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:06.190 align:middle line:90%


00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:11.140 align:middle line:84%
When your eyes are functioning
well, you don't see your eyes.

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:14.280 align:middle line:84%
If your eyes are imperfect,
you see spots in front of them.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.260 align:middle line:84%
That means there's some
lesions in the retina,

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.680 align:middle line:90%
or wherever it may be.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And because your eyes
aren't working properly,

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:21.660 align:middle line:90%
you feel them.

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:24.920 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way, you
don't hear your ears.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.620 align:middle line:84%
If you have singing
in your ears,

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.620 align:middle line:84%
it means there's something
wrong with your ears.

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:30.670 align:middle line:90%


00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:33.340 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, if you
do feel yourself,

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:35.920 align:middle line:84%
there must be something
wrong with you.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And whenever you have
the sensation of I

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:42.169 align:middle line:84%
is like spots in
front of the eyes.

00:18:42.169 --> 00:18:44.210 align:middle line:84%
It means something's wrong
with your functioning.

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:46.700 align:middle line:84%
That's why you
feel you're there,

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:50.620 align:middle line:84%
why you feel you as
being different from

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:54.750 align:middle line:84%
and somehow cut off from
all that you really are,

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:57.070 align:middle line:84%
which is everything
you're experiencing.

00:18:57.070 --> 00:19:01.200 align:middle line:84%
The real you is the totality
of everything you're aware of

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.302 align:middle line:90%
and a great deal more besides.

00:19:03.302 --> 00:19:05.510 align:middle line:84%
But what is this thing that
we feel in ourselves when

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:09.380 align:middle line:84%
we say that is the
concrete material me?

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:11.798 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'll tell you what it is.

00:19:11.798 --> 00:19:16.330 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLING] When you were
a little child in school--

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:19.815 align:middle line:84%
you remember?-- you were picking
your nose and looking out

00:19:19.815 --> 00:19:22.070 align:middle line:84%
of the window or flicking
spitballs at something.

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, the teacher rapped the
desk and said, pay attention.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:27.020 align:middle line:90%
Wowie.

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:29.740 align:middle line:90%
Now how did you do that?

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:32.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, you stared at the
teacher, and you put a frown

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:38.730 align:middle line:84%
on your face, because that's how
it looks like to pay attention.

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:40.910 align:middle line:84%
And when the teacher
sees all the pupils

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:45.550 align:middle line:84%
in the class staring at
her or him and frowning,

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:49.020 align:middle line:84%
then the teacher is
consoled and feels

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:50.980 align:middle line:84%
that the class is
paying attention.

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.565 align:middle line:84%
But this class is doing
nothing of the kind.

00:19:53.565 --> 00:19:57.170 align:middle line:84%
The class is pretending
to pay attention.

00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:57.680 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.290 align:middle line:84%
So you're reading a
book, some difficult book

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:03.820 align:middle line:84%
you have to read
because it's required.

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And you're bored
to death with it,

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:07.230 align:middle line:84%
and you think, well,
I've really got

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:08.855 align:middle line:90%
to concentrate on this book.

00:20:08.855 --> 00:20:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And so you sort of
glare at it and you

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:15.450 align:middle line:84%
try to force your mind
to follow its argument.

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And then you discover you're
not really reading the book.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:23.590 align:middle line:84%
You're thinking about
how you ought to read it.

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:25.630 align:middle line:84%
What would you do
if I say to you,

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:28.800 align:middle line:84%
now look, look, take
a hard look at me?

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.950 align:middle line:84%
Would you please take
a hard look at me?

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:33.652 align:middle line:90%
So you take a real hard look.

00:20:33.652 --> 00:20:34.610 align:middle line:90%
Now what are you doing?

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:38.550 align:middle line:84%
What's the difference between
a hard look and a soft look?

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Why, with your hard look,
you are straining muscles

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:46.000 align:middle line:84%
around your eyes, and
you're starting to stare.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Now if you stare
at a distant image,

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:54.782 align:middle line:84%
like a clock far away from
you, you make the image fuzzy.

00:20:54.782 --> 00:20:57.770 align:middle line:84%
If you want to see
the clock clearly,

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:01.500 align:middle line:84%
you must close your eyes,
imagine black for a while,

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.140 align:middle line:84%
and then lazily and
easily open them,

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.270 align:middle line:90%
and you will see the image.

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:08.740 align:middle line:90%
The light will come to you.

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And what do you do if I
say, now listen carefully?

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.622 align:middle line:84%
Listen very carefully
to what I'm saying.

00:21:14.622 --> 00:21:16.580 align:middle line:84%
You'll find you're
beginning to strain yourself

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:18.890 align:middle line:90%
around your ears.

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:21.040 align:middle line:84%
Golly, I remember
in school I had

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:24.720 align:middle line:84%
a boy who couldn't
read sat next to me.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to convince
the teacher that he really

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:41.210 align:middle line:84%
was trying to read, so he
would say, "Run, Spot, run."

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And he was using
all his muscles.

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:46.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, what have they
got to do with reading?

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:48.950 align:middle line:84%
What does straining your
muscles here to hear,

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:51.435 align:middle line:84%
straining your
muscles here to see,

00:21:51.435 --> 00:21:53.480 align:middle line:84%
what has that got
to do with seeing?

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.450 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:56.130 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:21:56.130 --> 00:22:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Supposing somebody says, OK,
now you've got to use your will.

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.450 align:middle line:84%
You've got to
exercise strong will.

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:04.810 align:middle line:90%
That's the ego, isn't it?

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:07.030 align:middle line:84%
What do you do when
you exercise your will?

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:10.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, they say, grit your
teeth, clench your fists.

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:10.960 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.684 align:middle line:90%
So you grit your teeth.

00:22:12.684 --> 00:22:13.600 align:middle line:90%
You clench your fists.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.850 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to stop wayward
emotions, you go up tight.

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:21.230 align:middle line:84%
You pull your stomach in or
hold your breath or contract

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:27.620 align:middle line:84%
your rectal muscles,
[STRAINING] like this.

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:31.190 align:middle line:84%
But all those activities
have absolutely nothing

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:33.520 align:middle line:84%
to do with the
efficient functioning

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.140 align:middle line:90%
of your nervous system.

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:39.740 align:middle line:84%
Just as staring at images makes
them fuzzy, listening hard,

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:41.900 align:middle line:84%
all this muscular
tension around here,

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:45.230 align:middle line:84%
distracts you from what
you're actually hearing.

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Gritting your teeth has
nothing to do with courage.

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:54.190 align:middle line:84%
All this is a total distraction,
and yet we do it all the time.

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we have
a chronic sensation

00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:02.380 align:middle line:84%
of muscular strain,
the object of which

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:05.950 align:middle line:84%
is an attempt to make our
nervous system, our brains,

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:09.320 align:middle line:84%
our sensitivity function
properly, and it doesn't work.

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.630 align:middle line:84%
It's like taking
off in a jet plane.

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:14.979 align:middle line:84%
You go zooming down
the runway, and you

00:23:14.979 --> 00:23:17.020 align:middle line:84%
think this plane has gone
too far down the runway

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:18.630 align:middle line:90%
and it isn't up in the air yet.

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:20.430 align:middle line:84%
So you start pulling
at your seat belts

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:22.370 align:middle line:90%
to help the thing up.

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:24.260 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have any effect.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And so in exactly the same
way all these muscular strains

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:30.640 align:middle line:84%
we do and have been taught to
do all our lives long so that we

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.170 align:middle line:84%
look as if we're
paying attention,

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:36.120 align:middle line:84%
we look as if we're
trying, all this is futile.

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.880 align:middle line:84%
But the chronic
sensation of strain

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:45.024 align:middle line:84%
is the sensation to which
we are referring as I.

00:23:45.024 --> 00:23:50.350 align:middle line:84%
So our ego is what have you, an
illusion married to a futility.

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:53.410 align:middle line:90%


00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:55.980 align:middle line:84%
It's the image of
ourselves which

00:23:55.980 --> 00:24:02.270 align:middle line:84%
is incorrect, false, and
only a caricature married to,

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:11.015 align:middle line:84%
combined with, a futile muscular
effort to will to be effective.

00:24:11.015 --> 00:24:13.770 align:middle line:90%


00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:16.980 align:middle line:84%
So then, what do
we do about that?

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:20.040 align:middle line:90%


00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:25.880 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't it be much better if
we had a sensation of ourselves

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:29.270 align:middle line:84%
that was in accord
with the facts?

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And as I tried to explain
in the beginning, the facts,

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:35.720 align:middle line:84%
the reality of our
existence is that we

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:42.080 align:middle line:84%
are both the natural
environment, which ultimately

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:47.940 align:middle line:84%
is the whole universe, and
the organism playing together.

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:50.160 align:middle line:90%
Why don't we feel that way?

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Why, obviously, because
this other feeling gets

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:55.970 align:middle line:84%
in the way of it, this
socially-induced feeling

00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:59.680 align:middle line:84%
which comes about as the
result of a kind of hypnotism

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:03.140 align:middle line:84%
exercised upon us throughout
the whole educational process

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:06.960 align:middle line:84%
has given us a hallucinatory
feeling of who we are,

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.230 align:middle line:84%
and therefore we
act like madmen.

00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:10.950 align:middle line:84%
We don't respect
our environment.

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:12.810 align:middle line:90%
We destroy it.

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:15.930 align:middle line:84%
But exploiting and
destroying your environment,

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:18.360 align:middle line:84%
polluting the water and
the air and everything

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.920 align:middle line:84%
is just like destroying
your own body.

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.480 align:middle line:90%
The environment is your body.

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.660 align:middle line:84%
But we act in this
crazy way because we've

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:28.180 align:middle line:84%
got a crazy conception
of who we are.

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:29.440 align:middle line:90%
We're raving mad.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.350 align:middle line:90%


00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:36.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, you say to me, then, all
right, how do I get rid of it?

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:38.840 align:middle line:84%
My answer to that is
that's the wrong question.

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:41.390 align:middle line:90%


00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:44.880 align:middle line:90%
How does what get rid of it?

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:48.190 align:middle line:84%
You can't get rid of
your hallucination

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:51.470 align:middle line:84%
of being an ego by an
activity of the ego.

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:52.940 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, but it can't be done.

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:56.010 align:middle line:90%


00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:59.280 align:middle line:84%
You can't lift yourself
up by your own bootstraps.

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:03.740 align:middle line:84%
You can't put out
fire with fire.

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And if you try to get rid
of your ego with your ego,

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.260 align:middle line:84%
you'll just get into
a vicious circle.

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:12.670 align:middle line:84%
You'll be like somebody who
worries because they worry

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:16.080 align:middle line:84%
and then worries because they
worry because they worry.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And you'll go round and round
and get crazier than ever.

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.770 align:middle line:84%
The first thing
to understand when

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:26.090 align:middle line:84%
you say what can I do about
getting rid of this false ego

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:32.020 align:middle line:84%
is the first answer is
nothing, because you're

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:34.450 align:middle line:90%
asking the wrong question.

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:38.190 align:middle line:84%
You're asking how can I,
thinking of myself as an ego,

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:40.307 align:middle line:84%
get rid of thinking
of myself as an ego?

00:26:40.307 --> 00:26:41.390 align:middle line:90%
Well, obviously you can't.

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:44.410 align:middle line:90%


00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:46.950 align:middle line:84%
Now you would say, well,
then it's hopeless.

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:47.470 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:48.630 align:middle line:90%
Now wait a minute.

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:49.480 align:middle line:90%
Don't go so fast.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:52.185 align:middle line:90%


00:26:52.185 --> 00:26:53.634 align:middle line:90%
It isn't hopeless.

00:26:53.634 --> 00:26:54.800 align:middle line:90%
You haven't got the message.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.560 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.730 align:middle line:84%
If you find out that
your ego feeling,

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:04.950 align:middle line:84%
your will and all that
jazz cannot get rid of that

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:09.340 align:middle line:84%
hallucination, you've found
out something very important.

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:12.510 align:middle line:84%
Because in finding out that
you can't do anything about it,

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:16.140 align:middle line:84%
what you have found out
is that you don't exist.

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.760 align:middle line:84%
That is to say you as
ego, you don't exist,

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:20.741 align:middle line:84%
so obviously you can't
do anything about it.

00:27:20.741 --> 00:27:24.040 align:middle line:90%


00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.590 align:middle line:84%
So you'll find
you can't control,

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:30.860 align:middle line:84%
not really, your thoughts,
your feelings, your emotions,

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:33.950 align:middle line:84%
all the processes going on
inside you and outside you

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:34.980 align:middle line:90%
that are happening.

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:37.780 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing you
can do about it.

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:40.130 align:middle line:90%
So then what follows?

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's only one
thing that follows.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.080 align:middle line:90%
You watch what's going on.

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:48.190 align:middle line:90%


00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:52.100 align:middle line:84%
You see, feel this
whole thing happening,

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:54.930 align:middle line:84%
and then suddenly you
find, to your amazement,

00:27:54.930 --> 00:28:01.490 align:middle line:84%
that you can perfectly well
get up, walk over to the table,

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:03.770 align:middle line:84%
pick up a glass of
milk, and drink it.

00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:06.290 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing standing
in your way for doing that.

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:11.310 align:middle line:90%
You can still move.
