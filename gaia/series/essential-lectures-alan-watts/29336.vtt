00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:18.350 align:middle line:90%
[GONG SOUNDING]

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:51.450 align:middle line:90%


00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:57.480 align:middle line:84%
>>I've been talking about the
perception of the world coming

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.650 align:middle line:90%
suddenly out of nothing.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.670 align:middle line:84%
You'll remember that,
in a previous talk,

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.740 align:middle line:84%
I asked you to close
your eyes and listen.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And you would hear silence, and
then sounds coming right out

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.300 align:middle line:90%
of that silence.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And then I suggested that you
use your eyes and see light,

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.365 align:middle line:84%
shape, form coming at
you as a vibration that

00:01:23.365 --> 00:01:24.660 align:middle line:90%
is proceeding out of space.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.660 align:middle line:90%


00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And I pointed out that our logic
resists that because, we say,

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.680 align:middle line:84%
you can't get something
out of nothing.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And that we normally
think of all

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.360 align:middle line:84%
the energetic manifestations
of this universe

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.540 align:middle line:90%
as coming out of the past.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.540 align:middle line:84%
We think the things
that were there already

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.380 align:middle line:84%
are producing the things
that are going on now.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.000 align:middle line:84%
But I was trying to get you to
look at it in the other way,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.500 align:middle line:84%
so that you would see the
whole world starting now

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.789 align:middle line:84%
instead of in the past, and the
past as a kind of echo fading

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.370 align:middle line:90%
away into memory.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And I illustrated it as being
like the wake of a ship that

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.540 align:middle line:84%
trails across the water
and then fades out.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.420 align:middle line:84%
But the wake is started by
the ship in the present.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And so in the same
way, I'm moving

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.310 align:middle line:84%
on to the uncommonsensical
idea of the world

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.370 align:middle line:84%
as a production of energy
that is beginning right now

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.210 align:middle line:84%
and is coming out of the
nothing that we variously

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.640 align:middle line:90%
call space and silence.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.640 align:middle line:90%


00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.740 align:middle line:84%
But then, naturally,
this raises the question,

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.480 align:middle line:90%
how on earth could that happen?

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And it has been, of course,
the usual explanation

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.350 align:middle line:84%
that the world is
being created by God.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.000 align:middle line:90%


00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.750 align:middle line:84%
In Christian and
Catholic theology,

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.060 align:middle line:84%
it is said that God creates
the world out of nothing.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And I want to
emphasize the point,

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.130 align:middle line:84%
in all fairness to
Catholic and to Islamic

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.810 align:middle line:84%
and to Jewish doctrine,
that it doesn't merely

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.740 align:middle line:84%
teach that God, once upon
a time, started the world

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.120 align:middle line:84%
and set it going like you
would wind up a machine

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.420 align:middle line:90%
and then leave it alone.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.520 align:middle line:84%
All these three religions
teach that God is always

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.250 align:middle line:84%
creating the world
out of nothing, now,

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.910 align:middle line:84%
and willing it by
His divine energy

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.640 align:middle line:90%
into being at this moment.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.900 align:middle line:84%
But now the
difficulty for us all,

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.660 align:middle line:84%
I think, especially for educated
people in the modern world,

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.110 align:middle line:84%
is that the
old-fashioned idea of God

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.105 align:middle line:84%
has become incredible
or implausible.

00:03:53.105 --> 00:03:55.700 align:middle line:90%


00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.280 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, in
church or in synagogue,

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.390 align:middle line:84%
we seem to be addressing
a royal personage.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.620 align:middle line:84%
The layout of a church
or of a synagogue

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.630 align:middle line:90%
looks like a royal court.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.900 align:middle line:90%
There is some sort of throne.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.959 align:middle line:84%
And we address
prayers and requests

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.710 align:middle line:84%
to the being represented
by the altar or the throne

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:30.450 align:middle line:84%
or the tabernacle as if
that being were a king

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:36.470 align:middle line:84%
and were causing this universe
in his royal, omnipotent,

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.820 align:middle line:90%
and omniscient wisdom.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.100 align:middle line:84%
But then, when we take a
look through our telescopes

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.180 align:middle line:84%
and microscopes, or even
when we go out in the forest

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.670 align:middle line:84%
and look at nature,
we have a problem.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:57.100 align:middle line:84%
Because the idea of God that we
get from the holy scriptures,

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:03.550 align:middle line:84%
the Bible, the Qur'an, doesn't
quite seem to fit the sort

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.070 align:middle line:84%
of world around us that we see,
in just the same way as you

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:15.110 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't dream of ascribing
a composition by Stravinsky

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.800 align:middle line:90%
to Bach.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.950 align:middle line:84%
The style of God, venerated in
church, mosque, and synagogue,

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.970 align:middle line:84%
seems completely
different from the style

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.880 align:middle line:90%
of the natural universe.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's so hard to conceive
the author of the one

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.750 align:middle line:90%
as the author of the other.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And furthermore, it strikes
most intelligent people

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:47.400 align:middle line:84%
that our traditional religious
ideas of God are too primitive.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:54.200 align:middle line:84%
It seems impossible to think
that this universe could have

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:59.220 align:middle line:84%
been authored by the
naive idea of God

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:06.910 align:middle line:84%
as a sort of old gentleman
who lives far above the stars,

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.290 align:middle line:84%
in Heaven, seated
on a golden throne,

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:15.240 align:middle line:90%
and adored by legions of angels.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.620 align:middle line:84%
That seems a concept
almost unworthy

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.590 align:middle line:84%
of the sort of universe
that modern science

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:24.990 align:middle line:90%
has revealed to us.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.660 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I mean,
here's a picture of God.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.050 align:middle line:90%


00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.950 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine, Richard
Bost, photographed this

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:39.430 align:middle line:84%
in a church just south
of Oaxaca in Mexico.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And it shows a very primitive
Indian, Catholic imagination

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:49.280 align:middle line:84%
of God the Father, wearing a
triple crown like the pope.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.670 align:middle line:84%
Only he's rather
young, handsome.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.870 align:middle line:84%
He's not quite the
old, gray bearded man,

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:53.720 align:middle line:90%
the Ancient of Days.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.310 align:middle line:84%
But there is a serious
idol, Christian idol

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.380 align:middle line:90%
of God the Father Almighty.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.910 align:middle line:90%
That has become implausible.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.280 align:middle line:84%
But also, for many people,
it has become implausible

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.790 align:middle line:84%
that the root of the universe,
which the theologian Paul

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.410 align:middle line:84%
Tillich calls the
ground of being,

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:19.220 align:middle line:84%
that the root of the
universe can be in some way

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:25.310 align:middle line:84%
a person to whom we can
relate in just the same way

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.310 align:middle line:84%
that we relate to other
people, and furthermore,

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.090 align:middle line:90%
a person who cares about us.

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:33.030 align:middle line:90%


00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.030 align:middle line:84%
In the words of
Jesus, five sparrows

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.120 align:middle line:90%
are sold for a farthing.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.610 align:middle line:84%
But yet not one of them
falls to the ground

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.120 align:middle line:90%
without the Father knowing it.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:49.140 align:middle line:84%
So realize that you are of
more value than many sparrows.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:53.710 align:middle line:84%
In other words, God cares a
great deal more about you.

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:57.890 align:middle line:84%
But it just baffles
our imagination

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:02.510 align:middle line:84%
that there could be
this sort of person who

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:06.300 align:middle line:84%
cares about each one
of us, who is totally

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.810 align:middle line:84%
aware of every single thing
that we are and that we do,

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:15.440 align:middle line:84%
and, by virtue of being
aware of us, creates us.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.370 align:middle line:84%
Of course, one thing that
is difficult about the idea

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:21.270 align:middle line:90%
is that it's embarrassing.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:26.380 align:middle line:84%
We do not feel comfortable if
we are watched all the time

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:29.810 align:middle line:84%
by an infinitely
intelligent judge.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:33.100 align:middle line:84%
You know how it is in
school when you're a child

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.020 align:middle line:84%
and you're working
at some exercise,

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.893 align:middle line:84%
and the teacher walks
behind your desk

00:08:37.893 --> 00:08:39.059 align:middle line:90%
and looks what you're doing.

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:41.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, even if you like
the teacher very much,

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.650 align:middle line:84%
you feel put off
by being watched.

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And it makes you
self-conscious and awkward.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And so in the same
way, many people

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.160 align:middle line:84%
opt for atheism
because they don't

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.160 align:middle line:84%
want that uncomfortable
feeling that they're

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.810 align:middle line:90%
being watched all the time.

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:58.650 align:middle line:90%
It's awkward.

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And if I were God,
I wouldn't do it.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.280 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't want to embarrass
my creatures in that way.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And so I would leave them
alone for a lot of the time.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:12.830 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I've often thought
about this whole thing.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:17.190 align:middle line:84%
The kind of god
that people worship

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.880 align:middle line:84%
is, of course, an
attempt to imagine

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.450 align:middle line:84%
an absolutely
perfect human being.

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.910 align:middle line:90%
But it's a very poor attempt.

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:34.060 align:middle line:84%
For example, Jesus taught that
if somebody sins against you,

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:34.850 align:middle line:90%
you forgive him.

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And his disciples asked,
well, how many times do you

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:38.500 align:middle line:90%
forgive him?

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And he said 90
and 9 times, which

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.320 align:middle line:84%
is our way of saying
umpteen times.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Always forgive somebody
who sins against you.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.650 align:middle line:84%
But notice that that
is required of a saint.

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:50.920 align:middle line:90%
A saint is always forgiving.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.790 align:middle line:90%
But it's not required of God.

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:59.220 align:middle line:84%
God will not forgive you
unless you apologize.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
grovel on the ground

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.040 align:middle line:84%
if you've committed what
the Catholic Church calls

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.020 align:middle line:90%
a mortal sin.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:08.500 align:middle line:84%
You've got to come to God in
a state of great penitence.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
do that, you are

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:14.240 align:middle line:84%
liable to be confined
in the dungeons

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.480 align:middle line:84%
of the court of Heaven, commonly
known as Hell, for always

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.697 align:middle line:90%
and always and always.

00:10:19.697 --> 00:10:21.905 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't think that's
a very nice kind of fellow.

00:10:21.905 --> 00:10:25.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you wouldn't invite
that sort of god to dinner.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.240 align:middle line:84%
Because he would
embarrass everybody.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.920 align:middle line:84%
Everybody would be sitting on
the edge their chair like this.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And God would be looking
at you in such a way

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:37.070 align:middle line:84%
that you felt you were being
seen through and through,

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:42.500 align:middle line:84%
that all your awful past,
all your falseness and lack

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:46.520 align:middle line:84%
of authenticity would be
completely perceptible to him.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And though he understood it,
and though he forgave it,

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:53.550 align:middle line:84%
he would nevertheless make
you feel absolutely terrible.

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:57.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, you just wouldn't want
that sort of company at dinner.

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:01.170 align:middle line:84%
You may think it's
frivolous of me to say this.

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:10.040 align:middle line:84%
But don't forget that the
pictorial image of God

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.570 align:middle line:84%
that people have in the
backs of their minds,

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:16.470 align:middle line:84%
even if you're a very
sophisticated philosopher

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:21.290 align:middle line:84%
or theologian, that
primitive, pictorial image

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:25.600 align:middle line:84%
has a very strong
influence on your feelings

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:31.270 align:middle line:84%
about religion, about the
universe, and about yourself.

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:36.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's just for that reason
that the traditional idea

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:40.540 align:middle line:84%
of God has become
implausible to many people,

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.490 align:middle line:84%
and that modern Protestant
theologians, and even

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:46.440 align:middle line:84%
some Catholics, have
been talking recently

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:50.180 align:middle line:84%
about the death of God
and about the possibility

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:53.340 align:middle line:84%
of whether we could have
a religionless religion.

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:58.930 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, a religion which
does not involve belief in God.

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:00.790 align:middle line:84%
What, in other
words, would become

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:05.050 align:middle line:84%
of the gospel, the
gospel of Jesus Christ,

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:08.510 align:middle line:84%
if it were shown that
Jesus' own belief in God

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:10.560 align:middle line:90%
were unnecessary and invalid?

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.520 align:middle line:84%
What would remain
of his teaching,

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:19.760 align:middle line:84%
of his ideas about caring
for other human beings,

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.310 align:middle line:84%
about social responsibility,
and so on and so forth,

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:27.920 align:middle line:84%
if the idea of God
simply evaporated?

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.850 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a pretty
wishy-washy kind of religion.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:34.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you're going to say
that this life is fundamentally

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.730 align:middle line:84%
nothing but a pilgrimage
from the maternity ward

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:41.890 align:middle line:84%
to the crematorium and that's
it, baby, you've had it,

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:44.640 align:middle line:84%
I think that indicates a
singular lack of imagination.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:48.270 align:middle line:90%


00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:50.040 align:middle line:84%
I would like to look
at the death of God

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.770 align:middle line:84%
theology in an
entirely different way.

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:58.120 align:middle line:90%


00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:02.590 align:middle line:84%
I would like to say
that what is dead

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:06.990 align:middle line:90%
is not God, but an idea of God.

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:09.430 align:middle line:84%
A particular
conception of God has

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:12.110 align:middle line:84%
died in the sense of
becoming implausible.

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And I find this a
very good thing.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:21.210 align:middle line:84%
Because, well, it's a
principle of Jewish theology

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:26.500 align:middle line:84%
and later of Christian
theology that it is always

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:30.424 align:middle line:84%
a mistake, even a sin, if
you want to call it that--

00:13:30.424 --> 00:13:32.090 align:middle line:84%
and I want to interpolate
something here

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:35.450 align:middle line:84%
as to the exact
meaning of a sin.

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:38.630 align:middle line:84%
The Greek word in the
New Testament for a sin

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:41.090 align:middle line:90%
is hamartanein.

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And that means to miss the
point, or, as in archery,

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.530 align:middle line:90%
to miss the mark.

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, from the
Mosaic Ten Commandments

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:56.840 align:middle line:84%
comes the idea that it is
a sin-- that is to say,

00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:03.340 align:middle line:84%
a missing of the point-- to
substitute an idol for God.

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:07.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, the picture I just showed
you, as I said, is an idol.

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:11.280 align:middle line:84%
But those primitive
Mexicans, even they

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:16.230 align:middle line:84%
don't seriously confuse that
particular image with God.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:17.880 align:middle line:84%
The danger of it
is, of course, is

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.760 align:middle line:84%
they may think of
God as something

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.700 align:middle line:90%
like that their mind's eye.

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.980 align:middle line:84%
They may think of God
in the form of man.

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:26.490 align:middle line:90%


00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:29.650 align:middle line:84%
But the images
that have been made

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:34.760 align:middle line:84%
of God or of the gods out of
wood and stone and in painting,

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:38.820 align:middle line:84%
have never really been taken
seriously as actually what

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:39.730 align:middle line:90%
God is like.

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And nobody has confused
the actual image, say,

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:46.630 align:middle line:84%
of a Buddha such as you saw at
the beginning of this program.

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Buddha is, of course,
never identified with a god

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:53.860 align:middle line:90%
because Buddha is a human being.

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:57.160 align:middle line:84%
But these images are
never seriously confused

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.620 align:middle line:84%
with what they represent any
more than a Catholic confuses

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:05.200 align:middle line:90%
a crucifix with Jesus Christ.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:10.180 align:middle line:84%
So the images that are
pictures, statues, and so forth,

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.450 align:middle line:90%
are not really very dangerous.

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:15.700 align:middle line:84%
The dangerous images
of God are those

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:19.420 align:middle line:84%
that we make, not out
of wood and stone,

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:23.780 align:middle line:90%
but out of ideas and concepts.

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:27.710 align:middle line:90%
You see, an idea is abstract.

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:31.220 align:middle line:84%
So St. Thomas
Aquinas, for example,

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:40.020 align:middle line:84%
defined "god" as "necessary
being, he who is necessarily."

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:43.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, that is a
philosophical concept.

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.340 align:middle line:90%
God is being.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:51.830 align:middle line:84%
But that concept is
an idol, because it

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:55.650 align:middle line:90%
confuses God with an idea.

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And because an idea
is abstract, it

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:02.420 align:middle line:84%
seems something very
much more spiritual

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:06.110 align:middle line:84%
than an image made
of wood or stone.

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's just precisely
where it becomes deceptive.

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:12.780 align:middle line:90%


00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, many people
think that the Bible

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:22.360 align:middle line:90%
is the authentic word of God.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, they worship the
Bible and make it into an idol,

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:34.940 align:middle line:84%
disregarding the
ironical remark of Jesus

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:39.390 align:middle line:84%
to his contemporary Jews, "You
search the scriptures daily,

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:43.780 align:middle line:84%
for in them you
think you have life."

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And as St. Paul said
later, "The letter kills,

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:50.390 align:middle line:90%
but the spirit gives life."

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And so whatever you put
as an image or an idea

00:16:54.920 --> 00:17:00.790 align:middle line:84%
in the place of God,
necessarily falsifies God.

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:04.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of
people say, I don't

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:07.210 align:middle line:84%
think I could face
in life, I don't

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:10.240 align:middle line:84%
think I could face
life unless I could

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.900 align:middle line:84%
believe in a just
and loving god.

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:17.010 align:middle line:90%


00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:21.790 align:middle line:84%
It strikes me that that
kind of belief in God

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:25.839 align:middle line:90%
is actually a lack of faith.

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:28.720 align:middle line:84%
You see, the word
"belief" in Anglo-Saxon

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.890 align:middle line:84%
comes from this
Anglo-Saxon root, "lief."

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:33.200 align:middle line:90%
I would as lief.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.110 align:middle line:90%
And "lief" means to wish.

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:40.720 align:middle line:84%
So "belief" really
means a strong wish.

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.260 align:middle line:84%
When you get up
and say the creed,

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:43.949 align:middle line:84%
"I believe in God,
the Father Almighty,

00:17:43.949 --> 00:17:45.740 align:middle line:84%
maker of Heaven and
Earth and of all things

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:50.550 align:middle line:84%
visible and invisible,"
you are really saying,

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:53.270 align:middle line:84%
I fervently wish
that there exists

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:55.800 align:middle line:84%
a God, the Father Almighty,
creator of Heaven and Earth,

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:56.400 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.930 align:middle line:90%


00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:07.000 align:middle line:84%
Because if you really have
faith, you don't need belief.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.190 align:middle line:84%
Because faith is an entirely
different attitude from belief.

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:14.800 align:middle line:84%
Faith is a state of
openness or trust.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:20.940 align:middle line:84%
To have faith is, for
example, like when you swim.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.610 align:middle line:90%
You trust yourself to the water.

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:25.840 align:middle line:84%
You don't grab hold of
the water when you swim.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And if you go stiff
and tight in the water

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:30.460 align:middle line:84%
and try to catch hold
of it, you'll sink.

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:31.210 align:middle line:90%
You have to relax.

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:33.970 align:middle line:90%


00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:37.760 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way, when
a cat falls off a tree,

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:41.250 align:middle line:84%
the cat doesn't go stiff all
over in a state of tension,

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:43.010 align:middle line:84%
that is to say, a
state of holding on.

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:45.210 align:middle line:90%
The cat relaxes.

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:50.040 align:middle line:84%
It falls heavily, thumps
the ground with its tail,

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.630 align:middle line:84%
and isn't hurt
because it relaxed.

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:57.720 align:middle line:84%
So the attitude of faith is
the very opposite of clinging,

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.780 align:middle line:90%
of holding on.

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:02.210 align:middle line:84%
So that you could
say that a person who

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:06.300 align:middle line:84%
is a fanatic in religion,
who simply has to believe

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:09.174 align:middle line:84%
in certain propositions
about the nature of God

00:19:09.174 --> 00:19:10.590 align:middle line:84%
and the nature of
the universe, is

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:13.140 align:middle line:84%
a person who has
no faith at all.

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:16.160 align:middle line:90%
Because he's holding on tight.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And so when we sing hymns like
"Rock of ages cleft for me,

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:23.670 align:middle line:84%
let me hide myself in thee,"
these aren't hymns of faith.

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Or even Luther made such
a thing about faith.

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:30.510 align:middle line:84%
But he wrote of
a hymn in German,

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:33.190 align:middle line:90%
"Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott."

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:35.850 align:middle line:90%
A mighty fortress is our God.

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:37.360 align:middle line:90%
That's not a hymn of faith.

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.110 align:middle line:84%
A person of faith
doesn't need a fortress.

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:41.900 align:middle line:90%


00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:43.080 align:middle line:90%
He's not on the defensive.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And so in the same
way, when churches

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:48.626 align:middle line:84%
are designed like the
royal courts of kings,

00:19:48.626 --> 00:19:51.780 align:middle line:84%
you know, in the royal court,
the king sits with his back

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.310 align:middle line:84%
to the wall, which
is the position,

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:57.760 align:middle line:84%
or used to be the
position, of the altar.

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And around him he would have
his courtiers and guards.

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And their place, of course,
in the church design,

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:10.380 align:middle line:84%
called a basilica, which means
the court of a basilus, a king.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And the bishop sits at
the back in his throne,

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:15.390 align:middle line:84%
and all his attendant
clergy stand around him

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:17.190 align:middle line:84%
like his guards
in a royal court.

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:18.520 align:middle line:90%
Well, why is this?

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.410 align:middle line:84%
A king stands with
his back to the wall

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:25.350 align:middle line:90%
because he rules by force.

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And when his subjects and
his courtiers approach him,

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:30.620 align:middle line:90%
they prostrate themselves.

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:31.820 align:middle line:90%
They kneel down.

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:32.470 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:34.090 align:middle line:84%
Because that's a
difficult position

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:35.400 align:middle line:90%
from which to start a fight.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:39.510 align:middle line:90%


00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And so are we projecting the
image of a frightened king

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:49.950 align:middle line:84%
upon the ground of
being, the godhead?

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:52.120 align:middle line:90%
We are, you see.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.500 align:middle line:84%
Or in a Protestant
church, the furniture

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.290 align:middle line:90%
all looks like a courthouse.

00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:59.660 align:middle line:90%
The minister wears a black gown.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same back
gown as is worn by a judge.

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And there are pews
and pulpits and all

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:10.070 align:middle line:84%
the familiar wooden
boxes of court furniture.

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And the minister, like the
judge, throws the book at you.

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:19.545 align:middle line:84%
He preaches the law laid
down in that other idol

00:21:19.545 --> 00:21:20.310 align:middle line:90%
of God, the Bible.

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:23.960 align:middle line:90%


00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:26.170 align:middle line:90%
But does God need all that?

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:32.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is God somebody who
takes this aggressive attitude

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:35.170 align:middle line:84%
either of the king in the court
where all the subjects must

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:38.050 align:middle line:84%
prostrate, or of the
judge who bangs the gavel

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:41.470 align:middle line:84%
and says bah, bah,
bah, bah, bah?

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:44.570 align:middle line:90%
This is ridiculous.

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And a god so
conceived is an idol

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:50.130 align:middle line:84%
and manifests the absence
of faith of all those

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:51.160 align:middle line:90%
that worship him.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.300 align:middle line:84%
Because they have no
attitude of trust.

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:57.690 align:middle line:84%
They cling onto these
rules, to these conceptions,

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:01.010 align:middle line:84%
and have no fundamental
give to life.

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:05.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, in a certain way you might
say that a good scientist has

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:07.690 align:middle line:84%
more faith than a
religious person.

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:10.720 align:middle line:84%
Because a good
scientist says, I want

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.650 align:middle line:90%
to find out what is the case.

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:15.980 align:middle line:84%
My mind is open to
the truth, whatever

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.880 align:middle line:90%
that truth may turn out to be.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.690 align:middle line:90%
I have no preconceptions.

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:22.670 align:middle line:90%
I may have some hypotheses.

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:24.560 align:middle line:84%
I may have some
notions in my mind

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:29.340 align:middle line:84%
as to what the truth might
be, but I'm going to test it.

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And the test is-- I will
open all my senses to reality

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:37.740 align:middle line:84%
and find out what
that reality is.

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:42.390 align:middle line:84%
But then again, the scientist
runs into a problem.

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Because he knows that whatever
comes to him as reality

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:54.760 align:middle line:84%
depends on the structure
of his instruments

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:57.900 align:middle line:84%
and the structure of his
senses, and behind the structure

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:02.044 align:middle line:84%
of his senses, the
structure of his brain.

00:23:02.044 --> 00:23:02.835 align:middle line:90%
And that's himself.

00:23:02.835 --> 00:23:05.380 align:middle line:90%


00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:08.580 align:middle line:84%
So he has to have, back of
all that, an act of faith

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:12.120 align:middle line:84%
in his own brain, an
act of faith in himself,

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:15.690 align:middle line:84%
that his physical
organism or his mind

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:20.270 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you want to call
it, is indeed reliable and will

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:25.930 align:middle line:84%
show him reality,
truth, what is.

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:30.870 align:middle line:84%
So unless there is a basic
and primordial act of faith

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:34.510 align:middle line:84%
in yourself-- and you can't
ultimately check on yourself.

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:38.010 align:middle line:90%
You have to believe your senses.

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:41.940 align:middle line:84%
You have to believe your reason,
your logic, your intelligence.

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:43.392 align:middle line:84%
So you have to
have faith in that,

00:23:43.392 --> 00:23:44.600 align:middle line:90%
even though you can check it.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not like
your mind's a radio

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:49.390 align:middle line:84%
and you can go in and
screw in a connection

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:51.970 align:middle line:84%
here and fix up another
connection there and so

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:55.160 align:middle line:90%
be quite sure.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:58.450 align:middle line:90%
You always have to trust.

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And behind all that, you
see, behind the brain,

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:08.060 align:middle line:84%
just as I've shown you
before, behind your eyes,

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:13.840 align:middle line:84%
there's the blank space,
the unknown, the unseen.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, one could say
that the highest image of God,

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:27.720 align:middle line:84%
which is the unseen
behind the eyes,

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:32.190 align:middle line:84%
the intangible and invisible,
which is space, out of which

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:38.560 align:middle line:84%
come all the stars, we
can say yes, that is God.

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:41.590 align:middle line:90%
But we have no image of that.

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:45.005 align:middle line:90%
We do not know what that is.

00:24:45.005 --> 00:24:48.100 align:middle line:90%


00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.102 align:middle line:90%
But we have to trust it.

00:24:50.102 --> 00:24:51.060 align:middle line:90%
There's no alternative.

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:51.780 align:middle line:90%
There's no way out.

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:52.904 align:middle line:90%
You can't help trusting it.

00:24:52.904 --> 00:24:53.695 align:middle line:90%
You've got to.

00:24:53.695 --> 00:24:57.810 align:middle line:90%


00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:04.600 align:middle line:84%
But you see, that trust in a god
whom one cannot conceive in any

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:10.350 align:middle line:84%
way is a far higher form of
faith than fervent clinging

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:15.430 align:middle line:84%
to a god of whom you have
a definite conception.

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And that conception
can easily be wrong.

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And even if it's
right, clinging to it

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:22.860 align:middle line:90%
would be the wrong attitude.

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:25.650 align:middle line:84%
Because when you love
someone very much,

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:28.940 align:middle line:90%
you shouldn't cling to them.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:32.702 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to hug my wife so
tightly that I strangle her.

00:25:32.702 --> 00:25:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And mothers shouldn't
love their children

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:36.580 align:middle line:84%
so much that they strangle
them by smother love.

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:39.400 align:middle line:90%


00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.960 align:middle line:84%
It comes out in the story
in the New Testament

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:46.360 align:middle line:84%
when Mary Magdalene, who
loved Jesus very much,

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:49.730 align:middle line:84%
she's said to have seen
him after his resurrection.

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And she immediately
ran to cling to him.

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.270 align:middle line:90%
And he said, do not cling to me.

00:25:56.270 --> 00:26:00.150 align:middle line:84%
It's translated in the King
James Bible, do not touch me.

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:04.890 align:middle line:84%
But the Greek word,
haptein, means to cling to.

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:06.520 align:middle line:90%
Don't cling to me.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Don't cling to
anything of the spirit.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:12.310 align:middle line:84%
Is just like, don't
cling to water.

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:14.440 align:middle line:84%
Because the more you
grab it, the faster it'll

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:15.750 align:middle line:90%
slip through your fingers.

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:16.880 align:middle line:90%
Don't cling to your breath.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:20.780 align:middle line:84%
If I breathe in, and
hold it, and say,

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:22.020 align:middle line:90%
oh, I got this breath now.

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:24.228 align:middle line:84%
Better hang onto it because
breath is life, you know.

00:26:24.228 --> 00:26:26.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go purple
in the face and strangle.

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:27.990 align:middle line:90%
You have to let it go.

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:29.500 align:middle line:90%
You let your breath out.

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:33.350 align:middle line:84%
That's the act of
faith, to breathe out.

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:34.410 align:middle line:90%
It'll come back.

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the Buddhist word
"nirvana" means breathe out.

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:44.400 align:middle line:84%
Because letting go is the
fundamental attitude of faith.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:50.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, it isn't as if Christians
haven't been aware of this.

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:56.250 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
fundamental source books

00:26:56.250 --> 00:27:01.030 align:middle line:84%
of Christian
spirituality was written,

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:03.540 align:middle line:84%
oh, somewhere in
the fifth century,

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:06.970 align:middle line:84%
maybe the sixth century,
by a Syrian monk who

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:09.370 align:middle line:90%
gave himself the name Dionysius.

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:12.580 align:middle line:84%
I've recently
translated this book.

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:18.340 align:middle line:84%
It's called "Theologia
Mystica," "Mystical Theology."

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And you can get it from
your paperback bookstore.

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:23.450 align:middle line:90%


00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:28.000 align:middle line:84%
This book is a very
strange document

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:35.280 align:middle line:84%
because it explains that
the highest knowledge of God

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:39.490 align:middle line:84%
is through what he calls
in Greek "agnozia,"

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:42.540 align:middle line:90%
which means unknowing.

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:48.910 align:middle line:84%
He says that one knows
God most profoundly

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:54.150 align:middle line:84%
and most truly in
not knowing God.

00:27:54.150 --> 00:28:00.130 align:middle line:84%
That means, just in the same
way as your sight comes out

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:05.990 align:middle line:84%
of an unseen, so, when you
know that you don't know,

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:07.340 align:middle line:90%
you really know.

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:10.210 align:middle line:84%
You really know because
knowing that you don't know

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:15.210 align:middle line:84%
is a state of mind in which
you have let go of your efforts

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:17.560 align:middle line:84%
to grasp hold of life
with your intellect.
