00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>>Tonight I want to tell you
three fantasies, all of which

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.380 align:middle line:90%
have something in common.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.470 align:middle line:84%
The first fantasy is
about reproduction.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.990 align:middle line:84%
We use the word reproduction
in two principal ways--

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.510 align:middle line:84%
when we talk about the
biological reproduction

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.810 align:middle line:84%
of the species, and when
we talk about making

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.970 align:middle line:84%
a good reproduction
of something,

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.990 align:middle line:84%
in terms of a painting, a
photograph, or a recording,

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.951 align:middle line:90%
or a video tape.

00:00:44.951 --> 00:00:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And what is all this about--
reproduction in that direction?

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.570 align:middle line:90%


00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.480 align:middle line:84%
Hundreds of years
ago, kings of Europe

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.740 align:middle line:84%
who wanted to form feudal
alliances by marrying

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.800 align:middle line:84%
the princesses of
far-off states would

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.490 align:middle line:84%
have painters send portraits
of the lady in question

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.050 align:middle line:84%
to see if his majesty approved
of her before he got her.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And there's a famous story in
which Henry VIII of England

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.070 align:middle line:84%
was badly cheated
in this respect

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.750 align:middle line:84%
by a too-flattering
portrait of Ann of Cleves.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, there
grew up a kind of morale

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.920 align:middle line:84%
among artists in the
European tradition

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.760 align:middle line:84%
to make faithful
reproductions of people.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And they perfected
their technique,

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.410 align:middle line:84%
beginning with the marvelous
work of the Renaissance

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.190 align:middle line:84%
painters, and the
Flemish painters,

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.830 align:middle line:84%
and going on finally
to what was called

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.610 align:middle line:84%
Art Officiale in
the 19th century,

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.330 align:middle line:84%
we got what we now call
photographic realism.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.700 align:middle line:84%
But then they said, isn't
there some more scientific way

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.850 align:middle line:90%
of doing this?

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And so they
discovered the camera.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And first of all, remember
those brownish daguerreotypes.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And people said,
well that is pretty.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.919 align:middle line:84%
It really looks like
grandpa, doesn't it?

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And then they said, but
there's several things missing.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.484 align:middle line:90%
It isn't colored.

00:02:14.484 --> 00:02:15.900 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
they tinted them.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.490 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.419 align:middle line:84%
And then they said well,
it's real lifelike.

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:24.210 align:middle line:84%
But then they went on
to say but, you know,

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.410 align:middle line:84%
there are some people whose
whole style of life, whose

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.490 align:middle line:84%
personality, is in
the way they move.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And if you just take a
static shot like that,

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.610 align:middle line:90%
the personality isn't there.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.250 align:middle line:90%
It's the way they go.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.580 align:middle line:84%
So we said we got to have some
way of making people move.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.550 align:middle line:90%


00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.550 align:middle line:90%
So they invented the movies.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when the
first movies came out.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.640 align:middle line:90%
They were all going dadadada.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.187 align:middle line:90%
Everybody was in a jerky way.

00:02:58.187 --> 00:02:59.270 align:middle line:90%
Then they smoothed it out.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
that's real lifelike.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.490 align:middle line:84%
But they said then, but
there's another thing

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.690 align:middle line:84%
about reproducing people,
which is that they talk.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.560 align:middle line:84%
A whole lot of their
personality is in the voice.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.247 align:middle line:84%
So can't we have them talking
at the same time that they move?

00:03:18.247 --> 00:03:19.455 align:middle line:90%
So they invented the talkies.

00:03:19.455 --> 00:03:21.990 align:middle line:90%


00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And then to get it more lifelike
still, they colored them.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.820 align:middle line:84%
They said, wow, now we're
really getting somewhere.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.540 align:middle line:90%


00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.520 align:middle line:84%
Then to make it even more
real, they put it in 3D,

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.570 align:middle line:84%
only you had to wear
sort of spectacles

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.070 align:middle line:84%
over your face to
see it that way.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.610 align:middle line:84%
But then they went on to say,
why is it that every time we

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.068 align:middle line:84%
want to see one of
these things, we

00:03:47.068 --> 00:03:49.750 align:middle line:84%
have to go down to
the center of town?

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.540 align:middle line:90%
Can't we have it all at home?

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.840 align:middle line:90%
And so television came on.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.726 align:middle line:84%
And in television,
they first of all

00:03:56.726 --> 00:03:58.100 align:middle line:84%
started out with
black and white,

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.640 align:middle line:84%
and it was kind of, like
Robert Benchley once

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.240 align:middle line:84%
described the cuts
in French newspapers

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.880 align:middle line:84%
as all looking as if
they'd been made on bread.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was television
in a certain period.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.080 align:middle line:90%
And then they improved it.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.230 align:middle line:90%
And then they colored it.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we are now--
not quite, because somebody

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.790 align:middle line:84%
has come out with the thing that
we shall all be seeing soon,

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.310 align:middle line:84%
which is the hologram-- a
television image produced

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.340 align:middle line:84%
by laser beams, where you see
a three-dimensional figure out

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.030 align:middle line:90%
in the air in front of you.

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.722 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that marvelous?

00:04:35.722 --> 00:04:39.200 align:middle line:90%


00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.567 align:middle line:84%
And then, but of course,
when you go up to it,

00:04:41.567 --> 00:04:43.150 align:middle line:84%
and you put your
hand on it, your hand

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.730 align:middle line:90%
goes right through it.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.750 align:middle line:90%
You can't touch it.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And you see, that was always
the trouble with television,

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.510 align:middle line:84%
because you look at whatever
you're seeing behind a screen.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.740 align:middle line:90%
It's intangible.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.370 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't smell, and
it won't relate to you.

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.550 align:middle line:84%
So these are further
problems to be

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.550 align:middle line:84%
solved in the techniques
of electronic reproduction.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.790 align:middle line:90%
And they'll do it.

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.280 align:middle line:84%
They'll first of
all manage a way

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:18.060 align:middle line:84%
in which the electronic emission
sources can solidify, and make

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.310 align:middle line:84%
the air vibrate, so that you
go up and you touch the figure,

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.260 align:middle line:84%
and you won't be able to
push your hand through it,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.665 align:middle line:84%
because the air will be
going faster than your hand.

00:05:28.665 --> 00:05:32.820 align:middle line:90%


00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.360 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that-- you can
actually, if there's

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.520 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful dancer
on the television,

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.720 align:middle line:84%
you'll be able to go
up and embrace her,

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.230 align:middle line:84%
but she won't know you're there,
and she won't respond to you.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And you'll say, well that's
not very lifelike, just as they

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.700 align:middle line:84%
once said, "If the
photograph doesn't move,

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:50.900 align:middle line:90%
it's not very lifelike.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.220 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't talk,
it's not very lifelike."

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.900 align:middle line:84%
They'll next say, "If the
reproduction in three dimension

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.090 align:middle line:84%
solid doesn't respond,
it's not very lifelike."

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.810 align:middle line:84%
So they'll have to figure out
a technique for doing that.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:03.870 align:middle line:90%
What will they do?

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.360 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.960 align:middle line:84%
Sitting in your
home, where you're

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.470 align:middle line:84%
watching the scene on a kind
of stage now, not on a screen,

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.510 align:middle line:84%
there'll be a TV
camera observing you.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And that TV camera
will report back

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.410 align:middle line:84%
everything you do
into a computer.

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And the computer will so manage
each bit of information--

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:34.420 align:middle line:84%
that's to say, each tiny, little
granule unit of information

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.560 align:middle line:84%
going into the image
that you're looking at,

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.350 align:middle line:84%
that it will
immediately decide what

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.335 align:middle line:84%
is the appropriate
response to the approach

00:06:42.335 --> 00:06:45.832 align:middle line:84%
that you are making
to the image.

00:06:45.832 --> 00:06:46.665 align:middle line:90%
Won't that be great?

00:06:46.665 --> 00:06:49.180 align:middle line:90%


00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:54.210 align:middle line:84%
She may slap you in the
face, and she may kiss you.

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:55.970 align:middle line:90%
You never know.

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.020 align:middle line:84%
But then, they'll say now, this
is still not really the kind

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.300 align:middle line:90%
of reproduction we wanted.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.160 align:middle line:84%
What we wanted when
we looked at the scene

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.310 align:middle line:84%
is to be able to identify
with one of the characters.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.460 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to not just
watch the drama that's

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.460 align:middle line:84%
being performed on the
stage in front of us,

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.770 align:middle line:90%
but actually get into it.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And so we want to be wired in
with electrodes on the brain,

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.270 align:middle line:84%
so that we will actually
feel the emotions

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:26.590 align:middle line:84%
of the people
acting on the stage.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And so eventually, we will
get absolutely perfect

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.510 align:middle line:90%
reproduction.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And we will be able
to see that image

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:39.710 align:middle line:84%
so vividly that we
shall become it.

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And so the question
arises-- could that

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:45.450 align:middle line:90%
be where we are already?

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:49.380 align:middle line:90%


00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Are we a reproduction which
over the centuries of evolution

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:57.725 align:middle line:84%
has worked out to be a
replica of something else that

00:07:57.725 --> 00:08:01.310 align:middle line:84%
was going on, and we are
where we always were?

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:04.780 align:middle line:90%


00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:13.480 align:middle line:84%
Now the next fantasy
concerns the idea

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.120 align:middle line:84%
that every living being
thinks it's human.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.670 align:middle line:90%


00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And that means a plant, a worm,
a virus, a bacterium, a fruit

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:34.010 align:middle line:84%
fly, a hippopotamus,
a giraffe, a rabbit--

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:38.120 align:middle line:84%
that all these beings,
wherever they feel out from,

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.740 align:middle line:84%
as we feel out from
our bodies, feel

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.750 align:middle line:90%
that they're in the middle.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:46.410 align:middle line:84%
That is to say
wherever you look,

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:48.064 align:middle line:84%
you turn your head
around, and you

00:08:48.064 --> 00:08:49.730 align:middle line:84%
feel you are in the
middle of the world.

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:52.070 align:middle line:90%
You feel you're the center.

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And a rabbit or a fruit fly
feels that it is a center.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And it has around it a company
of associates who look like it.

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And therefore,
this creature knows

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.467 align:middle line:84%
that these are the
right people, just

00:09:07.467 --> 00:09:09.300 align:middle line:84%
as we know when we look
at human beings they

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.850 align:middle line:90%
are the right people.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:12.740 align:middle line:90%
They are one of us.

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.780 align:middle line:84%
Only of course, we have
to make distinctions,

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:19.000 align:middle line:84%
because you never really
know that you are you,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.570 align:middle line:84%
and you are really in the right
place, unless you can contrast

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:25.460 align:middle line:84%
yourself with some other
people who are, after all, not

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:27.940 align:middle line:84%
quite in the right place,
and some other people who

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:30.260 align:middle line:84%
are very much in
the wrong place.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And then through having this
succession of comparisons,

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.290 align:middle line:90%
you know that you're OK.

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:38.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, the insect has exactly
the same arrangement.

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, you say, well,
insects and things

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.520 align:middle line:84%
like fishes-- they
don't have any culture.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.370 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean, fishes being
civilized, and being entitled

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:50.800 align:middle line:84%
to consider
themselves as humans?

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Well let me put the argument
from the fish's point of view.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:57.700 align:middle line:84%
Fishes say human
beings are a mess.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.560 align:middle line:90%
Look what they do.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:03.400 align:middle line:84%
They can't exist without
cluttering themselves,

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:07.460 align:middle line:84%
and carrying around all kinds
of things outside their bodies.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:14.370 align:middle line:84%
They have to have houses, and
automobiles, and books, books

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:19.410 align:middle line:84%
and records, and television,
and hi-fi equipment, and stuff--

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:20.770 align:middle line:90%
endless stuff.

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And they litter the
earth with rubbish.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:24.980 align:middle line:90%
Think of a dolphin.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.650 align:middle line:84%
He isn't really a
fish because a dolphin

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:28.540 align:middle line:84%
is a mammal-- but a
dolphin's point of view

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.460 align:middle line:90%
towards the human race.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.480 align:middle line:84%
Dolphins spend most
of their time playing.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:36.600 align:middle line:84%
They don't work, because
the grocery is right there

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.830 align:middle line:84%
in the ocean,
whatever they need.

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And so a dolphin will catch
up with a seagoing liner,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.150 align:middle line:84%
and it'll get on the
wake of the liner,

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:51.150 align:middle line:84%
and put its tail at an
exact angle of 26 degrees.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And in so doing, the liner
will carry the dolphin along.

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:56.790 align:middle line:84%
The dolphin will make
circles around the liner

00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:01.600 align:middle line:84%
just for fun, playing all
its life in the water.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And we know that a
dolphin's brain is as big,

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.170 align:middle line:84%
if not bigger than ours, that
it is incredibly intelligent,

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:11.340 align:middle line:84%
that it has a language
which we can't decipher.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And the person who knows most
about dolphins in the United

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:16.530 align:middle line:84%
States, Doctor John Lilly,
is a friend of mine.

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And he said he came
to the conclusion

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:22.385 align:middle line:84%
that dolphins were too smart
to tell us their language.

00:11:22.385 --> 00:11:25.830 align:middle line:90%


00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:28.600 align:middle line:90%
So he abandoned this project.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.690 align:middle line:84%
He said he would no longer keep
such a highly civilized being

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:33.630 align:middle line:84%
in the concentration
camp of a zoo,

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:37.170 align:middle line:84%
and that it should
go back to the ocean.

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:41.310 align:middle line:84%
So the point is, though, that
every-- not only dolphins,

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:45.260 align:middle line:84%
but every organism that
has any sensitivity in it

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:51.070 align:middle line:84%
whatsoever considers itself to
be the center of the universe.

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:52.110 align:middle line:90%
Now it has its problems.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:54.790 align:middle line:90%


00:11:54.790 --> 00:12:00.170 align:middle line:84%
There's a zen poem which
says, "The morning glory which

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:04.560 align:middle line:84%
blooms for an hour differs not
at heart from a giant pine that

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:10.470 align:middle line:90%
lives for 1,000 years."

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:17.970 align:middle line:84%
In other words, an hour is a
long life to a morning glory.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:21.970 align:middle line:84%
1,000 years is a
long life to a pine.

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And our four score years
and ten, or as the insurance

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:30.230 align:middle line:84%
companies actuarial tables
put it, somewhere between 65

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:32.710 align:middle line:84%
and 70 years is an
average human life,

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:35.320 align:middle line:84%
seems about the
right length of life.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:39.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are people
who want to go on and on,

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:43.740 align:middle line:84%
and are in quest of immortality,
and have their bodies frozen

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.490 align:middle line:84%
in case there should
develop in the future

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:49.410 align:middle line:84%
some technique by which
they could be revived.

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:53.370 align:middle line:84%
But I really don't
go for that idea,

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:59.110 align:middle line:84%
because nature has
mercifully arranged

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:01.530 align:middle line:84%
the principle of
forgettery as well

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:02.670 align:middle line:90%
as the principle of memory.

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:05.670 align:middle line:90%


00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:08.790 align:middle line:84%
If you always, and always, and
always remembered everything,

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:11.780 align:middle line:84%
you see, you would it be
like a piece of paper which

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.520 align:middle line:84%
had been painted over, and
painted over, and painted over,

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.330 align:middle line:84%
until there was no
space left, and you

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.077 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't be able to distinguish
between one thing and another.

00:13:19.077 --> 00:13:20.660 align:middle line:84%
It's like when a
whole bunch of people

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.830 align:middle line:84%
start to scream, and make
noises, and out-scream

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:24.330 align:middle line:90%
each other.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.380 align:middle line:90%
And soon you can hear nobody.

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:32.140 align:middle line:84%
So in that way, one's
memories become screams.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:35.325 align:middle line:84%
And nature mercifully arranges
that the whole thing be erased,

00:13:35.325 --> 00:13:38.230 align:middle line:90%
and you begin again.

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:41.550 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter in what form
you begin, whether you begin

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:45.840 align:middle line:84%
again as a human
being, or as a fruit

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:50.490 align:middle line:84%
fly, a butterfly, or
a beetle, or a bird.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:52.780 align:middle line:84%
It feels the same way
that you feel now.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:55.790 align:middle line:90%


00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:58.530 align:middle line:84%
So we're really all
in the same place.

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And we all have above us things
much higher than ourselves.

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And we all have below
us things that we

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.612 align:middle line:84%
feel are much lower
than ourselves,

00:14:08.612 --> 00:14:10.570 align:middle line:84%
just as there are things
out there on the left,

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:13.050 align:middle line:84%
and things out there on the
right, and things in front,

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:16.284 align:middle line:84%
and things behind,
because you're the middle.

00:14:16.284 --> 00:14:17.825 align:middle line:84%
You're the middle
everywhere, always.

00:14:17.825 --> 00:14:24.530 align:middle line:90%


00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Now my third fantasy--
nobody has, it seems to me,

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:37.080 align:middle line:84%
really seriously asked the
question, how do stars begin?

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:43.710 align:middle line:84%
Why, how out of space do these
enormous radioactive centers

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:44.210 align:middle line:90%
arise?

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:47.610 align:middle line:90%


00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:51.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm going to
solve this problem

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:54.450 align:middle line:84%
on the principle of
the egg and the hen,

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:58.090 align:middle line:84%
because it is said a
chicken is one egg's

00:14:58.090 --> 00:14:59.820 align:middle line:90%
way of becoming other eggs.

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:03.230 align:middle line:90%


00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you've understood
my second fantasy,

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.740 align:middle line:84%
you will see how
that could be true.

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:14.730 align:middle line:84%
Now let's suppose
then that a planet

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:17.430 align:middle line:84%
is one star's way of
becoming another star.

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:20.930 align:middle line:90%


00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:25.020 align:middle line:84%
Stars, when they explode,
they send a lot of goo

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.430 align:middle line:90%
out into space.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And some of this goo solidifies
into balls, which get in orbit,

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.420 align:middle line:90%
and spin around the star.

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And in one chance in 1,000,
maybe, one of those balls

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:40.250 align:middle line:84%
will become like
the planet Earth.

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And slowly upon it will
arise what some people might

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:47.930 align:middle line:84%
call a disease, called the
bacteria of intelligent life.

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.610 align:middle line:90%


00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And they have a notion, these
things that we call alive,

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:57.090 align:middle line:90%
that they ought to go on.

00:15:57.090 --> 00:16:01.050 align:middle line:84%
They have a fixed
idea in their heads

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:04.270 align:middle line:84%
that they should keep on doing
whatever it is they're doing,

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:07.400 align:middle line:84%
and they should always
be doing it better.

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.450 align:middle line:84%
So they divide themselves
into different species.

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And these species
compete with each other,

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:15.240 align:middle line:84%
in order to, as it were,
flex their muscles,

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.710 align:middle line:84%
and get better and better
at whatever it is they are.

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And they go on doing this until
one species really establishes

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:26.310 align:middle line:84%
itself as top species
in the particular area

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:31.570 align:middle line:84%
on the particular planet, as
we human beings, Homo sapiens,

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:34.170 align:middle line:84%
have established
ourselves as top species

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:38.040 align:middle line:90%
on Earth-- whatever top means.

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.810 align:middle line:84%
Well then, when we
have a little leisure

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:43.240 align:middle line:84%
and don't have to spend
all our time finding food

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:47.730 align:middle line:84%
to put into our mouths,
we start asking questions.

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And we look around at
each other and everything,

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.730 align:middle line:90%
and say what is this?

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:55.780 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what's going on here?

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, some people say, that's
a stupid question to ask.

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:00.090 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you just go
on doing your work?

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:03.490 align:middle line:84%
Go hunting, go farming,
go doing your business.

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:06.180 align:middle line:84%
They say, "No, there
are higher things."

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:09.980 align:middle line:84%
So they create a special class
of people who are in India

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:15.420 align:middle line:84%
called Brahmins, among us--
philosophers, scientists,

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:18.050 align:middle line:90%
theologians, thinkers.

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:20.369 align:middle line:90%
And they go into this question.

00:17:20.369 --> 00:17:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And they're allowed to stop
farming, to stop hunting,

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:29.070 align:middle line:84%
to stop mining, to
stop scrubbing floors,

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:32.290 align:middle line:84%
and to go to very special places
called universities, where they

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:37.340 align:middle line:84%
can sit around and think
about what is going on.

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.740 align:middle line:90%
Now they think about this.

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:42.090 align:middle line:84%
First of all, they do
what they call philosophy,

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:47.260 align:middle line:84%
which is they try to
say what it means.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:48.620 align:middle line:90%
What is the word be?

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.270 align:middle line:90%
What does the word exist mean?

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:53.550 align:middle line:84%
What do we mean when
we say we're here?

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:56.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, they find they can't
discuss that very far,

00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:03.480 align:middle line:84%
because the word stops
meaning anything.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.392 align:middle line:90%
It sort of becomes a noise.

00:18:05.392 --> 00:18:07.600 align:middle line:84%
They say, now, we're not
really getting to the point.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.770 align:middle line:84%
What we've got to do is instead
of thinking all the time,

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:13.930 align:middle line:84%
and just theorizing, and talking
words about what's going on,

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:16.600 align:middle line:84%
we've got to investigate
it experimentally.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.800 align:middle line:84%
We've somehow got to
look into this stuff

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:23.010 align:middle line:84%
that we call reality,
the material world,

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:25.700 align:middle line:90%
and find out what it is.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:28.540 align:middle line:90%
So they start chopping it up.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.920 align:middle line:84%
They go into flowers, and
they chop up the seeds,

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.880 align:middle line:84%
and they look into the
middle of the seeds.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:33.980 align:middle line:84%
They find something
there, and then

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:36.104 align:middle line:84%
have to get a magnifying
glass and look in on that.

00:18:36.104 --> 00:18:39.060 align:middle line:84%
They get smaller, and
smaller, and smaller.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:40.870 align:middle line:84%
They reason they
must eventually come

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:44.140 align:middle line:90%
to some particle called an atom.

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:49.860 align:middle line:84%
In Greek, atom means
atomos, non-cuttable--

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:52.260 align:middle line:84%
what you can't
split any further.

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:56.520 align:middle line:84%
So they come down to the
atomos that than which

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.980 align:middle line:84%
there is no whicher--
they thought.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.160 align:middle line:84%
But then they found they
could split that atom.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:04.100 align:middle line:84%
They could find the electron,
the positron, the meson,

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:06.150 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, et cetera,
et cetera forever.

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:11.800 align:middle line:90%


00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And so they said, well,
this is something.

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:19.720 align:middle line:84%
This is real science,
because we've now found out

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:26.140 align:middle line:84%
that every atomos of matter
contains immense energy,

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.810 align:middle line:84%
and that we could
come to the point

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:33.300 align:middle line:84%
where we could release
the energy in the atom.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And the trouble with
intellectual people

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:40.520 align:middle line:84%
is that anything that
can be done must be done.

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And so eventually, in
the necessary course

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:44.650 align:middle line:84%
of the development
of nature, they

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:47.910 align:middle line:84%
found out how to blow
the Earth to pieces

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:48.910 align:middle line:90%
and turn it into a star.

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:55.150 align:middle line:90%


00:19:55.150 --> 00:20:00.650 align:middle line:84%
So that may be, you see,
how stars originate.

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:05.160 align:middle line:84%
They have planets, like
chickens have eggs.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And the eggs burst and
turn into chickens.

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And planets burst, through the
agency of intelligent life,

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:17.580 align:middle line:84%
and turn into stars, which
throw out other mud balls, some

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:20.040 align:middle line:84%
of which stand a reasonable
chance-- about as

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:23.460 align:middle line:84%
reasonable a chance, as
say, any male spermatozoan

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:27.390 align:middle line:84%
stands when it enters the female
womb, of becoming a baby--

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:30.540 align:middle line:90%
one in a million.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And those spermatozoa are
in exactly the same position

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.750 align:middle line:90%
as the planets and the stars.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:38.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, I tell you,
this is a fantasy.

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:41.830 align:middle line:84%
But you may ask me, isn't it
a rather unpleasant fantasy?

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:45.060 align:middle line:90%


00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:49.120 align:middle line:84%
Aren't things going the wrong
way, the wrong direction?

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:56.060 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if the
whole point of life,

00:20:56.060 --> 00:21:02.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this tender biological
substance with all its tubes

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:06.770 align:middle line:84%
and filaments and nerves, which
are so very sensitive-- if all

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:14.582 align:middle line:84%
this is to end up in fire, into
an absolute blaze of light,

00:21:14.582 --> 00:21:19.980 align:middle line:90%
don't we say, oh, what a shame.

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:21.475 align:middle line:90%
Is that the way it ends?

00:21:21.475 --> 00:21:27.390 align:middle line:90%


00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:31.940 align:middle line:84%
But so many people say that
they want to see the light.

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.050 align:middle line:90%
They want to be enlightened.

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:36.040 align:middle line:84%
They want to dissolve
into the light of God.

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.490 align:middle line:90%


00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And then when they've done
that, all over again the process

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:48.780 align:middle line:84%
goes on, and it blows
out those mud balls.

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:52.510 align:middle line:90%
And here are planets.

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And here, once
again, you're a baby.

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:59.220 align:middle line:90%
You're a child.

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.260 align:middle line:84%
The flowers are
brilliantly colored.

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:04.230 align:middle line:90%
The stars are gorgeous.

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:08.210 align:middle line:84%
The smell of the Earth, the
sound of the rain, everything

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:09.590 align:middle line:90%
is marvelous once again.

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And once again, you see
the other-- the man,

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:21.410 align:middle line:90%
the woman that you love.

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:23.802 align:middle line:84%
As if it had never
happened before,

00:22:23.802 --> 00:22:27.050 align:middle line:90%
it all starts over again.

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And as it goes on, it gets
more and more intense.

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:33.570 align:middle line:84%
All the problems get more
and more problematic.

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And you find you're
wrestling with something

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:38.200 align:middle line:90%
you can't control.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.040 align:middle line:84%
You've got to control
it, but you absolutely

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.810 align:middle line:84%
can't control it,
like all the problems

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:43.520 align:middle line:84%
of the world at
the present time.

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.870 align:middle line:84%
The whole scene is
completely out of hand,

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:50.250 align:middle line:84%
and we feel we're
going to our doom,

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:52.800 align:middle line:84%
because we are going once
again towards the birth

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:55.639 align:middle line:84%
of a star, which is the most
creative thing there is.

00:22:55.639 --> 00:23:00.130 align:middle line:90%


00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:01.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you think
about this for a while,

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:07.760 align:middle line:84%
I've put forward three
fantasies, all of which

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.330 align:middle line:90%
have a cyclic quality.

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:15.690 align:middle line:84%
We reproduce, not
only biologically,

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:19.215 align:middle line:84%
but we reproduce
artistically, technically.

00:23:19.215 --> 00:23:22.212 align:middle line:90%


00:23:22.212 --> 00:23:23.670 align:middle line:84%
So just for a
moment, I want to put

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:25.520 align:middle line:84%
in an aside about
biological reproduction.

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:29.340 align:middle line:90%


00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:34.490 align:middle line:84%
When I think back to my
grandfather, whom I knew fairly

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:38.570 align:middle line:84%
well, he was-- when
I was a little boy,

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:42.300 align:middle line:84%
he was something
extraordinarily impressive.

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:45.080 align:middle line:84%
He looked like King
Edward the seventh.

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:50.880 align:middle line:84%
He was a very, very elegant
man, with a little goatee beard.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:54.844 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have sideburns like
this, and he had shorter hair,

00:23:54.844 --> 00:23:57.010 align:middle line:84%
but he was very elegant
fellow, dressed beautifully.

00:23:57.010 --> 00:24:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And I thought he was
the very image of God.

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And now here I am, the same
age as he was when I first

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:11.190 align:middle line:84%
knew him, and I have
five grandchildren.

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'm no longer
impressed by grandfathers.

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:22.380 align:middle line:90%


00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:23.550 align:middle line:90%
Here I am.

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:26.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm one of them, too.

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
same idea, you see,

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:39.350 align:middle line:84%
of the round, that we are almost
perpetually in the same place.

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:41.770 align:middle line:84%
As the French proverb says,
plus ca change, plus c'est

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:43.830 align:middle line:84%
la meme chose-- the
more it changes,

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:45.180 align:middle line:90%
the more it's the same thing.

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:49.240 align:middle line:90%


00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, that means then,
you see, that existence,

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:03.180 align:middle line:84%
the feeling of being,
is a sort of spectrum,

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:07.325 align:middle line:84%
just as light is at one end red,
and at the other end violet.

00:25:07.325 --> 00:25:10.230 align:middle line:90%


00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
have these extremes

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:17.060 align:middle line:84%
in order to have color at
all, in order to know light.

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:23.330 align:middle line:84%
So you see likewise, we
have to have the experience

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:27.420 align:middle line:84%
that there is somebody else,
something else going on

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:30.200 align:middle line:84%
altogether out of
our control, in order

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.960 align:middle line:84%
to have the experience
of being me.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.760 align:middle line:90%


00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:41.735 align:middle line:84%
And so in order to feel good,
to feel that life is worthwhile,

00:25:41.735 --> 00:25:44.970 align:middle line:84%
that existence is
worth going on with,

00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:46.970 align:middle line:84%
in order to bring out
that feeling, just

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:49.080 align:middle line:84%
as the red brings
out the violet, there

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:52.490 align:middle line:84%
has to be in the back of our
minds, maybe very far away,

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:56.160 align:middle line:84%
the comprehension that there
is something that could happen,

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:59.875 align:middle line:84%
that absolutely mustn't happen,
that is the horrors, that

00:25:59.875 --> 00:26:03.740 align:middle line:84%
is the screaming meemies
at the end of the line.

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:05.590 align:middle line:90%
We have to know that's there.

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:09.280 align:middle line:84%
And every so often,
that has to happen,

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.380 align:middle line:84%
because if there isn't
the experience that we

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:15.980 align:middle line:84%
go through called the screaming
meemies at the end of the line,

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:20.350 align:middle line:84%
where everything has gone
wrong, like just before he died,

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:23.000 align:middle line:84%
the British novelist
Arnold Bennett said,

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:30.620 align:middle line:84%
"I feel somehow that
everything's absolutely wrong."

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:34.940 align:middle line:84%
So the possibility,
even the imagination

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:36.550 align:middle line:84%
that there could be
such an experience

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:40.390 align:middle line:84%
in the back of our
heads is the background

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:42.970 align:middle line:84%
which gives intensity
to the sense

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:48.570 align:middle line:84%
that we call "feeling good,"
feeling that it's all right.

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:49.510 align:middle line:90%
It's all right now.

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:50.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm only bleeding.

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:53.030 align:middle line:90%


00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:59.880 align:middle line:84%
So if you understand
that, you see that really

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:03.330 align:middle line:84%
and truly, you're always
in the same place,

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:07.960 align:middle line:84%
just as every creature
thinks it's a human being.

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And as just every
being turns out

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:14.330 align:middle line:84%
to be a reproduction by
some interesting technology,

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:16.100 align:middle line:84%
whether it's electronic
or biological

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:19.540 align:middle line:90%
makes very little difference.

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And just as it may
be-- I don't know-

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:26.550 align:middle line:84%
planets are stars' ways
of becoming other stars,

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:30.212 align:middle line:84%
and so on, and so
on, but the moral is,

00:27:30.212 --> 00:27:31.545 align:middle line:90%
you're always in the same place.

00:27:31.545 --> 00:27:34.680 align:middle line:90%


00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:35.715 align:middle line:90%
And what is that place?

00:27:35.715 --> 00:27:41.240 align:middle line:90%


00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.960 align:middle line:84%
You can ask yourself
very, very-- I

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:47.080 align:middle line:84%
won't say seriously, because
this isn't really serious, it's

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:53.252 align:middle line:84%
sincere-- ask yourself very
sincerely if that is so,

00:27:53.252 --> 00:27:58.060 align:middle line:84%
if in other words, the
place in which you are now

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:00.450 align:middle line:84%
is the place where
everything and everybody else

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:04.950 align:middle line:84%
really is, only there's an
arrangement to pretend that you

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:11.419 align:middle line:84%
ought to be somewhere else,
so the place where you are

00:28:11.419 --> 00:28:13.210 align:middle line:84%
is the place where
you're always pretending

00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:14.501 align:middle line:90%
you ought to be somewhere else.

00:28:14.501 --> 00:28:17.019 align:middle line:90%


00:28:17.019 --> 00:28:18.310 align:middle line:90%
And this is the nature of life.

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:20.180 align:middle line:90%
This is the pulse.

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:22.470 align:middle line:90%
I ought to be someone else.

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:26.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of a
gazung, like that, see?

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.650 align:middle line:84%
When if you discover that
that's the trick that you're

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:36.620 align:middle line:84%
playing on yourself,
you become serene.

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:39.860 align:middle line:90%


00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And you don't entirely
give up the game,

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:47.320 align:middle line:90%
because you've seen through it.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:52.370 align:middle line:84%
But you say it really might
be fun to go on playing.

00:28:52.370 --> 00:29:19.510 align:middle line:90%
