>>SONJA GRACE: My
name is Sonja Grace.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.420 align:middle line:10%
I'm an author, mystic
healer, and spirit traveler.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.590 align:middle line:10%
My research is I spirit
travel to sacred sites

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.850 align:middle line:10%
all over the world and
uncover who created them,

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.280 align:middle line:10%
who the people were,
what happened there,

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.370 align:middle line:10%
what ceremonies
they did, and what

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.100 align:middle line:10%
messages did they leave for us.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.040 align:middle line:10%
I have four books that
I've published so far.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.880 align:middle line:10%
The most recent and most
relevant is "Spirit Traveler."

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.379 align:middle line:10%
This book is all
about the real truth

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.510 align:middle line:10%
of what happened in history.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.620 align:middle line:84%
We have defined history
through politics and religion

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.860 align:middle line:84%
and whoever is running
the region at the time.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.780 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted the truth.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.950 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to go back in time
and learn what happened,

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.210 align:middle line:84%
who built it, why they built
it, who are the people that

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.880 align:middle line:84%
live there, and what are
the ceremonies and rituals

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.100 align:middle line:90%
that they did at that time.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.760 align:middle line:84%
What I do when I
go to these sites

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.360 align:middle line:84%
is I literally go into
meditation and dissolve.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.080 align:middle line:84%
My whole body
completely dissolves.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.300 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing left.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.590 align:middle line:10%
And my guides then
take me to these sites.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.330 align:middle line:10%
I never travel without them.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.880 align:middle line:10%
It's really my guides
who are helping

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.950 align:middle line:10%
me get to where I'm going.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.420 align:middle line:10%
And actually, they
take me back in time.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.270 align:middle line:10%
So I'm time traveling.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.370 align:middle line:10%
I was born this way.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.180 align:middle line:84%
When I was 12, I had a
really profound experience

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.200 align:middle line:84%
where the entire spirit realm
walked through my bedroom.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And I knew at that point
that I was really different

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.270 align:middle line:84%
from everyone and that
I needed to pursue this.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.120 align:middle line:84%
I was obviously, as a
child, under the direction

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.620 align:middle line:90%
of my parents.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And my mom had put me in
ballet class when I was five.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.890 align:middle line:84%
So I trained as a
classical ballerina.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And I actually danced
professionally for a decade.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And I really found
that although that

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.060 align:middle line:84%
seemed it was taking me off
track from doing healing work,

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.130 align:middle line:90%
it was exactly what I needed.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.070 align:middle line:10%
It grounded me, and
it really taught me

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.260 align:middle line:10%
about defying time and space.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.160 align:middle line:90%


00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.210 align:middle line:84%
Some of the most important
things that I've learned

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.500 align:middle line:90%
is that we are not alone.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.750 align:middle line:84%
We have had help since
the beginning of time.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And what I was shown is
that 12,000 years ago,

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.060 align:middle line:84%
these huge portals opened
up all over the Earth.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.120 align:middle line:84%
Right as the Ice
Age was retreating,

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.820 align:middle line:90%
all of these big portals opened.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.110 align:middle line:84%
We all came through during
Atlantis and Lemuria.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.370 align:middle line:84%
And star beings or
demigods came through.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.280 align:middle line:90%
And they helped define humanity.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.090 align:middle line:84%
There are many alien
groups, extraterrestrials,

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.620 align:middle line:90%
coming through to the planet.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:33.580 align:middle line:90%
Some have bodies.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.350 align:middle line:90%
Some don't have bodies.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.750 align:middle line:90%
They're inhabiting human bodies.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.710 align:middle line:84%
Lots of the wars and
conflicts in our world today

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.540 align:middle line:84%
are actually these groups
fighting within human form.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.220 align:middle line:90%
And we forget that.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.370 align:middle line:84%
We tend to be so immediate
and looking at a situation

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.770 align:middle line:84%
as, oh, it's these people, when
in fact our world, our galaxy,

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.190 align:middle line:84%
our universe is
incredibly complex.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And there's so much going
on in the unseen world.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.290 align:middle line:84%
So these beings have a place
here, as much as we do.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.550 align:middle line:84%
I often give the example
of a parasitical world.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.870 align:middle line:84%
We've got animals running
around with parasites and fleas

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.300 align:middle line:90%
and things that we don't see.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.360 align:middle line:90%
It's the same.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.420 align:middle line:84%
We have this unseen world
with angels, aliens, guides,

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.150 align:middle line:84%
everything you can
think of, entities

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.770 align:middle line:84%
that are here with us as much
as we're here in physical form.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.060 align:middle line:90%


00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.760 align:middle line:84%
I've spirit traveled to many
places all over the world,

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.900 align:middle line:84%
to Wanaku, Chichen Itza,
the Temple of Kukula Khan,

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.170 align:middle line:84%
Skellig Michael, all over
Europe, around the world.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And these places all
hold different stories,

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.840 align:middle line:84%
different energies,
and different star

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.550 align:middle line:84%
beings that have helped create
the different societies.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.220 align:middle line:84%
The most interesting
was Stonehenge.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.090 align:middle line:90%
It was really amazing.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.180 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing on the land.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.500 align:middle line:90%
There were no stones.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.650 align:middle line:90%
It was just bare land.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.230 align:middle line:90%
And the beings came through.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And I call them
the ancient ones.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.880 align:middle line:90%
And they told me what happened.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.570 align:middle line:84%
They showed me as if
it was a hologram how

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.930 align:middle line:84%
the different
structures were built

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.910 align:middle line:90%
as Stonehenge was evolving.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.770 align:middle line:90%
First the land is barren.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Then, there's branches and
rocks placed around it.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.040 align:middle line:84%
Then I see different, you
know, people coming in

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.930 align:middle line:84%
and the beginnings
of the ceremony

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.440 align:middle line:84%
that they taught the people,
which was a fertility rite

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.820 align:middle line:90%
ceremony.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.780 align:middle line:84%
Although we know from history
and the archaeologists who

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.990 align:middle line:84%
have studied the
site that the burial

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.950 align:middle line:84%
mounds next to Stonehenge
imply that it was used

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.780 align:middle line:84%
for some kind of
death ritual, in fact,

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.370 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't, it was used
for fertility rites.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.190 align:middle line:84%
The high priestesses
that they trained

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.550 align:middle line:84%
were the ones that brought
through the star beings.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.720 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones that
procreated with the pleiadians

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.600 align:middle line:90%
to bring through these people.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And as it progressed, the
pleiadians, or star beings,

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:27.890 align:middle line:84%
they eventually around 4000 BC
placed the large sarsen stones

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.690 align:middle line:90%
to make up Stonehenge.

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
they did this is it

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.700 align:middle line:84%
was their last
message to the people.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.320 align:middle line:90%
But they did not come back.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.110 align:middle line:84%
They used to come and
spend time with the people

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.210 align:middle line:90%
at equinox and solstice.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.720 align:middle line:84%
But this was the last
time that they were here.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And so the people kept
doing the ceremonies.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.430 align:middle line:84%
But as time went by, they
started to lose their faith.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.920 align:middle line:84%
They started to lose
their connection.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And they started burying the
high priestesses and the elite

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.510 align:middle line:84%
next to Stonehenge in hopes
that they would find the gods

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.050 align:middle line:90%
and bring them back through.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.500 align:middle line:84%
There still is a lot of
energy in those stones.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Those star beings,
or the ancient ones,

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:17.270 align:middle line:84%
they infused those
stones with energy

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:21.110 align:middle line:84%
that comes through the portal,
of which Stonehenge is.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.140 align:middle line:90%
It's a massive portal.

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:27.680 align:middle line:84%
The stones themselves
mark a smaller portal that

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.350 align:middle line:90%
is within a much bigger portal.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:32.990 align:middle line:10%
And scientists have
recently discovered

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.320 align:middle line:10%
stones that are
much bigger that are

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.290 align:middle line:10%
buried under Salisbury Plain.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.420 align:middle line:10%
So it's a much larger site.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:46.100 align:middle line:84%
But Stonehenge itself had
these large sarsen stones

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.940 align:middle line:84%
placed by the ancient ones,
so that people would remember

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.850 align:middle line:90%
them, infused with that energy.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.370 align:middle line:84%
And what they wanted
the people to remember

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.920 align:middle line:84%
is the ceremonies
that they taught them.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.610 align:middle line:84%
They wanted them to remember
that the goddess, or the Earth,

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:04.040 align:middle line:90%
is the most sacred of all.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And that that's what everyone
should be connecting with

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:12.420 align:middle line:90%
and basically taking care of.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.530 align:middle line:84%
When I actually
physically went to the UK

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:19.040 align:middle line:84%
and visited Stonehenge,
we had a driver who

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.950 align:middle line:90%
was an amateur archaeologist.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And he listened to me talk
about Stonehenge and that I felt

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:29.180 align:middle line:84%
and my spirit
traveling had shown me

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:34.070 align:middle line:84%
the sarsen stones were
placed around 4000 BC.

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:35.780 align:middle line:90%
He was just shocked.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I went on
a dig with a whole crew

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.240 align:middle line:90%
here in Salisbury Plain.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.919 align:middle line:84%
And he says, we
discovered the tooth.

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Sonja,
that changed history.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.660 align:middle line:90%
That changed everything.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:52.070 align:middle line:84%
He says, because scientists
and archaeologists

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:56.790 align:middle line:84%
believed the stones were
placed around 2300 BC.

00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:01.070 align:middle line:84%
They feel that, you
know, between 2000, 2500,

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:02.660 align:middle line:90%
that's when they were placed.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.870 align:middle line:10%
And he said, they'll have to
rewrite all the history books,

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:10.700 align:middle line:10%
because this tooth proves
that there was a civilization

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:11.990 align:middle line:10%
during this time.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:14.420 align:middle line:84%
He said, basically,
what it proves

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.970 align:middle line:90%
is your dates are right on.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:19.520 align:middle line:10%
Recently, the UK
announced they are

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.874 align:middle line:10%
going to build a tunnel
under Stonehenge.

00:09:22.874 --> 00:09:24.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID CAMERON:
This is different

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:25.690 align:middle line:90%
because the green light is on.

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:26.780 align:middle line:90%
I put it on.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.570 align:middle line:10%
And the money can be spent
today, tomorrow, getting

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:32.630 align:middle line:10%
going on the plan that
needs to be put in place.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.990 align:middle line:10%
>>SONJA: And the world
shrieked and said, no.

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:38.900 align:middle line:10%
The entire UK said, oh, my god.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:43.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's not directly
underneath the stone circle.

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:45.500 align:middle line:10%
It is nearby.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.770 align:middle line:10%
And it is to help direct
traffic, because it's such

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:51.140 align:middle line:10%
a heavily trafficked area.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.100 align:middle line:90%
I think this is a huge mistake.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.650 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's
going to disrupt

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:56.990 align:middle line:90%
the land and the stones.

00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And I also feel that
what's going to happen

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:04.400 align:middle line:84%
is they're going to run
into a trove of artifacts.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And, yay, for the
archaeologists.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.570 align:middle line:84%
It will be a wonderful
dig site for them

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:10.980 align:middle line:90%
and the tunnel will be scrapped.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:14.990 align:middle line:84%
But I think that this is a
disruption to a place that

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:17.680 align:middle line:90%
really needs to be preserved.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.000 align:middle line:90%
It needs to be protected.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And I know the people of the UK
are really hoping and praying

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.950 align:middle line:90%
that this doesn't happen.

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:28.920 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of places
around the world that

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.740 align:middle line:90%
have been destroyed.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:35.970 align:middle line:84%
Different groups have blown
up areas that are very ancient

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:39.660 align:middle line:84%
and really, really
sacred to many people.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:40.560 align:middle line:90%
It's sad.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.050 align:middle line:10%
It's very hard on all of
us to have this happening.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:48.870 align:middle line:84%
But I feel that as we come to
the end of a phase of humanity,

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:52.470 align:middle line:84%
we're not necessarily going
to witness such a fall as we

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:middle line:90%
did with Atlantis and Lumeria.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:58.620 align:middle line:84%
But we may actually see
some of these ancient sites

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:03.670 align:middle line:84%
fall, symbolically representing
what happened back then.

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:06.780 align:middle line:84%
There's a new phase of
humanity that will begin.

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And many of the children
that are being born today

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:13.410 align:middle line:84%
are star seeds, just like
we were back during the time

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:15.120 align:middle line:90%
that we all came through.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.850 align:middle line:84%
They're coming through
now to govern and take

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:20.550 align:middle line:90%
care of this planet.

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:23.340 align:middle line:84%
This transition that
we're in and the end

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:26.170 align:middle line:84%
of a phase of humanity
is a good thing.

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:29.970 align:middle line:84%
It's something that we,
as souls, many of us

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:32.520 align:middle line:84%
old souls who have
been incarnating

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.280 align:middle line:84%
since the time of
Atlantis and Lumeria,

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:38.940 align:middle line:84%
have an opportunity now
to help those new star

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:40.950 align:middle line:90%
seeds that are being born.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.710 align:middle line:84%
We're able to help
them understand

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:46.380 align:middle line:84%
what has happened
during our time

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.650 align:middle line:84%
and now what they have
to look forward to.

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:52.380 align:middle line:84%
It's really up to
us that we help

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:55.680 align:middle line:84%
them learn how to
take care of the Earth

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:59.760 align:middle line:84%
and how to understand the
energies of this planet.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.540 align:middle line:84%
So I see this changing of
the guards as a good thing.

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:07.380 align:middle line:84%
I think that we're ushering in
a new phase of humanity that

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:10.035 align:middle line:84%
will bring about a
non-dualistic reality.

00:12:10.035 --> 00:12:17.750 align:middle line:90%


00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:22.410 align:middle line:84%
When people think about where
do I belong in the universe,

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:25.640 align:middle line:90%
it's a really complex view.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.150 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is
we have dimensions.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:31.410 align:middle line:90%
And dimensions are huge.

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:33.260 align:middle line:84%
We're in the fifth
dimension right now.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And that envelops
our entire galaxy.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.570 align:middle line:90%
Then we have realms.

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And realms are energies
that we exist in.

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:45.020 align:middle line:84%
The Earth is in the second
realm, which is combative.

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:47.220 align:middle line:90%
It's disruptive.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:50.090 align:middle line:84%
It's earthquakes and
volcanoes and all kinds

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:51.410 align:middle line:90%
of things happening.

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:55.640 align:middle line:84%
Then we have all of this
going on at the same time,

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.160 align:middle line:90%
people in different realms.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.210 align:middle line:90%
We're in this fifth dimension.

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:02.150 align:middle line:84%
There's other dimensional
openings happening

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:03.890 align:middle line:90%
in the fifth dimension.

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:05.990 align:middle line:84%
This is like mind
blowing for all of us,

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:08.690 align:middle line:84%
because during the
fourth dimension

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:10.970 align:middle line:90%
we did not experience that.

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:12.770 align:middle line:84%
But when the Mayan
calendar ended

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:14.750 align:middle line:84%
and we moved into
the fifth dimension,

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:18.380 align:middle line:84%
all of these different
portals started opening up.

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:21.200 align:middle line:84%
Since we've moved into
the fifth dimension,

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.020 align:middle line:84%
we are in a much
higher frequency.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:28.400 align:middle line:84%
The energy is so intense
that people can no longer

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:32.480 align:middle line:84%
do things the way that they did
them in the fourth dimension.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.930 align:middle line:84%
My best example is people
who sell real estate.

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:38.870 align:middle line:84%
It's not like it was back
in the fourth dimension.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:42.280 align:middle line:84%
There is, for all of
us, in all industries,

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:47.240 align:middle line:84%
the need to almost be
in some kind of service

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:51.020 align:middle line:84%
to a higher power, to
a higher understanding.

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:54.920 align:middle line:84%
All of us have this spiritual
awakening happening.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:59.870 align:middle line:10%
And so many people have this
desire to find themselves,

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:01.820 align:middle line:10%
to understand their
purpose, to know

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:04.680 align:middle line:10%
why they're here on the planet.

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.050 align:middle line:10%
And this has to do with
this higher frequency.

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:10.370 align:middle line:10%
And all of us moving
from the heart chakra

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:12.140 align:middle line:10%
into the fifth chakra.

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:13.340 align:middle line:90%
So we're verbal.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.650 align:middle line:90%
We're more expressive.

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:20.360 align:middle line:10%
There's all kinds of exposure
to these things that have never

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.850 align:middle line:10%
been said or talked
about, secrets

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:24.920 align:middle line:10%
that have been uncovered.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.750 align:middle line:84%
This is a part of
that fifth dimension.

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:31.190 align:middle line:84%
This is a part of us
experiencing this fifth chakra

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.290 align:middle line:90%
on a really big level.

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:36.230 align:middle line:84%
The trick is for
people not to just zoom

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:39.950 align:middle line:84%
right up into the sixth chakra,
because we get really mental

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:41.800 align:middle line:90%
in this fifth dimension.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.540 align:middle line:84%
We start thinking our
way through everything.

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:48.170 align:middle line:84%
We start being obsessive
with opening that third eye

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:51.770 align:middle line:90%
and figuring everything out.

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:54.650 align:middle line:84%
When I spirit traveled
to Hagar Qim, which

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:58.760 align:middle line:84%
is on the island of Malta,
it's just south of Italy,

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:03.660 align:middle line:84%
the oldest standing stone
religious site on the planet

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:04.460 align:middle line:90%
is there.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.900 align:middle line:90%
It's Hagar Qim.

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And this site was the
most mind boggling

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:14.750 align:middle line:90%
to discover, to experience.

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:18.890 align:middle line:84%
I was literally lost in the
maze, because it's like a maze.

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:20.240 align:middle line:90%
It's huge.

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And when I went there
in my spirit travels,

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:28.400 align:middle line:84%
the goddess who takes care
of this site came to me.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And she walked me down the
hallway to these two rooms.

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I want you to
experience these two rooms.

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And I walked into the one on the
left, which was absolute joy.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.910 align:middle line:90%
It was like bliss.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:46.010 align:middle line:90%
I was so happy.

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:49.075 align:middle line:84%
And everything in it
represented goodness.

00:15:49.075 --> 00:15:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And then I came out of that
room and she said, now,

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:55.370 align:middle line:84%
I want you to walk into this
room and experience this.

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And it was the scariest place
I've ever been in my life.

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:03.710 align:middle line:84%
It was everything that is
dark and scary and awful.

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And I came running out of that
room and stood in the middle.

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And she said, back during
Atlantis, she said,

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:15.260 align:middle line:90%
I took care of the people.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I'm here
on the island of Malta

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:23.060 align:middle line:84%
to take care of this site
because this site represented

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:26.600 align:middle line:90%
the balance of all duality.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:31.280 align:middle line:84%
These two rooms in
this ceremonial chamber

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:35.180 align:middle line:84%
was the balancing point
of the entire planet.

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.670 align:middle line:84%
She said, these
were built to keep

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:43.160 align:middle line:84%
the planet and all that is good
and all that is bad in balance.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.420 align:middle line:90%
And this is what I teach.

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:47.630 align:middle line:84%
This is what I take into
my meditation retreats.

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:49.730 align:middle line:84%
This is what I
teach the people is

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:54.470 align:middle line:84%
how we sit constantly
engaging in what is good

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:55.760 align:middle line:90%
and what is bad.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And our whole galaxy having
moved into the fifth dimension

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:04.339 align:middle line:84%
is also now experiencing
this outer measuring system

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:06.319 align:middle line:90%
splitting apart.

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:09.560 align:middle line:84%
It is not going to
be what we measure

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.960 align:middle line:90%
with 100 years from now.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:15.290 align:middle line:84%
Inside each of us
we have a soul body.

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:20.339 align:middle line:84%
And that soul body has already
a measuring system within it.

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:25.270 align:middle line:84%
We understand innately how
things are right or wrong,

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:26.369 align:middle line:90%
good or bad.

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:28.920 align:middle line:84%
But we don't tend
to rely upon that.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:31.590 align:middle line:84%
We tend to go
outside of ourselves.

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And we get side
tracked from that.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:37.650 align:middle line:84%
We're handed this beautiful
palette with emotions on it.

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And we have this
overwhelming amnesia

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:42.780 align:middle line:84%
that we walk into
this life with.

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And we're busy tending
to these emotions.

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:48.400 align:middle line:84%
Let me paint my day
with a little joy

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.970 align:middle line:84%
and, oh, I feel anxiety, and
how about a little resentment.

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And so we're painting our
lives with these emotions.

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And our energy is
leaving our body,

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:59.410 align:middle line:90%
connecting with like energy.

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:02.280 align:middle line:90%
That's what creates more karma.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.290 align:middle line:84%
I think it's really
important for people

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:09.330 align:middle line:84%
to understand that the process
that we all need to go through

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:13.930 align:middle line:84%
and to get out of creating
more karma is inside.

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:17.250 align:middle line:84%
It's an inside job in
this fifth dimension.

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:22.260 align:middle line:84%
We really have to go inward
and do the processing,

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.750 align:middle line:84%
understand what our
emotional wounds are,

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:28.800 align:middle line:84%
and really make some space so
that this higher frequency,

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.650 align:middle line:84%
this fifth dimension,
can be met,

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:33.420 align:middle line:84%
because it's not
going to meet us.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.490 align:middle line:90%
We have to meet it.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:39.100 align:middle line:84%
We have to do the work in
order to survive this higher

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:39.900 align:middle line:90%
frequency.

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:42.970 align:middle line:90%


00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:46.430 align:middle line:84%
Every day, I work on
people as a healer.

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:50.300 align:middle line:10%
I work on hearts and livers
and spleens and kidneys.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:51.790 align:middle line:10%
I repair tissue.

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:53.680 align:middle line:10%
I repair lesions.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.600 align:middle line:10%
I do the equivalency
of a triple bypass.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm like an energy surgeon.

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:02.230 align:middle line:84%
And in this work,
what I see day in

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:06.550 align:middle line:84%
and day out is people
who are struggling,

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:10.150 align:middle line:84%
people who don't understand
that physical illness

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:15.870 align:middle line:84%
is actually an emotional
component, an emotional wound

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:19.660 align:middle line:84%
stored in the body that's
festered and become

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:22.180 align:middle line:84%
a cancer or some
kind of illness.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:26.830 align:middle line:84%
So this process of
helping people, not only

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:31.480 align:middle line:84%
excavate the emotional part of
that, but then working on them

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:35.170 align:middle line:84%
and helping them to
heal the physical to me

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:42.490 align:middle line:84%
is the component that we need
to all look at and understand

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:47.810 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to how
are we going to evolve.

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:51.910 align:middle line:84%
We can look at evolution
and spiritualism

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:55.420 align:middle line:84%
outside of ourselves and
think that everything's love

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:57.910 align:middle line:90%
and light and really groovy.

00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:01.090 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, we
really need to own

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:04.180 align:middle line:84%
what's going on
inside of ourselves,

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:09.430 align:middle line:84%
really do the work internally,
and excavate those things that

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:12.430 align:middle line:84%
have caused us
pain and repeating

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:16.210 align:middle line:84%
of patterns and cycles
our whole lives,

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:20.530 align:middle line:84%
because we can't continue
in this addicted society

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:22.150 align:middle line:84%
that we live in,
where we're just

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:26.410 align:middle line:84%
finding external things to
occupy ourselves and be really

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:28.120 align:middle line:90%
distracted by.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.040 align:middle line:90%
It's time.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:33.160 align:middle line:84%
This fifth dimension
requires us to do the work.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:37.220 align:middle line:84%
When we do the work, which
is a lifelong process,

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:40.720 align:middle line:84%
we get to where we're trying
to get to, which is a higher

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.340 align:middle line:90%
state of consciousness.

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:45.690 align:middle line:90%
