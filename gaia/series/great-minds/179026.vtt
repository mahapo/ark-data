00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.730 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Nassim Haramein.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.580 align:middle line:10%
I am a researcher
in unified physics.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.470 align:middle line:10%
I'm the director of research
at the Resonance Science

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.660 align:middle line:10%
Foundation.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.980 align:middle line:10%
And I'm the executive
director of R&D at Torus Tech.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.840 align:middle line:10%
I work on many different things,
both theory and applications,

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.350 align:middle line:10%
as well outreach to the
public and education,

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.950 align:middle line:10%
but generally, I spend
most of my time working

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.540 align:middle line:10%
in the laboratory
on applications

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.520 align:middle line:10%
and on theoretical descriptions
of these new physics that

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.050 align:middle line:10%
are emerging at this time.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.970 align:middle line:84%
Some of the
applications associated

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.620 align:middle line:84%
with what I'm writing have to do
with energy production, gravity

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.590 align:middle line:90%
control.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.630 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very high
level applications.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.010 align:middle line:84%
There's other applications
to health and life extension.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.740 align:middle line:84%
The applications
are very, very wide

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.420 align:middle line:84%
reaching in all sectors
of society so it will--

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.970 align:middle line:84%
if it's correct and
I believe it is--

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.605 align:middle line:84%
then we're on the verge
of a very profound change

00:01:32.605 --> 00:01:33.405 align:middle line:90%
in our society.

00:01:33.405 --> 00:01:38.370 align:middle line:90%


00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Many different life events
got me into this work.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.340 align:middle line:90%
It was kind of a seamless path.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.870 align:middle line:10%
Probably, around the age of 10,
when I had very strong feelings

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.300 align:middle line:10%
about the way we were
dealing with dimensions.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.960 align:middle line:10%
I was taught the typical story
about dimensions that's cool.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.750 align:middle line:10%
I didn't quite agree
with the whole axiom

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.610 align:middle line:10%
and I came up with my own.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And I started to think
about it and look at nature

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.040 align:middle line:90%
and try to understand it better.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.870 align:middle line:84%
Nature was talking
to me so I had

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.949 align:middle line:90%
many moments of contemplation.

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:14.580 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't thinking of it as I'm
developing this great theory.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.390 align:middle line:10%
I was just wanting to
understand reality.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.090 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to understand
how I got here.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And why was I even
able to be conscious.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And how this natural world
around me actually got there.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And what was making
it tick, like

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.320 align:middle line:84%
how was it organized-- the
complexity being so incredible.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.830 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to
know, and I started

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.670 align:middle line:84%
to feel like there was patterns
that were underlying all this.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.320 align:middle line:84%
When I was about 12
or 13, we lived right

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.150 align:middle line:84%
beside a movie theater
and I would, at night,

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.560 align:middle line:84%
go outside and sit on a bench
at the exit of the movie theater

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.710 align:middle line:84%
and I would look at people
come out of the movie theater.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And I had started to create
classifications of people.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.900 align:middle line:84%
I could see certain
genre of people,

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.100 align:middle line:90%
like the way they walked.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.970 align:middle line:90%
The way they talked.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:12.900 align:middle line:90%
The way they moved.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.910 align:middle line:84%
The way they
interacted with people.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And I could see this
person is more like this.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And this person is more
like this and this.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying
to see patterns.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And then, eventually,
that led me

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.310 align:middle line:84%
to think that I should describe
this fundamental pattern

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.287 align:middle line:90%
in terms of the physics of it.

00:03:31.287 --> 00:03:33.622 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:33.622 --> 00:03:36.900 align:middle line:90%


00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.940 align:middle line:84%
I was spending a lot of
time at night studying

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.180 align:middle line:84%
and eventually, the
study took over.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And I, of course, didn't have
proper support or financing

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.490 align:middle line:84%
from the beginning
so I eventually, sold

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.460 align:middle line:84%
all my equipment and
I moved into a van

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.500 align:middle line:90%
so I didn't have to pay rent.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And my budget was
about $2,500 a year

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.820 align:middle line:84%
and I spent five years in
a van studying full-time.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.130 align:middle line:90%
Serious amount of hours a day--

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.120 align:middle line:90%
15 to 20 hours a day, even.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.680 align:middle line:90%
Very little sleep.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.890 align:middle line:84%
So I financed my study on my
own for many years and then,

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:28.920 align:middle line:84%
eventually, I connected with
people that were interested.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.010 align:middle line:10%
And one of them being
Foster Gamble, that

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.470 align:middle line:10%
supported me along
the way so that I

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.510 align:middle line:10%
could continue the research.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.160 align:middle line:10%
And I was very fortunate.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.610 align:middle line:10%
I eventually found other
patrons that financed my lab

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.390 align:middle line:10%
so that I could start doing
some hardware research.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.920 align:middle line:90%
But it has been a long journey.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.720 align:middle line:90%
There's been many ups and downs.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.210 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult
to finance research

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.490 align:middle line:90%
outside the academic world.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.410 align:middle line:84%
As well, there is
a lot of pushback

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:59.790 align:middle line:90%
from the academic world.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.010 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
censoring that occurs.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.580 align:middle line:10%
So it's been a long
battle up the hill

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.210 align:middle line:10%
to bring this information
out, but as well, look

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.510 align:middle line:10%
at the applications of this
kind of new understanding

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.940 align:middle line:10%
of the universe and its forces.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.708 align:middle line:84%
And what it can
bring to humanity.

00:05:18.708 --> 00:05:21.168 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:21.168 --> 00:05:22.650 align:middle line:90%


00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.930 align:middle line:84%
In current theoretical
models of matter and energy,

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.650 align:middle line:84%
there is fundamental questions
that are unanswered--

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.230 align:middle line:90%
where magnetic fields come from.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.020 align:middle line:90%
Where mass comes from.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.800 align:middle line:90%
Where forces come from.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.280 align:middle line:84%
We know that gravity is
the curvature of spacetime

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.760 align:middle line:84%
since Einstein, but spacetime
is not described by Einstein,

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.790 align:middle line:84%
meaning we don't really
know what gravity is

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.790 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't fit into quantum
theory so well and so on.

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.200 align:middle line:84%
So there's big holes
in our understanding,

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.410 align:middle line:84%
meaning we have ideas of
things-- for instance,

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.560 align:middle line:84%
we have a good
mathematical equation

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.230 align:middle line:84%
that gives us equivalence
so we can measure things.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.990 align:middle line:84%
So that we can calculate
things like E equals

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.570 align:middle line:84%
MC squared is a
famous equivalence.

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.020 align:middle line:84%
We know that mass and
energy have equivalents,

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.820 align:middle line:84%
but we don't know what mass
is so thus, we don't actually

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.530 align:middle line:90%
know what energy is.

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:24.390 align:middle line:84%
So these are very deep
lacks that are already

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.720 align:middle line:84%
embedded in the
structure of the series

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.670 align:middle line:90%
and so many things are built--

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:33.570 align:middle line:84%
layers are built on top of
it and a lot of Band-Aids

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.720 align:middle line:84%
are put on to try
to patch the holes.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:43.050 align:middle line:84%
But this new view emerged
from a deeper understanding

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:48.000 align:middle line:84%
of the source of mass,
the source of charge,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.100 align:middle line:90%
the source of electric fields.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And the geometry or the
dynamics of creation,

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.000 align:middle line:84%
meaning the fundamental pattern
that makes it possible not only

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.330 align:middle line:84%
from matter to
emerge, but as well,

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.540 align:middle line:84%
for organization to
occur, which is nowhere

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.460 align:middle line:90%
present in the standard models.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:13.350 align:middle line:84%
Meaning the standard models of
physics don't have life in it.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.830 align:middle line:10%
There's no life that can
emerge from the equations

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.380 align:middle line:10%
of relativity or
there's no life that

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:23.056 align:middle line:10%
can emerge from the
equations of quantum physics.

00:07:23.056 --> 00:07:26.520 align:middle line:84%
None of this includes
the complexity

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.880 align:middle line:84%
that emerge when we
look at natural systems.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.070 align:middle line:84%
In this new view,
it's quite different.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:37.350 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's based on
a field of information

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.120 align:middle line:90%
that's present everywhere.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.770 align:middle line:10%
And now that field
of information

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:44.430 align:middle line:10%
is already inside
the standard model--

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:48.450 align:middle line:10%
that is the Planck field,
this vacuum fluctuation,

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:52.230 align:middle line:10%
was actually predicted by
quantum theory already almost

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:53.460 align:middle line:10%
100 years ago.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.600 align:middle line:10%
It was just generally ignored.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.200 align:middle line:10%
It was thought to be a
background noise that you

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.490 align:middle line:10%
didn't have to worry about it.

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And what we're showing
is that no, actually,

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:06.840 align:middle line:84%
that background noise is the
source of the organization that

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.940 align:middle line:84%
produce matter, that
produces the force.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And actually, is the
source of creation.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.840 align:middle line:10%
And that field of
information actually

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.590 align:middle line:10%
is in feedback structure.

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:22.950 align:middle line:10%
Feedback in mathematical
equations-- for instance--

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:26.880 align:middle line:10%
creates fractals that have
high level of complexity

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:31.690 align:middle line:10%
and organization in very
short amount of iterations.

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And it starts to be able to
explain why complexity emerged

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:38.039 align:middle line:90%
so fast in the universe.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:40.470 align:middle line:84%
Because when we look at the
complexity-- for instance--

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:44.580 align:middle line:84%
of a human being with 100
trillion cells made out

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:49.680 align:middle line:84%
of 100 trillion
atoms each cell, is

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.660 align:middle line:84%
way more complex
than anything that

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.310 align:middle line:90%
could happen by random function.

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:56.910 align:middle line:84%
So if it's not
random, what is it?

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, the tendency is to think
that there's a God organizing

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.650 align:middle line:84%
creation, but there's
another option.

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And that option is
that there's feedback

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.580 align:middle line:84%
of information between this
field and the material world.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:13.390 align:middle line:90%


00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:16.000 align:middle line:84%
The feedback loop that
I'm describing-- so

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.580 align:middle line:90%
imagine a field.

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And imagine that
it's like a fluid,

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:24.250 align:middle line:84%
like your smoothie
in the morning.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And you've put all this
stuff in and you turn it on

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.750 align:middle line:84%
and you can see it's
spinning in there.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
the little particles

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:35.050 align:middle line:84%
of the wonderful fruits
and vegetables you've

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:36.500 align:middle line:84%
put them there,
you can see where

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.410 align:middle line:90%
the particles are going out.

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And they're going
back to the top.

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And then going back
in and back out.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.750 align:middle line:10%
And back to the top
and back in and back

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:48.700 align:middle line:10%
out in what is called
a toroidal structure.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.000 align:middle line:10%
And we see that in nature.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.880 align:middle line:84%
For instance, if you
look at galaxies.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.540 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the magnetic
fields of suns, of planets,

00:09:55.540 --> 00:10:00.250 align:middle line:84%
and so on you see this
toroidal structure.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And you have gravitational
fields involved.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:07.720 align:middle line:84%
It's fairly complex, but you
can imagine that information

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.890 align:middle line:84%
can fall into a system and
then emerge at its equator

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:14.710 align:middle line:84%
because the system is
spinning at high velocity.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:18.820 align:middle line:10%
And then get captured by
the gravitational field

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:22.750 align:middle line:10%
of the system and
then, return inside.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And when it returns inside,
it has gone through a journey

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:31.300 align:middle line:90%
and that journey has changed it.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually
feeding information back

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:37.810 align:middle line:84%
into the system different than
the information that came out.

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:40.430 align:middle line:90%
So the system is evolving now.

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:43.776 align:middle line:84%
The system is
getting more complex.

00:10:43.776 --> 00:10:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And you see that in
nature everywhere.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:49.430 align:middle line:84%
You can see that nature is
reacting to its environment.

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:53.320 align:middle line:84%
It adapts to its environment
because it's getting feedback

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.730 align:middle line:90%
from the environment.

00:10:54.730 --> 00:11:01.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a study of
nature applied to physics,

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:04.810 align:middle line:84%
that feedback appears
in nature according

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:08.030 align:middle line:84%
to this because
it's present already

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:12.640 align:middle line:84%
at insertion at the basis
of the physical world.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:16.030 align:middle line:84%
At the basis of the
way atoms come to be.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:18.680 align:middle line:90%
So you can think of atoms--

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:23.260 align:middle line:84%
the material world-- as these
little vortex of information

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.540 align:middle line:84%
that are spinning
very high velocity.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And that are making little
knots in the structure of space.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:34.450 align:middle line:10%
And we bump against these
knots and we think of it

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:37.090 align:middle line:10%
as the material
world, but we know

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:43.270 align:middle line:10%
it's made of 99.9999999% space.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And the thing we're
bumping against

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:49.900 align:middle line:84%
is just an electrostatic feel
that actually is bouncing off

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.840 align:middle line:84%
each other and so
we are actually,

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:59.410 align:middle line:84%
just talking about charge in
space or information in space.

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:02.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's a different
understanding

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.710 align:middle line:90%
of our material world.

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And since we're
made of it, then we

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:08.680 align:middle line:84%
can start to think of
ourself a little bit

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.418 align:middle line:90%
differently, as well.

00:12:11.418 --> 00:12:13.230 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:17.580 align:middle line:84%
Fractal mathematics
is a function

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:21.060 align:middle line:84%
in mathematics in which
you have an equation that

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:22.890 align:middle line:84%
gives an answer
and you are feeding

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:24.660 align:middle line:84%
the answer back
into the equation

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:28.650 align:middle line:84%
so that you have an
iteration process.

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:31.530 align:middle line:10%
And so you can imagine--
like, for instance--

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:35.490 align:middle line:10%
for people that are
visual, a simple triangle

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:37.260 align:middle line:10%
and then a reverse
one put on top.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.850 align:middle line:10%
So you have a
symbol that's common

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:42.040 align:middle line:10%
taught as the Star
of David or so on.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.850 align:middle line:10%
And then if you add
little triangles

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:47.530 align:middle line:10%
on the next scale
on the next level,

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:50.610 align:middle line:10%
then you'll have little Stars
of Davids that are developing.

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And then you can keep
adding little triangles

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:53.879 align:middle line:90%
and little triangles.

00:12:53.879 --> 00:12:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And then you zoom in, and then
keep adding them, and zoom in.

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And you can go like
that to infinity.

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:01.320 align:middle line:84%
The complexity can become
very, very complex.

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.140 align:middle line:84%
Now that's a simple
geometry fractal structure,

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:08.460 align:middle line:84%
but there is more complex
geometry fractal structure

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:09.720 align:middle line:90%
that are beautiful.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.900 align:middle line:84%
The Mandelbrot
set-- for instance--

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:18.360 align:middle line:84%
from Benoit Mandelbrot, that
was a very strong influence

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.930 align:middle line:84%
in creating some
of these equations.

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And then, eventually, you
get in a very short amount

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:31.540 align:middle line:84%
of time, a very strong
replication of the pattern

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.630 align:middle line:90%
at many different scales.

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And you see that in
nature very much so.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:40.939 align:middle line:84%
Fractal mathematics are
used widely in animation,

00:13:40.939 --> 00:13:42.730 align:middle line:84%
especially in Hollywood
when they're trying

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.400 align:middle line:90%
to reproduce a natural scene.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.516 align:middle line:10%
So we have mathematics
that can reproduce

00:13:47.516 --> 00:13:52.600 align:middle line:10%
man-made things, like buildings,
and cubes, and squares.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.840 align:middle line:10%
But if we want to
make natural scenes,

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.690 align:middle line:10%
then we have to find
mathematics that reproduce

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:00.430 align:middle line:10%
something that looks natural.

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:03.760 align:middle line:10%
So if we're trying to
make a flower or a tree

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:08.080 align:middle line:10%
and especially, if we're trying
to animate it so what Hollywood

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.910 align:middle line:10%
eventually did is
that they started

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:14.470 align:middle line:10%
to use fractal mathematics
because they reproduce

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:20.245 align:middle line:10%
these reiterations
of the animation--

00:14:20.245 --> 00:14:23.720 align:middle line:10%
in terms of the pixelation
of the structure that they

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:27.400 align:middle line:10%
are trying to build so that
it appears very natural.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.810 align:middle line:10%
And it's remarkable.

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:31.510 align:middle line:10%
It's sometimes
hard to distinguish

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:34.300 align:middle line:10%
between the real thing
and the animated thing.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And so that tells you something
profound about nature and this

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:43.310 align:middle line:84%
is something I had found very
early on-- some 25 years or 30

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:44.860 align:middle line:90%
years ago--

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:45.970 align:middle line:90%
what about fractals?

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Because if fractal
mathematics are

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.970 align:middle line:84%
so good at replicating
nature, then their

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:55.150 align:middle line:84%
must be fractal
systems involved,

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:59.020 align:middle line:84%
feedback involved in the
structure of spacetime.

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:02.890 align:middle line:84%
There must be feedback
occurring in some way.

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:08.530 align:middle line:10%
Information must be able to
emerge and return to a system

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:11.230 align:middle line:10%
so that the system
could evolve into higher

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:15.076 align:middle line:10%
and higher levels of complexity,
which is what we see in nature.

00:15:15.076 --> 00:15:17.566 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:17.566 --> 00:15:19.060 align:middle line:90%


00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:21.580 align:middle line:10%
Just like the
animation structure

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:26.380 align:middle line:10%
and the fractal iterations
that are in this software

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:31.450 align:middle line:10%
to produce the natural world,
spacetime is pixelated.

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:36.340 align:middle line:84%
This is the fundamental
discovery of this theory,

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:40.240 align:middle line:84%
is that spacetime is not smooth
as described by Einstein.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:43.180 align:middle line:84%
That it is smooth
on large scale,

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:47.890 align:middle line:84%
but in very teeny scale-- this
is called the Planck scale,

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:51.730 align:middle line:84%
which is billions and billions
of times smaller than an atom--

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:55.750 align:middle line:84%
it's actually pixelated
It's actually granular.

00:15:55.750 --> 00:16:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And these little grains are
like little bits of information,

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.780 align:middle line:90%
just like in a computer.

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And those bits are
moving in a certain way

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:09.820 align:middle line:84%
that produce patterns that
we call the material world.

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.160 align:middle line:10%
Although this sounds
very philosophical,

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.830 align:middle line:10%
when you run the mathematics
for such a thing,

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:19.510 align:middle line:10%
you end up with very
fundamental predictions

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:22.930 align:middle line:10%
of very important functions.

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:25.960 align:middle line:84%
The fundamental
mass of a proton.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:26.940 align:middle line:90%
The electron.

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.620 align:middle line:90%
The table of elements come out.

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:30.910 align:middle line:90%
The forces come out.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:35.320 align:middle line:84%
All this stuff emerged from
the theory very nicely,

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.990 align:middle line:90%
very simply, very beautifully.

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:39.880 align:middle line:90%
And that's important in physics.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.700 align:middle line:90%
And it makes predictions.

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:46.750 align:middle line:84%
For instance, using that theory,
I was able to predict exactly--

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:50.350 align:middle line:84%
very, very precisely-- what the
radius of a proton should be.

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And then it was measured in
an accelerator in Switzerland

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:56.450 align:middle line:84%
and it was found to be
exactly what I had predicted

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:58.990 align:middle line:84%
and the standard
model was off by 4%.

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:02.990 align:middle line:90%
And so this is very powerful.

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:07.240 align:middle line:84%
It's actually telling us
something very different

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.910 align:middle line:90%
about ourself, about our world.

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:13.010 align:middle line:84%
That is that we're interacting
with the field of information.

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:16.750 align:middle line:10%
And just recently, I
published papers in biophysics

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:18.250 align:middle line:10%
for the first time--

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.695 align:middle line:10%
with a biophysicist
and an astrophysicist

00:17:20.695 --> 00:17:21.970 align:middle line:10%
that I work with--

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:24.800 align:middle line:10%
describing extending
the theory, even

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:28.000 align:middle line:10%
to understanding that
consciousness is not

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.170 align:middle line:10%
something that's created
as an epiphenomena or--

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:35.380 align:middle line:10%
of the brain, but
actually, is an interaction

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:37.222 align:middle line:10%
with that field of information.

00:17:37.222 --> 00:17:41.080 align:middle line:90%


00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:45.070 align:middle line:84%
If you realize that you're
participating in whatever

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:47.500 align:middle line:84%
is happening, then
you might start

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.290 align:middle line:84%
to monitor a little
bit more of what you're

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:52.810 align:middle line:84%
feeding into the
field and realize

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:56.170 align:middle line:84%
that you have a connection
with everything in the field.

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:57.550 align:middle line:90%
That you're not separated.

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:58.990 align:middle line:90%
You're not isolated.

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:02.200 align:middle line:84%
You're part of this
incredible mechanics,

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:06.190 align:middle line:84%
wheel works of nature and
you are participating in it.

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:12.250 align:middle line:84%
So then, you start to become
more self-aware of what am I

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.410 align:middle line:90%
putting into this field?

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And what am I receiving
from this field as a result?

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And you not only might modify
what you're feeding to feel,

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:26.020 align:middle line:84%
but you might actually
be able to find

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:32.600 align:middle line:84%
ways to increase how much
information you are crunching.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.860 align:middle line:84%
Like the CPU of your
computer is crunching

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:40.390 align:middle line:84%
the fractal mathematics to make
nature, well, you're the CPU.

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you can increase
the frequency of the CPU

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.660 align:middle line:84%
so that you can go
to a higher frequency

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.520 align:middle line:90%
to get more information through.

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.760 align:middle line:84%
Like, literally as
computers get faster,

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:56.650 align:middle line:84%
the frequency oscillators inside
the computer are going faster.

00:18:56.650 --> 00:19:00.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's very
interesting because it

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:07.000 align:middle line:84%
opens the door to
understanding evolution,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.020 align:middle line:84%
but even not only
global evolution,

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:14.440 align:middle line:90%
but at the individual level.

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:18.640 align:middle line:84%
What is the most powerful
thing I have experienced?

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Is to see the
transformation that occurs.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.890 align:middle line:84%
I get hundreds of
letters at this point,

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:29.320 align:middle line:84%
as well when I give
talks and so on--

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:33.760 align:middle line:84%
when somebody gets it, what
I'm saying and they feel it.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:37.000 align:middle line:84%
People feel it because
it's resonating inside

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.520 align:middle line:90%
of them as something true.

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:43.270 align:middle line:84%
Their eyes light up, and
their face start glowing,

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:48.970 align:middle line:84%
and you can see how profound of
a change at such a deep level.

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:50.170 align:middle line:90%
That's so powerful.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:54.490 align:middle line:84%
Even just one person being
able to be changed by this

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:57.000 align:middle line:90%
made it all worth it.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:12.246 align:middle line:90%
