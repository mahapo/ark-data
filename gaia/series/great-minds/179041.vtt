00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.030 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm Dr. JJ Hurtak.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.240 align:middle line:10%
I'm a social scientist also
involved with archeology,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.610 align:middle line:10%
linguistics, and space science.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Dr. Desiree Hurtak with
the Academy for Future Science.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.670 align:middle line:10%
I'm an environmentalist,
a futurist,

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.850 align:middle line:10%
and a social scientist.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And my field has always been
to look at consciousness,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.120 align:middle line:84%
and to understand
how consciousness

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.770 align:middle line:90%
operates on planet Earth.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, why are
we in this together?

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, we feel this is the
age where the female takes

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.032 align:middle line:90%
a role in scientific knowledge.

00:01:01.032 --> 00:01:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we
are also working

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.950 align:middle line:84%
with Elizabeth Rauscher,
who is the foremost female

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.630 align:middle line:90%
mathematician in the world.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.570 align:middle line:84%
Desiree likewise has a great
gift in the physical sciences.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.500 align:middle line:10%
And so the male and
female working together

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.067 align:middle line:10%
bring about an
illustration, what

00:01:15.067 --> 00:01:16.650 align:middle line:10%
we encourage young
people in the world

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.830 align:middle line:10%
to do, especially the
females, to come forth

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.000 align:middle line:10%
and to understand science
and the arts work together

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.720 align:middle line:10%
holistically to describe what
we call planet Earth, Mother

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.860 align:middle line:10%
Earth, as a whole new
incubator of the imagination,

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.410 align:middle line:10%
that we are architects
together of the new dawn.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Male and female, Adam and Eve,
the whole story of evolution

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.140 align:middle line:84%
is over beyond the
mythical concept.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.800 align:middle line:84%
It's in the heart of two people
working together dynamically

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.460 align:middle line:84%
for social and intellectual
transformation.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.500 align:middle line:84%
When I was very young,
I began to examine

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.840 align:middle line:84%
the Eastern and
Western philosophies

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.910 align:middle line:90%
of science and psychology.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And I was intrigued
by the concepts

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.250 align:middle line:84%
of light and the
possibility that there

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.680 align:middle line:90%
was cosmic intelligence.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.660 align:middle line:10%
And so after many,
many years and

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.039 align:middle line:10%
many different methodologies, I
had an exceptional experience,

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.460 align:middle line:10%
where, quote, unquote,
"through a higher consciousness

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.340 align:middle line:10%
experience, a light
manifested before me"

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.290 align:middle line:10%
and that changed
the whole direction

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.440 align:middle line:10%
of my science and research.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.680 align:middle line:84%
That light experience was
so overwhelming that it

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.780 align:middle line:84%
basically changed not only
my life but that of students,

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.230 align:middle line:84%
and led me into research
behind the scenes dealing

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.370 align:middle line:84%
with everything from
paraphysics, parapsychology,

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.130 align:middle line:84%
the examination of
ancient documents

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.460 align:middle line:84%
that dealt with quote, unquote,
"cosmic cultures," and work

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.030 align:middle line:84%
with indigenous elders
throughout the world,

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.750 align:middle line:84%
in essence looking for
a common value that

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.410 align:middle line:84%
would unite the different
traditions of humanity.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>> He had this
amazing experience.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And with that, certain things
started coming into our lives,

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.070 align:middle line:84%
like we would actually see
other realms of intelligence,

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.900 align:middle line:84%
materializations
of other realities.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And so, of course, this
changes your life completely.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And the important
thing about all this

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.060 align:middle line:84%
is it started to show us that we
are not alone in the universe,

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.750 align:middle line:84%
that there's a vast awesome
reality that all of us

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.970 align:middle line:84%
can experience, so we
don't feel in any way

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.327 align:middle line:84%
it's limited to any two
people on the planet.

00:03:26.327 --> 00:03:27.285 align:middle line:90%
It's actually everyone.

00:03:27.285 --> 00:03:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And of course, this is
what's happening now.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Many people are starting
to see and experience,

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.510 align:middle line:84%
whether it's in their bedrooms
or in their meditations

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.340 align:middle line:84%
or in their dreams, these
other realms of intelligence.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Fortunately, I had this
light experience several times.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.830 align:middle line:84%
My physical body was
absorbed by the light.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.470 align:middle line:84%
I was taken into
another dimension.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And in that dimension of higher
consciousness, awareness,

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.180 align:middle line:84%
I was given mathematical
insights or codes

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.080 align:middle line:84%
of various realities
including ancient times,

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.560 align:middle line:84%
historic places of contact
with the cosmic cultures,

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.810 align:middle line:84%
as well as futuristic
events dealing with climate

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.770 align:middle line:90%
change and space evolution.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:17.100 align:middle line:84%
>> All areas of science will
progress to understand contact

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.980 align:middle line:84%
with these other
levels of intelligence.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.070 align:middle line:84%
We will be graduating into
having a greater understanding

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.960 align:middle line:90%
of the universe we live in.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And this has been going
on since the 1970s,

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.690 align:middle line:84%
and continues even
down to this day.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's that coming
together of all these levels

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.450 align:middle line:84%
that really is going
to introduce us

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.930 align:middle line:84%
to our new evolution, to
our next great quantum leap.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.360 align:middle line:90%


00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Both the male and the female
parts of what we call the mind

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.240 align:middle line:84%
or the perceptual apparatus is
also in the third dimension.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.670 align:middle line:90%
The fourth dimension is time.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And so to integrate what
is called a higher harmonic

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.860 align:middle line:84%
is to put both into
the fifth dimension.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.862 align:middle line:84%
That's a whole new area of
science yet to be understood.

00:05:04.862 --> 00:05:06.320 align:middle line:10%
It's what Einstein
referred to when

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.390 align:middle line:10%
he spoke of the
spooky area of logic,

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.350 align:middle line:10%
that which is over the
horizon, where we began

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.660 align:middle line:10%
to realize that we are
here but we are also

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.690 align:middle line:10%
in timeless awareness.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.780 align:middle line:90%
We are a part of the human ego.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.730 align:middle line:84%
But we're also part
of a global mind

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.000 align:middle line:84%
through interconnective
entanglement, where everything

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.080 align:middle line:84%
that flows through us is
also flowing simultaneously

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.200 align:middle line:84%
through those that we're
in correspondence with.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.870 align:middle line:84%
To use a metaphor of a
musician really tapping

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.040 align:middle line:84%
into the circuitry of the
intellectual experience

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.160 align:middle line:90%
is not sufficient.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.250 align:middle line:84%
You have to go into
the realization

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.470 align:middle line:84%
that we need a
whole new vocabulary

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.620 align:middle line:90%
to explain the fifth dimension.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.400 align:middle line:10%
I would illustrate
it simply saying

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.280 align:middle line:10%
when I worked with Ravi Shankar,
the famous sitar specialist,

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.280 align:middle line:10%
when we were on the faculty
together at Cal Arts,

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.400 align:middle line:10%
he was able to leave his
body, according to Ravi,

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.540 align:middle line:10%
and go out into the audience and
see himself playing the sitar

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.000 align:middle line:10%
through a higher
vibratory projection

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.440 align:middle line:10%
that came out of a higher
state of consciousness.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.190 align:middle line:84%
That reality we can transfer
now to medicine, to archeology,

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.170 align:middle line:84%
to sociology, where
we can momentarily

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.850 align:middle line:84%
see into the future, come to the
realization of a great reality

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.940 align:middle line:84%
that's a totality
of a collective,

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.800 align:middle line:84%
and make examinations work,
find solutions more quickly,

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.320 align:middle line:84%
and come to a realization
that we have answers already

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.860 align:middle line:84%
within us that have to be
dramatized and experienced

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.230 align:middle line:90%
in new scientific language.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:36.490 align:middle line:84%
>> All areas of science have
started to make this quantum

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:37.290 align:middle line:90%
leap.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.700 align:middle line:10%
Whether you look at the
archaeological data, which

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.400 align:middle line:10%
my husband and I have
worked on in Egypt,

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.680 align:middle line:10%
or in other places
like in Mexico,

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.840 align:middle line:10%
no longer do people feel that
it's just 2,000 or 4,000 years

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:51.680 align:middle line:10%
of history.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.840 align:middle line:84%
It really goes
much further back.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.300 align:middle line:84%
We've seen this in
areas like in Brazil,

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.960 align:middle line:84%
where they're starting to
look at data of over 8,000

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.850 align:middle line:90%
to 10,000 years ago.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.600 align:middle line:84%
This is amazing that
real civilizations

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.480 align:middle line:90%
existed at that time.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.240 align:middle line:84%
In addition to that,
areas of science,

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.660 align:middle line:84%
they're actually
starting to take DNA

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.809 align:middle line:84%
and scientists are using
that DNA to code information.

00:07:15.809 --> 00:07:17.600 align:middle line:84%
These are computer
scientists, because they

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.940 align:middle line:84%
can see how many terabytes of
information fit into our DNA.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.860 align:middle line:90%
This is amazing.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:30.500 align:middle line:84%
>> We are in a foggy fertility,
if I may use that expression,

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.740 align:middle line:84%
of not knowing how the
morphogenetic code actually is

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.810 align:middle line:84%
going to take us in the
next 20 or 30 years.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:39.230 align:middle line:84%
We hope that the
technical elites

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:42.080 align:middle line:84%
will be more heart-centered,
more humanistic, more aware

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.880 align:middle line:90%
of positive changes.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.460 align:middle line:84%
But it is up really
to us to forge,

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.490 align:middle line:84%
as we are doing through the
Academy for Future Science,

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:53.000 align:middle line:84%
a world commons whereby young
people can see the whole world

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.300 align:middle line:84%
with the use of new technology
as a global university where

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:59.180 align:middle line:84%
we can tap into vast
libraries of information,

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:02.150 align:middle line:84%
make solutions more
quickly available

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:03.710 align:middle line:84%
to people who come
from cultures who

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:07.070 align:middle line:84%
have no technology at their
fingertips, at the same time

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.700 align:middle line:84%
bring about a renaissance
of a whole new scientific

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:15.830 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual civilization where
the two meet and complement.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:18.440 align:middle line:10%
The part that has the
greater love and compassion,

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.210 align:middle line:10%
and the part that has the
greater science and shall

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:25.470 align:middle line:10%
we say the greater
sense of focus,

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:27.540 align:middle line:10%
you must be able
to bring together

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.180 align:middle line:10%
the internal and the
external universe.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And that is where quantum
change comes about.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:35.580 align:middle line:84%
We can find a bridge between
the two worlds, the inner

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.940 align:middle line:84%
and the outer, that scientists
and theologians have been

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:40.960 align:middle line:90%
fighting over for centuries.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:45.270 align:middle line:84%
This is the time for what I call
the age of the spirit, the age

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:48.770 align:middle line:84%
of the dawning of a
whole new consciousness,

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:53.390 align:middle line:84%
where we as architects
of the new dawn

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:56.420 align:middle line:84%
see a whole new
civilization with no set

00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:00.610 align:middle line:84%
boundaries, no
secret information,

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:02.850 align:middle line:84%
for through remote viewing
and remote sensing,

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:05.760 align:middle line:84%
everything is public
and we suddenly

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.690 align:middle line:84%
realize we are part of
one mind, one specie,

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:12.900 align:middle line:84%
one planet called Mother
Earth, and one destiny

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.453 align:middle line:90%
beyond alpha and omega.

00:09:14.453 --> 00:09:19.290 align:middle line:90%


00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>> The book that we recently
co-wrote with our colleague,

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Elizabeth Rauscher, shows
the history of remote viewing.

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:31.050 align:middle line:90%
Now, what is remote viewing?

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:34.140 align:middle line:84%
It means that you can be
sitting here right now

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:38.040 align:middle line:84%
and seeing exactly what's on
the other side of the planet.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.890 align:middle line:84%
Whether it was in Russia
or whether it's in Egypt,

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:44.490 align:middle line:84%
you could describe to me
exactly what's there from just

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:46.370 align:middle line:90%
sitting in this room right now.

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, there was at
least $2 million

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.650 align:middle line:84%
given by the CIA at the very
beginning of the research

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:54.300 align:middle line:84%
that Russell Targ
and Hal Puthoff

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:57.630 align:middle line:84%
did at Stanford Research
Institute, where Elizabeth

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.490 align:middle line:90%
Rauscher was a part of that.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:02.040 align:middle line:84%
Later on it may have
ballooned up to $6 million,

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.430 align:middle line:84%
and then became part
of the Army's work.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:10.890 align:middle line:84%
>> My wife and I with Elizabeth
decided that after the process

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:14.710 align:middle line:84%
of some 40 years, it was time
to put out this information

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:15.510 align:middle line:90%
in book form.

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.210 align:middle line:84%
I had a very electrifying
event while I

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:21.210 align:middle line:84%
was doing archaeological
research in Israel.

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:23.220 align:middle line:90%
And I asked mentally for a sign.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.260 align:middle line:84%
A tremendous life
flash took place.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:30.150 align:middle line:84%
I thought this was a green
light for publishing information

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.180 align:middle line:84%
that we had at our
fingertips for many years,

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.740 align:middle line:84%
along with research
that we had done

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:38.280 align:middle line:84%
with Dr. Puharich on
the East coast in tandem

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.370 align:middle line:84%
with that which was done
at SRI on the West coast.

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And so with this information,
plus examination of documents

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.810 align:middle line:84%
whereby Elizabeth was
able to look at Desiree

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:52.950 align:middle line:84%
and myself in Israel and
Egypt with such preciseness,

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:56.510 align:middle line:84%
we felt this information simply
had to see the light of day,

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:59.580 align:middle line:84%
had to influence students
in the new sciences

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.620 align:middle line:90%
as to the power of the mind.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.810 align:middle line:10%
Basically, I absorbed
a tremendous amount

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.540 align:middle line:10%
of information, which
led me into contact

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:11.070 align:middle line:10%
with very gifted thinkers
like Dr. Andrija Puharich, who

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.620 align:middle line:10%
worked with the government
in terms of paraphysics,

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.520 align:middle line:10%
parapsychology, several
of the astronauts,

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:21.420 align:middle line:10%
people in high areas of
information gathering.

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And this led into work with
those at Stanford Research

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Institute on the West Coast,
in California, a think tank

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.260 align:middle line:84%
of the top 1% of
thinkers who were looking

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.870 align:middle line:84%
at the power of the mind,
what we will call mind reach,

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.910 align:middle line:84%
to reach out into
other dimensions

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:38.400 align:middle line:84%
through expanded awareness
and consciousness

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.220 align:middle line:84%
and have what was historically
called an epiphany

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:45.510 align:middle line:84%
or a higher experience, where
one sees events yet to come.

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:48.450 align:middle line:84%
I describe it in my other book
called "The Keys of Enoch,"

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:51.030 align:middle line:84%
as a mind-2 event,
things that happened

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:54.870 align:middle line:84%
before they are recorded
in physical time/space.

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:57.840 align:middle line:10%
>> The research group at SRI,
or Stanford Research Institute,

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:01.080 align:middle line:10%
got started really
when Ingo Swan,

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:05.070 align:middle line:10%
who himself was a remote
viewer, approached Hal Puthoff

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:07.680 align:middle line:10%
and ultimately Russell
Targ, and said, hey,

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:10.700 align:middle line:10%
how about doing some
great testing about this?

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:12.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, Ingo actually
could remote view

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:14.380 align:middle line:90%
even all the way to the moon.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:15.180 align:middle line:90%
And he did this.

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:16.800 align:middle line:90%
And he was very accurate.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:20.190 align:middle line:84%
He saw water on the moon,
which has later been confirmed.

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:24.390 align:middle line:84%
But what was amazing is with
Ingo Swan and several others,

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:26.550 align:middle line:84%
like Pat Price,
they could actually

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:29.590 align:middle line:84%
see things going on
in Russia at the time.

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is during
the Cold War, so it

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:36.300 align:middle line:84%
was so shocking to the CIA
that they actually investigated

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.710 align:middle line:90%
where the data came from.

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:39.930 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't believe
that it literally

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.390 align:middle line:90%
came out of the ethers.

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:47.100 align:middle line:84%
But what's really interesting is
you could give a remote viewer

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.060 align:middle line:90%
a coordinate.

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And they wouldn't say--
the northeast, southwest

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:50.910 align:middle line:90%
coordinate.

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:52.451 align:middle line:84%
And they wouldn't
say, hey, you know,

00:12:52.451 --> 00:12:54.900 align:middle line:84%
I think that's like in Russia
and that must be here and so

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:55.710 align:middle line:90%
is this.

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:57.120 align:middle line:90%
That's not how it works.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:01.230 align:middle line:84%
They actually tune into
the actual coordination

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:03.150 align:middle line:84%
of it's in the
north and the east.

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:05.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go and
take my mind there.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And what Elizabeth Rauscher
and Russell Targ found out

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:13.230 align:middle line:84%
is that it's not a sending
and a receiving of a signal,

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:14.580 align:middle line:90%
so there's no time delay.

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.230 align:middle line:90%
It's being there.

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.340 align:middle line:90%
The mind is there.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And that information is then
brought back to the brain here.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.340 align:middle line:90%
But it's instantaneous.

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.140 align:middle line:84%
It's faster than
the speed of light.

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's why also non-locality
that the scientists are

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:32.950 align:middle line:84%
working with quantum physics
is telling us the same thing.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Einstein called this spooky
action at a distance,

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.580 align:middle line:84%
because he knew that
these things took place

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:41.880 align:middle line:84%
but he couldn't
really describe it.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:45.060 align:middle line:84%
You can actually have
a portion of a photon

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.970 align:middle line:84%
or an atom in one place
and then it could be

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:49.630 align:middle line:90%
hundreds of light years away.

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And if you change the
direction of that photon,

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.730 align:middle line:84%
the whole other one
completely shifts because they

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:58.530 align:middle line:90%
were at one point entangled.

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:02.100 align:middle line:84%
But what we're saying
is, we're all entangled.

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Every one of us is entangled
into this web of life.

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And we all came from the
same substance of life.

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.430 align:middle line:84%
What's also interesting
is two years ago,

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:15.000 align:middle line:84%
scientists have shown
this entanglement.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.870 align:middle line:84%
They've actually taken a photon,
put it into this rubidium cloud

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:23.630 align:middle line:84%
and they've been able
to entangle 3,000 atoms.

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And they are going
to be using this

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:29.680 align:middle line:84%
for a type of cloud computer
information connection.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.650 align:middle line:84%
So basically, everything
vibrates together.

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And they can react
to that 1 photon

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.810 align:middle line:84%
and all 3,000 other
atoms actually

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.220 align:middle line:90%
relate instantaneously to it.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:43.000 align:middle line:84%
This is what entanglement
is all about.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.570 align:middle line:10%
>> The whole idea of mind
dynamics is to show the many

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:50.950 align:middle line:10%
possibilities that we have if
we understand how we do not have

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:55.360 align:middle line:10%
a real understanding of
higher consciousness or how

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:59.125 align:middle line:10%
consciousness can shape
the physical world we exist

00:14:59.125 --> 00:15:02.710 align:middle line:10%
in, what Heisenberg received his
Nobel Prize for, how thoughts

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:05.770 align:middle line:10%
influence the mature
realm of creation.

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:11.060 align:middle line:84%
To put it very simply,
our concept of science

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:15.980 align:middle line:84%
is consciousness at work
towards a human-orientated

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:19.610 align:middle line:84%
rather than an object-orientated
world, where our consciousness

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:23.970 align:middle line:84%
shapes and actually
transforms reality just enough

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:27.200 align:middle line:84%
that transformations
and solutions

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.900 align:middle line:90%
are more quickly available.

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:33.050 align:middle line:84%
In essence, the mind
as a supercomputer

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:37.840 align:middle line:84%
becomes supercharged to
do a variety of things

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.790 align:middle line:84%
not only in the sciences,
but also in the arts

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:43.700 align:middle line:84%
and what I will call
consciousness that understands

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:47.910 align:middle line:84%
that we are embryo gods
waking up to being co-creators

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:48.710 align:middle line:90%
of our reality.

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:52.640 align:middle line:84%
We don't simply receive, but
we give and participate along

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:59.290 align:middle line:84%
with receiving the great norms
of history, society, and truth.

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Elizabeth Rauscher says
this is not all taking place

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.980 align:middle line:84%
in the three dimensions of
space or the fourth dimension

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:07.090 align:middle line:90%
of time.

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:10.480 align:middle line:84%
She calls it eighth space,
so you have the four and then

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.120 align:middle line:90%
another four dimensions.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.697 align:middle line:84%
And on that fourth
or eighth level,

00:16:15.697 --> 00:16:17.780 align:middle line:84%
we'll say, the higher
level, the eighth dimension,

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:22.180 align:middle line:84%
the eighth space, you actually
have everything interconnected.

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And this goes beyond the
concept of whether there's

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:28.780 align:middle line:90%
determination in our lives.

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.960 align:middle line:84%
We think if you can
reach that eighth space

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.820 align:middle line:84%
and you can work in that eighth
space, which all of us can do,

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:36.440 align:middle line:90%
we can literally change reality.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.990 align:middle line:90%
And that's the important thing.

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:40.730 align:middle line:84%
We are not stuck
in this reality.

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:43.600 align:middle line:84%
We can change the
way things are going

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:48.550 align:middle line:84%
by having a higher understanding
of who we are, because we all

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.290 align:middle line:90%
function in that eighth space.

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And the problem with all of
us that we're growing into now

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:57.670 align:middle line:84%
is that we've been blinded
to see that we're limited

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:59.500 align:middle line:90%
to this three-dimensional body.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:02.650 align:middle line:84%
So the step to
evolutionary consciousness

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:05.680 align:middle line:84%
is coming through science,
through quantum physics, coming

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.569 align:middle line:84%
through these
experiments, but also

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:10.300 align:middle line:84%
coming through an
awareness of each of us

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:15.220 align:middle line:84%
that we have a greater ability
to function and to change

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.869 align:middle line:90%
our reality.

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:20.980 align:middle line:84%
The amazing thing about
"Mind Dynamics" as a book

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:24.220 align:middle line:84%
is it shows everyone
that we have

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:26.170 align:middle line:90%
the ability to remote view.

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:30.500 align:middle line:84%
It also shows the
scientist what that means,

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:34.870 align:middle line:84%
where remote viewing fits
into the greater picture.

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:38.350 align:middle line:84%
That is a
multi-dimensional picture.

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:39.680 align:middle line:90%
Why is that important?

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:43.006 align:middle line:84%
Well, we only see
a limited reality.

00:17:43.006 --> 00:17:45.130 align:middle line:84%
When you start working with
these other dimensions,

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:49.870 align:middle line:84%
like string theorists, we
are able to see the fact

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:52.480 align:middle line:90%
that it's not all here.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.890 align:middle line:90%
It's also there.

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And when it's there, we wonder,
what else is in the cosmos?

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.360 align:middle line:84%
We always think it's our
consciousness out there.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.010 align:middle line:90%
But it's not our consciousness.

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:06.880 align:middle line:84%
It's us and them and them
and them and them and them.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And they're
influencing us as well.

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.560 align:middle line:84%
So this is part of the
whole mind dynamics,

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:16.900 align:middle line:84%
to realize the multi-dimensional
reality that we are part of.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Mind dynamics
is the real X file,

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:24.310 align:middle line:84%
the opening of the box of
the brain to think and work

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:28.720 align:middle line:84%
multi-dimensionally, the ability
to show the average person that

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:33.130 align:middle line:84%
he or she has an ability to
use more of the brain and more

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:36.940 align:middle line:84%
of the consciousness,
power of creativity.

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:38.560 align:middle line:84%
We call it
co-creativity, where we

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.320 align:middle line:84%
begin to use that part of
the brain that normally

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.900 align:middle line:90%
isn't harnessed or understood.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.300 align:middle line:84%
For example, we
have the traditions

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.060 align:middle line:84%
that the male is the dominant
player in the world of science,

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:52.330 align:middle line:84%
the three-dimensional;
the female in the arts,

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:54.040 align:middle line:84%
the metaphysical,
the multidimensional.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Putting the two
together in balance

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:59.740 align:middle line:84%
and the higher harmonic
of consciousness

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:04.820 align:middle line:84%
allows vast areas of information
to be experienced quickly.

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And so there is
a quantum change,

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:09.280 align:middle line:84%
a whole new understanding
of the potential of what

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.580 align:middle line:84%
the ancient Buddhist
scholars describe

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.410 align:middle line:84%
in their beautiful thangkas,
or pictures, of multi-heads

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:16.510 align:middle line:90%
on the top of the human head.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:19.120 align:middle line:84%
We become
multidimensional beings.

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.790 align:middle line:84%
We also become aware that
we are non-local beings.

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:25.360 align:middle line:84%
We are here but we are also
in an intellectual, vibratory

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.510 align:middle line:84%
sense all throughout
the universe.

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:30.400 align:middle line:84%
It's the universal mind and
the human mind coming together

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.890 align:middle line:90%
and experiencing facts of life.

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:38.760 align:middle line:90%


00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:45.570 align:middle line:84%
I have shown in my work that
there is a triggering mechanism

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:48.420 align:middle line:84%
to how our DNA/RNA
is orchestrated

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:52.950 align:middle line:84%
by the vibratory field
behind the material world

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:55.500 align:middle line:84%
that we accept as
physical reality.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.920 align:middle line:10%
It's like experiencing
DNA/RNA but understanding

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.890 align:middle line:10%
RNA comes before
DNA, with a higher

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:05.670 align:middle line:10%
signal-to-noise
relationship, that is to say,

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:08.910 align:middle line:10%
there is a music, a
symphony of the spheres,

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:11.370 align:middle line:10%
what the Greeks called
the music of the spheres,

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:13.980 align:middle line:10%
behind the material
world we accept

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:17.550 align:middle line:10%
that actually orchestrates
the individual parts

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:18.900 align:middle line:10%
within our body.

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And this creates a
type of disposition

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:27.240 align:middle line:84%
towards how we create with
the envelope of energy

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:31.320 align:middle line:84%
and DNA within ourselves a
whole new concept of evolution.

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:33.480 align:middle line:84%
It can actually
speed up evolution.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:37.140 align:middle line:84%
We have discovered that there
is a linkage of DNA/RNA that

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:40.500 align:middle line:84%
is too complex for the
normal process of evolution.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.490 align:middle line:84%
There has to be what I call
a higher evolutionary process

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:47.760 align:middle line:84%
involved from space, from what
we will call cosmic cultures

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.987 align:middle line:84%
or civilizations that some
will have set in motion

00:20:50.987 --> 00:20:53.070 align:middle line:84%
what we take for granted
with the normal blueprint

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:54.770 align:middle line:90%
of DNA/RNA.

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:58.140 align:middle line:84%
We are simply
biotransducers or receivers

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:00.900 align:middle line:84%
of information fed into
this biological form we

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.850 align:middle line:90%
call the human body.

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And now we have come into
a transformative moment,

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.970 align:middle line:84%
realizing that we
have many bodies, that

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:12.750 align:middle line:84%
is to say vibratory
bodies, within our physical

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:14.460 align:middle line:90%
and atomical self.

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And these vibratory
bodies hold the key

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:24.060 align:middle line:84%
to epigenetics, epikinetics,
and the realization of life

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:28.300 align:middle line:84%
beyond the threshold of what we
call the normal span of life.

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:33.712 align:middle line:90%


00:21:33.712 --> 00:21:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Epigenetics is a realization
that all parts of the body

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.560 align:middle line:84%
are part of the vibratory
communicative code that

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.890 align:middle line:84%
are taking place, that we
as a human being learned

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:48.340 align:middle line:84%
from all parts of our
body, all chakra centers,

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:51.930 align:middle line:84%
according to the ancient Indian
Sanskrit traditions of the Far

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:53.680 align:middle line:84%
East, according to
what we've been working

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.530 align:middle line:84%
with in Western science,
through the great thinkers

00:21:56.530 --> 00:22:00.540 align:middle line:84%
such as Basil Hiley or
Karl Pribram or others,

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:03.220 align:middle line:84%
that there is more than
just the neuron that's

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:06.250 align:middle line:84%
the transmitter of information
or the basis of knowledge.

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:09.220 align:middle line:84%
The whole microcosmos
of the human body

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:13.730 align:middle line:84%
is a process of
evolutionary experience.

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And when we begin to use
more levels of information

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:22.190 align:middle line:84%
gathering, then we can increase
our vibratory code, in essence.

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:26.110 align:middle line:10%
Our ability to think becomes
like a vibratory laser,

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:29.620 align:middle line:10%
reaching out more quickly
with the brilliance

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.830 align:middle line:10%
of a person like
John von Neumann, who

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:37.210 align:middle line:10%
set in motion the whole concept
of how we can build computers

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:39.250 align:middle line:10%
to work with the human
mind to create as it were

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:42.670 align:middle line:10%
a whole new landscape of
a transhuman experience,

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:46.330 align:middle line:10%
where we collectively put our
minds, our computers together

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:48.850 align:middle line:10%
to create a whole new
transformation of the entirety

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:52.720 align:middle line:10%
of life as a collectivity
rather than a singularity.

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of our work has been
with the aboriginal peoples,

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:59.800 align:middle line:84%
as well as the peoples of the
indigenous nation of Xavante

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:00.980 align:middle line:90%
in Brazil.

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And what we found when
we work with these people

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:06.500 align:middle line:84%
is that they're
actually in your heads.

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of
the reasons for that

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:11.110 align:middle line:84%
is because they
actually sleep together

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:14.950 align:middle line:84%
all in one room, many of them,
maybe 20, without any walls.

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And you all become
like part of a vibe.

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:19.220 align:middle line:10%
There's a consciousness field.

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.490 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's the
most important message

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:22.540 align:middle line:10%
to get across.

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:25.540 align:middle line:10%
We see ourselves as physical.

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:29.730 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, we started
from the consciousness field.

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:34.160 align:middle line:84%
That consciousness field
made us who we are today.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's by working
with the consciousness

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:36.830 align:middle line:90%
that we can shift.

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:38.920 align:middle line:84%
So what did the
indigenous people do?

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, they link-- they
come right into your brain.

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:43.780 align:middle line:90%
You can feel them.

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.760 align:middle line:84%
They can know what
you're thinking about.

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:49.300 align:middle line:84%
They can literally
help you in any way.

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:50.420 align:middle line:90%
This is how they work.

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:51.790 align:middle line:90%
This is their nature.

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And that really is our nature
as well, but we've blocked it.

00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:59.920 align:middle line:84%
In fact, sadly, with a lot
of the electronics also

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.200 align:middle line:84%
on the downside, we
are sitting there

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.420 align:middle line:84%
with our cell
phones or our iPads,

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:07.360 align:middle line:84%
blocking the world around
us, instead of trying

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.130 align:middle line:90%
to become part of that world.

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:10.852 align:middle line:90%
And that's what's so important.

00:24:10.852 --> 00:24:15.780 align:middle line:90%


00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>> We were at a crossroads,
either going too much towards

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:24.630 align:middle line:84%
a science-based technology,
where the "human"

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:26.280 align:middle line:84%
as we know him, in
quotation marks,

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.720 align:middle line:84%
will be secondary
to a supercomputer,

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.470 align:middle line:84%
or we have the opportunity as
illustrated in "Mind Dynamics"

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:35.010 align:middle line:84%
to use the gifts of spirits,
the gifts of consciousness

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:38.680 align:middle line:84%
to acquire higher levels
of information processing

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.640 align:middle line:84%
and scientific breakthroughs
through the power of mind

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.490 align:middle line:84%
and spirit, or the higher
consciousness field,

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:49.390 align:middle line:84%
without technology
being in the foreground.

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:52.590 align:middle line:84%
We are in the process of
finding the divine spark

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:56.640 align:middle line:84%
within ourselves that brings us
into what historic writers call

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.050 align:middle line:84%
the Buddhahood or the
Christhood experience,

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:03.240 align:middle line:84%
of realizing that we have
a man and a woman that

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:06.370 align:middle line:84%
can participate also
with the divine source,

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:09.600 align:middle line:84%
a man-god partnership or
a woman-god partnership.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And my experience
with the light is

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:15.510 align:middle line:84%
that we are at the
brink of actual contact

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:17.640 align:middle line:84%
with higher beings
of intelligence that

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.140 align:middle line:84%
are not only in the
fifth dimension,

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:22.620 align:middle line:84%
but in the sixth and seventh,
and that we are being carefully

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:26.780 align:middle line:84%
orchestrated right now in
the arts, in the sciences,

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:28.830 align:middle line:84%
and in the historic
investigations

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:31.380 align:middle line:84%
we're doing to realize
that life on this planet

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:35.376 align:middle line:84%
is one of many cycles of
contact with the high worlds.

00:25:35.376 --> 00:25:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And now we must
prepare ourselves

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:39.240 align:middle line:84%
with the right
psychology and sociology

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.270 align:middle line:84%
to reach out and visualize
what Michelangelo

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:46.440 align:middle line:84%
did in the Sistine Chapel,
the man and the god-force

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.040 align:middle line:90%
where fingers touching.

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:51.300 align:middle line:84%
We are at the point
of touching fingertips

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:53.760 align:middle line:84%
of ultra-terrestrial
intelligence

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:58.770 align:middle line:84%
that will make us aware that
we are more than human beings.

00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:02.520 align:middle line:84%
We are universal beings, what
the ancient philosophers called

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:07.770 align:middle line:84%
homo universalis, humans that
are destined for the stars

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:09.730 align:middle line:90%
and beyond.

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:14.690 align:middle line:84%
We are the life
force now in action.

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:18.720 align:middle line:84%
In 1973, as a result of the
higher light experiences I had,

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:22.160 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a series of mathematical
theorems on climate change,

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:25.140 align:middle line:84%
of how things would speed up
at the polar areas of Mother

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:25.950 align:middle line:90%
Earth.

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:29.580 align:middle line:10%
I also wrote theorems
regarding how DNA/RNA work.

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:34.205 align:middle line:10%
And they live on a level
of higher transduction

00:26:34.205 --> 00:26:36.000 align:middle line:10%
or communication.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.720 align:middle line:10%
And now, after 40-some
years, these theories

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:44.250 align:middle line:10%
are now being accepted
by scientific think tanks

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:46.890 align:middle line:10%
and research groups even
at the United Nations,

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:50.310 align:middle line:10%
at world forums dealing
with climate change.

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:52.590 align:middle line:84%
My work has been looked
at very seriously

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:55.620 align:middle line:84%
as having some remarkable
insights into how

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:58.371 align:middle line:90%
quickly changes have come.

00:26:58.371 --> 00:27:00.990 align:middle line:84%
The mathematical
theories have proven

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:03.160 align:middle line:90%
to be correct, on target.

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And if these are
correct, then what

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.380 align:middle line:84%
Carlos Santana has
seen in my work dealing

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:10.530 align:middle line:84%
with transformational
musical work,

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:15.690 align:middle line:84%
we need a music of
vision and compassion,

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:19.440 align:middle line:84%
a whole new music of
the spheres will become

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.660 align:middle line:90%
a reality in our lifetime.

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:24.690 align:middle line:90%
We will have a new renaissance.

00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And we will sing
with a transhuman

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:30.930 align:middle line:84%
and an interspecie communication
code to the dolphins,

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:33.420 align:middle line:84%
to the whales, and even
to the extraterrestrials.
