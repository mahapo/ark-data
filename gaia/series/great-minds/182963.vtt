00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm David Adair.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
know me as Rocket Man.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually more
known in science,

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.210 align:middle line:84%
in applications of
propulsion and power.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.810 align:middle line:10%
How things started,
that's the story.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.540 align:middle line:84%
I was born in Welch,
West Virginia.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.550 align:middle line:90%
My dad was a coal miner.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And my mother taught
him to read and write.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.960 align:middle line:90%
He was a functional illiterate.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.140 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of--
the irony of it is

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm working quantum physics,
differential mechanics when

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm seven.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.245 align:middle line:90%
Go figure that.

00:00:58.245 --> 00:01:01.410 align:middle line:90%


00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.120 align:middle line:84%
What really made things work for
me on a social level was here

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting over in
the local library.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And the librarian, she saw me
sitting in a corner every day,

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.090 align:middle line:90%
over there reading.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And she came over and she said,
are you reading these books?

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, there's
no pictures in them.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.750 align:middle line:90%
And she went, um.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.510 align:middle line:10%
So she goes, how much do
you remember of these books?

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.352 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:01:29.352 --> 00:01:31.560 align:middle line:84%
So she reaches over my head
and pulls this book down.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, OK, quantum
physics theory on singularity.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.183 align:middle line:90%
What does it say?

00:01:38.183 --> 00:01:39.350 align:middle line:90%
I remembered the first page.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.860 align:middle line:84%
I went, a singularity
is at the event horizon

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.900 align:middle line:90%
of a collapsed star.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And it forms when the matter
starts collapsing on itself

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.960 align:middle line:90%
from the gravitational tide.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.210 align:middle line:84%
She slams the book shut and
puts it back on the shelf.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.010 align:middle line:84%
She says, OK, how many of these
have you read is this corner?

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.810 align:middle line:90%
All of them.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.070 align:middle line:90%
It was like 600 books.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.230 align:middle line:90%
And she went, well--

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.680 align:middle line:90%
well, do you want to read more?

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.150 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yeah.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And they made me an
assistant librarian.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.550 align:middle line:90%
And I was the only boy there.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.220 align:middle line:84%
Everybody else was
girls and women.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.602 align:middle line:84%
And she said, just work
on the library stuff.

00:02:17.602 --> 00:02:18.810 align:middle line:90%
And then order what you need.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And don't tell anybody
we're doing this.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.887 align:middle line:84%
And you'll have access
to whatever is out there

00:02:24.887 --> 00:02:25.970 align:middle line:90%
on the rest of the planet.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.370 align:middle line:90%


00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.850 align:middle line:84%
You can read all day
long how to swim.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.760 align:middle line:84%
But until you get in the water,
you really don't know how.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.040 align:middle line:84%
I thought, you know, I
need to learn rocketry

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.660 align:middle line:84%
because as a hammer is to a
carpenter, rockets were to me.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.510 align:middle line:10%
They're just a tool.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.600 align:middle line:10%
What I was using the
rockets for is a medium

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.490 align:middle line:10%
to test the hypothesis of my
theorem of a field containment

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.110 align:middle line:10%
for new type of nuclear reactor.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.190 align:middle line:90%
It's fusion containment.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.410 align:middle line:84%
The only thing you all
know about nuclear power,

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.080 align:middle line:84%
you know the evil twin,
which is fission and fusion

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.180 align:middle line:90%
without containment.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.270 align:middle line:84%
You produce so much
waste with the pile rods.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.803 align:middle line:84%
They can come out of
their water containment

00:03:15.803 --> 00:03:17.470 align:middle line:84%
and overheat, and
melt through the Earth

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.470 align:middle line:90%
to China, "China Syndrome."

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:26.530 align:middle line:84%
They can make nuclear warhead
fuel out of these pile rods.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's just a nasty
system all the way around.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.670 align:middle line:90%
And it's dirty.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.970 align:middle line:84%
Contamination lasting
for 30,000 years,

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.750 align:middle line:84%
depending on what
fuel you're using.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.080 align:middle line:84%
However, the good twin,
which you have not met,

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.763 align:middle line:90%
is fusion containment.

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:43.695 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:43.695 --> 00:03:48.050 align:middle line:90%


00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.240 align:middle line:84%
It cannot melt down
like a "China Syndrome."

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.310 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have fuel rods.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.540 align:middle line:10%
And in my reactor, I made it
out of deuterium, seawater.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.530 align:middle line:10%
The containment
fields are like--

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.805 align:middle line:10%
it's like a magnetic bottle.

00:04:02.805 --> 00:04:04.430 align:middle line:10%
As a matter of fact,
Millennials didn't

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.330 align:middle line:10%
like my term, electromagnetic
fusion containment.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.250 align:middle line:84%
So they shortened it
down to this phrase,

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.190 align:middle line:90%
which is technically accurate.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.696 align:middle line:10%
It's called a star in a jar.

00:04:15.696 --> 00:04:17.980 align:middle line:10%
You see, there's only two
type of rocket engines

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.130 align:middle line:10%
in the world, liquid fuel
and solid propellant.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.595 align:middle line:84%
What I was aiming for is
something that was neither one,

00:04:24.595 --> 00:04:26.800 align:middle line:84%
the star in a jar,
electromagnetic fusion

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.570 align:middle line:90%
containment engine.

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.410 align:middle line:84%
It cannot melt down
like a "China Syndrome."

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.950 align:middle line:84%
The very first rocket I
built was sophisticated.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.750 align:middle line:84%
It was a cryogenic pumper, which
is the fluids inside the rocket

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.320 align:middle line:84%
engine are 325
degrees below zero.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.080 align:middle line:84%
It's liquid hydrogen,
liquid oxygen.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And it produced--
the BTUs involved,

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.200 align:middle line:84%
it really produces quite
a bit of a chain reaction.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.010 align:middle line:10%
You get a lot of
power out this rocket.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.230 align:middle line:90%
My friends came over.

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And we're all about
seven or eight years old.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.510 align:middle line:84%
My rocket is way
taller than we are.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.820 align:middle line:90%
It's about 7, 8 foot tall.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.640 align:middle line:84%
So they're all standing down
there about two feet away

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.030 align:middle line:90%
from it, looking at it.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm about a hundred feet
away, up at launch control.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.865 align:middle line:84%
And I told them, come
on up here, guys.

00:05:15.865 --> 00:05:17.730 align:middle line:90%
They go, why?

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.990 align:middle line:90%
It's not safe down there.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.510 align:middle line:84%
So they came up and
stood next to me.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:23.740 align:middle line:90%
And I turned on the pumps.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And the air into the
cryogenics starts pumping.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.217 align:middle line:90%
Then we get ignition.

00:05:28.217 --> 00:05:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And the flames come
out of this thing.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And it leaves the backyard
area, where I had.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And it incinerates an area
the size of a football field,

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.473 align:middle line:90%
just burnt to a crisp.

00:05:40.473 --> 00:05:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And I mean the
flame are gigantic.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.050 align:middle line:90%
And this thing takes off.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And its clocking
probably a modest speed

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.520 align:middle line:90%
about 4,000 miles an hour.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.500 align:middle line:90%
And you can hear it thundering.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.095 align:middle line:84%
We're watching it
go out of sight.

00:05:56.095 --> 00:05:58.095 align:middle line:84%
And my mother, she said,
everything in the house

00:05:58.095 --> 00:05:58.895 align:middle line:90%
is rattling.

00:05:58.895 --> 00:06:00.910 align:middle line:84%
So she come out
of there, running.

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.130 align:middle line:84%
My very first launch
went 52,000 feet.

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.810 align:middle line:90%
That's 10 miles.

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And I brought it back
by radio control.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.020 align:middle line:84%
I put generators in the
thrust vanes to steer it.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.840 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.130 align:middle line:90%


00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:23.260 align:middle line:84%
My mother's father was
the mine superintendent.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.375 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't want
his grandchildren

00:06:25.375 --> 00:06:30.070 align:middle line:84%
to end up fatherless cause, boy,
people died a lot in those coal

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.810 align:middle line:90%
mines back in the day.

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.490 align:middle line:84%
So my dad was really gifted
at mechanics, auto mechanics.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:41.110 align:middle line:84%
So his father-in-law got him
his own private service station.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And it was a screaming
success from the first week.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.580 align:middle line:84%
But I remember when I was,
like, three or four years old,

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.450 align:middle line:84%
watching my parents put blankets
over the windows at 3 o'clock

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:56.560 align:middle line:84%
in the morning, so no one could
see the lights of the garage.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.360 align:middle line:84%
The reason why
the best customers

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.781 align:middle line:90%
would come in at that time.

00:07:00.781 --> 00:07:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And they'd pull in
with these cars.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.180 align:middle line:84%
They had 396
Chrysler Hemi engines

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.210 align:middle line:84%
under the hood, a
powerful engine.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And in the trunk, you
have a 200 gallon tank.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, a gallon weighs about
nine pounds per gallon.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.685 align:middle line:84%
So you have, like, 1,800
pounds in this trunk.

00:07:18.685 --> 00:07:20.500 align:middle line:90%
And it's not gasoline.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.300 align:middle line:90%
It's moonshine.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.630 align:middle line:90%
These are moon runners.

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:28.590 align:middle line:84%
So dad would tune these
cars up till they were just

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:29.910 align:middle line:90%
Mopar Missiles.

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And revenuers had a hard time
trying to catch these guys.

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And what people don't know,
that was the birth of NASCAR.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.900 align:middle line:84%
The moon drivers
are driving so fast

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:47.340 align:middle line:84%
on curvy mountain roads,
run away from the revenuers.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.820 align:middle line:10%
They became the
perfect car drivers.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:55.380 align:middle line:10%
It's Fred Lorenzen, and
Buddy Baker, A.J. Foyt,

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:59.310 align:middle line:10%
Richard Petty, all
these people, Lee Petty.

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:02.730 align:middle line:90%
They became the NASCAR drivers.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:05.100 align:middle line:90%
And they came from moon runners.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And my dad was the guy
doing the car engines.

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And why does that have a
bearing on all this story?

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever stopped to
think what a NASA rocket shop

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:21.060 align:middle line:90%
and a NASCAR shop look like?

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.140 align:middle line:90%
They're mirrors of each other.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Both shops produce
one thing, speed.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And their raw materials,
aircraft aluminum,

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:34.299 align:middle line:84%
stainless steel, titanium,
exact same materials.

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:38.950 align:middle line:10%
So we had fuels like nitro,
methane, liquid oxygen,

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.620 align:middle line:10%
liquid hydrogen and all the
special handling equipment

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:42.730 align:middle line:10%
for all that.

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:47.890 align:middle line:84%
So we had everything
we needed there for me

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:49.940 align:middle line:90%
to build my first rocket.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:56.050 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:56.050 --> 00:09:01.710 align:middle line:84%
Think about that statement,
clean, thermal, nuclear power,

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:03.220 align:middle line:90%
no radiation.

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.960 align:middle line:84%
You now have all
the power that you

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:09.320 align:middle line:84%
need to run across the
planet, zero carbon footprint.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.360 align:middle line:84%
We have two little propellants
about the size of baby peas.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And in my reactor, I made
it out deuterium, seawater.

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.080 align:middle line:90%
How much fuel do we have?

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.600 align:middle line:90%
The Earth is covered, 3/4 of it.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.870 align:middle line:90%
So it's like a magnetic bottle.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:29.470 align:middle line:90%
You've got a magnetic bottle.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And you start a nuclear
chain reaction inside.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Basically, you detonate
an H-bomb in containment.

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:38.066 align:middle line:84%
You're standing
right there with it.

00:09:38.066 --> 00:09:40.030 align:middle line:90%
You better hope it works.

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:43.510 align:middle line:84%
Inside that containment
field, the temperatures

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:47.330 align:middle line:84%
are running up to about 100
million degrees centigrade.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:51.660 align:middle line:84%
That's 10,000 times hotter
than the core of the Sun.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And at that temperature, when
you shut down the reactor,

00:09:55.750 --> 00:10:00.370 align:middle line:84%
you walk in the reactor wearing
shirtsleeves, zero radiation.

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:02.080 align:middle line:90%
Nothing's left.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.320 align:middle line:84%
So you have clean,
thermal, fusion power,

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.210 align:middle line:90%
that you can't make waste.

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:10.510 align:middle line:84%
You can't make nuclear
fuel for warheads with it.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:12.360 align:middle line:90%
You can't have a meltdown.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.920 align:middle line:90%
And you got no radiation.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.100 align:middle line:90%
Think that change things?

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you don't like
that, I got some other toys

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.950 align:middle line:90%
that come with it.

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:23.800 align:middle line:84%
When I was doing the
math, the algorithms

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.320 align:middle line:84%
kept showing an anomaly,
which I couldn't figure out

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.120 align:middle line:90%
what it was.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.190 align:middle line:90%
It was a repeating pattern.

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And finally I figured
out what it was.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.480 align:middle line:90%
It was an inertia dampener.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.350 align:middle line:84%
So what good is a
inertia dampener?

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:43.783 align:middle line:84%
All right, has everybody
seen Bugs Bunny?

00:10:43.783 --> 00:10:45.700 align:middle line:84%
When him and his friends
got in this airplane,

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:47.950 align:middle line:84%
it ran out of fuel, and
falling back to Earth,

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:50.110 align:middle line:84%
it's going so fast the
speedometer is running off

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:51.310 align:middle line:90%
the dials.

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:53.630 align:middle line:84%
They're all screaming,
we're going to die.

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:54.610 align:middle line:90%
And they are.

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And right before the plane hits
the ground, Bugs opens the door

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:59.320 align:middle line:84%
and steps out with
all its friends.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.710 align:middle line:90%
And the plane crashes.

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:02.050 align:middle line:90%
And they're fine.

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:03.850 align:middle line:90%
That looks like a cartoon.

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:04.660 align:middle line:90%
That's not.

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:08.200 align:middle line:10%
That's exactly what an
inertial dampener will do.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.410 align:middle line:84%
It removes you from
the gravity's influence

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:12.890 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And it stops the inertia,
momentum, and kinetic energy.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.000 align:middle line:90%
It neutralizes all of it.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.530 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, why would you
want something like that?

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:26.980 align:middle line:84%
You have an inertial dampener
under the hood of your car.

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:29.830 align:middle line:84%
You lose control, with
your family in the car.

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:32.890 align:middle line:84%
80 miles an hour, you
hit a bridge head on.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:34.760 align:middle line:10%
The car is tore all to pieces.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:35.560 align:middle line:10%
You step out.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.510 align:middle line:10%
And your clothes are
not even wrinkled.

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:41.050 align:middle line:10%
That's what an inertial
dampener could do.

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:44.900 align:middle line:84%
But it also answers
another question.

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:48.610 align:middle line:84%
How do UFOs come in,
at 5,000 miles an hour,

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:51.100 align:middle line:90%
and do a 90 degree turn?

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.170 align:middle line:84%
Anything inside
going to be ripped--

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.970 align:middle line:84%
actually, it not going
to be ripped apart.

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:56.900 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
reduced to a liquid.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:00.250 align:middle line:84%
They're going to look like soup
because they're just destroyed

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:03.430 align:middle line:84%
by the gravitational
torrents of what's

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:09.110 align:middle line:84%
going on with momentum, and
inertia, and kinetic energy.

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:13.450 align:middle line:84%
However, if the spacecraft
has a sphere inside itself--

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:16.025 align:middle line:84%
there's one outside
and one on the inside.

00:12:16.025 --> 00:12:16.900 align:middle line:90%
And they can do that.

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.540 align:middle line:90%
And they feel nothing.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.010 align:middle line:90%
So that's how they operate.

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And that means that
most of these UFOs

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.766 align:middle line:84%
are using a fusion
containment drive.

00:12:26.766 --> 00:12:33.670 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:36.610 align:middle line:84%
At about age 40 or
41, my mother was

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:41.370 align:middle line:84%
the first female
coronary technician

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:43.470 align:middle line:84%
that took over a brand
new hospital built there,

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:46.110 align:middle line:90%
called Rowan Memorial.

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:50.280 align:middle line:84%
One of her first patients
with a guy named Irving LeMay.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.610 align:middle line:84%
He was 93 years old,
mean as a snake.

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:56.700 align:middle line:84%
Knocked out one of her
nurses with a cane.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And their son, named
Curtis, would come in.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:04.710 align:middle line:84%
That's Curtis LeMay,
four-star general,

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:06.990 align:middle line:90%
chief of the joint chiefs.

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:10.050 align:middle line:10%
The general that's standing
next to John Kennedy

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:12.060 align:middle line:10%
in the Cuban
Missile Crisis, he's

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:15.030 align:middle line:10%
the one that will push the
buttons and retaliate for us.

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:21.000 align:middle line:10%
The guy-- designer of the B-52
Stratofortress nuclear bomber,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.010 align:middle line:10%
founder and inventor of
SAC, Strategic Air Command,

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:29.340 align:middle line:10%
our nuclear deterrent
forces that exist today.

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:33.150 align:middle line:84%
Needless to say, the guy was
a little bit of a big item.

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:35.122 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to come
and see his dad.

00:13:35.122 --> 00:13:37.580 align:middle line:84%
So he would have to come in
about 3 o'clock in the morning.

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And he had go through my
mother to see his dad.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And after a while,
they became friends.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:47.443 align:middle line:84%
And he asked her one
day about her family.

00:13:47.443 --> 00:13:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And she says, well,
I've got three boys.

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Two of them are
kind of normal kids.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.880 align:middle line:10%
The third one, the
youngest one, there's

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.280 align:middle line:10%
something strange about him.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.750 align:middle line:10%
And LeMay was asked--

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:00.120 align:middle line:10%
Curtis LeMay said, well,
what's strange about it?

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.030 align:middle line:84%
He's always launching
these rockets and missiles.

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, what like
these little Estes

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:08.010 align:middle line:90%
rockets, and stuff?

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.140 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no, no.

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.985 align:middle line:90%
They're taller than the door.

00:14:11.985 --> 00:14:13.470 align:middle line:90%
They're made of metal.

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:16.652 align:middle line:84%
And he called them
cryogenic fuel.

00:14:16.652 --> 00:14:17.610 align:middle line:90%
Well, LeMay hears that.

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:20.290 align:middle line:10%
And he says, does he write
anything down in a book?

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:22.440 align:middle line:84%
She says yeah, he's
got this big notebook.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.720 align:middle line:90%
Can you bring that thing here?

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.070 align:middle line:90%
So I go to bed at 11:00.

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:27.625 align:middle line:90%
She goes to work.

00:14:27.625 --> 00:14:28.500 align:middle line:90%
She took my notebook.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.710 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know it.

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:31.380 align:middle line:90%
LeMay opens it up.

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And its got all my
quantum theories in it.

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:35.810 align:middle line:90%
He's reading it.

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And he asks-- he turns and asks
mother, you got a photocopier?

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:43.795 align:middle line:84%
So he copies about a
third of this notebook,

00:14:43.795 --> 00:14:44.670 align:middle line:90%
gives it back to her.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:45.700 align:middle line:90%
She's bringing this back.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:46.500 align:middle line:90%
Put it on a desk.

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
it's left the house.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:53.640 align:middle line:10%
He's now got all these first
round formulas I've got.

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:56.190 align:middle line:10%
He takes it over to
Battelle Memorial,

00:14:56.190 --> 00:15:00.340 align:middle line:10%
the gigantic think
tank in Columbus, Ohio.

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And he asks, is there anything--
is just chicken scratch

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:05.570 align:middle line:90%
or is there something to it?

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:08.735 align:middle line:84%
They look at it and come
back, where is this person?

00:15:08.735 --> 00:15:12.200 align:middle line:84%
What institution--
who's he working with,

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.500 align:middle line:90%
Battelle Labs or something?

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.300 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:18.625 align:middle line:84%
It's some kid out in cow
fields, launching rockets.

00:15:18.625 --> 00:15:21.240 align:middle line:90%
And they said, you're kidding.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.820 align:middle line:90%


00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:26.460 align:middle line:84%
He's working on
fusion containment.

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:27.720 align:middle line:90%
And he's nailing it down.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.660 align:middle line:90%
He's dead on target.

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:30.660 align:middle line:90%
And he's ahead of us.

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:37.110 align:middle line:90%


00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:40.510 align:middle line:84%
When General LeMay got in the
office everything changed.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:44.800 align:middle line:84%
His nickname is
Bombs Away LeMay.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:48.780 align:middle line:10%
And he's known as the Iron
Eagle in his autobiography.

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:51.640 align:middle line:84%
He smokes this big
stogie all the time.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And he's just a
powerful individual.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:16:00.450 align:middle line:84%
Buddy, when he enters into
your life, it's like a tsunami.

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
he wanted to do

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:07.590 align:middle line:90%
was give me whatever I wanted.

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:11.820 align:middle line:84%
On June 20, 1971, it
went from theory to fact

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:15.870 align:middle line:84%
because I launched an
electromagnetic fusion

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:18.480 align:middle line:90%
containment engine rocket.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And I just was
testing the theorems.

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:24.240 align:middle line:90%
It's ridiculously fast.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.430 align:middle line:84%
That kind of power system
shouldn't be launched

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.020 align:middle line:90%
in the Earth's environment.

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.775 align:middle line:90%
It's too much power.

00:16:29.775 --> 00:16:33.060 align:middle line:84%
The thing has only got two
speeds, off and wide open.

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:36.850 align:middle line:90%


00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:41.530 align:middle line:84%
When we launched it, we
were about two miles away.

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And when it left off the pad,
there was a massive explosion.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.530 align:middle line:90%
And we didn't see anything.

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Everybody thought
the rocket blew up.

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:53.380 align:middle line:90%
No, I knew better.

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:57.670 align:middle line:84%
Could you see a .30-06
bullet leave a rifle barrel?

00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:00.430 align:middle line:84%
That's how fast this
rocket was moving.

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:08.710 align:middle line:84%
It went 0, in 3.2
seconds, to about Mach 37.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:13.609 align:middle line:84%
So there's nothing that
fast, not even close.

00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:16.829 align:middle line:84%
That's where my
story takes place.

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:20.020 align:middle line:90%
And it all connects together.

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:23.570 align:middle line:10%
If you would go to Ashland,
Ohio, to the library

00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:26.880 align:middle line:10%
of Congressman John Ashbrook,
who was the congressman that

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.880 align:middle line:10%
was helping when I was
a teenager, building all

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:35.280 align:middle line:10%
this stuff, you will see
the curator open the vault

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.460 align:middle line:10%
and bring these letters out.

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And the very first letter,
dated June 10, 1970,

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.870 align:middle line:84%
says Dear David,
while Congress was out

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:47.990 align:middle line:84%
running for president of
the United States, 1972,

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:50.710 align:middle line:84%
we're in the process
of obtaining the Titan

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:52.990 align:middle line:90%
missile for you.

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:57.610 align:middle line:10%
It's some stationary
letterhead of the Congress.

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:00.910 align:middle line:10%
Congress is handing
over an ICBM,

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:03.800 align:middle line:10%
an intercontinental ballistic
missile, the biggest,

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.340 align:middle line:10%
baddest one they've
got, called Titan.

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:09.250 align:middle line:10%
It's 37 stories tall.

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:13.270 align:middle line:10%
It takes a military
crew of about 330 people

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:16.040 align:middle line:10%
to move the thing around.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:21.210 align:middle line:10%
And it has 1 million pound
thrusting engines in it.

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:22.710 align:middle line:90%
I was born in 1954.

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:24.310 align:middle line:90%
The letter is dated 1970.

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:25.460 align:middle line:90%
How old am I?

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:26.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm 15.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:30.000 align:middle line:10%
Don't you find it strange
that Congress is handing

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.765 align:middle line:10%
a state-of-the-art
ICBM to a 15-year-old?

00:18:33.765 --> 00:18:36.660 align:middle line:10%
Well, something is
going on there, you all.

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:39.880 align:middle line:10%
And if you like that letter,
look at the other 13 behind it.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:44.507 align:middle line:84%
And it's my story,
printed by Congress.

00:18:44.507 --> 00:18:47.930 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:51.845 align:middle line:90%


00:18:51.845 --> 00:18:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And now there's real
sweet guy that shows up,

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.770 align:middle line:90%
named Arthur Rudolph.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:19:00.900 align:middle line:84%
He's a former Gestapo
person out of Germany.

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:04.790 align:middle line:84%
Came in through Operation
Paperclip with von Braun.

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:09.080 align:middle line:84%
I was dealing with this guy
when I was 15 years old.

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.360 align:middle line:90%
He came in.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And he took over
the entire project.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And my rocket was already
programmed by Rudolph

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:23.600 align:middle line:84%
to come down in a place
about 435 miles from where

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:28.170 align:middle line:84%
we were at White Sands, into an
area called Groom Lake, Nevada.

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:32.810 align:middle line:84%
That's the only name I've ever
known, what you call Area 51.

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, why are going
to a big, dry lake bed?

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:39.560 align:middle line:90%
And when I got there, I saw why.

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.665 align:middle line:84%
After they showed me what they
wanted me to see, which was--

00:19:42.665 --> 00:19:46.620 align:middle line:84%
it turned out to be another
star-in-a-jar engine.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:51.440 align:middle line:84%
But man, this thing was not
from us, or them, the Soviets.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.200 align:middle line:84%
It was from-- I don't
know, some off-world thing

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.290 align:middle line:90%
cause this thing was alive.

00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:00.570 align:middle line:90%
It was a sentient entity.

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And not like artificial
intelligence.

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:06.660 align:middle line:84%
This thing was organic
and inorganic, both.

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And it thought and reasoned,
like everybody else.

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:14.100 align:middle line:84%
But it's a power plant, out of a
big vehicle of some kind, which

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.670 align:middle line:90%
I never saw.

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:18.390 align:middle line:84%
But this power plant is
an electromagnetic fusion

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:20.170 align:middle line:90%
containment engine.

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And you can tell by the way
the configuration of the fields

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.660 align:middle line:90%
are made.

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:29.340 align:middle line:84%
Just like if you had a Model
A Ford engine by Henry Ford,

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:32.270 align:middle line:84%
next to a Lamborghini,
you're going to look at them

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:33.240 align:middle line:90%
and tell one thing.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.880 align:middle line:84%
They both are internal
combustion engines,

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:38.808 align:middle line:90%
but one vastly advanced.

00:20:38.808 --> 00:20:42.600 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.450 align:middle line:90%


00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:47.550 align:middle line:84%
So what I had built
and what they had

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:50.940 align:middle line:84%
was just two different
worlds literally.

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:52.740 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, they
were trying to get

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:57.540 align:middle line:84%
me to help them fix this
busted engine they had down

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:01.620 align:middle line:84%
in the basement of Area 51,
which means we'll getting

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:04.350 align:middle line:90%
ready to attack Soviet Union.

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you attack
them, you'll have

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:08.620 align:middle line:90%
to attack China the same day.

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:12.540 align:middle line:84%
So you're looking at burning
two big billion souls to ash

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:13.910 align:middle line:90%
in a single day.

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And America would
take over Earth.

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:18.160 align:middle line:90%


00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:22.920 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't build all this
stuff to burn people into ash.

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:25.900 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to get us to go
with a different type of power

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:27.220 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to figure out a
way to destroy my own engine

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:32.980 align:middle line:90%
in a top secret Air Force base.

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And I remember telling the
guards, it's going to explode.

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:37.810 align:middle line:90%
It's leaking.

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:39.530 align:middle line:90%
They don't leak.

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:40.430 align:middle line:90%
I just set the timer.

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:42.070 align:middle line:90%
It's on the cyclotrons.

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:43.585 align:middle line:90%
So we took off.

00:21:43.585 --> 00:21:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And then the guard asked
me a really good question.

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:48.310 align:middle line:90%
He said, what's a safe distance?

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh, god, if
this goes to nuclear reaction.

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:55.490 align:middle line:84%
I turned around and
told him, Chicago.

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And boy, he floored that
little cart we were on.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.100 align:middle line:90%
But it stayed conventional.

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:03.010 align:middle line:84%
But it blew into
a million pieces.

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And now they don't have
anything, no drawings,

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:11.930 align:middle line:84%
no formulas, no models,
and no prototypes, just me.

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:13.710 align:middle line:90%
And now it's a real--

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:15.620 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well, that'll
be the end of it.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:16.430 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:19.002 align:middle line:84%
Rudolph kept me
at Area 51, so I'd

00:22:19.002 --> 00:22:20.210 align:middle line:90%
be there the rest of my life.

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:24.440 align:middle line:10%
We end up like Brent Spriner
from "Independence Day."

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:27.350 align:middle line:90%
But LeMay came and got me.

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And he told me this
is not over with.

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:32.580 align:middle line:84%
Rudolph and company
will be back.

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:33.640 align:middle line:90%
And they sure was.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.360 align:middle line:84%
A year later, at high
school graduation,

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.930 align:middle line:84%
they pulled me out of the line,
slapped a letter in my hand.

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:40.720 align:middle line:90%
And I'm drafted.

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And this time, it didn't
cost me a single day.

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:45.460 align:middle line:90%
It cost me 11 years.

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:48.770 align:middle line:10%
I stayed in the Navy that long.

00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:54.170 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was 11
years in the Navy.

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:58.190 align:middle line:10%
And the admiral said, we
have about a hundred job

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:00.020 align:middle line:10%
offers here on my desk for you.

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:01.350 align:middle line:90%
Who are you going to work for?

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:03.630 align:middle line:90%
And I said, all of them.

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:06.510 align:middle line:84%
So I opened up my own
company, called Intersect.

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And I worked that
for about 20 years.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.700 align:middle line:90%
And I retired 15 years ago.

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:15.930 align:middle line:10%
I've created three
magnificent inventions.

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:19.110 align:middle line:84%
I destroyed my first
one because I had to,

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:21.270 align:middle line:90%
for a first strike weapon.

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:26.270 align:middle line:84%
The second one was destroyed
by the Navy cause it upset

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:29.200 align:middle line:84%
the labor balance,
of all things.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And the third one
was legally buried.

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And that was the coolest one,
the coolest one I ever had.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And after this story-- and
by this time, I'm only 21.

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:41.770 align:middle line:84%
I decided not to build
another single thing.

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:45.390 align:middle line:84%
So what I did I just fixed
things as I found them,

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:49.584 align:middle line:84%
but nothing creative
out of my skull.

00:23:49.584 --> 00:23:56.920 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Somebody would have to step
up with a funding that's

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:02.640 align:middle line:90%
just astronomical.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:06.120 align:middle line:84%
But if they do, man,
I can rock his world

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.020 align:middle line:90%
like you wouldn't believe.

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:11.253 align:middle line:90%
And that has happened.

00:24:11.253 --> 00:24:13.170 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think it would
happen in my lifetime.

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:16.380 align:middle line:84%
But fortunately for
all of you, it is.

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:19.015 align:middle line:90%
Enter Mideast.

00:24:19.015 --> 00:24:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I can't make up
something this crazy.

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:24.805 align:middle line:84%
They said, we have
all the funding

00:24:24.805 --> 00:24:26.430 align:middle line:84%
that I'd ever need
to build everything.

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And I said, dude,
there's just one

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:32.040 align:middle line:84%
project in my head, that
would cost about $150 billion

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.630 align:middle line:90%
just to start.

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:36.300 align:middle line:84%
But if you'd come up
with that kind of money,

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.700 align:middle line:84%
I'll deliver some stuff
to you that you're not

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.680 align:middle line:90%
going to believe.

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:43.530 align:middle line:84%
So these mysterious people
started emailing me,

00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:45.030 align:middle line:90%
back and forth, back and forth.

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:46.980 align:middle line:84%
So I'm getting
ready to visit them.

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And the name of
the organization--

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:53.275 align:middle line:84%
it's the United
Humanitarian Trust Fund.

00:24:53.275 --> 00:24:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And if that don't sound
like a front operation,

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:56.730 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what does.

00:24:56.730 --> 00:25:01.020 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out they have
billions, verified, billions

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:04.965 align:middle line:90%
and billions of dollars.

00:25:04.965 --> 00:25:08.310 align:middle line:84%
The Mideast is united,
like the United States.

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:12.920 align:middle line:84%
They are functioning as
really one country now.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And think of their
combined wealth.

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:17.460 align:middle line:84%
They have a combined wealth
a hundred times greater

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:20.790 align:middle line:90%
than three superpowers combined.

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:23.550 align:middle line:84%
So they got the--
they got the money.

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:26.120 align:middle line:90%
And they formed a space program.

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:29.860 align:middle line:84%
There were space programs
forming everywhere.

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:33.910 align:middle line:10%
And Israel just launched
a satellite to the Moon.

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:37.060 align:middle line:10%
And hardly anybody
here knows about it.

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:40.440 align:middle line:84%
These are world events
happening, you all.

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:43.613 align:middle line:84%
And basically in
a single sentence,

00:25:43.613 --> 00:25:45.280 align:middle line:84%
they wanted me to
come and run the space

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.070 align:middle line:90%
programs of the world.

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:48.820 align:middle line:84%
But I told them
there are so many--

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:50.980 align:middle line:90%
I've got so many projects.

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:54.460 align:middle line:84%
I have probably about
25 different projects.

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:57.820 align:middle line:84%
Each one of them is as
big as the other one.

00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:00.390 align:middle line:10%
That's reason I'm doing this
interview cause I could--

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:03.700 align:middle line:10%
my and wife and I might
end up being sushi,

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:06.610 align:middle line:10%
like the reporter did in Turkey.

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:09.345 align:middle line:10%
You know, maybe they just want
to take me out altogether.

00:26:09.345 --> 00:26:11.470 align:middle line:10%
But like my aunt said, as
long as she dies with me,

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:12.280 align:middle line:10%
she don't care.

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.840 align:middle line:10%
We're both out of here.

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.910 align:middle line:84%
I said, yeah,
that's a good way--

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:17.500 align:middle line:90%
yeah, I'll go with that.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.924 align:middle line:90%
It'd be worth an effort.

00:26:19.924 --> 00:26:23.340 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:26.270 align:middle line:90%


00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:28.130 align:middle line:90%
It's an old riddle.

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:30.370 align:middle line:90%
Einstein asked this one time.

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:33.230 align:middle line:10%
And this riddle was, how
can you go millions of times

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:35.060 align:middle line:10%
faster than speed of
light without breaking

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.460 align:middle line:10%
the speed of light,
and stay constant

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:39.280 align:middle line:10%
inside the Newtonian physics?

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.420 align:middle line:84%
I figured out the
answer to that.

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:46.480 align:middle line:84%
That's what this
star drive does.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:51.100 align:middle line:84%
To go from point A to point
B at the speed of light,

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:56.080 align:middle line:84%
186,754 miles per second, it
would take you 200 million

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:59.560 align:middle line:90%
years to get to Andromeda.

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:05.110 align:middle line:10%
I'd have my engines turn
on, focus your navigation.

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And you pull this fabric
of space around the ship,

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:11.290 align:middle line:90%
like a burrito.

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:13.340 align:middle line:90%
And then you compress the walls.

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And on a linear surface,
a straight line,

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:19.120 align:middle line:84%
you'll cut through those
walls, jump through them.

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:23.080 align:middle line:84%
Transdimensional jump
drive is what I call it.

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And when we shut our engines
off five minutes later,

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:27.100 align:middle line:90%
we're in Andromeda.

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:29.860 align:middle line:84%
You would have--
anywhere you want

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:35.640 align:middle line:84%
to go in the universe is
within your grasp, anywhere.

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:36.955 align:middle line:90%
That's just one project.

00:27:36.955 --> 00:27:40.035 align:middle line:90%


00:27:40.035 --> 00:27:41.660 align:middle line:84%
One of the first
things that I would do

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:44.000 align:middle line:90%
is head back to the Moon.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'll head back
there for two reasons.

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:50.270 align:middle line:84%
One is, we want to go look
at all those strange things

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:52.670 align:middle line:84%
that all you conspiracy
theorists are about.

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And the second reason,
I'm after helium-3.

00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And I have an
extracting program.

00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:06.020 align:middle line:84%
I've already detailed it
out over the last 20 years,

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:07.790 align:middle line:84%
exactly how to
build a machine that

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:11.360 align:middle line:84%
would extract the gas from
the ores right on the surface

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:16.290 align:middle line:84%
of the Moon, using the natural
environment for processing.

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And then ship the
helium-3 back to Earth.

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:20.420 align:middle line:90%
Now, what is helium-3?

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:23.580 align:middle line:90%


00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:26.850 align:middle line:90%
It's an isotope of helium-2.

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's manufactured on the
Sun by the superheat of the Sun.

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:35.460 align:middle line:84%
You take helium-3, put
it in a nuclear reactor.

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:37.680 align:middle line:10%
Even the fission
reactors of today

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.110 align:middle line:10%
which are just horrible,
their efficiency

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:43.080 align:middle line:10%
will triple their loads.

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And they are clean, thermal,
radiation-free power.

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:53.390 align:middle line:84%
2,000 pounds of dirt from the
Moon, processed on the Moon,

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:56.420 align:middle line:84%
would give you enough
helium-3 to power

00:28:56.420 --> 00:29:01.370 align:middle line:84%
all the power needs of the
entire Earth for one year.

00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And I can scoop that up in a
single day and give it to you.

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:07.390 align:middle line:90%
How much helium-3 have we got?

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:10.980 align:middle line:84%
About a million
years worth of use.

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:14.310 align:middle line:90%
And no more carbon footprints.

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:15.750 align:middle line:90%
All coming from the Moon.

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Whoever controls helium-3
will control the world.

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:21.960 align:middle line:90%
Why am I doing all this?

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.030 align:middle line:90%
For you guys.

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:26.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be gone soon.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:29.610 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to leave you
somewhat of a different legacy

00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:30.760 align:middle line:90%
to live on.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:33.150 align:middle line:84%
Because right now,
it's miserable.

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:35.330 align:middle line:84%
You haven't got much
of a future at all.

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And if somebody don't
introduce something big

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:42.700 align:middle line:84%
on a mighty scale, all at once,
you're not going to make it.

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:47.380 align:middle line:84%
But I can give you entirely
different economic systems,

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:48.760 align:middle line:90%
medical systems.

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:51.180 align:middle line:84%
I have a space
hospital to build.

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:53.550 align:middle line:84%
You won't believe what will
come out of that thing,

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:57.060 align:middle line:90%
pharmaceuticals, unimaginable.

00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:58.560 align:middle line:84%
You know, where
they gave you a pill

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:02.830 align:middle line:84%
and your dialysis is no longer
needed, that kind of stuff.

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And I ain't "Star Trek"
or science fiction.

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:08.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking hard science,
by what we already know.

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:11.700 align:middle line:84%
We've done performed 5,000
industrial experiments

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:13.110 align:middle line:90%
in space.

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:15.030 align:middle line:84%
All these products are
looking to be made.

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:17.610 align:middle line:90%
And we have no facility.

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:20.673 align:middle line:84%
So I'll build all the
facilities for you.

00:30:20.673 --> 00:30:22.590 align:middle line:84%
You ought to see the
wagon wheel that I've got

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:23.940 align:middle line:90%
designed for a space station.

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:25.417 align:middle line:90%
It's got own gravity fields.

00:30:25.417 --> 00:30:27.000 align:middle line:84%
You go to the hub
and it's weightless.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.890 align:middle line:90%
That's where the OR is.

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:31.530 align:middle line:84%
Wait until you see
what you can in there.

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:34.110 align:middle line:90%
How about a massive burn victim?

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:36.810 align:middle line:84%
Their cellular
tissue regenerates

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:41.820 align:middle line:84%
at such a level through mitosis,
they heal without scar tissue.

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:44.230 align:middle line:90%
That worth something?

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:46.980 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, I actually
give all this.

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even care
if you remember my name.

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:51.250 align:middle line:90%
I don't care.

00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:52.422 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:30:52.422 --> 00:30:53.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm just
passing through.

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:55.920 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to leave
something behind.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.670 align:middle line:90%
