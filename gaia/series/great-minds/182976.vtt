>> My name, is Steven Halpern,
and I am a sound healer,

composer, musician, recording
artist, and producer,

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.720 align:middle line:10%
as well as a researcher,
author, and educator.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.410 align:middle line:84%
I was doing music without a
beat, that didn't have a name.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.800 align:middle line:84%
This was before new age
music was what it was.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.300 align:middle line:10%
And because what I
was bringing through

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.710 align:middle line:10%
was a new form of music
that didn't have a context,

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.400 align:middle line:10%
I had to explain it.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.310 align:middle line:10%
And since there
weren't record labels,

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.670 align:middle line:10%
I had to start my own record
label, learn how to distribute,

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.310 align:middle line:10%
and learn about business,
which was one of the hardest

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.650 align:middle line:10%
transitions I ever made.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.140 align:middle line:84%
So as a kid, what I
remember was always

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.840 align:middle line:90%
been fascinated by sound.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.420 align:middle line:84%
The wind in the trees, the
radiator, the steam radiators,

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.910 align:middle line:84%
making all those little
percussive sounds.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.410 align:middle line:84%
I would be playing
with the rhythms,

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.080 align:middle line:84%
and just hearing little
melodies in my head, which

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.100 align:middle line:90%
I thought everybody did that.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.200 align:middle line:84%
One of the first
memories I have,

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.000 align:middle line:84%
very vaguely, is when we lived
in a place called Flushing,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.910 align:middle line:84%
in Queens, outside
of New York City,

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.140 align:middle line:84%
I would crawl down the hallway
to a neighbor's apartment

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.330 align:middle line:84%
and just sit outside
their doorway

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.780 align:middle line:84%
because I could hear music,
and I didn't know what it was.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.600 align:middle line:84%
It was something
that my soul needed.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.900 align:middle line:90%
My parents never played music.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.290 align:middle line:90%
There was no music in the house.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.090 align:middle line:90%
No instruments.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.080 align:middle line:90%
No piano.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.630 align:middle line:90%
They didn't play radio or music.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.630 align:middle line:90%
It was all news, all the time.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.360 align:middle line:84%
The good part of that, for me,
was that I wasn't programmed

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.430 align:middle line:84%
to this is classical music,
and this is the only music,

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.890 align:middle line:90%
and you have to do this.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Later on, we didn't
have a piano,

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.030 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend whose
parents had a piano.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.660 align:middle line:84%
I would play tonal
colors, and I would just

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.910 align:middle line:90%
get lost in the sounds.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.760 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of New Age
music for nine-year-olds,

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.610 align:middle line:84%
but I was into the textures,
and into the harmonics,

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.340 align:middle line:90%
and the overtones.

right now to these lights

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.470 align:middle line:90%
to the refrigerator.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.960 align:middle line:10%
And the rumble of
the refrigerator,

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.390 align:middle line:10%
the resonance of
the low frequencies,

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.595 align:middle line:10%
always gave me
indigestion and gas.

00:02:39.595 --> 00:02:40.720 align:middle line:90%
My father would yell at me.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.220 align:middle line:84%
He says, why do you
always have gas?

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.810 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, the refrigerator
is hurting my stomach.

up and eat your spinach.

never understood me.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.080 align:middle line:84%
My mother was a Jewish
mother, so she was supportive,

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.270 align:middle line:84%

what was going on.

There's no one there.

But there's a piano.

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And I sit down at
the piano, and I just

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:34.820 align:middle line:90%
start going into the trance.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.008 align:middle line:84%
I go into state, and start
playing the music I just heard.

00:06:38.008 --> 00:06:40.300 align:middle line:84%
I was familiar with piano,
but it was not an instrument

I told you I met this

And the deepest learning for
me was being at a keyboard

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:29.610 align:middle line:90%
and getting out of the way.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And that was also tied
into the ancient Greeks,

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:37.560 align:middle line:84%
tuning into their muse,
with the goal of an artist,

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.590 align:middle line:84%
a writer, a musician, was
to connect with your muse,

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:44.600 align:middle line:84%
to connect with the
divine, and that's

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.920 align:middle line:84%
what I started seeking and being
able to do through my music.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:53.060 align:middle line:90%


00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Bridge Mountain Foundation
was like the little Esalen.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.000 align:middle line:84%
People go to Esalen
then come there.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.190 align:middle line:10%
So I would meet
the leading people

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:04.940 align:middle line:10%
in the Human Potential
Movement in that days, Dr. John

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:08.570 align:middle line:10%
Lilly, Dr. Stanley Krippner
leading psychics Anne

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:09.620 align:middle line:10%
Armstrong.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.900 align:middle line:10%
And all of them would say,
well, this is fantastic,

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.210 align:middle line:10%
but how do we know it works?

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:16.160 align:middle line:84%
How is this
different than music?

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.290 align:middle line:90%
Where's the beat?

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:19.400 align:middle line:90%
Where's the melody?

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.753 align:middle line:90%
Where are the words?

00:08:20.753 --> 00:08:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is not
what it's about.

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:26.120 align:middle line:84%
It's about shutting down the
analytical part of the brain.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:30.140 align:middle line:84%
It's about dealing with
being rather than doing.

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:34.490 align:middle line:84%
So to be taken seriously,
you need to do research.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:35.690 align:middle line:10%
How do I do research?

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.190 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Krippner said,
well, I've just

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:40.679 align:middle line:10%
been offered the Associate
Dean of a new program

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:42.409 align:middle line:10%
at Sonoma State College.

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:44.840 align:middle line:84%
We would love to have
someone like you do research

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.200 align:middle line:84%
at the Human Potential
Institute, HPI.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And that was the beginning
of the whole rest of my life

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:53.150 align:middle line:90%
and career.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:58.330 align:middle line:90%


00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:05.050 align:middle line:84%
Most music locks us into
a predictive mode, a brain

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:06.490 align:middle line:90%
state where you are analyzing.

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.380 align:middle line:10%
You're in the beta
state, like we're

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.280 align:middle line:10%
speaking right now, where the
brain's electrical pulsations

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:18.360 align:middle line:10%
are between, let's say, 13
and 30 cycles per second.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.080 align:middle line:10%
So the alpha state
is a little lower,

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.790 align:middle line:10%
between eight and 12 cycles.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:24.910 align:middle line:10%
When you get deeper, you're into
the theta state, between four

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.420 align:middle line:10%
and seven cycles per second.

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And sleep is between
one and three.

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:31.120 align:middle line:84%
And so when we're
able to measure that,

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.100 align:middle line:84%
we found that mostly
music keeps you

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:40.060 align:middle line:84%
locked in the beta state of
typical ordinary consciousness,

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:45.130 align:middle line:84%
and it locks you into the
future, the predictive mode,

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:49.505 align:middle line:84%
and it's the exact
opposite of mindfulness.

00:09:49.505 --> 00:09:51.130 align:middle line:84%
If I were to demonstrate
that right now

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:52.430 align:middle line:90%
by singing a little scale.

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:56.530 align:middle line:84%
(SINGING) Do, re,
mi, sol, la, ti.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:58.270 align:middle line:90%
And I don't finish that.

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:00.350 align:middle line:90%
You hear that note in your head.

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:02.560 align:middle line:84%
You will hold your
breath waiting

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.720 align:middle line:90%
for me to sing that last note.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And I coined the phrase
Scalus Interruptus.

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, what that does,
it creates stress.

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And as a type A individual
coming from New York,

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:16.120 align:middle line:90%
I had enough stress.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:19.910 align:middle line:84%
I needed something
that was not stressful.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And in the '60s,
a lot of us were

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:24.850 align:middle line:84%
looking for music to help us,
you know, chill and mellow out.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:28.390 align:middle line:90%
And there wasn't a lot of it.

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:31.970 align:middle line:84%
From Iselin and from the
Bridge Mountain Foundation,

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:35.650 align:middle line:84%
I went to graduate
school, and then there

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:38.380 align:middle line:84%
was no work for a
musician playing

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.990 align:middle line:90%
meditation music in 1970, '71.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:42.310 align:middle line:90%
So I was a music teacher.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:43.660 align:middle line:90%
I was a music specialist.

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:48.380 align:middle line:84%
I went around to high
schools, and I was a coach.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:52.430 align:middle line:84%
When I was in grad school, we
were told about it a physician

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:55.670 align:middle line:84%
from New York, a guy named
Dr. Irving Oyle, O-Y-L-E,

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.025 align:middle line:90%
the Father of Holistic Medicine.

00:10:57.025 --> 00:10:58.400 align:middle line:84%
No one knows it
better than that.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.790 align:middle line:10%
But he wrote the first
book, "Healing in the Mind."

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:04.220 align:middle line:84%
He does sonopuncture,
and he's into all sorts

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:05.900 align:middle line:90%
of alternative things.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.840 align:middle line:84%
I bring my reel to
reel recorder, set up

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.030 align:middle line:84%
in his waiting room,
and babies are crying,

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:12.590 align:middle line:90%
and people are waiting.

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And within about five
minutes, everybody's quiet.

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:18.660 align:middle line:84%
Dr. OYle comes and says,
what's going on here?

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:19.460 align:middle line:90%
Who are you?

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm the guy that has
the interview with you.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:22.860 align:middle line:90%
Is that your music?

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:23.790 align:middle line:90%
I go, yeah.

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:24.860 align:middle line:90%
It's quieting everybody.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.400 align:middle line:90%
Come right in right now.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.170 align:middle line:90%
So he became my mentor.

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:32.410 align:middle line:84%
A couple years later,
when the first Conference

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:36.820 align:middle line:84%
of Spirituality and Psychology
and Science, The Mind

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Can Do Anything, was being
held at UC Santa Cruz,

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:45.590 align:middle line:84%
he said, well, come on
down and meet with us.

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:46.390 align:middle line:90%
Bam.

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:49.400 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly, I'm in
front of 1,000 people.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And when I play my
chakra-balancing music

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.570 align:middle line:84%
in the first break, the
audience is going, oh, my gosh.

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:58.450 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Virginia Satir,
and Dr. Norman Shealy,

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Uri Geller, major people who
became the leaders in the Human

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:03.670 align:middle line:90%
Potential Movement.

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And then people who were
putting on their own conferences

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.827 align:middle line:84%
around the country would
say, we are putting

00:12:08.827 --> 00:12:09.910 align:middle line:90%
on a conference like that.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:11.974 align:middle line:90%
We want to have you there.

00:12:11.974 --> 00:12:15.418 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:15.418 --> 00:12:19.360 align:middle line:90%


00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.020 align:middle line:84%
The big major
international conference,

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:27.210 align:middle line:84%
The World Symposium on Humanity,
was happening in Vancouver.

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:30.390 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, 1976,
I said, I want to go.

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:31.710 align:middle line:90%
I don't have the money.

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:33.300 align:middle line:90%
I was a starving musician.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.250 align:middle line:84%
You know, the spiritual
belief at that point,

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.750 align:middle line:84%
if you want to play
great music, you

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:39.000 align:middle line:90%
have to be a starving musician.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.680 align:middle line:84%
We found out that
that's not true.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.620 align:middle line:84%
You play better music if
you have your rent paid.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.670 align:middle line:84%
But I went up there and
started playing my music,

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:48.790 align:middle line:84%
and people heard it, and they
said, well, this is fantastic.

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:52.560 align:middle line:84%
We're doing the first conference
in London in the spring.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.110 align:middle line:90%
We need to have you there.

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:58.890 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, I am in
London in April 1977.

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:01.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm one of the few Americans
there, and I'm a huge hit.

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.040 align:middle line:90%
And I'm suddenly international.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm on BBC.

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:09.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm on the news, in print.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I
started exploding.

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:15.430 align:middle line:84%
In one of those
first conferences,

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:20.920 align:middle line:84%
I heard the phrase
that music is a carrier

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.350 align:middle line:90%
wave for consciousness.

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:26.520 align:middle line:84%
When you play music, it's not
just the notes, but the energy

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.320 align:middle line:90%
that comes through.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:31.500 align:middle line:10%
And long before people were
talking about intention,

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:36.270 align:middle line:10%
this aspect of the carrier wave
of consciousness, from day one,

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:39.290 align:middle line:10%
my intention was
to create and bring

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:41.040 align:middle line:10%
through music that
would serve the highest

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:44.310 align:middle line:10%
and best in the listener.

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:45.870 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't coming from ego.

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:48.690 align:middle line:84%
As a jazz-playing trumpet
player, lot of ego.

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:50.500 align:middle line:84%
We practice a lot
and, dammit, you

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.083 align:middle line:84%
were going to be
impressed, because we

00:13:52.083 --> 00:13:54.210 align:middle line:84%
could play faster, and
higher, and fancier

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:56.040 align:middle line:90%
than the rest of you.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.210 align:middle line:90%
That was the gig.

00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:00.647 align:middle line:90%

[PLAYING TIBETAN BOWLS]

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:07.040 align:middle line:90%


00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:11.720 align:middle line:84%
I was working before the term
mindfulness came into vogue.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.488 align:middle line:84%
But when it started
becoming a meme,

00:14:15.488 --> 00:14:17.780 align:middle line:84%
we realized that this is what
my music has always done.

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:20.030 align:middle line:84%
It anchors people
in the here and now,

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:21.740 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't
have to go somewhere.

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:24.170 align:middle line:84%
All the things that I
used to be criticized for,

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:27.380 align:middle line:84%
your music doesn't go anywhere,
said my faculty advisor

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:28.540 align:middle line:90%
in grad school.

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.020 align:middle line:90%
Right, it's already there.

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And that taps into the
ancient Buddhist aspect.

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:35.570 align:middle line:84%
When you play Tibetan
bowls or Buddhist bowls,

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:36.370 align:middle line:90%
it's right there.

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:39.150 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't go anywhere.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:42.600 align:middle line:84%
What the ancient
bowls were doing

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.700 align:middle line:84%
was setting up an
entrainment matrix

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.280 align:middle line:84%
that would get people into an
alpha state and a theta state.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:52.320 align:middle line:84%
I remember the first time I
was at a lecture by Alan Watts,

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.740 align:middle line:84%
and he hit the big
Japanese temple bowl.

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.793 align:middle line:84%
Some of us in the audience
were going, OK, next.

00:14:58.793 --> 00:15:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And I remember he looked
at me and said, some of you

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.480 align:middle line:84%
don't know how to
listen to the bowl.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.020 align:middle line:84%
Listen to the
furthest away sound.

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:09.370 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have to go somewhere.

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:10.810 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to do something.

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:12.140 align:middle line:90%
Just be with it.

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I became,
basically, the Johnny Appleseed

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:21.370 align:middle line:90%
of talking about sound healing.

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:24.370 align:middle line:84%
What I was doing was
teaching and educating

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:26.410 align:middle line:84%
people about the
fact that there's

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:30.010 align:middle line:84%
a whole field, an ancient
field, of sound healing,

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:34.407 align:middle line:84%
of music healing,
and it's available.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.520 align:middle line:84%
Then when the recording
technology was around,

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:50.030 align:middle line:84%
that I could be in the studio
and just go into the state

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:52.400 align:middle line:84%
and allow the music
to flow, and that's

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.833 align:middle line:90%
when I put out my first albums.

00:15:53.833 --> 00:15:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And people were writing,
I've been looking for music

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.950 align:middle line:90%
like this for years.

00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:00.470 align:middle line:10%
When my first album came
out, it was the first album

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:03.890 align:middle line:10%
that was distributed nationally
and advertised nationally

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:06.530 align:middle line:10%
in the New Age magazines,
offered to people

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:08.420 align:middle line:10%
looking for meditation.

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:12.140 align:middle line:10%
The first name that I
had was "Chakra Suite."

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:15.710 align:middle line:10%
But in those days, people didn't
know what chakras were, outside

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:19.080 align:middle line:10%
of the small community.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And I had to change the name to
"The Spectrum Suite," because I

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.220 align:middle line:84%
was dealing with the
electromagnetic spectrum,

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:30.590 align:middle line:84%
and that would also be a context
that the media understood,

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:33.505 align:middle line:84%
that I was relating sounds
and colors to these energy

00:16:33.505 --> 00:16:34.380 align:middle line:90%
centers, the chakras.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.670 align:middle line:84%
I'd look back at this now,
it was almost magical.

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:44.530 align:middle line:84%
But they said, here's
a guy that comes in.

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:46.260 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't have
everything prepared.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.180 align:middle line:84%
He comes, he meditates
for a half hour,

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:52.080 align:middle line:84%
he pays us to just
sit in the room.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And then he plays, and
he doesn't make mistakes.

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And he gets an album done
in a couple of hours.

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.600 align:middle line:90%
We've never seen that.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:03.340 align:middle line:84%
So they say, we don't know
what he's doing, but it works.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:08.839 align:middle line:84%
And that was the beginning
of my record career.

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:13.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't go into recording
thinking scientific things

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:15.079 align:middle line:90%
with the music.

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:17.210 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, I actually
look down, and it

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:18.619 align:middle line:90%
appears that I'm levitating.

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:21.319 align:middle line:90%


00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:24.079 align:middle line:84%
I'm often playing
with my eyes closed,

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:27.920 align:middle line:84%
and I'm listening to the
way the harmonies, as I

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:32.480 align:middle line:84%
play certain notes and sustain
them, blend after I play them.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.900 align:middle line:84%
So I create notes
that I don't play.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And the harmonies
that happen after I

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:41.900 align:middle line:84%
play the notes that
swirl in the expanded

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:44.150 align:middle line:90%
overtones of the sustains--

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:47.300 align:middle line:84%
Indian music has that
with the way sitar

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:51.170 align:middle line:84%
and with the gourds that
have the resonant chamber,

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:53.720 align:middle line:84%
the tambura, that
work on the overtones.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:18:01.350 align:middle line:90%


00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:03.510 align:middle line:10%
When I discovered Indian music--

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:05.460 align:middle line:10%
it was love at first hear--

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.500 align:middle line:10%
I got into the
overtones and understood

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.480 align:middle line:10%
that it's not just
the notes, but they

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.060 align:middle line:10%
might spend an hour tuning up.

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.650 align:middle line:90%
This is part of the concert.

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.380 align:middle line:84%
They are tuning the
instruments, but they're tuning

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:19.290 align:middle line:90%
themselves and the audience.

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:20.160 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.860 align:middle line:90%
Breakthrough.

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:26.460 align:middle line:84%
So when I go in the
studio, I tune myself,

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:29.400 align:middle line:84%
and then I become the
instrument of the instrument.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.940 align:middle line:90%
And the music plays through me.

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:32.535 align:middle line:90%
It becomes non-mental.

00:18:32.535 --> 00:18:38.790 align:middle line:84%
It becomes non-ego, because
music is being played.

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And as a producer,
I create soundscapes

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:46.320 align:middle line:84%
that are more than
what was recorded.

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.790 align:middle line:90%
The music lets me know.

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And my job is to
translate and make

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.080 align:middle line:90%
audible what is already there.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:56.110 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it's like the
music is already there.

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just transcribing
it and bringing it through.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And other times, I know it's
a conscious co-creation.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And then other times where
I am totally surprised.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:11.190 align:middle line:84%
Things will happen in the studio
that I never expected to do.

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
usually, there's

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:15.780 align:middle line:84%
a big smile that
happens on my face,

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:19.400 align:middle line:84%
and I know that I'm
getting some help.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.020 align:middle line:84%
My engineer would say,
wow, when that happened,

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:24.750 align:middle line:90%
the room filled with light.

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:27.270 align:middle line:84%
So my engineer and
I would describe

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.700 align:middle line:90%
that as a voltage surge.

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.500 align:middle line:90%
And that was cool for him.

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that that was part
of the magic that was going on.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:39.366 align:middle line:84%
Because early on, I learned
that I'm not in this alone.

How does sound heal?

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:49.900 align:middle line:90%
It heals many ways.

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:55.060 align:middle line:84%
But one of the main ways, it
allows your human instrument

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.400 align:middle line:84%
to come into a higher
state of coherence.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:03.100 align:middle line:84%
Your brainwaves shift
into a balanced state.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:06.070 align:middle line:84%
When I was in London,
the first time in 1977,

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:09.580 align:middle line:84%
I met the leading brainwave
researchers in the world

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:11.470 align:middle line:90%
at that point, Dr. Maxwell Cade.

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:12.970 align:middle line:90%
I was invited to his laboratory.

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:15.095 align:middle line:84%
They hooked me up with
their biofeedback equipment,

00:20:15.095 --> 00:20:18.990 align:middle line:84%
the most sophisticated in the
world at that point, the minor.

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:21.910 align:middle line:84%
And they found that my music
did something different

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:23.140 align:middle line:90%
than any other music.

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we must
have hooked things

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:27.220 align:middle line:84%
up wrong with all the
electrodes and everything.

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.553 align:middle line:84%
So they took everything apart,
and they glued everything

00:20:29.553 --> 00:20:31.570 align:middle line:90%
back on, and it happened again.

00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And they looked to me
and said, your music

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:35.230 align:middle line:90%
is doing something different.

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:36.440 align:middle line:90%
We've listened to classic--

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:40.240 align:middle line:84%
the only other time we have that
happen is with Tibetan monks

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.820 align:middle line:84%
who are doing
[CHANTING]---- chanting.

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:46.090 align:middle line:84%
But most people
can't listen to that.

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:47.922 align:middle line:90%
So how does it happen?

00:20:47.922 --> 00:20:48.880 align:middle line:90%
There's several things.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.410 align:middle line:90%
It's the notes.

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:51.860 align:middle line:90%
It's the space in the notes.

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:54.940 align:middle line:84%

doesn't make your brain

But allows it to be.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:03.220 align:middle line:84%
It allows it to expand, but
both hemispheres of the brain

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:06.820 align:middle line:84%
become balanced
and in synchrony.

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:10.930 align:middle line:84%
With the biofeedback and
the brainwave mapping,

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:19.090 align:middle line:84%
most music would create a left
hemispheric dominant response

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:22.300 align:middle line:90%
in the beta range.

Blundell and the
associates, they have found,

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:30.430 align:middle line:10%
is that my music will create

only the Tibetan monks,

the leading English healer
at the time, Rose Gladden,

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:44.560 align:middle line:10%
and out of nowhere, my music was
balancing in the hemispheres.

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.180 align:middle line:90%
And you could see that.

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:48.970 align:middle line:90%
And that was unique.

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:52.390 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the music that
you hear now doesn't do that.

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:53.340 align:middle line:90%
It's pleasant.

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:56.820 align:middle line:84%
It's nice, but it doesn't
have the medical aspects.

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:58.920 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't get the
body in a state

You're still paying
attention to the music.

My music gets to a state

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:08.100 align:middle line:84%
paying attention
to music, you hear

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:10.710 align:middle line:84%
beyond the music, where
the listener tunes

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:15.360 align:middle line:84%
into what I'm tuning into when
I'm receiving the music, when

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm recording the music.

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:20.700 align:middle line:84%

Well, also the AMA frowns on it.

The FDA frowns on it.

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:42.260 align:middle line:84%
There was a time that the FDA
considered albums like mine

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:46.550 align:middle line:84%
to be medical devices
because relaxation could

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:48.820 align:middle line:90%
be considered a medical effect.

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And anything that affects
the structure and function

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:55.430 align:middle line:84%
of human organism could be
called a medical device.

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:58.640 align:middle line:10%
And they looked at me and
says, your album says,

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:02.330 align:middle line:10%
you'll be transported to
a state of relaxation.

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:05.050 align:middle line:84%

The Sun is not making a claim

that mean you're going

to shut people like me down?

thinking of that.

The whole field--
they were trying

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:32.200 align:middle line:90%

down guided imagery, hypnosis.

He said, well, take all
your albums off the market.

Get rid of the word relaxation.

the word brainwaves.

heard me say
something under my--

not so much under my breath.

There's a lot of
information now about music

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:36.940 align:middle line:84%
tuned to 432 Hertz, which is
a more biological frequency

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:41.520 align:middle line:84%
than a 440 Hertz, which is

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:21.320 align:middle line:84%
The harmonic of the
Earth itself is basically

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.370 align:middle line:90%
about eight cycles per second.

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:26.900 align:middle line:84%
This is what's also known as
the Schumann Resonance that

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:29.820 align:middle line:90%
was measured in 1957.

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:32.960 align:middle line:84%
So when we get into the
most natural healing state,

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:37.190 align:middle line:84%
we literally entrain to
the dominant frequency

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:38.960 align:middle line:90%
of the planet itself.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:42.770 align:middle line:10%
And what we think
is that if music

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:46.760 align:middle line:10%
is played at 432
Hertz, tuned to that,

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:50.510 align:middle line:10%
it may be even more healing
than music tuned to 440.

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:54.440 align:middle line:84%
Now what that does not mean
is that any music at 432

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:56.900 align:middle line:90%
is better than any music at 440.

00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:01.970 align:middle line:10%
Bad music at 432 is not
better than good music at 440,

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:05.510 align:middle line:10%
because all the research that
was done on my early albums

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:09.280 align:middle line:10%
were done with
"Chakra Suite" at 440.

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:14.150 align:middle line:10%
But my latest album, the sound
healing, I put out a 440 Hertz

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:20.040 align:middle line:10%
album, and then I did
the 432 Hertz album.

Same notes.

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:25.830 align:middle line:10%
And if you listen to them back
to back, it's hard to tell.

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:28.830 align:middle line:10%
So what I started doing is
just listening exclusively

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:32.880 align:middle line:10%
to the 432 Hertz version.

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:36.480 align:middle line:84%

difference immediately.

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:50.310 align:middle line:84%

it's a 432, it mixed itself.

But when I started getting
different readings of people

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:54.750 align:middle line:84%
who did not know me at all,
and all told me the same thing

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:58.892 align:middle line:84%
over and over, I began to
accept that this is who I am.

00:28:58.892 --> 00:29:01.350 align:middle line:10%
And then, I wanted to say, how
come I don't have more money

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:04.800 align:middle line:10%
to do the research, or
to do the publicity,

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:09.250 align:middle line:10%
and do the advertising that
would get more people to it--

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:11.880 align:middle line:10%

throughout my life

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:41.020 align:middle line:84%

synchronicities that, had I

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:44.590 align:middle line:84%
been 20 seconds earlier or
later in some of these times,

my work has inspired
