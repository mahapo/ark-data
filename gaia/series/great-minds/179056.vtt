00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.680 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Jonathan Young.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.770 align:middle line:10%
I'm a psychologist and founding
curator of the Joseph Campbell

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.820 align:middle line:10%
Archive.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.520 align:middle line:10%
My area of study is
the mythic imagination,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.610 align:middle line:10%
both in ancient cultures
and contemporary times.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.530 align:middle line:84%
I had been studying
the connection

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.220 align:middle line:84%
between psychological experience
and the mythological texts

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.110 align:middle line:90%
for some time.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.750 align:middle line:84%
My teacher was Rollo May, who
is well known in this area.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And a friend was
bringing Joseph Campbell

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.820 align:middle line:84%
to Santa Barbara, where I
lived, to present workshops

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.810 align:middle line:90%
and asked me to help.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And once I got into conversation
with Joseph Campbell,

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.400 align:middle line:90%
it changed everything.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.270 align:middle line:84%
Joseph Campbell gave me a
religious sense of life back.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.230 align:middle line:84%
He showed how the old stories
and the modern imagination,

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.560 align:middle line:84%
movies, whatever we
look at, has patterns.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.160 align:middle line:84%
He taught what you might
call a picture language,

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.310 align:middle line:84%
how to understand the
symbols of everyday life

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.740 align:middle line:84%
as representing something
beyond themselves,

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.800 align:middle line:90%
as alluding to invisible worlds.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.140 align:middle line:84%
Whether we think of that as
spiritual or psychological

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.390 align:middle line:84%
isn't as important
as that we have

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.730 align:middle line:84%
some kind of openness
to it, that we know

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.610 align:middle line:90%
more than we know that we know.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.640 align:middle line:84%
I am attracted to the poets,
the writers, and the artists.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And Joseph Campbell
thought they would

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.120 align:middle line:90%
be able to see the future.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.750 align:middle line:84%
They were the best guides to
what has not yet happened,

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.060 align:middle line:90%
what others do not yet see.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.790 align:middle line:84%
Is America a great country
because of political leaders

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.230 align:middle line:90%
like Lincoln?

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Sure, but actually, our
consciousness, our personality,

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.490 align:middle line:84%
is more shaped by Mark
Twain and Emily Dickinson

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.100 align:middle line:84%
and the great painters and
the great dramatists, Eugene

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.910 align:middle line:90%
O'Neill.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.820 align:middle line:84%
They will give us
the inner life that

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.840 align:middle line:84%
will be necessary to become
who we might be able to become.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.350 align:middle line:90%


00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.290 align:middle line:84%
One thing studying
myth will do is

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.090 align:middle line:84%
make us aware that
nothing is entirely new,

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.220 align:middle line:84%
that any experience
we have been facing

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.500 align:middle line:84%
is something that has
happened to others

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.730 align:middle line:84%
and they have struggled with
and they have left clues.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.000 align:middle line:84%
So, mythology helps us get
through everyday challenges.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.080 align:middle line:84%
We can see the guidance that
has been left to us from those

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.390 align:middle line:90%
who came this way before.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And it is interpreted
primarily through imagery.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.390 align:middle line:10%
A picture carries
thousand words,

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.560 align:middle line:10%
and if we can study what
the pictures in old stories,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.170 align:middle line:10%
dreams, movies,
culture at any time,

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.160 align:middle line:10%
what the images are telling
us, we can understand things

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.596 align:middle line:10%
on deeper levels.

00:03:00.596 --> 00:03:02.220 align:middle line:84%
Joseph Campbell had
a best selling book

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.760 align:middle line:84%
in 1949 called "The
Hero with 1,000 Faces."

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.685 align:middle line:84%
That is to say stories
are similar over time

00:03:09.685 --> 00:03:11.070 align:middle line:90%
and in different cultures.

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And there is one main
story, the mono myth,

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.320 align:middle line:90%
that is told again and again.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.675 align:middle line:84%
It's essentially a
journey story, a quest.

00:03:18.675 --> 00:03:23.540 align:middle line:90%


00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.160 align:middle line:84%
When you diagram
the hero's journey,

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.920 align:middle line:84%
it's customarily
depicted as a circle.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.300 align:middle line:90%
You start at the top.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.910 align:middle line:84%
A calling takes you
away from the ordinary,

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.050 align:middle line:90%
and there is a descent.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.380 align:middle line:84%
You cross a threshold into a
place you have not been before.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.910 align:middle line:84%
There are companions, allies,
mentors, and opponents.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.080 align:middle line:90%
There are ordeals.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.940 align:middle line:84%
There is a good
deal of suffering.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.420 align:middle line:84%
At the bottom, the nadir,
the dark night of the soul--

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.430 align:middle line:90%
it gets really hard.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.650 align:middle line:84%
There is a death and
rebirth experience.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.950 align:middle line:84%
The redemption is the rising up
the other side of the circle.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And there are several lessons
to be learned on the way back.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.040 align:middle line:84%
Finally, a return
threshold crossing

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.620 align:middle line:84%
when you re-enter
the place you left,

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.591 align:middle line:90%
but you are changed forever.

00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:09.830 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.930 align:middle line:84%
When there are
difficult times, it

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.480 align:middle line:90%
might be a vocational moment.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.680 align:middle line:84%
It could be that trouble
is calling us to a change.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.460 align:middle line:84%
If we don't have trouble, there
is no reason to learn anything.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.650 align:middle line:90%
We can stay in our comfort zone.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.720 align:middle line:84%
But when things
get difficult, we

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.460 align:middle line:84%
might have to stretch and find
new ways of looking at things.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.070 align:middle line:84%
So what Joseph Campbell
referred to as "the calling"

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.660 align:middle line:90%
is usually bad news.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.010 align:middle line:90%
Something goes wrong.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.430 align:middle line:84%
In a person's life, it's a
divorce or a financial setback

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.720 align:middle line:90%
or an illness.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.850 align:middle line:10%
In a collective,
a community life,

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.370 align:middle line:10%
it's a natural disaster
or a political shift

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.560 align:middle line:10%
or a financial
crisis of some kind.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.670 align:middle line:10%
Something happens that
makes us start again.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And we have to go
looking for new answers.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.940 align:middle line:84%
So that is possibly what we have
in difficult times, a calling

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.940 align:middle line:90%
to go, learn something new.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.860 align:middle line:90%
It could be that these moments--

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.980 align:middle line:84%
and there is upheaval in
so many ways in the world

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.200 align:middle line:84%
right now-- it could be
that this is a turning

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.800 align:middle line:84%
point, a calling, that we are
being drawn over a threshold

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.570 align:middle line:84%
into a new way of
looking at things.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.320 align:middle line:84%
That would be a positive
reading of contemporary events.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.520 align:middle line:84%
In the Old Testament, Samuel was
a boy that was given up to God.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.560 align:middle line:10%
That is, his mother
wanted him to be a priest.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.780 align:middle line:84%
To study the priesthood,
you went to the temple

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.300 align:middle line:84%
and studied with
the high priest.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And so this boy was
a servant, but also

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.520 align:middle line:90%
a student of the priest.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.370 align:middle line:84%
One night, Samuel
heard his name, Samuel.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.970 align:middle line:84%
So he ran in to ask
what the old man needed.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And this old man said,
I didn't call you.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.660 align:middle line:90%
Go back to bed.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.400 align:middle line:90%
The voice comes again, Samuel.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.900 align:middle line:90%
And the boy goes in.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:48.800 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.150 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no, I didn't call you.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.200 align:middle line:90%
Go to bed.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.630 align:middle line:84%
The third time-- these
things always seem to happen

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:54.540 align:middle line:90%
in threes--

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.340 align:middle line:90%
Samuel.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And he comes in,
and I'm imagining

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.870 align:middle line:84%
the old priest is still
awake from the last time.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.130 align:middle line:84%
But he said, I see that
you are hearing your name,

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.750 align:middle line:90%
but I am not calling you.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:06.950 align:middle line:90%
God is calling you.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.660 align:middle line:90%
Go pray.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.710 align:middle line:90%
This is vocation.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.500 align:middle line:84%
This is the calling, the
thing that pulls us away

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.470 align:middle line:84%
from the familiar and and
pulls us into development,

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.170 align:middle line:90%
into becoming what we might be.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.420 align:middle line:90%
So there is a leaving.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.400 align:middle line:84%
In the story, he
leaves his mother.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.320 align:middle line:90%
In our lives, we leave the crib.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.520 align:middle line:90%
We leave the maternal.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.700 align:middle line:84%
We leave the goddess, the
original, divine oneness

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.740 align:middle line:90%
that we experienced as infants.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.020 align:middle line:84%
Collectively, well,
in history, there

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.010 align:middle line:84%
were times when the
sacred saturated community

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.980 align:middle line:84%
life, everybody believed,
and everything was sacred.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And we came to a more
instrumental, practical,

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.760 align:middle line:84%
technological way of
thinking about things.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.130 align:middle line:90%
And that is progress.

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.050 align:middle line:90%
But something was lost.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.100 align:middle line:84%
So we go off into new
learning, and we find powers,

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.810 align:middle line:84%
and we gain access to
mysteries, and we survive this.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.890 align:middle line:84%
We come back wiser for our
trouble, older and wiser,

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.900 align:middle line:84%
and we make a new
life for ourselves

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.740 align:middle line:90%
and for the community.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And then there is the question
of what was lost, what it cost.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And we need to revisit how
we have lost balance at times

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:14.660 align:middle line:90%
and need to regain that.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.890 align:middle line:90%


00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:20.750 align:middle line:90%
There is the call to adventure.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And there are great
historical figures.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.240 align:middle line:10%
Joan of Arc heard voices and
went out and changed history.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.730 align:middle line:84%
Florence Nightingale
was touched.

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:31.670 align:middle line:84%
Her heart was moved by the
suffering on the battlefield,

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:35.030 align:middle line:84%
and she proceeded to invent
the discipline of nursing,

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:36.890 align:middle line:90%
and many lives were saved.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.430 align:middle line:84%
Rosa Parks wanted
to sit down on a bus

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.850 align:middle line:84%
and changed history in
her area in her time.

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:45.620 align:middle line:90%
Marie Curie was a scientist.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.900 align:middle line:84%
She was interested
in new things,

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.870 align:middle line:84%
and her discoveries,
which cost her her life,

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.790 align:middle line:84%
have given us things
of great value.

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:56.150 align:middle line:84%
So we have many
examples of those

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:59.660 align:middle line:84%
who heard something that had
not yet happened and brought it

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:00.470 align:middle line:90%
into being.

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:03.110 align:middle line:90%
This is how history is changed.

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:05.090 align:middle line:84%
The word "adventure"
sounds bold,

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:07.040 align:middle line:90%
and the quest is very demanding.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.160 align:middle line:84%
It requires a great
deal of courage.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.990 align:middle line:84%
There is much
warrior language that

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.500 align:middle line:84%
is used, but very seldom are
these journeys about going off

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.300 align:middle line:90%
to war.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.380 align:middle line:84%
There may be fighting
with our demons

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:21.530 align:middle line:84%
or struggling to free
ourselves from old thinking.

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.610 align:middle line:84%
But boldness of one
kind or another,

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:27.410 align:middle line:84%
whether it is physical strength
or, more often, moral courage,

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:31.430 align:middle line:84%
that is, the ability to stand
up to the criticism of others,

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:34.940 align:middle line:84%
the doubts of others and
our own doubts in order

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:38.900 align:middle line:84%
to step into the new, that
is the warrior stance, which

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.900 align:middle line:84%
we often use masculine
language for.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.000 align:middle line:84%
But it's not at
all unique to men.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.310 align:middle line:84%
We both need this,
as we both need

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:49.790 align:middle line:84%
the tender and the creative,
the poetic, the delicate, what

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.070 align:middle line:90%
we often associate with women.

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:55.070 align:middle line:84%
But yes, at times
of crisis, we need

00:08:55.070 --> 00:09:00.020 align:middle line:84%
to take the stance, the
seeker's stance, that I must go,

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:03.350 align:middle line:84%
I must find what
needs to be known.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.660 align:middle line:84%
We tend to cling to
our innocence, which

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.300 align:middle line:90%
is a kind of ignorance, really.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.870 align:middle line:84%
It is sort of lovely,
but it's very limited.

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:13.790 align:middle line:84%
So when faced with a big
adventure, a new learning

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:16.430 align:middle line:84%
experience, we often
have reluctance.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.860 align:middle line:84%
Joseph Campbell
did not criticize

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.020 align:middle line:90%
the seeker for hesitation.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.390 align:middle line:84%
He thought that was
actually an important stage

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:26.340 align:middle line:84%
in the overall
success of the quest.

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:27.260 align:middle line:90%
It's preparatory.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:28.650 align:middle line:90%
Its dress rehearsal.

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:31.100 align:middle line:84%
It's a pilot study if
you're doing science.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.410 align:middle line:90%
These are important moments.

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:37.010 align:middle line:10%
In history collectively, we
seem to learn the same lessons

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:37.820 align:middle line:10%
again and again.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.190 align:middle line:90%
The call comes again.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:40.490 align:middle line:90%
Again we blow it.

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:43.730 align:middle line:84%
We set up international
peace making bodies

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:44.990 align:middle line:90%
and then don't fund them.

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:49.130 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we have these mistakes
that seem to reappear.

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And they often have to
do with an attachment

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:54.650 align:middle line:84%
to innocence, an attachment
to an old way of looking

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:58.970 align:middle line:84%
at something and a
mistrust of the possibility

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:03.170 align:middle line:84%
that we could do things an
entirely new way that we might

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.570 align:middle line:84%
be able to cooperate
with others.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:07.580 align:middle line:84%
Often the shift of
thinking, it has

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.560 align:middle line:84%
to do with developmental
psychology.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.070 align:middle line:84%
Simple thinking is
very black and white.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:13.340 align:middle line:90%
There's us and them.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.494 align:middle line:90%
There is male and female.

00:10:14.494 --> 00:10:15.410 align:middle line:90%
There's night and day.

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:17.242 align:middle line:90%
There's good and bad.

00:10:17.242 --> 00:10:18.950 align:middle line:84%
There are the good
guys and the bad guys.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:20.533 align:middle line:84%
That kind of thinking
is very limited.

00:10:20.533 --> 00:10:22.540 align:middle line:90%
It sounds-- mm.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:26.450 align:middle line:84%
It kind of sounds coherent,
but if you look closely,

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:30.550 align:middle line:84%
things in reality
are seldom that tidy.

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:32.990 align:middle line:10%
And the advance, the
big leap forward,

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:37.370 align:middle line:10%
is to find a way to bridge
what seems opposite.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:40.790 align:middle line:84%
In international affairs,
that's the work of peacekeepers.

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:45.200 align:middle line:84%
In our personal lives, it's to
get over ways we seem divided--

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.820 align:middle line:84%
we seem to have an
angel on one shoulder,

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.760 align:middle line:90%
a devil on the other--

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.370 align:middle line:84%
to get all of our energies
cooperating and pulling

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:54.440 align:middle line:90%
together in the same story.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.230 align:middle line:84%
In the Star Wars movie
"The Force Awakens,"

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:59.090 align:middle line:90%
there is a junk collector.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:01.610 align:middle line:84%
She's very good at
treasure-finding.

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:04.890 align:middle line:84%
That is, she's taking equipment
off of old wrecked space ships

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:05.690 align:middle line:90%
and things.

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And something happens
where she gets

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:13.820 align:middle line:84%
involved in a bold action that
is far beyond her station.

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:17.300 align:middle line:10%
There is a moment in that
story where a mentor figure,

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:18.140 align:middle line:10%
Maz Kanata--

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:19.760 align:middle line:10%
I think I'm saying it right--

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.740 align:middle line:10%
shows her some things
in the basement.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.930 align:middle line:10%
She does not want to know them.

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:27.320 align:middle line:10%
It is frightening when
our destiny is obvious,

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.560 align:middle line:10%
because it seems larger
than we can handle.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.660 align:middle line:90%
It will involve integration.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.690 align:middle line:84%
If a person has identified with
the delicate and sensitive,

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:39.500 align:middle line:84%
it will find it will require
discovering the bold.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.150 align:middle line:84%
If a person has been
bold their whole life,

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:44.240 align:middle line:84%
they might have to go
find their poetic side,

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.430 align:middle line:84%
because we will need
all of our energies

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:47.540 align:middle line:90%
to accomplish the task.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:52.490 align:middle line:90%


00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:56.930 align:middle line:84%
In the initiatory adventure,
there are terrifying moments.

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:59.930 align:middle line:10%
You will cross a threshold
or through a portal

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:01.850 align:middle line:10%
or a doorway of some kind.

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And there will be what is in
the story is called a threshold

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:05.420 align:middle line:90%
guardian.

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.400 align:middle line:84%
This is a monster
of some kind who

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.720 align:middle line:90%
is telling you to turn back.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.030 align:middle line:84%
In "The Odyssey," it was
a great, towering figure

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:13.940 align:middle line:84%
with one eye that was
ready to eat you alive.

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.670 align:middle line:84%
So, if we make progress
through history,

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.970 align:middle line:84%
it will always be
a dicey business.

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:21.580 align:middle line:84%
There will be a very
risky experience, at least

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.140 align:middle line:90%
from time to time.

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.300 align:middle line:90%
There will be great wars.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.550 align:middle line:84%
So much of the challenge
of human history

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.430 align:middle line:90%
has to do with crowding.

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:33.640 align:middle line:84%
The shift from the
matriarchal to the patriarchal

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.910 align:middle line:84%
probably had to do with
increased population.

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:38.530 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to get
along if there's

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:40.210 align:middle line:90%
a lot of space between us.

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:43.480 align:middle line:84%
As we start sharing resources
and they become more scarce,

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.760 align:middle line:84%
water and things
like that, then we

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.250 align:middle line:84%
begin setting up boundaries
and fighting over them.

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:53.440 align:middle line:84%
So, the big challenge coming up
is, again, increased crowding.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.350 align:middle line:84%
How will we live
well together if we

00:12:56.350 --> 00:13:00.190 align:middle line:84%
were packed in in big
cities that go on forever?

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:03.340 align:middle line:84%
All good stories have
allies, lots of them.

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.710 align:middle line:90%
Tom Sawyer has Huckleberry Finn.

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:07.690 align:middle line:90%
The Little Women are a group.

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:11.080 align:middle line:84%
It seems like our lives
are solitary adventures,

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.200 align:middle line:84%
that a hero's journey refers
to one seeker or traveler.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.080 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, these things
are done in groups.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.030 align:middle line:84%
The stories of the
Knights of the Roundtable

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:22.510 align:middle line:84%
are groups of knights going
out to solve problems and be

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:23.560 align:middle line:90%
of service.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.620 align:middle line:84%
So we need to be
good team players.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And we will find them at
moments of difficulty, that is,

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:31.390 align:middle line:84%
when you're studying
for a final.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:33.765 align:middle line:84%
That's when you make your best
friend for life in college

00:13:33.765 --> 00:13:36.640 align:middle line:84%
or high school because it's
a shared crisis and you have

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.050 align:middle line:90%
a shared enemy, the teacher.

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:40.970 align:middle line:84%
So we rise together, and
we work well together.

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:43.360 align:middle line:84%
The fantasy of
individual identity

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.150 align:middle line:90%
is a huge problem to overcome.

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:48.670 align:middle line:84%
The innermost cave
is our own fear,

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:51.820 align:middle line:84%
that is, individually the
things that go bump in the night

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:53.650 align:middle line:90%
deep inside of each of us.

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Collectively, the innermost
cave would be the unknown,

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:59.470 align:middle line:84%
and we are constantly
facing the unknown,

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:01.630 align:middle line:84%
and it seems like
history is speeding up,

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:03.970 align:middle line:90%
so we're facing it more often.

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And we need to be wise
as we let go of old ideas

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.500 align:middle line:84%
and trusting that new
possibilities will

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:15.340 align:middle line:84%
emerge that are every bit
as good and probably better.

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:17.050 align:middle line:90%
The real challenge is control.

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:19.180 align:middle line:84%
The real challenge
is being able to let

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:22.567 align:middle line:84%
go of what we know how to do and
our smugness and our attachment

00:14:22.567 --> 00:14:25.150 align:middle line:84%
to it and our arrogance, that
it is the best idea ever thought

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:28.400 align:middle line:84%
of, and realize there is always
going to be something better.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.560 align:middle line:90%


00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.490 align:middle line:10%
Finally, things fall apart.

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:36.460 align:middle line:10%
It is a death experience.

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.210 align:middle line:10%
It is the death of old ideas.

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:40.750 align:middle line:10%
It is the death of how we
have been looking at ourselves

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:43.120 align:middle line:10%
individually and collectively.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.930 align:middle line:84%
Jonah ends up in the
belly of the great fish.

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:48.460 align:middle line:84%
Little Red Riding is in
the belly of the wolf.

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:52.780 align:middle line:84%
That is, the belly of the beast
is being devoured by change,

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:54.940 align:middle line:90%
being devoured by our fears.

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And it would seem in a rational
story that's the end, that's

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.250 align:middle line:90%
a tragic end to the story.

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:01.570 align:middle line:90%
You've just died.

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:03.980 align:middle line:84%
But these are magical
stories, or at least they

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:07.960 align:middle line:84%
are maps that point us past what
we have known how to control.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.040 align:middle line:84%
So we have the
potential of rebirth.

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:13.750 align:middle line:84%
We might come back
from this end point

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.660 align:middle line:84%
and have a whole new
story to live out.

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, we will learn
from our previous arrogance

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:22.030 align:middle line:84%
and our previous
mistakes so that we

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:24.070 align:middle line:84%
don't head straight
into death again,

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:27.250 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps we
can set out things

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:29.940 align:middle line:90%
that will work a little better.

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.470 align:middle line:84%
To people who have always
seen things a certain way,

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:35.020 align:middle line:84%
that one group is better than
another group or things are

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:39.100 align:middle line:84%
done a certain way,
it feels terrible

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.350 align:middle line:90%
when these ideas are shaken.

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:43.300 align:middle line:90%
But they really must go.

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.670 align:middle line:84%
We are very slowly
and begrudgingly

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:47.980 align:middle line:84%
moving a little more
toward equality.

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.570 align:middle line:84%
We don't have as many kings
and queens on the planet.

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:54.280 align:middle line:84%
We have democracies
run by regular people,

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.380 align:middle line:84%
and we see ourselves
close to equal.

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And yet there is
an old hierarchy

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:01.960 align:middle line:84%
that dies hard that is not
going away very quickly.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And every now and then,
there's a step back,

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.370 align:middle line:84%
where people will
try to reconstitute

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:09.800 align:middle line:84%
very old ideas that weren't
very good even in their time.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:13.694 align:middle line:84%
So, progress is always two
steps forward and one step back.

00:16:13.694 --> 00:16:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that there
is a reversal does not

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:16.990 align:middle line:90%
mean the whole story is over.

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:19.810 align:middle line:90%
It's just a temporary setback.

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:21.020 align:middle line:90%
It is death-like, though.

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.570 align:middle line:84%
The people that
have had privilege

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:26.170 align:middle line:84%
and have to lose some of it
feel like they're being cheated.

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.420 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they've been
cheating all along,

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.220 align:middle line:84%
so the change is
toward fairness.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.335 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't feel like
that to the person that

00:16:32.335 --> 00:16:34.360 align:middle line:90%
is losing some advantage.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.970 align:middle line:84%
The metaphor of death
might involve real death.

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:41.920 align:middle line:84%
That is, there might be illness
or wars or injury of some kind.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.020 align:middle line:84%
But it really represents
something dying.

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:44.900 align:middle line:90%
It's a view.

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.880 align:middle line:90%
It's a belief system.

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.700 align:middle line:90%
It's a certain perspective.

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.510 align:middle line:90%
And it's for the best.

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:52.780 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't feel like
that, but later, you

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:54.940 align:middle line:90%
see that it makes space.

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:58.300 align:middle line:84%
The dying make space for
something to be born,

00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:59.320 align:middle line:90%
something better.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:04.410 align:middle line:90%


00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:08.390 align:middle line:10%
There is a moment of empowerment
in the mythic journey.

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:11.089 align:middle line:84%
It is something that the
individual experiences

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:14.670 align:middle line:84%
and we experience in teams
and communities as well.

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:18.950 align:middle line:84%
It is often pictured as
receiving a special weapon

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:22.730 align:middle line:84%
or tool, a sword or
a new technology.

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:26.000 align:middle line:84%
It really represents
a new skill,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.630 align:middle line:84%
that is, a new knowledge,
some kind of wisdom,

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:32.030 align:middle line:84%
some kind of understanding
that will allow

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:35.330 align:middle line:90%
us to build what is called for.

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And so once we have the
weapon-- let's call it a sword

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.680 align:middle line:90%
for symbolic reasons--

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.639 align:middle line:90%
we are able to slice.

00:17:41.639 --> 00:17:42.680 align:middle line:90%
That's what a sword does.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.810 align:middle line:90%
It cuts it cuts away the old.

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:47.000 align:middle line:90%
It cuts away the problem.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.590 align:middle line:84%
A cut is a way of
describing discernment.

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:51.290 align:middle line:84%
When you cut this
away from that,

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:54.800 align:middle line:84%
you make very difficult,
subtle decisions and choices.

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And we have big choices
to make, both personally

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.690 align:middle line:90%
and collectively in our times.

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:02.960 align:middle line:84%
So gaining a new
technology, a new knowledge,

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.740 align:middle line:84%
is what will help us
invent the future.

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:10.520 align:middle line:84%
We think of technology as we
generally experience it now,

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.430 align:middle line:84%
our new devices,
our new connections,

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:16.280 align:middle line:84%
our new ways of communicating
and moving around.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.550 align:middle line:84%
They are our new
swords for our time

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:21.920 align:middle line:84%
with which we can either
fight with each other

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.990 align:middle line:84%
or build something
that works better

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:26.420 align:middle line:90%
than anything we've had before.

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:30.230 align:middle line:84%
On a personal level, the sword
is usually additional skills.

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:33.280 align:middle line:84%
So you go to school and
learn how to do something.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.105 align:middle line:84%
And that allows you to
hold a different job

00:18:35.105 --> 00:18:36.480 align:middle line:84%
and make a different
contribution

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.104 align:middle line:84%
and make some money
and build a family,

00:18:38.104 --> 00:18:40.020 align:middle line:84%
do the things that
need to be done.

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:43.110 align:middle line:84%
So, learning is at the core
of the entire hero model.

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:45.980 align:middle line:84%
It's learning, which
is to say changing.

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And learning is a very
frustrating experience.

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:51.164 align:middle line:84%
Some people love school,
and some people just

00:18:51.164 --> 00:18:52.580 align:middle line:84%
wonder why anybody
would go there.

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:53.380 align:middle line:90%
It's so painful.

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:54.860 align:middle line:90%
Of course it's painful.

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:57.826 align:middle line:84%
It's a sustained experience
of feeling stupid.

00:18:57.826 --> 00:18:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't feel
stupid at school,

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:01.190 align:middle line:84%
you're not doing it
right, because you're not

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:02.107 align:middle line:90%
pushing hard enough.

00:19:02.107 --> 00:19:04.190 align:middle line:84%
If you read the harder
books and the harder books,

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:06.106 align:middle line:84%
finally you've got a
book, and you open it up,

00:19:06.106 --> 00:19:08.270 align:middle line:84%
and it just says on the
page, you are so stupid,

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:10.400 align:middle line:84%
which is to say
that's how it feels.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And that means I'm pushing
myself, I'm challenging,

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.890 align:middle line:84%
and I'm reaching
for my capacity.

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:19.490 align:middle line:84%
We want to become as well
learned as we can be,

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:22.110 align:middle line:84%
as well developed as
we are capable of.

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:23.540 align:middle line:90%
And that is some struggle.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:26.039 align:middle line:84%
That has certainly got
a lot of doubt in it.

00:19:26.039 --> 00:19:27.080 align:middle line:90%
We're going to be afraid.

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.850 align:middle line:90%
You cannot do this without fear.

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:31.160 align:middle line:84%
You're going to stumble
in your own dark places.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.380 align:middle line:84%
You're going to struggle
with your own demons,

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:36.770 align:middle line:84%
all in claiming the sword,
the sword of effectiveness,

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:40.160 align:middle line:84%
of ability utility would
be the word, the ability

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.340 align:middle line:84%
to cause something to happen
in the world for the better.

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.200 align:middle line:10%
In "The Lord of the
Rings," relatively early

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.810 align:middle line:10%
in the adventure,
the mentor Gandalf

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:51.640 align:middle line:10%
holds back to fight a monster
who would kill the whole team.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.740 align:middle line:10%
But he is quite a warrior, as
well as being a wise, old man.

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And he allows all of his
friends and colleagues

00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:59.960 align:middle line:84%
to get through the
dangerous place

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:04.850 align:middle line:84%
there while he fights the
fire monster and loses-- well,

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:06.560 align:middle line:84%
I guess mutually
kill each other.

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:07.790 align:middle line:90%
They both die.

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:09.350 align:middle line:10%
And we, because
we are identifying

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:10.970 align:middle line:10%
with Frodo and the
others on the team,

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:13.940 align:middle line:10%
we go on without our
leader, without our teacher,

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.650 align:middle line:10%
without the wisdom of
the previous generation.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:18.530 align:middle line:10%
We have great doubts
whether we know enough

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:20.720 align:middle line:10%
because the
challenges are great.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.850 align:middle line:84%
Later in the story,
Gandalf returns.

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:27.470 align:middle line:84%
It's a bit of a mystery how
he survived and came back.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And one little change,
his beard is now white.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:31.930 align:middle line:90%
His hair is now white.

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:34.580 align:middle line:10%
And he explains, I am no
longer Gandalf the Gray.

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:37.370 align:middle line:84%
I am now Gandalf
the White, which

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:42.090 align:middle line:84%
is to say everyone changes,
even the leaders and teachers.

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:46.580 align:middle line:84%
Everyone in a transformative
journey will be changing.

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And the change
from gray to white

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.540 align:middle line:90%
is kind of a purification.

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.580 align:middle line:84%
But it is also a
gaining of wisdom.

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And that is what is at
play in these stories.

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:59.600 align:middle line:84%
If we survive, we should
be wiser for our trouble.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:04.130 align:middle line:90%


00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:05.270 align:middle line:90%
The defeat is horrible.

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:06.950 align:middle line:84%
It feels like death
and is usually

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:09.680 align:middle line:84%
described as a death
and rebirth experience.

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.690 align:middle line:84%
Following that, you
have resurrection,

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:13.080 align:middle line:90%
redemption, return.

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.170 align:middle line:84%
These are slow
and painful steps.

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:17.480 align:middle line:84%
But you realize
you're still alive

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.980 align:middle line:84%
and that you have
gained something

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:21.080 align:middle line:84%
for your trouble,
usually symbolized

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:25.400 align:middle line:84%
as a sword, which is you
have new tools, new ways

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.800 align:middle line:84%
of thinking, new
kinds of effectiveness

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:30.260 align:middle line:90%
to use in the journey ahead.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to take steps
and realize you're strong.

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:35.630 align:middle line:84%
You are stronger
for your trouble.

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:36.950 align:middle line:90%
You make new allies.

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:38.930 align:middle line:90%
You begin gaining steam here.

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And there are new
problems to be solved.

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:45.980 align:middle line:84%
The journey back is every bit as
long and taxing as the journey

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:47.030 align:middle line:90%
to the depths.

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:50.250 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing is
quite an ordeal.

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:51.600 align:middle line:90%
But we are gaining something.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And there is no
other way to change.

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Change is an insulting,
grueling experience.

00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:00.770 align:middle line:84%
But if we want to
maximize our potentials

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:02.660 align:middle line:90%
there is no other thing to do.

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:05.510 align:middle line:84%
As we realize we
are still alive,

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:07.910 align:middle line:90%
we begin to return to the game.

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:12.890 align:middle line:84%
We return to the place of
action, the battlefield,

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:15.080 align:middle line:84%
if you take that metaphor,
the laboratory if you're

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:15.880 align:middle line:90%
doing research.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.320 align:middle line:90%
We get back to our work.

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.730 align:middle line:90%
But it's not the same person--

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:21.290 align:middle line:90%
same face, same name.

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Others may not
notice any change.

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:25.190 align:middle line:90%
And the change may be subtle.

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:27.830 align:middle line:84%
It might simply be
increased confidence.

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:30.410 align:middle line:84%
It might be increased
hope or belief

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:32.520 align:middle line:90%
that the project is worth doing.

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.550 align:middle line:90%
But we do better at it.

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:37.325 align:middle line:84%
And people look back
and say, couldn't I

00:22:37.325 --> 00:22:39.800 align:middle line:84%
have done this without
all of that ordeal?

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:40.610 align:middle line:90%
Probably not.

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:42.890 align:middle line:84%
There is no other
way to get away

00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:44.690 align:middle line:84%
from the past and
its limitations

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:46.740 align:middle line:90%
and into the new potentialities.

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:52.380 align:middle line:90%


00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:55.200 align:middle line:84%
I was the founding curator of
the Marija Gimbutas papers.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.960 align:middle line:84%
She was the leading
scholar on the goddess.

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And her theory is
that some 3,000 years

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:03.930 align:middle line:84%
before the common era, there
was a shift, that there

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:06.150 align:middle line:84%
was a matriarchal
system socially

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:08.760 align:middle line:84%
and a goddess
tradition religiously

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:12.180 align:middle line:84%
that was the dominant
way of seeing things.

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:13.440 align:middle line:90%
Things changed.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.970 align:middle line:90%
The male gods came.

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:18.270 align:middle line:84%
Certain more masculine
ideas gained dominance.

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:19.890 align:middle line:90%
The feminine did not go away.

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:22.410 align:middle line:84%
It just didn't have the
leading edge anymore.

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:24.330 align:middle line:84%
It was still very
strong and present

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:26.460 align:middle line:90%
and a little bit underground.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:29.070 align:middle line:84%
There is a notion that
perhaps at some point

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:31.410 align:middle line:90%
it will shift back.

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:36.180 align:middle line:84%
Saying it in Hegelian terms, the
feminine would be the thesis,

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:38.280 align:middle line:84%
the masculine would
be the antithesis,

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.650 align:middle line:84%
and the synthesis
would be an integration

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:42.630 align:middle line:84%
of the two, not a
return to the feminine,

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:44.730 align:middle line:84%
but the best of both
working together

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:46.830 align:middle line:84%
in a kind of
partnership culture.

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:48.960 align:middle line:84%
A popular writer
Ryan Eisler wrote

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.750 align:middle line:84%
"The Chalice and the
Blade," a retelling

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:53.640 align:middle line:90%
of Gimbutas' theories.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And is an interesting
perspective on history.

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:58.860 align:middle line:90%
We don't have good data.

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:01.890 align:middle line:84%
The evidence for the
shifts 3,000 years

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:03.940 align:middle line:84%
before the common era
is a little sketchy.

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:07.980 align:middle line:84%
But whether it's good
history or just a notion

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.870 align:middle line:90%
doesn't in the end matter.

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:12.630 align:middle line:84%
It describes a loss
of certain values,

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:16.110 align:middle line:84%
that they were underplayed and
need to come back into balance.

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:17.400 align:middle line:90%
And that we know to be true.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:21.720 align:middle line:90%


00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.250 align:middle line:84%
What we sometimes
call the feminine

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:26.400 align:middle line:84%
is probably all of the
internal values, the value

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.610 align:middle line:84%
of subjectivity, of
emotionality, creativity,

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:33.490 align:middle line:84%
the poetic things, the things
of beauty and tenderness.

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:35.860 align:middle line:84%
They get trampled during
times of ambition.

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:37.110 align:middle line:90%
And this is not unique to men.

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:39.900 align:middle line:10%
Any ambitious person is
going to push themselves,

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:42.570 align:middle line:10%
and they're going to
be rough and probably

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:45.660 align:middle line:10%
accomplish some things, win,
be achieving some things.

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:50.340 align:middle line:84%
And then at some point, probably
after we've arrived somewhere,

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:53.180 align:middle line:84%
we might wonder,
what have I missed?

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.800 align:middle line:90%
What else is there for me?

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.917 align:middle line:84%
And we go back to some of
the things we set aside

00:24:58.917 --> 00:25:00.750 align:middle line:84%
because they weren't
convenient or efficient

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:03.720 align:middle line:84%
or didn't seem like they
would help us toward our goals

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.500 align:middle line:84%
and begin to bring them
back into our definition

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:07.300 align:middle line:90%
of ourselves.

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:09.290 align:middle line:90%
This is a stage of integration.

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:12.630 align:middle line:84%
It's not that we shift values
and take a different side.

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:15.900 align:middle line:84%
It's more that we try for
the holistic perspective.

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:18.240 align:middle line:84%
During a time of
great growth, a nation

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:21.720 align:middle line:84%
might be very instrumental,
very productive, a lot of energy

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.760 align:middle line:84%
put into factories
and technology.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And then after we pollute
the air a little too much,

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:28.200 align:middle line:84%
we might say, weren't
there some other things

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:33.480 align:middle line:84%
we liked, walking in the
woods, enjoying a lake that

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.490 align:middle line:90%
wasn't too polluted?

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:39.210 align:middle line:84%
We might go back to
trusting nature and beauty

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:42.480 align:middle line:84%
and the poetic side of
things collectively and find

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.270 align:middle line:84%
some balance, not that we
tear the factories down,

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:47.460 align:middle line:84%
but we build a
park next to them.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:52.440 align:middle line:84%
If we survive the ordeals, if
we return from the deathlike

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.560 align:middle line:84%
moment, we have something
for our trouble,

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:58.425 align:middle line:84%
sometimes called the boon or
the reward or the elixir--

00:25:58.425 --> 00:26:02.190 align:middle line:84%
a good word, the elixir,
a healing potion.

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:04.740 align:middle line:10%
And it's symbolized
in some stories

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:06.480 align:middle line:10%
as a vial of magical medicine.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.370 align:middle line:10%
But it is the wisdom.

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:10.620 align:middle line:10%
It is the new way
of looking at things

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:12.690 align:middle line:10%
that will allow us
to solve problems

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:14.130 align:middle line:10%
that seemed intractable.

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:15.734 align:middle line:10%
This is what we get.

00:26:15.734 --> 00:26:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And there isn't any
other way to get it.

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:21.420 align:middle line:84%
It involves a radical and
disheveling learning process.

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.310 align:middle line:84%
The elixir is not
the private property

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:25.170 align:middle line:84%
of an individual
seeker or a group.

00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:28.800 align:middle line:84%
If some group stumbles
on some great idea,

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:31.340 align:middle line:84%
they may hold the copyright
for a little while.

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.300 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, it
needs to be shared.

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.570 align:middle line:90%
And the point is collective.

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:39.090 align:middle line:84%
The point of the entire
initiatory adventure

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:44.280 align:middle line:84%
is that we all gain in the
new idea, the new elixir that

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:45.150 align:middle line:90%
can help.

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:47.490 align:middle line:84%
In the large sense
collectively, if we

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:51.810 align:middle line:84%
are able to come to the
elixir, a new philosophy

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:55.710 align:middle line:84%
of living, what we will gain
is something like peace.

00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:58.440 align:middle line:10%
We will find an ability
to put up with people

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.300 align:middle line:10%
who are different from us.

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.820 align:middle line:84%
We will find an ability
on a personal level

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:04.440 align:middle line:84%
to put up with the
parts of ourselves

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.106 align:middle line:84%
we've never gotten
along with very well.

00:27:06.106 --> 00:27:09.000 align:middle line:84%
This is enormously important
in psychological work

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.420 align:middle line:90%
on a personal level.

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:14.260 align:middle line:84%
So if we find the elixir,
it will be shared.

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:17.760 align:middle line:84%
It can be hoarded temporarily,
but it will come out.

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And the advantage is
everyone benefits,

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:23.910 align:middle line:90%
and we are all better off.

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:27.480 align:middle line:84%
Apparently we need to learn
the same lessons over and over

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:28.510 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:32.640 align:middle line:84%
We are partly bold, brave,
smart adventurers and partly

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.650 align:middle line:84%
silly fools that shoot
ourselves in the foot.

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:39.060 align:middle line:84%
OK, we need to be humble,
and perhaps we are fools so

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.070 align:middle line:90%
that we will stay humble.

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:43.740 align:middle line:84%
There is great arrogance
if great power is gained,

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.670 align:middle line:84%
and we have to
recover from that.

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:49.170 align:middle line:84%
So, foolishness allows
us to laugh at ourselves.

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's a sense
of fun and play.

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.080 align:middle line:90%
We need that.

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.810 align:middle line:84%
We can get overly serious and
take ourselves too seriously.

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:58.020 align:middle line:84%
We need the generosity
of the fool,

00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:00.900 align:middle line:84%
the entertainer, the clown
who just wants to make people

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:04.830 align:middle line:84%
happy, even though they
themselves might be a bit sad.

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:06.220 align:middle line:10%
We need all of
that in ourselves.

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:10.860 align:middle line:10%
So, yes, we need strong heroes,
and we need wonderful fools.

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:13.890 align:middle line:84%
One of the great advantages
of studying the heroic journey

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:16.330 align:middle line:90%
is that it is a quest model.

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:18.450 align:middle line:90%
It's not a one right answer.

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:20.430 align:middle line:84%
It suggests we need
different answers

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:22.560 align:middle line:84%
for different stages
of the adventure,

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.890 align:middle line:84%
that we will learn
different things and change.

00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:27.060 align:middle line:10%
It as a model involving change.

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:30.330 align:middle line:10%
It says, you don't
know enough, not now.

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:32.520 align:middle line:84%
You need to go learn
some more things

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.800 align:middle line:84%
and that you can
see about where you

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.830 align:middle line:84%
are in the progression
of the story.

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And you can realize
this is not the end.

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:43.260 align:middle line:84%
I may be in the belly
of the whale right now,

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:47.050 align:middle line:84%
but in all those old stories
I read, you get out of that.

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:47.850 align:middle line:90%
You live on.

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:49.290 align:middle line:90%
The best part comes later.

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:52.810 align:middle line:84%
This is enormously important
for people who are discouraged.

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:54.880 align:middle line:84%
This is not the
end of the story.

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:58.140 align:middle line:84%
It is time to pick up
ourselves and press on.

00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:02.090 align:middle line:10%
