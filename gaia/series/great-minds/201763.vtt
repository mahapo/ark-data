00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.530 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm Freddy Silva and
in this lifetime, anyway,

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.510 align:middle line:10%
I am a researcher of ancient
systems of knowledge and best

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.140 align:middle line:10%
selling author, documentary
filmmaker, wannabe musician,

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.040 align:middle line:10%
and generally a person who likes
to find out what makes things

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.936 align:middle line:10%
tick.

00:00:41.936 --> 00:00:44.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm what we consider
to be a security risk.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.150 align:middle line:84%
I have three passports
and three nationalities.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.580 align:middle line:84%
I was born in Portugal in
a place called the Garden

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.983 align:middle line:90%
of the Gods in Sintra.

00:00:50.983 --> 00:00:53.150 align:middle line:84%
It's a place where they
have sacred sites going back

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.598 align:middle line:90%
6,000 years.

00:00:54.598 --> 00:00:56.390 align:middle line:84%
It literally looks like
the Garden of Eden.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.760 align:middle line:84%
It's a place in an
arid environment

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.950 align:middle line:90%
that it's this bucolic garden.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.650 align:middle line:90%
It was a very lonely childhood.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I didn't really
get along with my peers.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.280 align:middle line:84%
I was blonde and kind
of blue-green eyed.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And I am 6' 5",
for heaven's sake.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't look like an
average Portuguese person.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that
I love geology--

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.630 align:middle line:90%
I love playing with the stones.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.570 align:middle line:84%
The stones had little
bits of gold in it

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.950 align:middle line:90%
and bits of dinosaur.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.510 align:middle line:84%
They're everywhere
where we lived.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.170 align:middle line:84%
I'd dangle from trees,
which were fruit trees.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.480 align:middle line:84%
My passion was
actually in the lands,

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.490 align:middle line:84%
where my research
really goes back to,

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.380 align:middle line:84%
but my parents idea
of a great time

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.330 align:middle line:84%
was for me to become a banker,
or a lawyer, or an architect.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.490 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't really get
any consolation from them.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.470 align:middle line:90%


00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.800 align:middle line:84%
There was one year when
my biological parents

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.530 align:middle line:84%
moved to London and left me
alone with my grandparents.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.273 align:middle line:84%
And it was sad, but I look back
right now with great fondness

00:01:54.273 --> 00:01:55.940 align:middle line:84%
because I learned so
much from these two

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.840 align:middle line:84%
people who were peasants
living in the eastern part

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.770 align:middle line:90%
of Portugal.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.000 align:middle line:90%
Very poor.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And we had no electricity, no
running water, and no toilet.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.880 align:middle line:84%
If you wanted to excuse yourself
in the middle of the night,

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.740 align:middle line:84%
you had to go and
cross the train track

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.710 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, pull down
your drawers over a cliff

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.390 align:middle line:84%
and hope that the
wind wasn't too cold.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you called
developing character.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.970 align:middle line:84%
But it was the most
spiritual experience

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.770 align:middle line:84%
I had because I
suddenly realized

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.140 align:middle line:84%
that my grandparents
being so close to the land

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.660 align:middle line:84%
and having so little
in material goods

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.910 align:middle line:90%
understood the rhythm of nature.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.430 align:middle line:84%
My grandmother was
born on Beltane,

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.680 align:middle line:90%
which is a Celtic feast.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.230 align:middle line:84%
My grandfather was born
on the spring equinox.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.625 align:middle line:84%
They were like
two divine beings.

00:02:37.625 --> 00:02:40.190 align:middle line:90%


00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.250 align:middle line:84%
My parents migrated to
London when I was eight,

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.350 align:middle line:84%
so I went to England,
which is why I've developed

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.930 align:middle line:90%
this ridiculous accent.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.710 align:middle line:84%
I had to literally cram
English into my understanding

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.510 align:middle line:90%
within three months.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.450 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know, you're a
foreigner in a foreign land.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.980 align:middle line:90%
Everybody is beating up on you.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And you wear glasses and you're
taller than everybody else.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.595 align:middle line:90%
You're a target.

00:03:02.595 --> 00:03:04.220 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was a
difficult childhood.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.380 align:middle line:90%
I had no way of belonging.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.380 align:middle line:84%
It's like I sort of got dumped
here from a different planet

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.180 align:middle line:90%
and was left on my own.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.140 align:middle line:84%
So I began to develop my
own system of belonging

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.870 align:middle line:84%
to the world, and I kind
of got involved much more

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.510 align:middle line:90%
into material things.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And it was a meeting
with Freddie Mercury,

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.730 align:middle line:84%
of all people, when I was
walking back from school--

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.920 align:middle line:84%
back in the days when
he was dating women--

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.540 align:middle line:90%
and I'd walk behind him.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.510 align:middle line:90%
And there's two gods--

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.270 align:middle line:84%
they were dressed in
pure black leather--

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.880 align:middle line:84%
long, dark hair all the
way down to their waist.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, who
are these gods?

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:37.950 align:middle line:90%
I must have been 12.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.950 align:middle line:90%
And I walked past him--

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.760 align:middle line:84%
"Mr. Mercury, I've
got all your albums!"

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.760 align:middle line:90%
"What, all two of them?"

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.840 align:middle line:90%
"Yes."

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.820 align:middle line:90%
"Well done."

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I want
to be like this guy.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.480 align:middle line:84%
I want to have a woman
that looks like a goddess

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.650 align:middle line:84%
and I want to go on
stage and be a god.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.650 align:middle line:90%
And it kind of drove me.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.290 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.240 align:middle line:10%
I had the hair, and the
pose, and everything.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.100 align:middle line:84%
I liked the idea of having 1,000
people showing me their armpits

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.563 align:middle line:90%
after I played the power chord.

00:04:06.563 --> 00:04:08.230 align:middle line:84%
But I also knew I
didn't have the talent

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.650 align:middle line:90%
it took to be a rock star.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.010 align:middle line:90%
At least I was quite sensible.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.170 align:middle line:84%
So I think I was in
England for about 20 years.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.850 align:middle line:84%
I left when I was 28
and I moved to America.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.140 align:middle line:90%
I initially moved to Chicago.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.416 align:middle line:84%
And then I went to advertising--
a creative director-- and then

00:04:23.416 --> 00:04:25.090 align:middle line:90%
an art director and a writer.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.460 align:middle line:90%
But it was very unsatisfactory.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.080 align:middle line:84%
It was making a
lot of money, but I

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.120 align:middle line:84%
felt that, like, I
wasn't really doing what

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.950 align:middle line:90%
I was supposed to be doing.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.590 align:middle line:10%
You buy the big house, the
sports car, the two pussycats,

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.490 align:middle line:10%
you get married, and
something's missing.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.440 align:middle line:90%
It was around about 1992.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, I got laid off, like
everybody else in America,

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.100 align:middle line:84%
and I was watching
something on television.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And it was a news item and
there was a combine harvester

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.340 align:middle line:84%
going through a field, and it
kind of looked like England.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Recently, a new kind
of temple has appeared

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.760 align:middle line:10%
in the landscape.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.440 align:middle line:10%
>> And I was looking at this
mysterious symbol being plowed

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.630 align:middle line:10%
out by a machine and I
knew exactly what it was.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:05.650 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't explain it.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Although they gained
prominence in the media during

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.710 align:middle line:10%
the late 1980s, the crop circles
can be traced back to 1680.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>> I've seen this before,
but I can't explain it.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.380 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment,
something just clicked.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And my commercial
career went like this,

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.110 align:middle line:84%
but my spirituality
was beginning to go up.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, something
just crossed and I said,

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take a
big leap of faith.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.440 align:middle line:84%
But in order to do it properly,
I had to give up my life.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.080 align:middle line:84%
I have to give up my
marriage, my house, my cars.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.550 align:middle line:90%
The cats are gone.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:38.780 align:middle line:90%
That was hard.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And my whole life literally just
got destroyed within a month.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.340 align:middle line:90%
Just wonderful fun.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.250 align:middle line:90%
And I moved back to England.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.590 align:middle line:84%
I was thrust out of work because
my passion was elsewhere.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.083 align:middle line:90%


00:05:53.083 --> 00:05:55.000 align:middle line:84%
You can't just research
just from an armchair.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.740 align:middle line:84%
You have to go back and
breathe it, drink it, touch it,

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.820 align:middle line:90%
talk to people.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.970 align:middle line:84%
Without the experience,
there's something missing.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.750 align:middle line:10%
So I just took a car and I went
to the fields and I got out

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.960 align:middle line:10%
and I walked and I went,
that's interesting.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.750 align:middle line:84%
I think that there's a god
that protects stupid tourists,

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.500 align:middle line:90%
and I'm one of them.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And I just felt very
guided along the way.

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.210 align:middle line:84%
I'd go into a crop
circle at night

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:25.127 align:middle line:84%
and I said, how does this
relate to human consciousness?

00:06:25.127 --> 00:06:27.210 align:middle line:10%
And how does this evolve
this, and that, and that?

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.238 align:middle line:10%
And I don't know.

00:06:29.238 --> 00:06:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And next thing I know, I'm
levitating above the ground.

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm watching my arms
floating past me.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.940 align:middle line:90%
And I had these six people--

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.570 align:middle line:84%
three on either side, one at the
very end, with one behind them.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.150 align:middle line:84%
I can see them as clearly
as it was yesterday.

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:43.920 align:middle line:84%
They're very tall,
very slim, dressed

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.960 align:middle line:90%
in this beautiful white satin.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And the person at
the end at my feet

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.600 align:middle line:84%
is making these gestures
like Balinese dancers.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.590 align:middle line:90%
Very elegant.

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.120 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, oh, I see.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.170 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.830 align:middle line:84%
It was like a
subconscious communication

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.190 align:middle line:90%
that was going on.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.820 align:middle line:90%
And then I heard a click.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And I hit the ground
with such a thud

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.320 align:middle line:84%
that I still had the bump
on my head the next morning.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And back in the day
when we used cassettes,

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.800 align:middle line:90%
I took a little cassette tape--

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.240 align:middle line:90%
the music of Jonn Serrie--

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.270 align:middle line:84%
and it was on a C90 tape,
so I had 45 minutes.

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.030 align:middle line:84%
So I know that that experience
lasted for 45 minutes

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:19.980 align:middle line:84%
because the moment
I left the body

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.550 align:middle line:84%
and then I hear this click
is when the tape stops.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And when you get levitated
and you go out of body

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.410 align:middle line:84%
and you see people
in the other world

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:31.833 align:middle line:84%
and you feel a sense of this
loving support and you go,

00:07:31.833 --> 00:07:33.250 align:middle line:84%
there's something
very important--

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:37.338 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what it is, but my
curiosity will see it through.

00:07:37.338 --> 00:07:38.880 align:middle line:84%
It was at that moment
that I suddenly

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.940 align:middle line:90%
realized I had a job to do.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing it not
because I wanted to

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.570 align:middle line:84%
but because I was being
pushed in that direction.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.330 align:middle line:90%


00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And I began to learn
about the mysteries

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.203 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient world-- about
the invisible universe, gods,

00:07:53.203 --> 00:07:54.870 align:middle line:84%
spirits, whatever you
want to call them.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:55.920 align:middle line:90%
Devas.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:59.450 align:middle line:10%
I wrote a book, which I
had no intention of doing,

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:02.030 align:middle line:10%
and it becomes a
best selling book,

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:03.420 align:middle line:10%
translated in six languages.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And here I am, 20 odd
years later, still touring.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.330 align:middle line:10%
>> These people that were
depicting in the petroglyphs

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.630 align:middle line:10%
are called lookers
and the watchers,

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:15.750 align:middle line:10%
and these are the people that
also appear around 11,000 years

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.330 align:middle line:10%
ago, just before a big
flood consumes the whole

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:21.930 align:middle line:10%
of the Earth, and also the
fundamental consciousness now

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.570 align:middle line:10%
of who's behind the core
group of the phenomenon.

00:08:27.916 --> 00:08:30.613 align:middle line:90%


00:08:30.613 --> 00:08:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Just kept sending out the
story, sending out the story,

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.770 align:middle line:84%
but there was something
nagging me about this.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:36.395 align:middle line:84%
I figured, I've
got this backwards.

00:08:36.395 --> 00:08:38.608 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:38.608 --> 00:08:40.150 align:middle line:10%
I really should have
been researching

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:43.900 align:middle line:10%
ancient sacred sites
because the one thing

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.610 align:middle line:10%
I learned more
about crop circles

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:48.040 align:middle line:10%
was about understanding
how ancient temples work.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Because crop circles and ancient
temples are the same thing.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.560 align:middle line:10%
One is made of stone, the other
one is made of crushed wheat.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Tiwanaku is probably
the world's oldest temple.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.630 align:middle line:10%
The mega lifts along
its central plaza

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:05.200 align:middle line:10%
reference significant celestial
events along the horizon

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.510 align:middle line:10%
in 15,000 BC.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:11.290 align:middle line:10%
The stones, quarries as
much as 55 miles away,

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:13.270 align:middle line:10%
was said to have been
moved through the air

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:14.960 align:middle line:10%
to the sound of the trumpets.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.190 align:middle line:10%
>> They function exactly
on the same principles.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.260 align:middle line:10%
They are achieving
the same ends, which

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.015 align:middle line:10%
is alteration of consciousness.

00:09:22.015 --> 00:09:23.890 align:middle line:10%
And then that led me to
write the second book

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.020 align:middle line:10%
and the information
just came out so quickly

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.390 align:middle line:10%
because I'd already
experienced so much of it.

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:30.370 align:middle line:10%
It really wrote itself
in a few months.

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:32.830 align:middle line:10%
>> On this one, you are
totally outdone yourself.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:35.560 align:middle line:10%
I've been a fan of your work
since the crop circle work.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.100 align:middle line:10%
This is a different
octave of information.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.810 align:middle line:10%
>> It's the essential guide to
how these things actually do

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:41.740 align:middle line:10%
what they do.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:44.110 align:middle line:10%
Every single text says
that within these arcs

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:47.322 align:middle line:10%
there were seven sages
that survived the flood.

00:09:47.322 --> 00:09:49.280 align:middle line:10%
They all knew the knowledge
of temple building.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.790 align:middle line:10%
They knew how to locate
the Earth's hot spots.

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:53.410 align:middle line:10%
And after the
flood receded, they

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:56.260 align:middle line:10%
were to go walk about,
build primordial mounds,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.750 align:middle line:10%
and then these mounds
would form the basis

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:00.430 align:middle line:10%
of the future historic temples--

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:01.900 align:middle line:10%
the ones that we see today.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.660 align:middle line:10%
We're talking about a span
here of over 8,000 years.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:06.130 align:middle line:10%
It's a long time.

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:08.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm slowly figuring
out the lost pieces

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:12.760 align:middle line:84%
of an ancient system of
technology and knowledge

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.670 align:middle line:84%
that keeps getting destroyed,
or buried, or systematically

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:18.640 align:middle line:84%
destroyed by religion
or organized power,

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.610 align:middle line:84%
and bringing that
back into the fore.

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:23.260 align:middle line:84%
I think so many
theories and books

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.877 align:middle line:84%
have been written about an
idea, a theory that then has--

00:10:25.877 --> 00:10:27.460 align:middle line:84%
where the information
and the evidence

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.803 align:middle line:84%
has to be shoehorned
into the theory.

00:10:29.803 --> 00:10:30.970 align:middle line:90%
I work the other way around.

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:34.082 align:middle line:84%
I follow an idea and
I follow the evidence

00:10:34.082 --> 00:10:36.040 align:middle line:84%
and let the theory develop
out of the evidence.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a much,
much more grounded way

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.270 align:middle line:84%
of doing things because
then it allows me

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:42.310 align:middle line:84%
to free-associate,
which ironically is

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.080 align:middle line:90%
what I did during advertising.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.820 align:middle line:84%
Because I could
free-associate ideas.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:49.120 align:middle line:84%
I'd find common points,
connect them into a message.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.530 align:middle line:84%
So advertising
actually taught me

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:54.490 align:middle line:84%
how to sell the ancient
world to a modern audience.

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Every single sacred site
on the face of the Earth is

00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:59.830 align:middle line:84%
aligned exactly where the
Earth's telluric currents

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:00.880 align:middle line:90%
happen to be.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Whether they were
manipulated there

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:05.350 align:middle line:84%
or whether they were
already there to begin with,

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:06.790 align:middle line:90%
that's another story.

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:10.180 align:middle line:84%
>> You sort of put the work out
there and you let the arrows

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:11.650 align:middle line:90%
fall on top of you.

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:13.222 align:middle line:84%
But if you've done
your homework,

00:11:13.222 --> 00:11:14.680 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to
make anything up.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And so far, I've seemed to
be winning every argument

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.710 align:middle line:84%
because whenever I get attacked,
I just put the evidence--

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:22.030 align:middle line:90%
I said, this is the evidence.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:24.552 align:middle line:84%
Can you suggest
that this is wrong

00:11:24.552 --> 00:11:26.260 align:middle line:84%
or there's something
untoward about this?

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.870 align:middle line:84%
Because if there is, I
will change my theory.

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:31.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, much of the
communication that we see

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:33.760 align:middle line:10%
in the crop circle world is
actually based on the universal

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:38.150 align:middle line:10%
language of mathematics and its
visual expression, geometry.

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:40.450 align:middle line:10%
Especially a very
complex geometry

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:43.390 align:middle line:10%
like Ptolemy's
theorem of chords.

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:46.300 align:middle line:10%
>> The whole point of science
is to let the evidence drive

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:47.842 align:middle line:10%
the theory, not the
other way around.

00:11:47.842 --> 00:11:49.300 align:middle line:84%
Because the moment
I'll say this is

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.700 align:middle line:84%
exactly how it was-- that's
the moment that my fall comes

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.190 align:middle line:84%
around because tomorrow
someone will walk into the room

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.710 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, we just discovered
something that totally

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:57.820 align:middle line:90%
contradicts your theory.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:58.490 align:middle line:90%
Where are you now?

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:00.340 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm in a better
place because now we

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:03.190 align:middle line:84%
can ditch that theory,
add that, and now we

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.420 align:middle line:84%
can expand our understanding
of the ancient world.

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:08.920 align:middle line:84%
That's how science works, or
how it's supposed to work.

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>> This particular design
has a number of geometries.

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.900 align:middle line:84%
One is the pentagram,
which is hardwired

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.910 align:middle line:84%
in the elements,
which are flattened,

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:17.860 align:middle line:84%
and you can see the
relationship of the gaps

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:19.420 align:middle line:84%
in between the areas
that are risen,

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:20.700 align:middle line:90%
the ones that are flattened.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.590 align:middle line:84%
The pentagram is essentially the
geometry of living organisms.

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:25.960 align:middle line:10%
And also the hexagram,
which is the geometry

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:30.850 align:middle line:10%
of non-living organisms, such
as crystals, for example.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>> And I've been on permanent
tour learning the things that I

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.380 align:middle line:90%
was so passionate about--

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:39.187 align:middle line:84%
ancient sacred sites,
ancient systems of knowledge.

00:12:39.187 --> 00:12:40.270 align:middle line:90%
How do we come to be here?

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:43.150 align:middle line:84%
Why do we build big
pyramids and use big stones?

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:44.080 align:middle line:90%
What was the purpose?

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.510 align:middle line:84%
What were these people
smoking that they

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:50.470 align:middle line:84%
induced them to build this
civilization that we inherited?

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's this quest
that drives me.

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:55.540 align:middle line:90%


00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.930 align:middle line:84%
One day I got the chance to go
to the Great Pyramid of Giza.

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:00.520 align:middle line:84%
Knew very little
about it back then.

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.310 align:middle line:84%
I was working with
a spiritual group.

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And there we are in
the King's Chamber

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:07.723 align:middle line:84%
and everybody
leaves the building.

00:13:07.723 --> 00:13:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you've ever been
to the Great Pyramid,

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.730 align:middle line:84%
the place is overrun
with screaming children,

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:15.850 align:middle line:84%
loud, excited people,
and it's so finely tuned

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:18.720 align:middle line:90%
that only a whisper is required.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, the noise
disappeared and then

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.920 align:middle line:90%
the lights went off.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.410 align:middle line:84%
So we were in complete
darkness-- four people--

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:26.890 align:middle line:90%
in the King's Chamber.

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
guides says to me,

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.587 align:middle line:84%
you've had more experience
with this than all of us,

00:13:30.587 --> 00:13:32.050 align:middle line:84%
why don't you do
a toning in here?

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:34.337 align:middle line:84%
I said, I don't think I
really know how to tone.

00:13:34.337 --> 00:13:35.920 align:middle line:84%
I'll make some sounds
that I think are

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.710 align:middle line:90%
appropriate for the building.

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:40.588 align:middle line:84%
And the moment I start
to do the toning,

00:13:40.588 --> 00:13:42.130 align:middle line:84%
there's stuff coming
out of my throat

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:44.470 align:middle line:90%
that I've never done in my life.

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:46.170 align:middle line:90%
It was incredible.

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And I hear it from
the other three guys,

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.890 align:middle line:84%
none of whom had
done this before.

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And we're getting caught
up in this wonderful music.

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And I saw about 30 people
coming out of the stones,

00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:58.480 align:middle line:90%
surrounding us--

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.723 align:middle line:84%
same people that
I've seen when I

00:14:00.723 --> 00:14:02.140 align:middle line:84%
was levitating in
the crop circle,

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:03.670 align:middle line:90%
dressed in the same way.

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Very tall, slight
elongated heads.

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.012 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful people.

00:14:08.012 --> 00:14:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And I went, I hope
someone else can see this.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:16.120 align:middle line:84%
We went back out into the
sunlight and I said, all right.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:16.930 align:middle line:90%
I'll go first.

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:18.520 align:middle line:84%
Did anybody see
what I saw in there?

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.323 align:middle line:84%
And one of them goes,
what, the people

00:14:20.323 --> 00:14:21.490 align:middle line:90%
that came out of the stones?

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:22.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:22.937 align:middle line:90%
Oh, they're very tall.

00:14:22.937 --> 00:14:25.520 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and they're dressed in
this white sort of satin thing.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.720 align:middle line:90%
So we all saw this then?

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And we all went very
quiet and white.

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And then we took turns going
into the sarcophagus for about

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:36.580 align:middle line:90%
five minutes.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what happens
in that box, but in two minutes

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm out of body and I've gone
into places that you could only

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:45.340 align:middle line:90%
imagine and come back.

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.613 align:middle line:90%
It's living stone.

00:14:47.613 --> 00:14:49.030 align:middle line:84%
When you're at the
right frequency

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:52.410 align:middle line:84%
and the right spiritual metal,
you connect with the temple.

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:53.830 align:middle line:90%
You become part of the temple.

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And you dissolve and
the stone becomes you.

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:57.550 align:middle line:90%
The two are indivisible.

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And I started writing
stuff like crazy.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.475 align:middle line:84%
That was a hell
of an experience.

00:15:01.475 --> 00:15:04.387 align:middle line:90%


00:15:04.387 --> 00:15:06.220 align:middle line:84%
It was interesting to
find out that wherever

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:08.620 align:middle line:84%
you go around the world looking
at ancient civilizations,

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:12.107 align:middle line:84%
don't ever go to the academic
circle to begin with.

00:15:12.107 --> 00:15:14.440 align:middle line:84%
Ask the local people because
they know that story better

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.640 align:middle line:90%
than anybody else.

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.818 align:middle line:84%
Sit down, shut your
mouth, and listen.

00:15:17.818 --> 00:15:18.860 align:middle line:90%
That's what I love doing.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:20.420 align:middle line:84%
I want to hear what
they have to say.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And every story that I've
heard around the world--

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:25.570 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the Hopi, the Zuni,
the Waitaha of New Zealand,

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:27.760 align:middle line:84%
which hardly anyone's
ever heard of.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:31.560 align:middle line:84%
People in Japan, the Ainu,
people in the Middle East,

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.480 align:middle line:84%
certainly the ancient
Egyptians, the Azores--

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.410 align:middle line:84%
they'll describe
it in the same way.

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:39.910 align:middle line:84%
They all talk about these
predeluvian gods, antediluvian

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:43.930 align:middle line:84%
gods, which form the backbone
of a parallel civilization

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:45.210 align:middle line:90%
alongside humans.

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:48.520 align:middle line:84%
They said that they already had
developed much better intellect

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:51.250 align:middle line:84%
and, certainly, they were
renowned for having control

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:53.600 align:middle line:90%
over the laws of nature.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.930 align:middle line:84%
They were described as
human-like, but not quite

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:56.740 align:middle line:90%
human.

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:59.470 align:middle line:90%
Very tall, elongated skulls.

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:02.590 align:middle line:84%
Red hair and green eyes
or blonde with blue eyes.

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:03.690 align:middle line:90%
Light skinned.

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:04.690 align:middle line:90%
Not white skinned.

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:06.500 align:middle line:90%
Light skinned.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.490 align:middle line:84%
They were all magicians,
masters of the sacred arts,

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:14.650 align:middle line:84%
great astronomers, extraordinary
seafarers, great architects,

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:17.860 align:middle line:84%
and they certainly knew
the mechanics of nature.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And if you asked them,
they would teach you them

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.850 align:middle line:84%
so that you can
be just like them.

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:23.267 align:middle line:84%
They didn't keep
it to themselves.

00:16:23.267 --> 00:16:26.043 align:middle line:90%
They would give it you freely.

00:16:26.043 --> 00:16:27.460 align:middle line:84%
So they were the
original teachers

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.340 align:middle line:90%
that we called the gods.

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:33.190 align:middle line:84%
A god is nothing more
than a source of nature.

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:34.150 align:middle line:90%
A plant is a god.

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:36.590 align:middle line:90%
A rock is a god.

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:38.920 align:middle line:84%
An electric guitar
is a god in itself.

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:40.240 align:middle line:90%
Everything is living.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And once you understand the
life force behind a plant

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.460 align:middle line:84%
and you take it into your
life, you become as a god.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:51.590 align:middle line:84%
That's where the word
really comes from.

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:55.427 align:middle line:84%
So my knowledge really comes
from getting under their skin

00:16:55.427 --> 00:16:57.010 align:middle line:84%
and finding out,
what were they doing?

00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:59.350 align:middle line:84%
What were they doing here
to create a golden age?

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:02.200 align:middle line:10%
How do they move big
rocks through the air?

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.089 align:middle line:84%
What were they doing
with the laws of nature?

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And the whole point of
it that I can distill

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.290 align:middle line:84%
is to literally
understand who you

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:10.960 align:middle line:84%
are as an individual, your
relationship to nature,

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.760 align:middle line:84%
and your place in the
bigger scheme of things.

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And when you strip this aside,
take all of this information

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:19.780 align:middle line:84%
away and look at the big picture
as though you're looking down

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:24.160 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, it really comes
down to a very basic concept--

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.089 align:middle line:90%
who am I?

00:17:26.089 --> 00:17:26.980 align:middle line:90%
Who am I as a soul?

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:28.349 align:middle line:90%
Where do I come from?

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:30.970 align:middle line:90%
And what am I doing here?

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:32.630 align:middle line:90%
It really is that simple.

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And the way you do it is
by having experiences.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And you grow the
experiences and then you

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.830 align:middle line:84%
learn the laws of
nature, and you

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:40.330 align:middle line:84%
learn to mimic
the laws of nature

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.700 align:middle line:84%
to a point where you can
control the law of nature.

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.259 align:middle line:90%
You become as nature.

00:17:45.259 --> 00:17:47.530 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:50.438 align:middle line:84%
The Templars really
was an offshoot.

00:17:50.438 --> 00:17:52.230 align:middle line:84%
How do Templars fit in
with ancient systems

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:55.430 align:middle line:84%
of knowledge, pyramids,
stone circles, and watchers?

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And you think, I
don't think they do.

00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And originally I'd set
out to just figure out

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.580 align:middle line:84%
the connection between
Portugal and why we're

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.010 align:middle line:90%
so obsessed with the Templars.

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:05.760 align:middle line:84%
I really didn't see
the connection either.

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Always thought Templars were
part of the crusade, which

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:10.350 align:middle line:90%
is completely wrong.

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:12.780 align:middle line:84%
Crusaders and Templars
are two different people.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And they came from
France, Belgium,

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:17.710 align:middle line:84%
and they formed these secret
societies, a banking system,

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:20.700 align:middle line:84%
and then they all
burned at the stake.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.730 align:middle line:10%
Anyway, five years later
it began to mushroom

00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:25.140 align:middle line:10%
because I realized
and discovered

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:28.890 align:middle line:10%
that the Templars had
founded my country of birth.

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:30.840 align:middle line:10%
And not only did they
found the country,

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.080 align:middle line:10%
they did it before the Templars
were official in Jerusalem.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And I went, my god, this
is a historical first.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.100 align:middle line:90%
What have I stumbled upon?

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even know
where I'm going with this.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.038 align:middle line:84%
But I hit a roadblock--
big roadblock.

00:18:43.038 --> 00:18:45.330 align:middle line:10%
>> So you start piecing all
these bits together and you

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.580 align:middle line:10%
think, there's something
more going on here than meets

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:48.380 align:middle line:10%
the eye.

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:50.160 align:middle line:10%
There's something
much more interesting.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.310 align:middle line:84%
What happened was that the
Templars-- these nine men--

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:57.810 align:middle line:84%
supposedly spent all of their
time secreted on Temple Mount.

00:18:57.810 --> 00:18:59.310 align:middle line:90%
Doing what?

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:03.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, they spent all their
time digging tunnels.

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:06.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Little did I know that I had
to go and learn more about how

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:08.260 align:middle line:10%
sacred space works because
in order to understand

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:11.520 align:middle line:10%
the Templars, you have to
understand the spiritual aspect

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.370 align:middle line:10%
of the Templars and why
the Templars were looking

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:17.190 align:middle line:10%
for specific places in Europe
where to build their temples,

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:19.410 align:middle line:10%
or they would go
and rebuild a site,

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:21.720 align:middle line:10%
always dedicated to
The Divine Feminine.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.150 align:middle line:84%
I thought, that doesn't
sound like a bunch of guys

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:26.940 align:middle line:84%
with swords that went around
killing and dealing with money.

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:29.940 align:middle line:84%
This is a ministerial
college and it

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.620 align:middle line:84%
behaves like a
ministerial college

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:32.920 align:middle line:90%
working with a big secret.

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.270 align:middle line:90%
What's the big secret about?

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out
once you understand

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.160 align:middle line:84%
why the Templars chose
Portugal as a place

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.430 align:middle line:84%
to occupy and create their
own kingdom within a kingdom--

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:43.200 align:middle line:84%
and what they were
practicing there

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.140 align:middle line:84%
was identical to what they'd
been doing in Japan in 8,000

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:52.740 align:middle line:84%
BC, in India in 6,000 BC,
and the whole time of Egypt.

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:56.070 align:middle line:84%
The same mystery secrets
of leaving the body,

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:58.260 align:middle line:84%
returning with the
secrets of the universe,

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:01.330 align:middle line:84%
and they called it a
living resurrection.

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:03.960 align:middle line:84%
They were described as risen
from the dead, the knights that

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:08.370 align:middle line:84%
were actually pulled from a
figurative grave to be risen,

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:09.840 align:middle line:90%
to be enlightened again.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh,
that's interesting.

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.630 align:middle line:84%
So the knights are
literally the continuation

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:17.760 align:middle line:84%
of the Essenes, who
were the continuation

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.260 align:middle line:84%
of the followers of horrors
in Egypt, and so forth.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.785 align:middle line:84%
It turns out they are
the same gods that

00:20:22.785 --> 00:20:23.910 align:middle line:90%
were here during the flood.

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:26.080 align:middle line:84%
It's the same school,
the same manual,

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.930 align:middle line:84%
they just called themselves
by something different.

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:31.500 align:middle line:84%
So the Templars
were bringing back

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.170 align:middle line:84%
this concept of a
spirituality that's

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:36.060 align:middle line:90%
born within every person--

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:39.820 align:middle line:84%
that no priest or bishop
can tell you and direct it.

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:43.170 align:middle line:84%
You have to find
out that god within.

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:45.840 align:middle line:84%
That's very empowering
in the 12th century.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.917 align:middle line:84%
No wonder they were
revered as gods.

00:20:47.917 --> 00:20:50.250 align:middle line:10%
And, of course, they brought
on the wrath of the church.

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:53.220 align:middle line:10%
They got taken out.

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:55.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's funny how these
stories are all interlinked.

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:57.860 align:middle line:10%
And it comes back
to the empowerment

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:00.710 align:middle line:10%
of the individual--
learning the mysteries that

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:04.430 align:middle line:10%
help you to empower yourself,
to recognize that you are a god.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:06.410 align:middle line:84%
I can't find anything
in the world that

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:09.110 align:middle line:84%
makes you feel much more special
and much more potent than that.

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:11.900 align:middle line:90%


00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:13.895 align:middle line:84%

a little bit ago.

00:21:13.895 --> 00:21:14.695 align:middle line:90%
>> Saqqara.

00:21:14.695 --> 00:21:16.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Talk about the
dynamics going on there.

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:17.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:19.460 align:middle line:10%
Saqqara was a city of knowledge.

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:21.830 align:middle line:10%
A lot of the pyramids,
the ancillary pyramids,

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:24.890 align:middle line:10%
were actually used
as ritual chambers.

00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:26.360 align:middle line:10%
The entrance into it--

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.190 align:middle line:10%
there is a particular
saying, and it's

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:30.380 align:middle line:10%
a very curious saying--
it says, seven gates

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:33.230 align:middle line:10%
allow you entrance
from Earth into heaven.

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:35.720 align:middle line:10%
And after doing a little bit
of energy work at the entrance

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.880 align:middle line:10%
of Saqqara I found
that there are exactly

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.980 align:middle line:10%
seven nodes of energy
along the passageway--

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:40.511 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, interesting.

00:21:40.511 --> 00:21:41.311 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:21:41.311 --> 00:21:43.730 align:middle line:10%
>> --which are positively
charged as a magnetic point

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:46.520 align:middle line:10%
that do act as a kind of
gate before you walk in.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:49.130 align:middle line:10%
So it's a preparatory
hallway where each time you

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:51.200 align:middle line:10%
get hit by this energy
you have a chance

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.390 align:middle line:10%
to figure out your
thoughts and your emotions.

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:55.850 align:middle line:10%
If they're negative, throw
them in the garbage bin

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:57.920 align:middle line:10%
because all that stuff
is now electromagnetic,

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:58.970 align:middle line:10%
as we now know.

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:02.270 align:middle line:10%
You take those impurities into
the pure temple of the gods,

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:04.745 align:middle line:10%
you're going to basically
create a downfall of the temple.

00:22:04.745 --> 00:22:06.620 align:middle line:10%
Because the temple is
supposed to be a mirror

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:09.290 align:middle line:10%
image of everything that is
perfect in the universe--

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:11.870 align:middle line:10%
the actual physical body
of a creative being.

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:13.670 align:middle line:10%
So if you take your
negativity in there,

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:16.250 align:middle line:10%
you're going to create a
downfall of the temple.

How are they built to get
you to have an experience?

And you can have an
experience in any temple.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.070 align:middle line:84%
Even just a small
group of rocks is

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:30.200 align:middle line:84%
enough to have an out
of body experience,

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.300 align:middle line:84%
or just to sit there,
meditate, and you

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:34.670 align:middle line:84%
can learn so much about what
you're doing in your life.

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:36.437 align:middle line:90%
It's that simple.

00:22:36.437 --> 00:22:38.270 align:middle line:84%
I've learned how to
dissect how temples work

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:39.978 align:middle line:84%
and I can teach it to
people in one day--

00:22:39.978 --> 00:22:41.450 align:middle line:90%
how to build their own portal.

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:44.060 align:middle line:84%
Even in the living room
you can build a portal.

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.810 align:middle line:10%
These mysteries are all there
that I'm bringing out, trying

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:50.060 align:middle line:10%
to expose what's been
covered up by religion,

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.820 align:middle line:10%
and showing that all this
is serving to empower you

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:54.590 align:middle line:10%
as an individual.

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:56.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm taking a very
complex thing called

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:59.300 align:middle line:84%
the mechanics of the
universe and teaching you

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.820 align:middle line:84%
in a very simplified form--
in a way that hopefully even

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:04.070 align:middle line:84%
my grandmother can
understand-- how can I

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:05.730 align:middle line:90%
apply this in my daily life?

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to be working
from the feedback that I get.

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of funny that
it overlaps at a time when

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:13.210 align:middle line:90%
we are losing our godliness.

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:16.690 align:middle line:84%

turmoil around the world.

00:23:19.013 --> 00:23:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's getting
really worse right now,

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.290 align:middle line:84%
but it also shows
you that everything

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:24.040 align:middle line:84%
is beginning to fall
apart because there's

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.970 align:middle line:84%
a new paradigm about
to be established.

And the fact that I am
regurgitating things

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:32.280 align:middle line:84%

10,000 years ago is

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.710 align:middle line:84%
inconsequential

the Temple of Edfu

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.135 align:middle line:90%
what it's therefore.

00:26:15.135 --> 00:26:17.760 align:middle line:84%
It gets you to remember who you
are and what you're doing here.

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:20.550 align:middle line:90%

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:24.380 align:middle line:10%
And if you can influence
those 10 people,

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:26.140 align:middle line:10%
they will influence
10 people, and then

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:30.010 align:middle line:10%
they'll influence 10 more, and
that's how you alter the world.

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:32.920 align:middle line:10%
You alter the consciousness
of the world in that way.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.240 align:middle line:10%
You can't change everybody.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody is
meant to be changed.

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And at least you've
influence one person,

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:41.700 align:middle line:84%
and slowly the garden gets
bigger, and bigger, and bigger.

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.740 align:middle line:10%
And I think we've reached
that moment in our lifetime,

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:46.840 align:middle line:10%
and we're all here born
at this moment in time

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:49.083 align:middle line:10%
where every indigenous
conscious says,

00:26:49.083 --> 00:26:51.250 align:middle line:10%
this is the moment where
we're shifting from one age

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:51.760 align:middle line:10%
to the next.

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:54.250 align:middle line:10%
We're already in the middle
of the closing of the age,

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:55.540 align:middle line:10%
according to the Maya.

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:59.000 align:middle line:84%
So we've seen this complete
collapse of systems

00:26:59.000 --> 00:26:59.800 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.990 align:middle line:84%
We're all seeing extreme
systems of government

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:04.000 align:middle line:84%
around the world
and crazy people

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.650 align:middle line:84%
taking over governments
around the world.

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:09.410 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing the last order
hold on for their life.

00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:11.230 align:middle line:84%
So we're seeing many
more teachers suddenly

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:12.272 align:middle line:90%
come out of the woodwork.

00:27:12.272 --> 00:27:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And they began back in
the '60s, by the way.

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:18.838 align:middle line:84%
So I'm kind of like the last
in line of these tutors.

00:27:18.838 --> 00:27:20.380 align:middle line:84%
We're all coming
out of the woodwork,

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:23.890 align:middle line:84%
slowly releasing the information
like a time capsule at the time

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:26.830 align:middle line:84%
when it's needed, at the point
where it's needed to help

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:28.540 align:middle line:90%
people bring about this change.

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:30.210 align:middle line:84%
Because it has to
come from a majority.

00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:32.380 align:middle line:90%
It has to hit a critical mass.

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And we're so close to
hitting that critical mass.

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:39.000 align:middle line:10%
I have come to trust the
people who work around me

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.860 align:middle line:10%
in the invisible world
because they show me

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:41.952 align:middle line:10%
that I can trust them.

00:27:41.952 --> 00:27:43.410 align:middle line:10%
So the more you
trust, the more you

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:45.930 align:middle line:10%
accept that there's something
else working behind you that's

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:47.430 align:middle line:10%
getting you to move
in the direction

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:50.610 align:middle line:10%
that you chose
before you came here.

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And in the words of
the invisible gods,

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:57.180 align:middle line:84%
we envy anybody who has the guts
to incarnate in the material

00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:00.450 align:middle line:84%
world of Earth because we
know how difficult it is,

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:03.690 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we sit in the
sidelines giving you help.

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:04.950 align:middle line:90%
We can't intervene.

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:07.050 align:middle line:84%
You have to ask us to
intervene, and then we'll

00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:08.845 align:middle line:84%
give you the
goalposts and you have

00:28:08.845 --> 00:28:10.470 align:middle line:84%
to kick the ball
through the goalposts.

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:13.030 align:middle line:84%
It's up to you in the end,
otherwise it's too easy.

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:16.411 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:16.411 --> 00:28:22.210 align:middle line:90%


00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:24.710 align:middle line:10%
So I'm hoping that I'm
actually contributing something

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:27.680 align:middle line:10%
positive to this
understanding of the reason

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:31.530 align:middle line:10%
why our predecessors went to the
trouble of taking a 1,600 ton

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:33.560 align:middle line:10%
rock and creating a
temple out of it, which

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:34.933 align:middle line:10%
seems a bit over the top.

00:28:34.933 --> 00:28:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Because the reason
why they did it

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:39.610 align:middle line:84%
was to make sure that these
places survived until our time.

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:42.200 align:middle line:84%
It's the only thing that makes
any sense of why they used

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.630 align:middle line:84%
ridiculous rocks is
because they would survive

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:47.730 align:middle line:84%
until now because they could
foresee the problems that we'd

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:48.530 align:middle line:90%
had.

00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:52.100 align:middle line:84%
So I guess I belong
to that part--

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.770 align:middle line:90%
from that memory of people.

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:58.323 align:middle line:84%
It's my sort of duty to
put this in front of people

00:28:58.323 --> 00:29:00.740 align:middle line:84%
and then hope that they are
going to be the change that we

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:02.270 align:middle line:90%
wish to see.

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:04.820 align:middle line:84%
Because in the end of it,
it's going to benefit me

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:06.410 align:middle line:90%
as well when I come back here.

00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:09.590 align:middle line:84%
They would have made
the road much easier.

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:10.940 align:middle line:90%
So it's a bit of a tit for tat.

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:12.607 align:middle line:84%
We're all helping
each other in the end.

00:29:12.607 --> 00:29:14.840 align:middle line:84%
So I'm hoping that's the
legacy that leaves behind

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:17.840 align:middle line:84%
but, you know, I don't
know where it's going.

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm kind of going with the flow.

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think the big joke is--
and some of my friends pointed

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:23.050 align:middle line:90%
this out--

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:25.910 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of funny that you
wanted to be a rock star

00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:28.070 align:middle line:84%
and you never quite
made it with a guitar,

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:30.380 align:middle line:84%
but you ended up being
a rock star talking

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:31.973 align:middle line:90%
about large, upright rocks.

00:29:31.973 --> 00:29:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, yeah,
it's kind of sad, really,

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:35.630 align:middle line:84%
but-- doesn't have
the same paycheck.

00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:37.880 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not sure who
won in the end--

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:38.680 align:middle line:90%
me or the gods.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.380 align:middle line:90%
