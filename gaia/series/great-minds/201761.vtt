So when I was learning
stuff in school,

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.840 align:middle line:84%
I would immediately
think, that's not right.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.610 align:middle line:84%
There's no way that's
the correct story.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.320 align:middle line:90%
That can't be correct.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.640 align:middle line:84%
I always just felt like
there was stuff left out

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.213 align:middle line:84%
or there was an
agenda behind it.

00:01:14.213 --> 00:01:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And then I would come home,
and my dad, for example,

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.060 align:middle line:90%
was really into the Civil War.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.220 align:middle line:10%
And he actually
had a book that was

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.680 align:middle line:10%
written by Ulysses S.
Grant in our house,

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.817 align:middle line:10%
like from 1860 or something.

00:01:24.817 --> 00:01:27.150 align:middle line:10%
So we'd learned one thing
about the Civil War in school,

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.610 align:middle line:10%
and I'd come home, and it was
a completely different story

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.350 align:middle line:10%
of what was in the
books that my dad had.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.410 align:middle line:84%
So my dad is a New
Yorker, and my mom

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.230 align:middle line:90%
came from Tehran in the 1950s.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And my mom's side of
the family is Baha'i--

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.220 align:middle line:90%
they're Baha'i faith.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.874 align:middle line:90%
So we were in with the Shah.

00:01:44.874 --> 00:01:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And when the Shah was
overthrown out of Iran,

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.015 align:middle line:84%
we were basically-- we
had to flee the country.

00:01:53.015 --> 00:01:55.390 align:middle line:84%

time in Iran and half the time

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.230 align:middle line:90%
in New York, New Jersey.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.870 align:middle line:90%
And my first language was Farsi.

Most people don't
know that about me.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.720 align:middle line:84%
The timing of it all
was in the 1970s.

Both my parents are
medical doctors,

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.560 align:middle line:84%
and I grew up in
a doctor's office.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And we were the
only doctor's office

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.460 align:middle line:90%

normally a family doctor

But another thing that I
was doing at that same time

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.188 align:middle line:84%
and growing up in
that neighborhood

00:02:45.188 --> 00:02:47.210 align:middle line:90%
there on the Jersey Shore was--

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.730 align:middle line:84%
I used to renegade
plant pine trees

in the neighborhood
in people's yards.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And they never even knew
it, and I never even

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.638 align:middle line:84%
actually told anybody else
about it until many years later.

00:02:55.638 --> 00:02:57.290 align:middle line:90%
I just realized, that's--

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.245 align:middle line:90%
I did that.

00:02:58.245 --> 00:02:59.870 align:middle line:84%

earliest memories.

My parents got
divorced when I was 10,

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.170 align:middle line:84%
so we moved from the Jersey
Shore to San Diego, California.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I started growing
avocados at my uncle's ranch,

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.230 align:middle line:84%
and I never really
saw much of my dad

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.400 align:middle line:90%
after that for many years.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And so from the time
I was 10 years old on,

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.364 align:middle line:90%
was kind of a street kid.

up with, we were like--

even as 14-year-olds, we were
like, you don't eat candy.

That's poison.

that that was going
to be our gig in life.

And so we thought, we have
to have superhero names, kind

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.992 align:middle line:90%
of like Kiss.

00:03:50.992 --> 00:03:52.450 align:middle line:84%
Each one of the
members of Kiss had

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.033 align:middle line:84%
their individual
personality, and they

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:56.033 align:middle line:84%
were like their own
superhero, and everybody had

00:03:56.033 --> 00:03:57.790 align:middle line:90%
their favorite members of Kiss.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:58.960 align:middle line:84%

a really good idea.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.320 align:middle line:84%
Let's go with that
in the health field.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.237 align:middle line:90%
So that's what we did.

00:04:01.237 --> 00:04:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And my best friend became
Captain Wheatgrass,

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.618 align:middle line:84%
my cousin became Raw Courage

00:04:07.618 --> 00:04:09.160 align:middle line:84%
one day, my cousin
showed up and he's

like, I got something here.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.148 align:middle line:84%
And it was the
name Fats Avocado.

00:04:14.148 --> 00:04:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And so after a while,
the Fats dropped off,

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.060 align:middle line:90%
but it just became Avocados.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.339 align:middle line:84%

that for 25 years.

street, just say, hey, Avocado.

really as a hobby.

18, 19, I realized

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.828 align:middle line:90%
I had dairy product allergies.

00:04:36.828 --> 00:04:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, I
got off that stuff,

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.990 align:middle line:84%
and that's when
I really woke up.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, whoa, I
really feel different.

those dairy products overnight.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.280 align:middle line:90%
And then I started going deeper.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.405 align:middle line:84%
I've been a vegetarian
pretty much ever since then.

00:04:55.405 --> 00:04:57.090 align:middle line:84%

That's a long time.

And it's not something that I
think is right for everybody.

right for me, and it's

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:46.800 align:middle line:84%
And all I have to do to get
back there, by the way, is fast.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.540 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I'm on a
seven-day water fast,

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.130 align:middle line:84%
12-day water fast,
I'm right back

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:51.870 align:middle line:84%
to where I was when I was
23, and I'm right back

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.120 align:middle line:84%
to that state of health,
right back to those feelings,

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.680 align:middle line:90%
right back to that creativity.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.220 align:middle line:84%
>> We've got all our superfoods
and super herbs over here.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.710 align:middle line:10%
>> And then eventually putting
these foods and super foods

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.410 align:middle line:10%
onto the internet, which I was
the first person to put coconut

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:08.250 align:middle line:10%
oil on the internet, first
person to put cacao beans

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.980 align:middle line:10%
on the internet-- we had the
first raw food and superfoods

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:18.160 align:middle line:10%
website in the world in 1994.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.800 align:middle line:84%
My mom sent me to a summer
camp called Super Camp,

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.320 align:middle line:84%
and one of our teachers
was Tony Robbins.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.715 align:middle line:90%
I met Tony Robbins in 1984.

00:07:24.715 --> 00:07:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And during that camp, we learned
about goal setting and writing

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.580 align:middle line:84%
things down and the
importance of setting on paper

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.600 align:middle line:90%
what you want in your life.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And so I started to
realize that-- yeah,

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.430 align:middle line:90%
I can create what I want.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.440 align:middle line:84%
This world is
malleable, and I can

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.950 align:middle line:84%
bend the will of the universe
towards manifesting things

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.530 align:middle line:90%
in life by writing them down.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.280 align:middle line:84%
Every time I think I
want to write a goal,

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.113 align:middle line:84%
and then write it out,
and then I eventually

00:07:48.113 --> 00:07:50.480 align:middle line:84%
transfer those into
master files my computer.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And then I have goals
that I've achieved,

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.300 align:middle line:84%
and those go into the
victory file of goals

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.300 align:middle line:90%
that have been achieved.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.383 align:middle line:84%
And then there's goals
that I don't want any more,

00:07:58.383 --> 00:07:59.780 align:middle line:90%
so I disenfranchise those.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.530 align:middle line:84%
So those are called
disenfranchised goals,

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:03.560 align:middle line:90%
and those go into another file.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.810 align:middle line:84%
Every year, out of 100
goals that I write down,

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:10.460 align:middle line:84%
I achieve somewhere between 30
and 36 of them-- roughly 33%.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.675 align:middle line:84%
That's really something
prof-- that's deep.

00:08:12.675 --> 00:08:13.700 align:middle line:90%
It's profound.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.220 align:middle line:10%
It's like, whoa, you're
able to manifest things out

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.930 align:middle line:10%
of the world.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:19.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Greetings, NutriBlasters.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.790 align:middle line:10%
I'm David Wolfe, and we're
here to talk about oxidation.

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:26.300 align:middle line:10%
>> I filled an entire journal of
what I wanted to do with going

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:27.530 align:middle line:10%
on TV with a blender--

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:28.670 align:middle line:10%
an entire journal.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:30.560 align:middle line:84%
The whole infomercial,
every-- all

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.380 align:middle line:84%
written out,
20-something years ago.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And then these guys
kept calling me.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.320 align:middle line:84%
They were like, we want to
do some with TV with you.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.789 align:middle line:90%
And I kept going, I don't do TV.

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:39.030 align:middle line:90%
No way.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:41.059 align:middle line:10%
But I took that call
eventually, and they just

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:43.429 align:middle line:10%
laid out this whole blender
we're going to develop,

00:08:43.429 --> 00:08:45.110 align:middle line:10%
how we're going
to bring it on TV.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:46.850 align:middle line:84%
Like literally, the
first seven points

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:49.550 align:middle line:84%
match directly what I had
written in that journal years

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:50.490 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:51.860 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, this is it.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.463 align:middle line:10%
>> I take off the
extractor blades.

00:08:54.463 --> 00:08:55.380 align:middle line:10%
Looks like we've got--

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.980 align:middle line:10%
>> We developed the NutriBullet
and the NutriBullet Rx

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.580 align:middle line:10%
and the 600, the 900, the
1,200, the NutriBullet Rx,

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.650 align:middle line:10%
all the derivative properties--

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:04.820 align:middle line:10%
it's the best thing ever.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:05.480 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.938 align:middle line:84%
The NutriBullet to
me is like-- you

00:09:06.938 --> 00:09:08.720 align:middle line:90%
talk about dreams coming true.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.495 align:middle line:10%
>> We're going to put
in some cucumbers.

00:09:10.495 --> 00:09:11.620 align:middle line:10%
>> We fulfilled that dream.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:14.270 align:middle line:10%
I went on TV and sold
blenders for years and years

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:15.410 align:middle line:10%
on live television.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:17.630 align:middle line:84%
It was the best, most
fun thing of all time.

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And so I live with
that fulfillment.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:22.440 align:middle line:90%
It's awesome.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.920 align:middle line:84%
Mexicans know how to grow
avocados really well.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And we grew up on the border, so
Mexican people are close to me.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.290 align:middle line:90%
And so they taught me as a kid.

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And we were grafting
avocados in 1978, '79, 1980.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:38.100 align:middle line:84%
I was grafting citrus fruits
even back then as an 8-, 9-,

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.120 align:middle line:90%
10-year-old.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And it just began there--
my love of farming.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.760 align:middle line:84%
>> These are our
first cacao fruits,

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.600 align:middle line:84%
and this moment is our first
harvest ever here in NoniLand.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And now I farm in both
Hawaii and in Ontario, Canada.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.730 align:middle line:84%
It's such an incredibly
important part of my life.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.730 align:middle line:90%
>> And that is an avocado tree--

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.320 align:middle line:90%
just got pollinated.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Today, I grow about
40 different varieties

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:04.620 align:middle line:90%
of avocados.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.250 align:middle line:90%
I don't do the grafting anymore.

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:08.580 align:middle line:84%
I grow more seedlings,
so that means

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.243 align:middle line:90%
that I'm breeding true to seed.

00:10:10.243 --> 00:10:12.660 align:middle line:84%
So I can have an avocado that
I really like, and then I'll

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:13.200 align:middle line:90%
breed it.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.617 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll get maybe three
of those that I really like,

00:10:15.617 --> 00:10:16.830 align:middle line:90%
and then I'll breed those.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:19.125 align:middle line:84%
So I'm basically selecting
the types of avocados

00:10:19.125 --> 00:10:20.250 align:middle line:90%
that I really want to grow.

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:23.400 align:middle line:10%
>> Avocados-- check this out.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.590 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm looking for
characteristics like richness

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:28.943 align:middle line:10%
of flavor,
butteriness, oiliness.

00:10:28.943 --> 00:10:30.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking for
something that has

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.560 align:middle line:84%
a very small seed and a very
large amount of avocado fat,

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.320 align:middle line:84%
or we call it the
seed to meat ratio.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.930 align:middle line:84%
Really can nourish us, and are
easy to get to, and just all

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:42.760 align:middle line:84%
these different factors that
are lost as soon as you go,

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.187 align:middle line:84%
let's just graft
that Haas avocado

00:10:44.187 --> 00:10:46.020 align:middle line:84%
and put it in the front
yard in Los Angeles.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:50.620 align:middle line:90%


00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.390 align:middle line:84%
All my life, I have
felt that one day,

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:56.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get to
the correct philosophy.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.270 align:middle line:84%
It's always been
there my whole life.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.310 align:middle line:10%
Just like planting
trees, there's

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:04.570 align:middle line:10%
always been this drive to get
to the correct philosophy.

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:06.005 align:middle line:10%
And I investigate everything.

00:11:06.005 --> 00:11:06.880 align:middle line:90%
I look at everything.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.005 align:middle line:84%
I read every book--
philosophy, Kant, Schopenhauer.

00:11:09.005 --> 00:11:12.220 align:middle line:84%
I go through Nietzsche,
Einstein, Newton, Hippocrates--

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.070 align:middle line:90%
you name it.

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, I ran into a
friend of mine, Alan Steinfeld,

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.560 align:middle line:84%
who is a UFO investigator and
a paranormal investigator.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me-- he's
like, have you ever read

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.542 align:middle line:90%
the books of Charles Fort?

00:11:24.542 --> 00:11:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
never heard of him.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.240 align:middle line:10%
And he's like, get "The
Book of the Damned."

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And when I got to Charles
Fort, everything made sense.

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:34.850 align:middle line:90%
It all made sense.

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:37.040 align:middle line:90%
There it all was.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.560 align:middle line:84%
What he lays down is that
for every law that you posit,

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.260 align:middle line:84%
there will be an
anti-law presented.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.230 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing in this world
that's just all 100% rational,

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:46.897 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing
in this world that's

00:11:46.897 --> 00:11:48.050 align:middle line:90%
all 100% irrational.

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:50.840 align:middle line:90%
It's a mixture of the two.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.180 align:middle line:84%
The more you try to
go hyper rational,

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.940 align:middle line:84%
the more the irrational
will present itself

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.770 align:middle line:90%
in order to sort you out.

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And so when we put
our attention away

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:04.490 align:middle line:84%
from the mundane,
rational, logical,

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:07.470 align:middle line:84%
everything's in
certainty over here,

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:11.360 align:middle line:84%
and we start going to
uncertainty and the irrational

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.100 align:middle line:84%
and the synchronistic
and the X factor,

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:17.915 align:middle line:84%
we start to see and feel
the visceral magic that

00:12:17.915 --> 00:12:20.165 align:middle line:84%
is part of our reality, so
we actually become happier.

00:12:20.165 --> 00:12:23.503 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.503 --> 00:12:25.420 align:middle line:84%
I know of many great
farmers in the world that

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.700 align:middle line:84%
are super Aramanic
in their thinking,

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.710 align:middle line:84%
in the sense they're
very materialistic.

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:31.360 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK, we got to
get the right genetics.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.068 align:middle line:84%
We've got to make sure
we breed properly,

00:12:33.068 --> 00:12:34.990 align:middle line:84%
then we're going to
graft this onto that.

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And even there
are organic farms,

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:38.220 align:middle line:84%
but they still have
that in their mindset.

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.410 align:middle line:84%
Where I'm at is, what I grows
the best ever of all time.

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:42.375 align:middle line:90%
It's my assumption.

00:12:42.375 --> 00:12:43.750 align:middle line:84%
That tree is
getting all the love

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:45.383 align:middle line:84%
it needs just by my
thoughts about it

00:12:45.383 --> 00:12:47.050 align:middle line:84%
and the way I feel
about it and the love

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:48.250 align:middle line:90%
that we're putting out there.

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And whatever its
genetics are, they

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:51.523 align:middle line:84%
will be perfected on
this farm, because it's

00:12:51.523 --> 00:12:53.710 align:middle line:84%
finally come to fruition,
because this is the best

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:55.150 align:middle line:90%
farm ever.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:58.120 align:middle line:84%
Those assumptions
of magic and love

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:02.800 align:middle line:84%
being able to influence genetic
expression very strongly

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.440 align:middle line:90%
influence genetic expression.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:09.260 align:middle line:10%
>> We're going to see
our score from yesterday.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:10.922 align:middle line:10%
OK, look at this.

00:13:10.922 --> 00:13:12.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Some more avocados here.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.720 align:middle line:10%
>> A massive abundance.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.758 align:middle line:10%
>> Now you see how that is a
totally different mindset than

00:13:16.758 --> 00:13:19.050 align:middle line:10%
we've got a hyper-rationally
figure out how we're going

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:20.860 align:middle line:10%
to get these genetics, and
we've got to import these,

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.050 align:middle line:10%
and we've got to
make sure we do this,

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:24.250 align:middle line:10%
and we've got to graft at
exactly this time and--

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:28.450 align:middle line:10%
that stuff is an absolute
Aramanic nightmare.

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:29.890 align:middle line:90%
It's a materialistic nightmare.

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have
anything to do with that,

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.615 align:middle line:84%
because my philosophy
has finally

00:13:32.615 --> 00:13:34.450 align:middle line:90%
led me to forget all that.

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:35.260 align:middle line:90%
It's just auto--

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:39.220 align:middle line:84%
I'll just assume it,
stand in synchronicity,

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:41.140 align:middle line:84%
live inside the magic,
and it will come.

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:46.080 align:middle line:90%


00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.780 align:middle line:84%
My role has always been
to get the information out

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.540 align:middle line:90%
to get people to be healthier.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.250 align:middle line:90%
Nutrition is a big part of that.

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:57.270 align:middle line:84%
But as I found out, it's the
mindset of certainty, logic,

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:58.590 align:middle line:90%
rationality--

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:01.000 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be able to
crack every secret this way.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.540 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, I realized
that that's killing people.

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.670 align:middle line:90%
That's a terrible way of life.

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:07.560 align:middle line:90%
It destroys all magic, actually.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.170 align:middle line:84%
It gets you into
anti-synchronicity, where

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:11.760 align:middle line:90%
you're not in the holy flow.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And so over the years,
I started realizing,

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:17.565 align:middle line:84%
I need to get people more
of a message of hope.

00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:18.690 align:middle line:90%
>> This is my medicine bag.

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And people asked me
about this all the time.

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:23.010 align:middle line:84%
>> More of a message
of synchronicity,

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:26.900 align:middle line:84%
more of a message of love, more
of a message of relating it

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.952 align:middle line:84%
differently, more of a
spiritual emotional message--

00:14:29.952 --> 00:14:31.410 align:middle line:84%
and I could do that
with food, too.

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:34.050 align:middle line:10%
And that eventually
started to change how I

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:36.743 align:middle line:10%
was dealing with social media.

00:14:36.743 --> 00:14:38.160 align:middle line:10%
I did all the
social media myself.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.110 align:middle line:10%
I do Instagram myself,
I do Facebook myself,

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:42.420 align:middle line:10%
I do Twitter myself,
I do Telegram myself,

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.590 align:middle line:10%
which I really prefer.

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:45.360 align:middle line:84%
Telegram Messenger
is the best ever.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And I eventually got into that
broader spectrum of health.

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:52.940 align:middle line:84%
So we deal with spirit,
emotion, mental, attitude,

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.200 align:middle line:84%
and the physical--
food and all that.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.080 align:middle line:90%
And it exploded.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.370 align:middle line:90%
And it was like, boom.

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:00.700 align:middle line:90%
Put more fuel on that one.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:01.500 align:middle line:90%
Let's keep going.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:02.875 align:middle line:84%
And it just kept going, going,
going, going, going, going,

00:15:02.875 --> 00:15:04.040 align:middle line:90%
going, going.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.660 align:middle line:90%
But just stop for a second.

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:09.510 align:middle line:90%
This is a side hobby for me.

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:10.740 align:middle line:90%
This isn't my job.

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:13.080 align:middle line:10%
People are like, oh, well
how could raw foods help me,

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.413 align:middle line:10%
or how could superfoods help me?

00:15:14.413 --> 00:15:16.440 align:middle line:90%
It's like, you have more energy.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I literally was leading
Facebook in hits and reach

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:24.240 align:middle line:84%
and everything almost every
number for two years every day

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.490 align:middle line:90%
as a side thing.

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:29.460 align:middle line:84%
If people can't get
the message from that,

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:31.395 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing more
I can do for them.

00:15:31.395 --> 00:15:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, Facebook
or whoever--

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:34.240 align:middle line:84%
whoever is running
this stuff-- it's

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.370 align:middle line:84%
a publicly traded
company-- they were just

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:36.900 align:middle line:84%
like, we've got
to stop this guy.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.500 align:middle line:90%
We cannot have this.

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.000 align:middle line:84%
But that's what raw
foods gives you.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.083 align:middle line:90%
It brightens up your life.

00:15:41.083 --> 00:15:43.440 align:middle line:84%
It's a high
vibrational substance.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And we could get into the
presence of whatever vitamin is

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:48.860 align:middle line:84%
present there and all the
co-factors-- vitamin C, rutin,

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.520 align:middle line:90%
bioflavonoids--

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:52.380 align:middle line:84%
I could go through
that ad infinitum.

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:54.498 align:middle line:84%
But people want the
scientism, because we

00:15:54.498 --> 00:15:56.040 align:middle line:84%
think science is
the best thing ever,

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.665 align:middle line:84%
and it's the only
way to know anything.

00:15:57.665 --> 00:15:58.950 align:middle line:90%
And all it is is a viewpoint.

00:15:58.950 --> 00:15:59.700 align:middle line:90%
It's a good few point.

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.575 align:middle line:84%
It's an important one,
and I agree with that.

00:16:01.575 --> 00:16:03.600 align:middle line:84%
But there's other viewpoints,
like your instinct

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.180 align:middle line:84%
and your intuition, like what
synchronicity is guiding you

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:07.980 align:middle line:90%
to--

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:11.280 align:middle line:84%
your common sense and
your super sensibility.

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.530 align:middle line:90%
These are other viewpoints.

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And I never really realized
how intense the scientism

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.770 align:middle line:90%
was until I got really big.

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:24.270 align:middle line:84%
People really believe that
science is the only way

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:26.650 align:middle line:90%
to know anything.

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:28.510 align:middle line:90%
But science is changing.

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:30.270 align:middle line:90%
It's never the same.

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:31.800 align:middle line:10%
And so whenever
you hear something

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.500 align:middle line:10%
like, oh, this
science is settled,

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:38.070 align:middle line:10%
immediately, I go, oh, it's
definitely not settled.

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:40.260 align:middle line:84%
Whenever somebody says,
oh, we know this for sure,

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.120 align:middle line:84%
I know for sure we don't
know that for sure.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:46.450 align:middle line:90%


00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:51.000 align:middle line:84%
The human being is
a noble organism,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.850 align:middle line:84%
and we need things from
the different kingdoms

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:55.470 align:middle line:90%
of life on Earth.

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And in order to really
know what your body needs,

00:16:58.290 --> 00:16:59.970 align:middle line:84%
you need to have a
diversity of things.

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:04.349 align:middle line:84%
Like the average gorilla eats
120 to 140 different plants

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:06.000 align:middle line:90%
in a year--

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.200 align:middle line:90%
in a year.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.339 align:middle line:84%
So I started looking
at that and going,

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:10.339 align:middle line:84%
how many different plants
am I eating in a year?

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:12.714 align:middle line:84%
I'd better start diversifying
up here a little bit.

00:17:12.714 --> 00:17:14.589 align:middle line:84%
And then you never know--
you have an injury.

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:16.770 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, your
body goes, we need this.

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:17.950 align:middle line:90%
We need this.

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:19.589 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're like, I haven't
had that in like eight years.

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:21.297 align:middle line:84%
But that's what its
called for right now.

00:17:21.297 --> 00:17:22.859 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
it's very important

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:27.010 align:middle line:84%
to use what I like to say is
the trial and success method--

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:28.815 align:middle line:90%
the trial and success method.

00:17:28.815 --> 00:17:29.940 align:middle line:90%
You just keep trying stuff.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:31.980 align:middle line:84%
Just be like, oh, OK,
this is what spirulina is.

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.130 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is what hemp
seed is all about.

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:35.350 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's a goji berry.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:36.447 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's a black berry.

00:17:36.447 --> 00:17:37.905 align:middle line:84%
OK, over here--
that's what lettuce

00:17:37.905 --> 00:17:39.570 align:middle line:90%
is-- dancing woman lettuce.

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:41.640 align:middle line:84%
Actually, drunken woman
lettuce is my favorite.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.600 align:middle line:90%
And then-- oh, OK.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.470 align:middle line:84%
This is what sea
buckthorn berries are.

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And you just keep trying
all this different stuff.

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And then that one
day when you get

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.470 align:middle line:84%
pregnant or something
happens, your body goes,

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:50.550 align:middle line:90%
we need flax oil.

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:51.540 align:middle line:90%
We need spirulina.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:52.405 align:middle line:90%
We need an avocado.

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's gotta be with salt
on it, right here, right now.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:55.780 align:middle line:90%
How would you know that?

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.560 align:middle line:84%
You never had an avocado or
spirulina or flax oil or sea

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.690 align:middle line:90%
salt before.

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:04.060 align:middle line:84%
There's really only 350
plants in the world,

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:04.990 align:middle line:90%
just to simplify that.

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:07.450 align:middle line:84%
Now the scientism and the
categorization of everything

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:09.250 align:middle line:84%
and the breakdown into
the binomial system,

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:13.420 align:middle line:84%
Latin binomial system,
and Linnaeus's system is--

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:15.580 align:middle line:90%
that's very deeply scientismic.

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And you lose a lot by
categorizing like that,

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:21.677 align:middle line:84%
because for example, I
know the goji berry family.

00:18:21.677 --> 00:18:24.010 align:middle line:84%
I know the goji of the lyceum
family all over the world.

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:24.820 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it all over the world.

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:26.560 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it growing on the
sacred monuments of Peru.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.390 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it growing in
the deserts of Australia.

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:30.765 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it growing in the
deserts of the United States.

00:18:30.765 --> 00:18:32.320 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it growing in Asia.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.880 align:middle line:90%
So now, I know the personality.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And so once you know
the family and you

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:41.320 align:middle line:84%
know it's personalities, then
you can understand it anywhere.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:44.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we're into the Linnean
categorization binomial system,

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:47.830 align:middle line:84%
you're actually
handicapped by that system,

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:50.597 align:middle line:84%
because you can't
understand reality.

00:18:50.597 --> 00:18:52.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm actually going to
put several squirts of chaga

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:53.730 align:middle line:90%
in here.

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:56.680 align:middle line:10%
There are so many
immunological benefits to chaga

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.323 align:middle line:10%
that I could have
written a book on it.

00:18:58.323 --> 00:18:59.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I did
write a book on it,

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.270 align:middle line:90%
and this is the book right here.

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>> I've written a book.

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.580 align:middle line:10%
It's called "Chaga--

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:05.440 align:middle line:10%
King of the
Medicinal Mushrooms."

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And it got voted, actually, in
the top 40 books ever written

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:10.690 align:middle line:84%
on mushrooms, which I
felt very honored about,

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:12.160 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't really
want to write that book.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.270 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to hand
that off to someone.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:14.710 align:middle line:90%
I was like, you write this book.

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:15.700 align:middle line:90%
How about you do this book?

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I realized,
no one's going to do it.

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And I live in a chaga
environment in Canada,

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:20.680 align:middle line:90%
so they're all around me.

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.120 align:middle line:90%
And I know chaga inside out.

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's every
day, all day long.

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Even today, this morning,
I had five droppers

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.510 align:middle line:84%
full of my tincture
of chaga, my alcohol

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:31.330 align:middle line:90%
tincture, just with chocolate.

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:33.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And we've got
the super mushroom.

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:35.770 align:middle line:90%
This is the Siberian chaga.

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:37.120 align:middle line:90%
But it's not just from Siberia.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.970 align:middle line:84%
It also grows right here in the
Catskill Mountains of New York

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:40.840 align:middle line:90%
wildly.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:44.390 align:middle line:10%
>> Chaga is a herniated mycelium
of a medicinal mushroom.

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:46.360 align:middle line:84%
So most medicinal mushrooms
and most mushrooms

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.645 align:middle line:90%
we see in general--

00:19:47.645 --> 00:19:49.270 align:middle line:84%
what you see that
comes out of the tree

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:53.200 align:middle line:84%
or comes out of the ground
is the reproductive organ

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.490 align:middle line:90%
of the mushroom.

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:57.820 align:middle line:84%
The actual body of the
mushroom is called mycelium.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And you almost never see it
unless you peel a piece of bark

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:03.520 align:middle line:84%
back on a dead tree, and you see
all this white stuff in there.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.190 align:middle line:84%
That's the actual body of
the medicinal mushroom.

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:08.420 align:middle line:90%
That's it right there.

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And with chaga,
though, it's weird.

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:12.400 align:middle line:84%
It's fruiting body is
very difficult to spot,

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.430 align:middle line:84%
so that mycelium
actually herniates out

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:18.070 align:middle line:84%
of the tree and
busts out of the tree

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:21.940 align:middle line:84%
and becomes something you
can actually get at and get.

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:24.325 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's so
unusual and so special.

00:20:24.325 --> 00:20:28.920 align:middle line:90%


00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.990 align:middle line:84%
One of the things is always the
best quality water I can get.

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:34.260 align:middle line:84%
>> So you can still see
there's still snow up there.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:35.635 align:middle line:84%
But this is the
place right here.

00:20:35.635 --> 00:20:36.703 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:20:36.703 --> 00:20:39.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'm a spring water
hunter on five continents for 25

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:39.480 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And there is
something you learn,

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.230 align:middle line:84%
as Victor Schauberger
taught me, at every spring.

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And there's something amazing
about a spring coming up

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.860 align:middle line:90%
at the top of the mountain.

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:47.902 align:middle line:90%
How is it falling upward?

00:20:47.902 --> 00:20:50.152 align:middle line:84%
Why isn't it coming out at
the bottom of the mountain?

00:20:50.152 --> 00:20:51.570 align:middle line:90%
Why is it coming out at the top?

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:54.930 align:middle line:84%
How does the water get to
the top of a Redwood tree?

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:57.540 align:middle line:90%
It's not capillary action.

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.497 align:middle line:84%
So we start to get into
the deeper mysteries

00:20:59.497 --> 00:21:00.580 align:middle line:90%
by investing spring water.

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:02.363 align:middle line:90%
That's the first piece.

00:21:02.363 --> 00:21:03.780 align:middle line:84%
Second piece is,
I'm going to have

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:05.280 align:middle line:84%
some kind of
electrolyte-- sea salt.

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:06.980 align:middle line:84%
I've learned that
over the years.

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:10.077 align:middle line:84%
I had friends who went
many, many long days--

00:21:10.077 --> 00:21:12.660 align:middle line:84%
let's just start with that-- or
weeks without any food at all,

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:13.668 align:middle line:90%
just on salt water.

00:21:13.668 --> 00:21:15.710 align:middle line:84%
It's in the right ratio
for you as an individual.

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:16.530 align:middle line:90%
Some people can handle more.

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:17.947 align:middle line:84%
I can handle a lot
of salt. And it

00:21:17.947 --> 00:21:20.370 align:middle line:84%
neutralizes all autoimmune
conditions in my body.

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:22.245 align:middle line:84%
And then I don't need
to drink as much water,

00:21:22.245 --> 00:21:23.340 align:middle line:90%
because I'm hydrated.

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:24.240 align:middle line:90%
That's number two.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.680 align:middle line:90%
Number three is charcoal.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.750 align:middle line:84%
Activated charcoal and
the charcoal revolution

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:31.050 align:middle line:84%
and the fullerene revolution
and what that means to me today

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:32.740 align:middle line:90%
is just absolutely incredible.

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:35.760 align:middle line:84%
So I do about 2,000,
2,500 milligrams

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.030 align:middle line:90%
of charcoal every day.

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:38.280 align:middle line:90%
>> And what else you got here?

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.613 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so what we've got in
here-- now I've got-- boom--

00:21:40.613 --> 00:21:41.490 align:middle line:90%
digestive enzymes.

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:42.323 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, in case you--

00:21:42.323 --> 00:21:43.917 align:middle line:90%
>> Very key thing to have.

00:21:43.917 --> 00:21:46.500 align:middle line:84%
>> And then another piece that
I'm really into on the daily is

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:47.460 align:middle line:90%
enzymes.

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And depending on the
situation I'm in,

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:53.100 align:middle line:84%
I will sometimes get it really
into really good quality

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:57.180 align:middle line:84%
probiotics or ferment
vegetables, like cucumbers

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:59.190 align:middle line:84%
and cabbage that I
have with everything,

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:01.750 align:middle line:90%
that has the bacteria with it.

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:03.720 align:middle line:84%
So those are
non-negotiable for me.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:04.770 align:middle line:90%
They're there.

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:05.908 align:middle line:10%
And then of course--

00:22:05.908 --> 00:22:07.200 align:middle line:10%
>> We're going to fill this up.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.540 align:middle line:10%
>> The medicinal mushroom teas,
which are pretty much every

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.998 align:middle line:10%
day, or some kind of medicinal
mushrooms going into my body

00:22:11.998 --> 00:22:12.900 align:middle line:10%
every single day.

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And then it's delivered
with chocolate.

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:16.440 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a cacao eater.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm a cacao grower.

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And that delivery of
the medicinal mushroom

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:25.320 align:middle line:84%
in tea with hot chocolate
is just the best ever.

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.658 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:22:26.658 --> 00:22:28.200 align:middle line:84%
It's not much else
to eat after that.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.000 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.710 align:middle line:90%


00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:35.350 align:middle line:84%
In 2002, I founded the Fruit
Tree Planting Foundation,

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:37.930 align:middle line:84%
because as an entrepreneur,
I wanted a method

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.180 align:middle line:84%
to give back so that some
of the money that was earned

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:43.090 align:middle line:84%
from selling products
and events and seminars

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:44.758 align:middle line:84%
would work its way
back to the Earth

00:22:44.758 --> 00:22:46.300 align:middle line:84%
and work its way
back to a foundation

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.830 align:middle line:90%
that I could really believe in.

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:51.310 align:middle line:84%
Planting trees is something
I deeply believe in.

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And we want to, through
the Fruit Tree Planting

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.650 align:middle line:84%
Foundation, plant fruit,
nut, and medicinal trees.

00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:58.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just a
tree that looks good,

00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:00.150 align:middle line:84%
but what are we
going to use it for?

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:02.080 align:middle line:90%
It has multiple uses.

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:07.600 align:middle line:10%
In 2019, we planted 80,636
trees in five countries--

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:13.240 align:middle line:10%
places where kids have
found their soul's mission.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.982 align:middle line:10%
Every day, their job is to
take care of that orchard.

00:23:15.982 --> 00:23:17.440 align:middle line:10%
And so they've
found something they

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.990 align:middle line:10%
can sink their heart
and their soul into.

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:23.330 align:middle line:84%
Life is fleeting and
it's short, and we

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:27.090 align:middle line:84%
could be gone in a second,
so we'd better get planting.

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And we put a million trees
in the ground since 2002.

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:34.280 align:middle line:84%
It's by far my favorite thing
I've ever been involved in.

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.840 align:middle line:84%
It's by far the
only thing I've ever

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.970 align:middle line:84%
been involved in
where it was all

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:41.713 align:middle line:90%
100% best ever all the time.

00:23:41.713 --> 00:23:43.130 align:middle line:84%
The Fruit Tree
Planting Foundation

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:49.520 align:middle line:90%
is found it www.ftpf.org.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.830 align:middle line:84%
My legacy is we're getting
trees in the ground.

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:53.330 align:middle line:84%
That's the legacy
I'll leave behind.

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:56.430 align:middle line:90%
Now, who am I as a person?

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:57.950 align:middle line:84%
We're dealing with--
I mean, I don't

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:00.100 align:middle line:84%
think people even understand
who I am as a person.

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:00.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Greetings, everybody.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:01.820 align:middle line:90%
This is David Avocado Wolfe.

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:02.620 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:05.480 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be talking about
5G and how to protect yourself.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Because we have--

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.510 align:middle line:84%
billions of people don't
even believe in magic.

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:09.770 align:middle line:84%
We've got billions of
people who don't even

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:10.970 align:middle line:90%
understand synchronicity.

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:13.428 align:middle line:84%
We have billions of people
don't even realize it's miracles

00:24:13.428 --> 00:24:15.200 align:middle line:84%
non-stop, every
second, all day long.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.720 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not looking
to create a legacy

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.340 align:middle line:90%
amongst the human population.

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.503 align:middle line:84%
That's not-- I don't
think that way.

00:24:21.503 --> 00:24:23.420 align:middle line:84%
>> We've got a lot of
interesting things here.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.430 align:middle line:84%
We have to make
it work together.

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:26.760 align:middle line:90%
>> But there's always a way.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:27.800 align:middle line:90%
The light always finds a way.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:28.940 align:middle line:90%
The love always finds a way.

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:29.982 align:middle line:90%
Everything is just find--

00:24:29.982 --> 00:24:30.860 align:middle line:90%
will find its way.

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:34.820 align:middle line:84%
So humanity will get out of
the toil and troubles of today

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:35.730 align:middle line:90%
without question.

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:36.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Cheers to the--

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:37.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Cheers.

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:38.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Best day ever.

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:39.920 align:middle line:90%
The best drink ever.

Thank you.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.770 align:middle line:90%
>> You're bloody well right.

>> I'm showing
people another way,

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:46.490 align:middle line:84%
which is the path that I'm
looking for, which is that path

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:48.260 align:middle line:84%
of the hyper synchronicity,
the holy flow,

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:51.410 align:middle line:84%
the love and the light
and the magic of living.

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And I know that in future
incarnations, that will be--

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:55.460 align:middle line:84%
that's what I'm-- it's
the best day ever.

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:58.100 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I'm manifesting the
best day ever every single day,

00:24:58.100 --> 00:24:59.000 align:middle line:90%
all day long.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I have faith,
because I know it works.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been growing
avocados for 42 years.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.210 align:middle line:90%
This is where we're at.

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:10.700 align:middle line:90%
Today is the best day ever.

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:12.920 align:middle line:84%
>> When I say today is the
best day ever, it happens.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:13.760 align:middle line:90%
Stuff happens.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.530 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely miraculous.

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:18.470 align:middle line:84%
The bizarre, the unbelievable
will occur right there,

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:20.240 align:middle line:90%
in front of me, all day long.

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.430 align:middle line:84%
So that's been going on
for so many decades for me

00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:26.000 align:middle line:90%
at this point, I have faith.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.450 align:middle line:90%
