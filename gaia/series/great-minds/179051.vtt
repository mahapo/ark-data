>>DAVID HATCHER
CHILDRESS: My name

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.439 align:middle line:10%
is David Hatcher Childress, and
I'm actually an archaeologist.

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:45.230 align:middle line:10%
I travel around the
world in search of lost

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.030 align:middle line:10%
cities and ancient mysteries.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.040 align:middle line:10%
My name is David
Hatcher Childress,

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.820 align:middle line:10%
and my area of research
is ancient civilizations

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.910 align:middle line:10%
and megaliths.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.590 align:middle line:10%
I'm an author on a
wide variety of books,

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.590 align:middle line:10%
of over 20 different books,
on mysteries of the past,

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.210 align:middle line:10%
lost cities, the Olmecs,
megaliths in South America

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.840 align:middle line:10%
and all over the world.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.880 align:middle line:84%
I was born in France, actually,
but my parents are Americans

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.320 align:middle line:90%
and they like to travel.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And when I was
younger we traveled

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.470 align:middle line:84%
all over Europe
and also to Turkey

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.470 align:middle line:90%
and to Mexico and other places.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And I remember climbing
the pyramids of Mexico

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.900 align:middle line:84%
City as a little kid, and
going to Stonehenge, and Carnac

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.380 align:middle line:90%
in France, or places like that.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.230 align:middle line:84%
So I've always been
interested in ancient history

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.430 align:middle line:84%
and lost cities and
mysteries of the past.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.660 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.700 align:middle line:84%
I went to high school
in Missoula, Montana,

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.990 align:middle line:84%
and I was a grocery
bagger at a supermarket.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.014 align:middle line:84%
And I would buy books
from the supermarket.

00:01:54.014 --> 00:01:55.430 align:middle line:10%
Some of the books
that I would buy

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.490 align:middle line:10%
were Erich Von Daniken's
books, "Chariots of the Gods?,"

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.340 align:middle line:10%
and "The Gold of
the Gods," which

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.460 align:middle line:10%
was about these mysterious
tunnels in South America.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.140 align:middle line:10%
And I liked reading those books.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.580 align:middle line:84%
But I think what was interesting
about archaeological mysteries

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.630 align:middle line:84%
was that unlike a
UFO, or some Bigfoot

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.930 align:middle line:84%
sighting, or some
other oddball event,

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.090 align:middle line:84%
with archaeological
mysteries these are things

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.040 align:middle line:84%
that you can visit at any
time of your choosing.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And they're are giant
structures that generally

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.820 align:middle line:90%
aren't going anywhere.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And unlike a UFO event,
again, or a Bigfoot sighting,

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.240 align:middle line:84%
if there is some
mystery associated

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.710 align:middle line:84%
with, say, some giant pyramid
or wall or statues someplace,

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.340 align:middle line:84%
this is something that you can
actually go and investigate

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.840 align:middle line:90%
yourself.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.830 align:middle line:90%
And that intrigued me.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.580 align:middle line:84%
I already liked to
travel and go to places

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.270 align:middle line:84%
and was relatively well-versed
in many of these sites,

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.970 align:middle line:90%
although there are so many.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm still learning about all
kinds of interesting sites

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.170 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.140 align:middle line:84%
I think of myself as a
scientifically-minded person.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't just believe everything
that's strange or weird.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.260 align:middle line:84%
I want to see proof of
claims that people make.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'm the kind of person
who likes to go and see

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.190 align:middle line:90%
things for myself.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.890 align:middle line:90%
And so that's what got me going.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And I began to travel around the
world starting in the mid '70s.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.830 align:middle line:10%
I returned to the
United States, and I

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.410 align:middle line:10%
wanted to write some
books and keep traveling.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.290 align:middle line:84%
But at that point I wrote a book
called "The Hitchhiker's Guide

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.970 align:middle line:90%
to Africa and Arabia."

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.740 align:middle line:84%
This was mid-1980s, and this
was just as Apple computers were

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.140 align:middle line:84%
first coming out and
the first laser printers

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.380 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And it was the beginning
of desktop publishing.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.700 align:middle line:10%
And at that point, I started
my own publishing company,

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.900 align:middle line:10%
Adventures Unlimited Press,
realizing that this was a time

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.106 align:middle line:10%
to be my own publisher.

00:03:57.106 --> 00:03:58.730 align:middle line:10%
And it was a difficult
time, but then I

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.960 align:middle line:10%
began publishing books on
my "Lost Cities" series,

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.590 align:middle line:10%
books on anti-gravity,
books on the Olmecs,

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.210 align:middle line:10%
books on South America,
on ancient technology

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.430 align:middle line:10%
in Peru and Bolivia.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.710 align:middle line:10%
Plus I wrote books on time
travel and Nikola Tesla.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:20.130 align:middle line:90%


00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.070 align:middle line:84%
What really got me going
on my latest book, which

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.250 align:middle line:84%
is called "The Lost
World of the Cham,"

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.100 align:middle line:90%
was I made a trip to Vietnam.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And on that trip I
was visiting Da Nang

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.400 align:middle line:84%
and I visited the Champa
city of My Son, which

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.460 align:middle line:90%
is there in central Vietnam.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And I was very
surprised at the things

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.070 align:middle line:84%
that I encountered there
because what was at My Son

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.250 align:middle line:84%
were things that I hadn't
expected to see, really.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And that was, first of
all, megalithic building

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.190 align:middle line:84%
with granite and basalt,
and also something

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.400 align:middle line:84%
very important to me, which
are these distinctive keystone

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.290 align:middle line:90%
cuts.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And so when I saw the
keystone on cuts at My Son,

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.120 align:middle line:84%
I immediately recognized them
as the same keystone cuts

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.040 align:middle line:84%
on structures I had seen
in Peru and Bolivia.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And I've also noticed these
keystone cuts at other sites,

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:21.700 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.710 align:middle line:84%
But to me this was
very important.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that these
Cham people, and also

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.670 align:middle line:84%
known as the Champa,
were a civilization that

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:39.060 align:middle line:84%
was a megalithic civilization,
was using keystone cuts just

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.280 align:middle line:84%
like in South America and
in Egypt and other areas,

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.070 align:middle line:84%
and that they were these
great seafarers who

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.700 align:middle line:84%
built huge cities
all over Vietnam,

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.450 align:middle line:90%
and I discovered other places.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:06:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And they used a base of islands,
known as the Cham Islands.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.760 align:middle line:10%
The Cham Islands
are a small group

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.260 align:middle line:10%
of islands off of the
coast of central Vietnam.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.980 align:middle line:10%
And although there are not
megalithic structures there,

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.410 align:middle line:10%
those islands were
a place where,

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:16.740 align:middle line:10%
I discovered as I
started my research,

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:22.680 align:middle line:10%
this giant fleet of ships would
congregate several times a year

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.030 align:middle line:10%
at the Cham Islands.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And then these fleets
would then go out

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.000 align:middle line:84%
into the Pacific or
different places.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.070 align:middle line:84%
They would go north
to China, they

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.770 align:middle line:84%
would go south to
Java and Sumatra,

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.530 align:middle line:84%
they would go to India,
and even, apparently,

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.980 align:middle line:84%
across the Indian
Ocean to East Africa.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And I quickly concluded
that the Cham were also

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:51.270 align:middle line:84%
going across the Pacific,
and were probably

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:55.380 align:middle line:84%
somehow involved with the
Olmecs of ancient Mexico.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.740 align:middle line:10%
Also, the mysterious
San Agustin culture

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.430 align:middle line:10%
in Colombia, also
cultures in Peru

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:08.310 align:middle line:10%
like the structures we see in
Cusco and Machu Picchu, too,

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:13.660 align:middle line:10%
or Ollantaytambo, because we
find these keystone cuts there.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:18.510 align:middle line:84%
So once I had discovered the
Cham, and what was going on

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:20.580 align:middle line:84%
with their megalith
building, and particularly

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.800 align:middle line:84%
the keystone cuts, I
realized that there

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.120 align:middle line:84%
was some connection here between
the Cham and South America

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.340 align:middle line:90%
and all of Southeast Asia.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.370 align:middle line:84%
So this began what was
years of research for me.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:38.930 align:middle line:90%


00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:44.070 align:middle line:84%
A new city had become available
for tourists a few years ago,

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:47.150 align:middle line:84%
which is in the very
northern part of Cambodia.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:51.470 align:middle line:84%
It's right on the border
of Cambodia and Thailand.

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And that is a mountainous
area with big high mountains

00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:00.380 align:middle line:84%
that are jungle covered,
and big valleys.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And the Thai government and
the Cambodian government

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:07.880 align:middle line:84%
have had a dispute
for decades over who

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.210 align:middle line:84%
controls this area of
very northern Cambodia.

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:13.760 align:middle line:10%
And the thing is, there's
a megalithic city there

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.740 align:middle line:10%
on top of this mountain.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.740 align:middle line:10%
And that city is
called Preah Vihear,

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.830 align:middle line:10%
and until just a few
years ago no tourists

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.640 align:middle line:10%
could visit Preah Vihear
because of the conflict

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.560 align:middle line:10%
between Thailand and Cambodia.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:33.590 align:middle line:84%
The United Nations
ruled in a final ruling,

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:35.690 align:middle line:84%
and they had actually
made this ruling decades

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.940 align:middle line:84%
before but Thailand
had not accepted it,

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:42.169 align:middle line:84%
and they said Preah
Vihear is in Cambodia

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:45.170 align:middle line:90%
and it's not part of Thailand.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
the Thai military

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.920 align:middle line:84%
stopped shelling the
Cambodian military,

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.730 align:middle line:84%
which they were on two
mountainsides across a valley.

00:08:55.730 --> 00:09:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And once that conflict stopped,
the Cambodian government

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:03.230 align:middle line:84%
began to allow tourists
to go to Preah Vihear,

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:07.100 align:middle line:84%
although you still had to
go with a military escort

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:08.630 align:middle line:90%
to the mountain.

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:09.860 align:middle line:90%
And you had to register.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:13.850 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to do all this,
and I visited Preah Vihear.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And what I found at Preah
Vihear also astonished me.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Here was a megalithic
city built out of granite

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.330 align:middle line:90%
on top of a mountain.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And also at Preah Vihear
were the same keystone cuts

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:30.800 align:middle line:84%
that I was seeing at
My Son in Vietnam.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.496 align:middle line:10%
And those are
basically T-shaped.

00:09:33.496 --> 00:09:35.390 align:middle line:10%
A keystone like that
would be a double T

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:40.190 align:middle line:10%
because the keystone has to
span two different stones.

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Molten metals are then poured
into these cuts to make a span.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:50.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's either
usually a T-shaped cut

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.450 align:middle line:90%
or it's an hourglass type cut.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:55.700 align:middle line:84%
So they had this at
Preah Vihear, too.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.480 align:middle line:84%
What is also at Preah
Vihear, and much of that city

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:06.260 align:middle line:84%
is in ruins, is there is a
big wall of three windows.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:10.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's a megalithic
wall built out of granite.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And that wall is virtually
identical to a famous wall

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.980 align:middle line:90%
at Machu Picchu in Peru.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And that wall is known as
the Wall of Three Windows,

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:26.820 align:middle line:84%
and it's a part of Machu
Picchu that's at the very top.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:32.940 align:middle line:84%
So I realize that Preah Vihear
was almost identical to Machu

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.910 align:middle line:90%
Picchu in Peru.

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:36.290 align:middle line:90%
They were very, very similar.

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:42.150 align:middle line:90%


00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:45.380 align:middle line:84%
So once I had seen Preah
Vihear and with all my travels,

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:48.410 align:middle line:84%
I realized that, yes, there
was a total connection

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:51.740 align:middle line:84%
between the Cham
of Vietnam, also

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Cambodia, being named after
Cambodia, after the Cham.

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it's known that
Cham people and the Cham

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.350 align:middle line:90%
language was spoken in Cambodia.

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:03.260 align:middle line:84%
But as I began to
research, what surprised

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:09.320 align:middle line:84%
me was that there's not really
a good prehistory of Southeast

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.430 align:middle line:90%
Asia.

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:14.900 align:middle line:84%
When we look at ancient India
or ancient China or Samaria

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:18.140 align:middle line:84%
or Egypt or even
ancient Peru and Mexico,

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:22.670 align:middle line:84%
we're able to identify
civilizations going back

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:28.760 align:middle line:84%
to easily 1000 BCE,
2000 BCE, even 3000 BCE.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And during the time of just,
say, 500 BC, in ancient India

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:36.560 align:middle line:84%
and in China all kinds
of stuff was going on.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:40.220 align:middle line:84%
This was around
the time of Ashoka,

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:44.750 align:middle line:84%
the great emperor of northern
India who became a Buddhist.

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And he sent people all over
the world to spread Buddhism.

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:53.000 align:middle line:10%
And this was about
300 BC, or so.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.870 align:middle line:84%
But as I researched the
Cham and the Champa,

00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:01.620 align:middle line:84%
what really surprised me
was that in Southeast Asia,

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:04.700 align:middle line:84%
there was no
civilization that anyone

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:10.730 align:middle line:84%
had identified that really goes
back to any time before Christ.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:15.230 align:middle line:84%
The Champa themselves are
said to really exist around,

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:18.880 align:middle line:84%
the earliest inscription they
find, which is at My Son,

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.520 align:middle line:90%
is around 192 AD.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:25.580 align:middle line:84%
So modern historians,
what I discovered,

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.040 align:middle line:84%
are placing the
Cham and the Champa

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.760 align:middle line:84%
in just a very small
part of central Vietnam.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And areas like Cambodia and
southern Thailand and Malaysia

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:41.450 align:middle line:84%
and Sumatra and Java and Borneo,
in all these areas of Southeast

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:44.710 align:middle line:84%
Asia, according to
mainstream historians,

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:47.290 align:middle line:90%
there is no civilization there.

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:50.330 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing they
can speak about.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:56.180 align:middle line:84%
They can't ascribe any
cities or structures

00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:02.300 align:middle line:84%
to any civilization that
is BC in Southeast Asia.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:07.460 align:middle line:84%
That really astonished me
that essentially the history

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:12.320 align:middle line:84%
of Southeast Asia was
completely missing.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:17.690 align:middle line:84%
What was going on in 500 BC or
even 200 BC in Southeast Asia

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:19.520 align:middle line:90%
is completely unknown.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And mainstream historians
are essentially

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:26.120 align:middle line:84%
saying that nothing was
happening in Southeast Asia,

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:31.610 align:middle line:84%
and that there were no empires
or cohesive civilizations that

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:33.620 align:middle line:90%
were ruling this area.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And that didn't
make sense to me.

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:38.190 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't see how
that could possibly be.

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:42.380 align:middle line:10%
And so as my research
into the Cham and Champa

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:46.970 align:middle line:10%
extended, what I realized
was that all of Southeast

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:52.910 align:middle line:10%
Asia, from Sumatra to Java to
Malaysia and southern Thailand

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:57.530 align:middle line:10%
and, of course, Cambodia and
southern Vietnam and islands

00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:01.130 align:middle line:10%
like southern
Philippines, all this area

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:04.040 align:middle line:10%
was controlled by the Cham.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, in my
research I found

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:09.380 align:middle line:84%
that the Cham language
was known to be

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.960 align:middle line:90%
spoken in northern Sumatra.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.480 align:middle line:84%
So here we have,
at the very least,

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.840 align:middle line:84%
the Cham are not
just in Vietnam,

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.100 align:middle line:90%
they're in Sumatra, too.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.690 align:middle line:90%
There are structures.

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:24.402 align:middle line:84%
One interesting structure is
in Java, it's called Borobudur.

00:14:24.402 --> 00:14:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Borobudur is probably
the main tourist site

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:30.850 align:middle line:84%
today on the island
of Java in Indonesia.

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:34.820 align:middle line:84%
Borobudur is a gigantic
megalithic mandala

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:37.470 align:middle line:90%
built as a mountain.

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:41.030 align:middle line:84%
It was covered in a lava
flow, actually, at one point

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:42.110 align:middle line:90%
and then became ruins.

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And it was rediscovered
in the mid-1800s.

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:51.140 align:middle line:84%
But even today, no one
knows who built Borobudur.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.430 align:middle line:90%
It's a tourist site.

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:55.580 align:middle line:84%
When you get to Borobudur,
you walk up onto this mandala.

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:59.390 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to walk it
in a certain way around it,

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:00.980 align:middle line:90%
as walking a mandala.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And you get to the
top and there's

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.350 align:middle line:84%
these small Buddhas sitting
in these small stupas that

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:08.180 align:middle line:90%
look like flying saucers.

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And each of these small
flying saucers stupas

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:15.260 align:middle line:84%
has a statue of the
Buddha inside it.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:20.230 align:middle line:84%
It's very well made,
every statue is perfect.

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:25.100 align:middle line:84%
It's really excellent
stonework of the best kind.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And there are also keystone
cuts at Borobudur, as well,

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.540 align:middle line:84%
and they're hourglass
type keystone cuts.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:35.450 align:middle line:90%


00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:40.260 align:middle line:84%
The whole keystone cut
controversy is, I think,

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.080 align:middle line:90%
very important.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:47.420 align:middle line:84%
What keystone cuts are,
they're an unusual way

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:51.530 align:middle line:84%
of holding blocks
of stone together.

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
smaller blocks of stone,

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:57.460 align:middle line:84%
walls like that can pull apart,
earthquakes can destroy them,

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.560 align:middle line:84%
and the keystone
cuts and the metal

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:04.780 align:middle line:84%
clamps that go in them can
help hold walls together.

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:08.710 align:middle line:84%
But it's an unusual way
of fitting stonework.

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very advanced
way of fitting stonework.

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And it requires
metallurgical skills

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.010 align:middle line:90%
that are beyond stone cutting.

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:21.530 align:middle line:84%
So not only are you
quarrying blocks of stone

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:24.040 align:middle line:84%
that can weigh many
tons, and even hundreds

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.620 align:middle line:90%
of tons in some cases.

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.720 align:middle line:84%
They're are huge
blocks of stones,

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:32.380 align:middle line:84%
ones that we would never work
with today or even try to move.

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:36.220 align:middle line:84%
But still, these blocks of stone
will have these keystone cuts

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:37.600 align:middle line:90%
cut in them.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:41.920 align:middle line:10%
And then, when it's properly
done and constructed,

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:45.670 align:middle line:10%
molten metals are
poured into the cuts

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:48.700 align:middle line:10%
to create these long clamps.

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:53.590 align:middle line:84%
My point is that this is not
a normal way of fitting stone

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:54.640 align:middle line:90%
blocks together.

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.610 align:middle line:84%
It's an unusual
way, a unique way.

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And so wherever we would see
that, we're seeing construction

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:06.760 align:middle line:84%
by people who are using
the same architect,

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.880 align:middle line:84%
the same engineers are
building these things

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.910 align:middle line:84%
because they're using
a technique that's

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:15.140 align:middle line:90%
unique, in a sense.

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:19.329 align:middle line:84%
Keystone cuts and the metallic
clamps that go in them

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:23.800 align:middle line:84%
are not something that people
would independently invent.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:27.280 align:middle line:84%
It's a technique
and technology that

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:31.210 align:middle line:90%
has to be brought to each site.

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:34.780 align:middle line:10%
We don't know how old
this technology goes,

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:41.200 align:middle line:10%
but certain temples in Egypt
also have these keystone cuts.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:45.190 align:middle line:10%
I was also in Ethiopia
a few years ago

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:48.640 align:middle line:10%
to see the obelisks and
the megaliths there.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed the
keystone cuts as well.

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the metallic
clamps were still there.

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:58.770 align:middle line:84%
What makes this really
important with the Cham

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:04.750 align:middle line:84%
and all of these situations
and sites all over the world

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.360 align:middle line:84%
that have these keystone
cuts is that they're

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.350 align:middle line:90%
in very different places.

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:12.250 align:middle line:84%
They're high in the
Andes Mountains,

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:15.700 align:middle line:84%
they're in jungle cities
in Southeast Asia,

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.260 align:middle line:84%
they're in the
mountains of Ethiopia,

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:21.580 align:middle line:84%
they're in Greece, as
well, and other sites

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:23.130 align:middle line:90%
in India or Cambodia.

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:26.830 align:middle line:10%
Mainstream archaeologists
and anthropologists

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:32.290 align:middle line:10%
are telling us that ancient
civilizations are disconnected.

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And this would be at the
University of California

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:36.430 align:middle line:84%
or Oxford University
or something.

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:38.677 align:middle line:84%
They're saying,
oceans are barriers.

00:18:38.677 --> 00:18:40.135 align:middle line:84%
People can't just
get into the boat

00:18:40.135 --> 00:18:41.710 align:middle line:90%
and cross the Atlantic Ocean.

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:44.560 align:middle line:84%
This is the dogma we're
being taught in the highest

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:48.940 align:middle line:84%
universities by
our PhD lecturers.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:52.092 align:middle line:84%
This is known as
isolationism, and the other

00:18:52.092 --> 00:18:53.050 align:middle line:90%
is called diffusionism.

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:56.590 align:middle line:84%
So isolationism is what
we're being taught.

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:59.230 align:middle line:84%
Cultures are isolated from
each other, particularly

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:01.810 align:middle line:84%
the cultures in South
America or Mexico,

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:05.110 align:middle line:84%
they're isolated from
Southeast Asia or Egypt.

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:07.690 align:middle line:84%
There's not
trans-Pacific voyages

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:11.290 align:middle line:84%
connecting these countries,
according to those historians.

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:13.770 align:middle line:84%
But what we're seeing here
with the keystone cuts

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:16.145 align:middle line:84%
and with the Cham is a
completely different story,

00:19:16.145 --> 00:19:17.770 align:middle line:84%
and that is what's
called diffusionism.

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And that is that oceans are not
barriers, oceans are highways.

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.060 align:middle line:84%
The easy way to go
to someplace is not

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:27.640 align:middle line:84%
to walk there but
to get in a boat.

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:31.390 align:middle line:84%
But even today, look at
our use of airplanes and we

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:34.150 align:middle line:84%
have spaceships and
everything, but still

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:38.590 align:middle line:84%
most of the cargo and travel,
if it's from continent

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:41.290 align:middle line:90%
to continent, is done by ships.

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is what the Cham
had, giant fleets of ships.

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And these giant fleet
of ships were running

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:50.140 align:middle line:90%
all over Southeast Asia.

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:55.080 align:middle line:90%


00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:58.440 align:middle line:10%
There's really a historical
schism that's really going on

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:02.400 align:middle line:10%
here, and it has to do with
the keystone cuts but also

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.760 align:middle line:10%
other things too, such
as cranial deformation.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.440 align:middle line:10%
I also did a book
some years ago,

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:11.140 align:middle line:10%
and I coauthored it, about
head deformation and people

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:13.830 align:middle line:10%
elongating their heads.

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:16.320 align:middle line:10%
And this is also
like keystone cuts,

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.760 align:middle line:10%
it's something that occurs
in very diverse places all

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.700 align:middle line:10%
over the world.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.480 align:middle line:84%
It's on Pacific Islands,
it's done in South America,

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:29.070 align:middle line:84%
it was done in Mexico, it
was done in Korea and China,

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:32.640 align:middle line:84%
Egyptians did it, the Kurds
in northern Iraq did it,

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:37.740 align:middle line:84%
the Hungarians did it, we found
these elongated heads in Malta.

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:41.070 align:middle line:84%
So why is it that the
mainstream archaeologists

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:45.630 align:middle line:84%
historians don't want to talk
about cranial deformation?

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:47.610 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's why.

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:50.820 align:middle line:84%
Cranial deformation is in
all of these different places

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:51.970 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:54.130 align:middle line:90%
And it's an unusual thing to do.

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to discuss
in any meaningful way cranial

00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:01.760 align:middle line:84%
deformation, you
would have to discuss

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:05.700 align:middle line:84%
that is in South
America, it's in Mexico,

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:09.940 align:middle line:84%
it's in the Pacific Northwest,
it's on Vanuatu, it's in Egypt,

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:13.950 align:middle line:90%
it's in Sumeria, it's on Malta.

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And then you would
have to somehow relate

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:21.710 align:middle line:84%
all of these coneheads
with their elongated skulls

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:24.730 align:middle line:84%
from all of these places
from around the world,

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:28.210 align:middle line:84%
and you would have to
relate them to each other.

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And that is what mainstream
historians do not

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:34.710 align:middle line:84%
want to do because
none of these places

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:36.440 align:middle line:90%
can actually be connected.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:40.440 align:middle line:90%


00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:43.140 align:middle line:84%
What I'm learning from the
Cham and from all these studies

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:46.500 align:middle line:84%
is that the whole world was
connected in ancient times

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:50.010 align:middle line:84%
and people were traveling
across both the Atlantic

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:52.890 align:middle line:84%
and the Pacific Ocean
and the Indian Ocean.

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, who the Cham
were is really significant.

00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:58.980 align:middle line:84%
The Cham, although
they were in Vietnam

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:04.110 align:middle line:84%
and they interacted a lot with
China, they were really Hindus.

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:08.910 align:middle line:84%
Their culture that they
had was completely Hindu.

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:12.870 align:middle line:84%
They worshiped Shiva and
all of the Hindu gods,

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:16.800 align:middle line:84%
Parvati, their statuary,
everything was Hindu.

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:21.150 align:middle line:84%
Almost identical to what you
would see in India, really.

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:26.040 align:middle line:84%
But the Cham did something also
unusual, they were Shaivites.

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.140 align:middle line:84%
Shaivites wear their
hair long, they

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.150 align:middle line:90%
grow very long hair, the men.

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And then they tie it up on
top of their head in a bun.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:39.540 align:middle line:84%
So when you go to Easter Island
and you see the statues there,

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:42.300 align:middle line:90%
they are Shaivites.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:47.460 align:middle line:84%
They have long ears, which is
how Shiva and Buddha are always

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:50.640 align:middle line:84%
depicted, with very
long ear lobes.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And they're
apparently coneheads,

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:55.950 align:middle line:90%
as well, those statues.

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:58.410 align:middle line:84%
But on Easter Island,
what they would do

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:03.059 align:middle line:84%
is they would quarry the giant
statues at a volcano sort

00:23:03.059 --> 00:23:04.350 align:middle line:90%
of in the center of the island.

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
move the statues

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:09.300 align:middle line:84%
to the outer edge of the
island facing inland,

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:13.140 align:middle line:84%
and then it would put a red
top knot on top of the head.

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same thing of
the Shaivites tying their hair

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.790 align:middle line:90%
as a bun on top of the head.

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:26.160 align:middle line:84%
So that's where I realized that
the statues at Easter Island

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.620 align:middle line:90%
are also of the Cham.

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:34.220 align:middle line:90%


00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:37.160 align:middle line:10%
I really feel that
it's important for us

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:40.490 align:middle line:10%
to understand the ancient
past and where we've been,

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:45.110 align:middle line:10%
where we've come from, what our
civilization was in the past,

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:48.740 align:middle line:10%
and how worldwide it was.

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:51.440 align:middle line:10%
And by understanding
the past it helps

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:55.220 align:middle line:10%
us understand who we are
now and our connection

00:23:55.220 --> 00:24:00.860 align:middle line:10%
to people all over the world
and to so many cultures.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And by understanding
who we are now

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:05.340 align:middle line:84%
and where we've
been in the past,

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:09.020 align:middle line:84%
I believe this can help
us as we go forward,

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:14.540 align:middle line:84%
and, ultimately, how
our future as the United

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:21.060 align:middle line:84%
States and the whole world
is one where we are all one,

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:25.910 align:middle line:84%
we're coming out of largely
the same ancient culture

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:29.478 align:middle line:84%
and hopefully we will go
forward in that same way.
