00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.690 align:middle line:10%
>> My name is Mitch Horowitz.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.390 align:middle line:10%
I am a historian,
writer, and seeker

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.760 align:middle line:10%
in alternative spirituality.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.920 align:middle line:84%
I got into this work
as a little kid.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.900 align:middle line:84%
I was growing up in
the borough of Queens

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.420 align:middle line:84%
in New York City
in the 1970s and I

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.210 align:middle line:84%
was fascinated with folklore,
superstition, ghost stories,

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.530 align:middle line:90%
astrology.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to know, where
did these ideas come from?

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.930 align:middle line:90%
How did they enter our culture?

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.629 align:middle line:84%
How did they reach
my childhood home

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.230 align:middle line:84%
from the civilizations
of ancient Egypt,

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.930 align:middle line:90%
Babylonian Greece, Rome?

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.262 align:middle line:90%
And what path did they travel?

00:01:13.262 --> 00:01:14.470 align:middle line:90%
How did they get interrupted?

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.740 align:middle line:90%
How did they get changed?

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.610 align:middle line:84%
So starting from when I
was just a little kid,

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.880 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know the
answers to these things.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.100 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to peel back
the onion on all this.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And I was very blessed
to be able to carry

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.100 align:middle line:84%
that search into adulthood
as a writer, as a historian,

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.690 align:middle line:90%
as a seeker.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.140 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.090 align:middle line:90%


00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.810 align:middle line:84%
Part of my work is the
work of verification.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.310 align:middle line:84%
I think, not only can you
write as a critical historian

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.320 align:middle line:84%
about movements and figures
that you place some belief in,

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.450 align:middle line:84%
but, in fact, most of our
historical writing, most

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.990 align:middle line:84%
of our critical writing
about world religions

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.740 align:middle line:84%
comes from people who are
believers within those belief

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.270 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.310 align:middle line:10%
I wrote "Occult
America" because I

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.110 align:middle line:10%
was working with the ideas of
many different occult thinkers

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.930 align:middle line:10%
and experimenters
and I didn't think

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.230 align:middle line:10%
that their lives were being
captured or understood

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.650 align:middle line:10%
in the prevailing
historical literature.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking of people like
Madam HP Blavatsky, Paul Foster

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Case, Edward Casey, Manly
P. Hall-- the great occult

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:29.620 align:middle line:90%
scholar.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.930 align:middle line:84%
It seemed to me that
these people really

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.340 align:middle line:90%
stood for something.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.450 align:middle line:84%
There was something in their
lives that required defending.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.670 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to take esoteric,
and ancient, and hermetic

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.210 align:middle line:84%
religious ideas and
turn them into sources

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:53.080 align:middle line:84%
of practical insight and wisdom
within the day-to-day life

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.630 align:middle line:90%
of the ordinary person.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.170 align:middle line:84%
If New Age spirituality or
alternative spirituality

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.960 align:middle line:84%
stands for anything,
it's that the spiritual

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.010 align:middle line:90%
can be therapeutic.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.490 align:middle line:84%
That there are practical
methods and insights and ideas

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.060 align:middle line:84%
that can deepen the experience
and improve the experience

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.800 align:middle line:90%
of the individual.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.940 align:middle line:84%
When occult figures are
written about in mainstream

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.720 align:middle line:84%
historical works, first
of all, when is a rarity.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.100 align:middle line:84%
Very often, they're either
ignored, they're looked past,

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.910 align:middle line:84%
or they're just
momentarily depicted

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.160 align:middle line:84%
as being these fringe
oddball figures

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.990 align:middle line:84%
who might have had a regrettable
influence at some earlier

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.040 align:middle line:84%
or less sophisticated
time in our national life,

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.300 align:middle line:84%
but who could safely be
relegated to a museum case

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.830 align:middle line:90%
somewhere and ignored.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.200 align:middle line:10%
Most mainstream
historians, for example,

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.870 align:middle line:10%
have no idea what to make of
a figure like Madam Blavatsky

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.320 align:middle line:10%
They think of her some
huckster or carnival performer.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.640 align:middle line:90%
They don't know where to look.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And even if you could
show them where to look,

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.670 align:middle line:90%
they're bored with the topic.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.590 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to look there.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.090 align:middle line:10%
So for example, Mahatma Gandhi
in his letters and diaries

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.810 align:middle line:10%
was very plain about the
fact that Madam Blavatsky

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.930 align:middle line:10%
as a person and
theosophy as a principle

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.270 align:middle line:10%
had an enormous formative effect
on the Indian independence

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.140 align:middle line:10%
movement.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.890 align:middle line:84%
India today is the largest
democracy in the world.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.940 align:middle line:84%
Gandhi traced his
earliest influences back

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.280 align:middle line:90%
to Madam Blavatsky.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.410 align:middle line:84%
This gets lost within
mainstream history

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.480 align:middle line:84%
because mainstream
historians are

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.330 align:middle line:84%
trained in a kind of
conformist mindset--

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.770 align:middle line:90%
as we all are--

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.720 align:middle line:84%
to regard certain
things as serious.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.220 align:middle line:90%
Certain things is nonsense.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And it dawned on me that the
esoteric and occult subculture

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.750 align:middle line:84%
was going to lose its
own history unless it

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.370 align:middle line:90%
wrote its own history.

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.190 align:middle line:84%
You can't depend upon
historians from other fields who

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.740 align:middle line:84%
may be very indifferent to
some of these movements who

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.170 align:middle line:84%
don't have any
understanding of the values,

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.960 align:middle line:84%
and practices, and
ideals of these movements

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.930 align:middle line:90%
to write that history for you.

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.330 align:middle line:90%
It will not happen.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.610 align:middle line:90%
It will be forgotten.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.400 align:middle line:84%
Or it will be written about
in a very caricatured way.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.190 align:middle line:84%
So I saw that need in
the historical literature

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.570 align:middle line:84%
that the occult subcultures
and the figures behind them

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.750 align:middle line:84%
were either being ignored
or being misunderstood.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And my conviction
was and remains

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.330 align:middle line:84%
that something in their lives
was really worth defending.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.890 align:middle line:90%
They stood for something.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to capture
their own intellectual

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.620 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual search,
as well as their foibles

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.950 align:middle line:84%
and their failures of
which, there were many.

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.290 align:middle line:84%
But they were great
successes, as well.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.210 align:middle line:84%
There were great
acts of integrity.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to capture
that full picture

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.056 align:middle line:84%
so that's what I attempted
in "Occult America."

00:05:45.056 --> 00:05:49.250 align:middle line:90%


00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.820 align:middle line:10%
In the here and now, I'm very
interested in New Thought,

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.670 align:middle line:10%
which is the spiritual
philosophy that grew out

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.200 align:middle line:10%
of the New England
mental healing

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.360 align:middle line:10%
movement in the
late 19th century.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.670 align:middle line:10%
New Thought is sometimes,
known as the power

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.020 align:middle line:10%
of positive thinking.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.250 align:middle line:10%
I'm very interested in the
question of whether thoughts

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.750 align:middle line:10%
are causative.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And I answer that question
in the affirmative,

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.910 align:middle line:84%
but that still leaves open so
many mysteries and questions

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.380 align:middle line:90%
that build upon one another.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:19.610 align:middle line:90%
How are they causative?

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.080 align:middle line:90%
Why are they causative?

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.790 align:middle line:84%
In what circumstances
can my thoughts actually

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:29.420 align:middle line:84%
affect and rearrange
reality, and experience,

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.710 align:middle line:90%
and physicality?

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And in what circumstances
does that not work?

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.540 align:middle line:10%
The problem with New
Thought is that it's

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.250 align:middle line:10%
failed to grow intellectually
so that we think of New Thought

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.430 align:middle line:10%
principles, of positive mind
principles as things that

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.980 align:middle line:10%
belong on refrigerator magnets
or inspirational page a day

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:47.780 align:middle line:10%
calendars.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.480 align:middle line:90%
But in fact, New Thought ideas--

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.690 align:middle line:84%
the question of the
minds influence--

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:55.910 align:middle line:90%
is-- for me--

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.570 align:middle line:84%
the most radical
question facing humanity

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:01.910 align:middle line:90%
of say, the past 150 years.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.750 align:middle line:84%
I think within our generation
and within the folds of things

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.860 align:middle line:84%
that we're discovering today
in fields like neuroplasticity,

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.040 align:middle line:84%
placebo studies,
and quantum physics,

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.360 align:middle line:84%
we are encountering
ideas about the mind that

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.750 align:middle line:84%
are going to change our
conception of what it means

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.900 align:middle line:84%
to be human, as much
as Darwinism change

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.360 align:middle line:84%
that conception in
the Victorian Age.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.750 align:middle line:84%
That's unfolding right now
within our own generation.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:35.660 align:middle line:10%
And the pioneers of New Thought
had a very early instinct

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.350 align:middle line:10%
for all of the things that
are being validated today

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:42.290 align:middle line:10%
in the fields that I
just mentioned and more.

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:44.630 align:middle line:84%
That we're learning
about right now.

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.250 align:middle line:84%
But that movement failed
to grow intellectually.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.760 align:middle line:84%
It became very successful
as a popular literature

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.030 align:middle line:84%
so today, people are
familiar with "The Power

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.870 align:middle line:84%
of Positive Thinking," "Law of
Attraction," and "The Secret."

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:58.820 align:middle line:84%
It succeeded as a
popular literature,

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.690 align:middle line:84%
but it did not succeed as a
serious intellectual movement

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:06.560 align:middle line:84%
that really turned its own
questions back on itself

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.980 align:middle line:84%
and deepened and
further detailed

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.030 align:middle line:90%
some of its premises and ideas.

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:14.210 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I'm trying to do.

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:17.960 align:middle line:10%
William James was doing
this when he died in 1910.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.700 align:middle line:10%
He was experimenting
with mind power

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.520 align:middle line:10%
methods for the last
decade of his life.

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.650 align:middle line:10%
And he took all of
this very seriously,

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:27.620 align:middle line:10%
but there weren't
many people that

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:31.970 align:middle line:10%
followed in his wake that looked
seriously at the challenge

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.610 align:middle line:10%
that thoughts are causative
in a really sustained way.

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:35.659 align:middle line:90%
So I'm trying to do that.

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And I try to do it in
a very practical way.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:42.770 align:middle line:84%
I love the practical
New Thought literature.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't try to sway
people from reading it.

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:48.750 align:middle line:84%
My encouragement is read
it, experiment with it.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.007 align:middle line:90%
There's so much there.

00:08:50.007 --> 00:08:51.590 align:middle line:84%
But we also have to
go further with it

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:53.240 align:middle line:90%
and ask ourselves questions.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:57.770 align:middle line:84%
The chief one is, do we live
under one mental super law?

00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Or do we live under
many causes and forces

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.839 align:middle line:90%
of which that is one part?

00:09:02.839 --> 00:09:04.880 align:middle line:84%
That's something that I'm
working with right now.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:10.432 align:middle line:90%


00:09:10.432 --> 00:09:12.320 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
interesting questions

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.900 align:middle line:90%
about what creates reality.

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.030 align:middle line:84%
We're on our knees
looking through a keyhole

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:20.570 align:middle line:84%
and we may never get more
than a keyhole picture of it

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:22.460 align:middle line:90%
during this lifetime.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:26.180 align:middle line:84%
But there are fascinating
questions-- for example--

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:30.860 align:middle line:84%
about whether events that
we experience as linear

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:35.120 align:middle line:90%
are really linear after all.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.750 align:middle line:84%
In quantum physics, there's a
theory called the many worlds

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:41.300 align:middle line:84%
theories, which
proposes that there

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:45.080 align:middle line:84%
are infinite numbers of
outcomes going on around us

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:50.750 align:middle line:84%
all the time, but we experience
a limited conception of reality

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:52.730 align:middle line:90%
through our sensory organs.

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And we experience these
things in a linear fashion.

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:59.150 align:middle line:84%
When, in fact,
they're there going on

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.390 align:middle line:84%
in this infinite
circuitous fashion

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:07.460 align:middle line:84%
that can't be mapped
out on a line chart.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:10.670 align:middle line:84%
William James reasoned
in 1902, that the mystic

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:11.870 align:middle line:90%
is like a microscope.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:14.540 align:middle line:84%
That when the mystic
looks at something

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.340 align:middle line:84%
as through a microscope,
you're seeing

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.890 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of things going on.

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:20.660 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing
cellular structure.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:21.860 align:middle line:90%
You're seeing molecules.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:22.910 align:middle line:90%
You're seeing atoms.

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.430 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing space
between things.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.010 align:middle line:90%
But when you pan back--

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:29.450 align:middle line:90%
as with a camera--

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:32.120 align:middle line:84%
you're getting less
and less detail.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.630 align:middle line:84%
So the coarseness of
our sensory organs

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:38.660 align:middle line:84%
might not be sufficient
to really take

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.940 align:middle line:90%
in everything that's going on.

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:43.760 align:middle line:84%
But the quantum
physicist, the person

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:49.210 align:middle line:84%
looking through a microscope,
the astronomer looking

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:51.640 align:middle line:84%
through a nuclear
telescope-- might be seeing

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:52.960 align:middle line:90%
things that are going on.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:57.190 align:middle line:84%
The mystic who has a
heightened intuitive ability

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:59.260 align:middle line:84%
might be seeing things
that are going on

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.760 align:middle line:84%
in ways that we don't take in
our normal day-to-day life.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.820 align:middle line:84%
So my challenge and the thing
that I'm trying to work with

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:11.890 align:middle line:84%
is whether linear events as we
experience them exist at all.

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:16.780 align:middle line:84%
Or whether, in fact, by the
very nature of our thoughts,

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.570 align:middle line:84%
we're not manifesting
things, necessarily,

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:22.030 align:middle line:90%
but we are selecting things.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:26.110 align:middle line:84%
Which is why it's so
important for the individual

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:28.540 align:middle line:84%
to have some sense of
awareness of the thoughts

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:32.000 align:middle line:84%
that are going on in his or
her head, which are nonstop.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.710 align:middle line:84%
We all have these running
dialogues occurring, not only

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:38.600 align:middle line:84%
every waking moment, but
in our sleep, as well.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.730 align:middle line:90%
It's possible.

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:40.760 align:middle line:90%
It's possible.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think generations
of mystics study,

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.510 align:middle line:84%
as well as things that have
gone on in contemporary science,

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:49.450 align:middle line:84%
suggests to us that
the mind is not only

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:53.770 align:middle line:84%
a tool of cognitive and motor
function, but may be actually,

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.900 align:middle line:90%
selecting events--

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:59.230 align:middle line:84%
which is something that has just
been suggested, that we've just

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:03.220 align:middle line:84%
gotten a hint of in the past
80 years of quantum physics

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:04.460 align:middle line:90%
experiments.

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:09.560 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's a tremendous
challenge facing our generation

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.360 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
I'm working on right now

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:17.050 align:middle line:84%
is trying to come up with
a theory of positive mind

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:19.265 align:middle line:90%
mechanics-- if it works.

00:12:19.265 --> 00:12:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we've seen
enough evidence to suggest it

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.220 align:middle line:84%
does, and we know it
does-- for example--

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.540 align:middle line:90%
in placebo studies.

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.530 align:middle line:90%
If it works, why does it work?

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:28.570 align:middle line:90%
What's the mechanism?

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:30.880 align:middle line:90%
It may not just be one thing.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.400 align:middle line:84%
There may be changes in
the body-- for example--

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.010 align:middle line:84%
and we may be able to
measure these changes

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:38.770 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, look, the
placebo effect in the body

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:42.220 align:middle line:84%
is the stimulation of the
reward center in the brain.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.830 align:middle line:84%
Or it's the release
of endorphins.

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Or it's a strengthening of
the immunological system.

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, it may be all those
things, but keep in mind,

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.430 align:middle line:84%
those things may be
effects and not causes.

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:59.350 align:middle line:84%
That may be what the spiritual
appeal looks like in the body.

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:02.100 align:middle line:84%
Part of our limitation
in our intellectual study

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.140 align:middle line:84%
is we find something that's
going on, we verify it,

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.380 align:middle line:84%
and we assume that's the
only thing that's going on.

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.110 align:middle line:84%
That might be what prayer
looks like in the body.

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:12.880 align:middle line:84%
That might be what
mental causation

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.300 align:middle line:90%
looks like in the body.

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:18.250 align:middle line:84%
So I'm trying to broaden
our sense of what's really

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:22.517 align:middle line:84%
happening in life and how it may
be much broader than what we've

00:13:22.517 --> 00:13:23.600 align:middle line:90%
been brought up to assume.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:28.970 align:middle line:90%


00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:32.660 align:middle line:84%
All of us as
individuals, all the time

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:37.040 align:middle line:84%
are facing ethical decisions
and ethical dilemmas.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.530 align:middle line:84%
And these things
have both material

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:42.770 align:middle line:84%
and metaphysical
dimensions to them.

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:47.240 align:middle line:84%
The person who says to
me, is the government

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.750 align:middle line:84%
or some secret agency
using all these bad devices

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:52.640 align:middle line:90%
to manipulate things?

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:57.170 align:middle line:84%
The question I would put back to
that person is, do you gossip?

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:58.910 align:middle line:90%
Do you keep your word?

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Are you a good
person to live with?

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.410 align:middle line:84%
What would your spouse or
your boyfriend or girlfriend

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:06.240 align:middle line:84%
say if I were to
put that question?

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to
judge the individual

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:11.460 align:middle line:84%
and I direct these questions
to myself, as well.

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:14.660 align:middle line:84%
We have an enormous range
of ethical decisions

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:19.280 align:middle line:84%
to make in our personal
life all day, every day.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.260 align:middle line:90%
Look at online banter.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.630 align:middle line:10%
It's filled with cynicism.

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:26.180 align:middle line:84%
It's filled with people
being humiliated.

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.940 align:middle line:84%
It's filled with
people being insulted.

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:31.730 align:middle line:84%
So much of our
entertainment is based

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:35.010 align:middle line:84%
on denigrating other people,
whether it's political talk

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:35.810 align:middle line:90%
shows.

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:38.420 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's so-called,
reality television.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:41.360 align:middle line:84%
We, as a culture,
take great glee

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.670 align:middle line:90%
in seeing people humiliated.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:47.420 align:middle line:84%
You want to look for evil
forces, look right there.

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:50.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm infinitely less
concerned about things

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:53.330 align:middle line:84%
that are supposedly
going on somewhere

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:56.780 align:middle line:84%
in the halls of power,
than I am concerned

00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:01.430 align:middle line:84%
about the coarseness, and the
anger, and the denigrating tone

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:03.110 align:middle line:90%
that is found online.

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:04.910 align:middle line:84%
I get hate mail
all the time when

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:07.190 align:middle line:84%
I say something nice
about Freemasonry

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:09.470 align:middle line:90%
or the historic Illuminati.

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:11.390 align:middle line:84%
I think those
organizations have actually

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:13.400 align:middle line:90%
been wonderful influences.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.620 align:middle line:10%
The Illuminati as
it really existed--

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.290 align:middle line:10%
not in some fantasy,
but as it existed

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:22.040 align:middle line:10%
upon its founding
in Bavaria in 1776

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:26.000 align:middle line:10%
was filled with radical
humanitarian principles.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.490 align:middle line:84%
A belief in separation
of church and state.

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:30.740 align:middle line:84%
A belief that rank and
status should not be

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:35.840 align:middle line:84%
conferred upon an individual
by his accident of birth.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.480 align:middle line:84%
A belief in some kind
of social polity--

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.060 align:middle line:90%
free schools, free hospitals.

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:44.150 align:middle line:84%
These were aspects of
Illuminati philosophy.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:46.400 align:middle line:10%
Aspects of Rosicrucian
philosophy.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.290 align:middle line:10%
Aspects of Freemasonic
philosophy.

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:51.980 align:middle line:10%
And as these things influenced--
especially coming through

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.150 align:middle line:10%
Freemasonry--

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:57.890 align:middle line:10%
some of America's founders,
including George Washington,

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:00.080 align:middle line:10%
Paul Revere, Ben
Franklin-- these

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.430 align:middle line:10%
were wonderful influences.

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:04.520 align:middle line:84%
So I view Freemasonry
as having been

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:08.150 align:middle line:84%
a very positive influence on
the development of our culture.

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:10.730 align:middle line:84%
A very positive
influence on the ethic

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:13.640 align:middle line:84%
of religious plurality
and freedom as it

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.380 align:middle line:90%
has existed in America.

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think that when
people are looking

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:23.960 align:middle line:84%
for storylines or ideas
about secret societies

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.720 align:middle line:84%
having some kind of
sinister influence

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.370 align:middle line:84%
within our government
today, they're

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:31.130 align:middle line:84%
looking in precisely,
the wrong place.

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:34.190 align:middle line:84%
They should be
looking at influences

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:35.990 align:middle line:90%
that course through them.

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:40.940 align:middle line:84%
Influences that they are on
the lives of other people.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:43.250 align:middle line:84%
Do we ever stop to
ask other people

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:47.780 align:middle line:84%
or to consider what other
people's experiences are of me?

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.260 align:middle line:90%
Of us?

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.560 align:middle line:84%
Whether we are
helping or hurting?

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.760 align:middle line:84%
Whether we are there
for other people?

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.430 align:middle line:90%
Whether we keep our word?

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:57.860 align:middle line:84%
I think the most radical
mystical exercise

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.950 align:middle line:84%
that any individual
can undertake, even

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:04.490 align:middle line:84%
in the space of one hour,
is keeping his or her word.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:07.430 align:middle line:84%
If you can't keep your word,
then you can't ultimately

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:08.930 align:middle line:90%
be responsible for anything.

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:11.569 align:middle line:84%
There's something sacred
about keeping your word.

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:13.099 align:middle line:90%
It will change your life.

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:15.410 align:middle line:84%
It will change the lives
of people around you.

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:16.880 align:middle line:90%
I guarantee that.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.220 align:middle line:84%
But we rarely look
at things like that

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:20.869 align:middle line:84%
and we're more apt
to look at what

00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:24.109 align:middle line:84%
I consider complete fantasies
about conspiratorial

00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:26.960 align:middle line:84%
organizations that are pulling
strings and controlling things.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:30.080 align:middle line:84%
Again, I would turn that
right back on the questioner

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.710 align:middle line:84%
and ask him, how
in his private life

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:37.400 align:middle line:84%
he's carrying out the
principles that he thinks are

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.710 align:middle line:90%
being violated somewhere else?

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:41.000 align:middle line:90%
Bring it back home--

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.378 align:middle line:90%
that's my challenge.

00:17:42.378 --> 00:17:49.350 align:middle line:90%


00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:53.850 align:middle line:84%
Positive mind philosophy is
really, the American creed.

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:56.490 align:middle line:84%
There's so much talk
of division these days,

00:17:56.490 --> 00:18:00.450 align:middle line:84%
but if there's one philosophy
that really unites everybody

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.540 align:middle line:84%
across political
and religious lines,

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:08.490 align:middle line:84%
it's this idea that your
thoughts, your attitude,

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:12.990 align:middle line:84%
your self-image play
an intimate role

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:17.280 align:middle line:84%
in what actually happens to
you in day-to-day experience.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:20.700 align:middle line:84%
You will find the
positive mind idea

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:24.270 align:middle line:84%
running the gamut from
New Age spiritual centers,

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:27.900 align:middle line:84%
to evangelical churches,
to high schools in Harlem.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.760 align:middle line:90%
And I have been to them all.

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And you could parachute down
in any one of these places

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:36.270 align:middle line:84%
and if you've had a
moment where there's

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:40.560 align:middle line:84%
been an inspirational book or
inspirational idea coming out

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:43.890 align:middle line:84%
of the positive thinking
movement that's touched you

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:47.190 align:middle line:84%
and you meet someone else
has had the same experience,

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:50.310 align:middle line:84%
you will find this
tremendous intimate bond

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:53.520 align:middle line:84%
that you have with
that person right away.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:59.310 align:middle line:10%
Americans, more than any
other people or culture today,

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:04.170 align:middle line:10%
think in terms of our minds
as a causative instrument.

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:06.060 align:middle line:90%
That's new-- that's new.

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:10.200 align:middle line:84%
There was always a manners and
morals literature in America,

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.080 align:middle line:84%
in the American colonies,
going back to Ben Franklin

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.280 align:middle line:90%
and before.

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.820 align:middle line:10%
But it was really in
the mid-19th century

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.190 align:middle line:10%
with the movement called
transcendentalism,

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:21.840 align:middle line:10%
with the mental
healing movement,

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:26.130 align:middle line:10%
that Americans began to grok to
the idea that what you think,

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:30.600 align:middle line:10%
that your attitude is an
actual engine of experience.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:34.690 align:middle line:10%
And you'll find that outlook
in other parts of the world,

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:40.200 align:middle line:10%
but I can guarantee you in
Moscow, or Paris, or London,

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.900 align:middle line:10%
people are going to
look at you funny

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.060 align:middle line:10%
if you say that, unless
they specifically,

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.490 align:middle line:10%
have cultivated their own
interests in these beliefs.

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:50.040 align:middle line:84%
But in almost any
place in America--

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:55.050 align:middle line:84%
small town, inner city, place
of wealth, a place of want--

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:57.300 align:middle line:84%
you will find people
agreeing with that attitude.

00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:59.370 align:middle line:90%
That unites all of us.

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:02.370 align:middle line:84%
So you can't really tell
the story of America

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:06.060 align:middle line:84%
without understanding the story
of positive mind metaphysics

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:10.880 align:middle line:84%
because it is the back
story of our country.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.046 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make us
innocent of everything.

00:20:13.046 --> 00:20:14.670 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
there haven't been

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:16.950 align:middle line:90%
grotesque departures from it.

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:19.860 align:middle line:84%
But you can't understand
the American mindset

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:22.220 align:middle line:84%
without understanding the
positive thinking mindset.

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:23.020 align:middle line:90%
They're married.

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:30.690 align:middle line:90%


00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:32.880 align:middle line:10%
"Mind as Builder" is
a new book that I've

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:36.150 align:middle line:10%
done on the positive mind
philosophy of Edgar Cayce.

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:38.280 align:middle line:84%
Cayce was a medical
clairvoyant who

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.830 align:middle line:84%
lived in the first half
of the 20th century.

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:43.140 align:middle line:84%
He would go into
trance states and he

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:45.780 align:middle line:84%
would diagnose and
prescribe cures

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:50.040 align:middle line:84%
for diseases of people
he had never met-- often,

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:53.220 align:middle line:90%
who were many, many miles away.

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And there's a record of more
than 14,000 trance readings

00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:58.660 align:middle line:90%
that Cayce gave this way.

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And in many cases, people claim
that they had positive results.

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:06.600 align:middle line:84%
Cayce also had a set of
psychological teachings.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:10.890 align:middle line:84%
He used the expression, the
spiritual is the life, the mind

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:13.830 align:middle line:84%
is the builder, the
physical is the result.

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:17.655 align:middle line:84%
So Cayce shared in this idea
that thoughts are causative.

00:21:17.655 --> 00:21:21.210 align:middle line:84%
That thoughts make things
happen physically in our lives,

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:22.860 align:middle line:90%
contributing to illness.

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:24.360 align:middle line:90%
Contributing to relationships.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.160 align:middle line:90%
Contributing to happiness.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.290 align:middle line:84%
But Cayce had an
interesting outlook--

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:29.790 align:middle line:90%
which is one that I share--

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:33.900 align:middle line:84%
which is, again, people get
very hung up on this question--

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.700 align:middle line:90%
I've thought positively.

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:36.960 align:middle line:90%
I've used affirmations.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.640 align:middle line:90%
I've used visualizations.

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.420 align:middle line:90%
And I got sick, what went wrong?

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.420 align:middle line:90%
What did I do wrong?

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.940 align:middle line:10%
And my outlook is you
didn't do anything wrong.

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:51.000 align:middle line:10%
The fact is we have misled
ourselves and we have misused

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.070 align:middle line:10%
these teachings-- at times--

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:56.310 align:middle line:10%
by rushing to the
hasty conclusion

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:59.050 align:middle line:10%
that the mind
controls everything.

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:01.200 align:middle line:90%
Why is that outlook necessary?

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.280 align:middle line:84%
I can believe in the
law of attraction.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:06.750 align:middle line:84%
I can practice the idea
that thoughts are causative.

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And that is a very sacred
central belief in my life,

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.770 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't mean that
it needs to be exclusive.

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:17.600 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that it's the
only thing that's going on.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.770 align:middle line:84%
So that if people are caught
up in catastrophic events--

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:23.070 align:middle line:84%
whether it's an
earthquake in Haiti,

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:27.120 align:middle line:84%
or monsoon in the Philippines,
or 9/11 in New York City--

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:30.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we should ever
talk about events like that

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:34.260 align:middle line:84%
as though we really understand
them from a mental perspective,

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:38.250 align:middle line:84%
unless, first of all, we've been
through those things ourselves.

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:42.660 align:middle line:84%
The only empiricism that we
have on the spiritual path

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:43.980 align:middle line:90%
is from within.

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.210 align:middle line:90%
What's my own experience?

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:47.040 align:middle line:90%
What's my own conduct?

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:50.040 align:middle line:84%
What's been the
result of my thoughts?

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:54.180 align:middle line:84%
Inner experience really is
the data and the empiricism

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:55.470 align:middle line:90%
of the spiritual path.

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:57.450 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, I
think it's important

00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:02.070 align:middle line:84%
not to talk in some self-certain
way about the kinds of events

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:03.720 align:middle line:90%
that we've never been through.

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:07.140 align:middle line:84%
Many people who live in
America, who live in the West

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.530 align:middle line:84%
have never been through
catastrophes on that scale.

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think if one
judges people who

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:15.090 align:middle line:84%
have been through
those catastrophes

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:18.360 align:middle line:84%
as though their minds were
vibrating on that level

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:21.510 align:middle line:84%
or something like that,
that's just throwing a stone.

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:24.480 align:middle line:84%
That's just presuming that
my neighbor did something

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.710 align:middle line:90%
to bring this upon himself.

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:27.060 align:middle line:90%
And I don't believe that.

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:30.000 align:middle line:84%
So I find that challenge
within Cayce's teachings,

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.190 align:middle line:84%
within his positive
mind philosophy.

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:36.690 align:middle line:84%
Cayce taught that we do
live under very concrete

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:37.680 align:middle line:90%
physical laws--

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.500 align:middle line:90%
mortality alone tells us that.

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.850 align:middle line:90%
These bodies decline.

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:44.670 align:middle line:90%
These bodies go away.

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:47.310 align:middle line:90%
That is an indelible fact.

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:50.070 align:middle line:84%
So to say that
everything is mind,

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:51.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't think is
quite sufficient.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.150 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't take away from
the challenge of the law

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:56.350 align:middle line:10%
of attraction, it enriches it.

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:59.100 align:middle line:10%
Because what happens is people
approach these mind power

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:04.050 align:middle line:10%
philosophies and maybe events go
exactly the opposite than what

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:05.250 align:middle line:10%
they are visualizing.

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And then, they feel guilty,
and they feel dejected,

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:09.240 align:middle line:84%
and they want to
drift away, or they

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.650 align:middle line:90%
get angry or what have you.

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:12.280 align:middle line:90%
None of that needs to happen.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.710 align:middle line:90%
None of that needs to happen.

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:17.910 align:middle line:84%
We can ask ourselves what
myriad array of forces

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:19.220 align:middle line:90%
are we experiencing?

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:22.560 align:middle line:90%
And if-- if--

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.300 align:middle line:90%
mind is the ultimate reality--

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:27.880 align:middle line:84%
and I believe that may be true,
that may very well be true--

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:31.200 align:middle line:84%
we also have to remember
that laws and forces can

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:35.130 align:middle line:84%
be felt very inconsistently
based on our vantage point.

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:36.630 align:middle line:90%
Gravity is a law.

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:38.820 align:middle line:84%
We understand that
gravity operates

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:41.550 align:middle line:84%
under certain principles
that are constant.

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:43.140 align:middle line:84%
But you're going to
experience gravity

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:45.340 align:middle line:90%
very differently on the moon--

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:48.420 align:middle line:84%
for example-- than
you would on Jupiter.

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:51.270 align:middle line:84%
On the moon, you can
jump 10 feet in the air.

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:55.440 align:middle line:84%
On Jupiter, you would
be so heavy that you

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.080 align:middle line:84%
would be crushed
under your own weight

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.270 align:middle line:84%
because there are
also laws of mass.

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:03.330 align:middle line:84%
There's greater mass and there's
a greater gravitational force.

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:05.430 align:middle line:90%
It's the same law going on.

00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:07.140 align:middle line:84%
It's the ultimate
truth, but we're

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:09.720 align:middle line:84%
going to experience different
ways based on our vantage

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:10.520 align:middle line:90%
point.

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:13.740 align:middle line:84%
So I want people to
be free to experiment

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:16.470 align:middle line:84%
with and use these
ideas without feeling

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:23.920 align:middle line:84%
limited by this A plus B equals
C equation, where oh gee,

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.340 align:middle line:84%
if I don't experience C,
I did something wrong.

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:28.920 align:middle line:84%
You didn't do anything
wrong, you're experimenting.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:32.770 align:middle line:84%
So I use Cayce's teachings
as a jumping off point

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:37.330 align:middle line:84%
to try to expand our
ideas of how we can use

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:39.593 align:middle line:90%
the positive mind philosophy.

00:25:39.593 --> 00:25:41.908 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:41.908 --> 00:25:44.230 align:middle line:90%


00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:47.200 align:middle line:84%
I try to say the
same thing wherever

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:51.070 align:middle line:84%
I go, which is that it is a
basic human question-- maybe,

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:53.920 align:middle line:84%
the basic human question--
to ask, what is it

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.030 align:middle line:90%
around the next corner?

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:56.650 align:middle line:90%
What is it just over that hill?

00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:58.360 align:middle line:90%
What's going on over there?

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.250 align:middle line:84%
I want to understand
how things work

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:01.390 align:middle line:90%
and where things come from.

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:05.230 align:middle line:10%
And I'm attracted to esoteric
and alternative spirituality

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:07.480 align:middle line:10%
because those spiritual
movements more

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:12.280 align:middle line:10%
than any other in modern life
have presented practical ideas

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.300 align:middle line:10%
and methods to the individual.

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And if my work
can help people, I

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:20.500 align:middle line:84%
hope it will give them
a sense of options.

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.660 align:middle line:84%
I hope it will give
them a sense of freedom

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:24.520 align:middle line:90%
to experiment with these things.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.250 align:middle line:84%
I hope that if they've
had a disappointment

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:29.980 align:middle line:84%
in their experiments,
they can realize

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:33.070 align:middle line:84%
that that disappointment
is not something that they

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:34.720 align:middle line:90%
should blame themselves for.

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.940 align:middle line:84%
Or is not reason to
pack up their bags

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.170 align:middle line:90%
and go somewhere else.

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:39.460 align:middle line:90%
But stick around.

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:40.270 align:middle line:90%
Stay with us.

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:43.120 align:middle line:84%
That disappointment is part
of a lifelong experiment.

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:46.660 align:middle line:84%
That's the beauty
of your existence.

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:49.750 align:middle line:84%
We are here-- if we're
here for anything--

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:53.020 align:middle line:84%
to be generative, to
experiment, to probe.

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:56.260 align:middle line:84%
So how can you have
experimentation

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:59.140 align:middle line:84%
without a null
experiment at some point?

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:01.360 align:middle line:84%
Without what looks like
a failure at some point?

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.640 align:middle line:84%
That may be the stepping
stone to some extraordinary

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:06.249 align:middle line:84%
discovery, including
a discovery that

00:27:06.249 --> 00:27:07.790 align:middle line:84%
could help the search
of other people

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:11.800 align:middle line:84%
because we need to find out
under what conditions do

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.900 align:middle line:90%
certain spiritual ideas work?

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Under what conditions do
they not seem to work?

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:18.100 align:middle line:90%
I want people to be practical.

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:19.600 align:middle line:90%
I want people to be probing.

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.700 align:middle line:84%
I want people to
be experimental.

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And above all, I want people
to be civil, and meticulous,

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:29.140 align:middle line:84%
and decorous in how
they think and how

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:31.000 align:middle line:84%
they talk to one
another because that

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.060 align:middle line:84%
has enormous impact
on your experience.

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:46.539 align:middle line:90%
