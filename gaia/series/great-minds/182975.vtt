I am Swiss.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.820 align:middle line:84%
I was educated in Switzerland
as a strict Catholic,

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.690 align:middle line:84%
in a boarding school
led by Jesuits.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.630 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I was in
deep believer in God.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.930 align:middle line:84%
I still am a believer in
God, although, I do not

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.530 align:middle line:90%
know what God really is.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.510 align:middle line:84%
But when I was a boy,
17-years-old, God, for me,

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.030 align:middle line:90%
had to have some qualities.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.040 align:middle line:84%
For example, God
makes no mistake.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.220 align:middle line:84%
God does not need a vehicle in
which to move around from point

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.500 align:middle line:90%
A to point B. God is all over.

Now, in this boarding
school, we have

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.040 align:middle line:84%
to translate parts of the
Bible from Latin into Greek,

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.660 align:middle line:90%
and from Greek to German.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Then I learned
that in the Bible,

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.190 align:middle line:84%
the God, which is
described there,

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.760 align:middle line:84%
he uses a vehicle
to move around.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.120 align:middle line:84%
He descends on the holy
mountain with smoke,

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.060 align:middle line:84%
and fire, and trembling,
and loud noise, and so on,

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.320 align:middle line:90%
and he made some mistakes.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.720 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, I had doubts
in my own Catholic education,

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.100 align:middle line:84%
and I simply wanted to find
out if other communities

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.800 align:middle line:84%
in antiquity have
similar traditions

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.050 align:middle line:84%
than we have it
from the Christian

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.610 align:middle line:90%

I was a member of a band.

on the holy mountain,

So Moses constructs a

descends with smoke, and fire,
and rumbling, and loud noise.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.640 align:middle line:84%
does not need to construct,
first, a gate for safety.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Does not come down with smoke,
and fire, and loud noise.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.870 align:middle line:10%
So I had my doubts in
that boarding school,

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.960 align:middle line:10%
and of course, I was talking
to this to my professors.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.160 align:middle line:90%
And they were not afraid.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.830 align:middle line:84%
They said Erich, if you
think in this direction,

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.880 align:middle line:84%
you should learn much more
about the old scriptures

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.200 align:middle line:90%
before you discuss this.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And they told me, Erich, go to
father whatever the name was,

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.280 align:middle line:90%
and ask for a Book of Enoch.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.900 align:middle line:90%
I asked for a Book of Enoch.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.690 align:middle line:90%

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.650 align:middle line:10%
disappeared in a fiery
chariot from this planet,

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.820 align:middle line:10%

Now, roughly 180 years
ago, a British explorer

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.210 align:middle line:84%
came to Ethiopia,
and in Ethiopia, he

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.730 align:middle line:90%
came into an old library.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And in this old library, he
found the book with the title

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.870 align:middle line:90%
The Book of Enoch.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.330 align:middle line:10%
Slowly, he translated
the Book of Enoch

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.520 align:middle line:10%
from the Ethiopian
language into English.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.260 align:middle line:10%
Later, from English into German.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.140 align:middle line:10%
And I was a boy, I had
the German translation

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.970 align:middle line:10%
before my eyes, and I
was completely shocked

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.670 align:middle line:10%
because Enoch speaks
in the first person.

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.100 align:middle line:90%
An eyewitness.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.700 align:middle line:90%
Not in the third person.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.490 align:middle line:90%
He says he was 12 years old.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.190 align:middle line:84%
The whole community of the
village wanted to go to sleep.

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Then they hear the
noise in the sky.

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.640 align:middle line:90%
They saw a light in the sky.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.910 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
the light fell down

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.170 align:middle line:84%
to the earth, and all the
inhabitants of the village

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.970 align:middle line:90%
runaway.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.950 align:middle line:90%
They were afraid, except Enoch.

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.890 align:middle line:84%
He says I stood there
in astonishment.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.040 align:middle line:84%
Then, all of a sudden, two
beings came close to me

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.830 align:middle line:90%
in glittering clothes.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And he says, clearly,
these two beings

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.830 align:middle line:90%
did not look like humans.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.530 align:middle line:10%
They did not breath like humans.

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:05.970 align:middle line:90%
They breathed differently.

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.130 align:middle line:84%
I never saw beings
like this on Earth.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.150 align:middle line:90%
He is afraid.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Enoch, finally, he fells
on this ground too.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:17.640 align:middle line:84%
Then, somebody picks him up,
and says to him, "Son of humans,

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.170 align:middle line:90%
don't be afraid.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.640 align:middle line:90%
We won't hurt you."

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And then follows
the whole story.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.930 align:middle line:84%
An incredible story
in the Book of Enoch.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.230 align:middle line:84%
So I was completely
fascinated of Enoch.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And later, of course, I learned
that we find similar stories

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.330 align:middle line:90%
in the Maya texts.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.850 align:middle line:10%
The same thing happen
in the old Indian text.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.660 align:middle line:90%
Always one person is taken out.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Also they learned the
language of the strangers.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.380 align:middle line:10%
Enoch receives a writing device.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.720 align:middle line:90%
Then they dictate in books--

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.550 align:middle line:84%
books about science, astronomy,
calendar, engineering,

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.280 align:middle line:90%
and all this.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, the critics cannot
say, this is ridiculous.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.640 align:middle line:84%
How should extraterrestrials
speak Enoch's language?

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.520 align:middle line:84%
In our time, our
ethnologists, they

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.060 align:middle line:84%
were visiting some tribe
from the upper Amazon River

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.040 align:middle line:84%
or maybe on the
Upper Nile River.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.380 align:middle line:10%
It was never a
problem of learning

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.440 align:middle line:10%
the language of the natives
within a short period.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.020 align:middle line:84%
After five, six months,
our ethnologists

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.060 align:middle line:84%
understood the
languages of the tribe.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.170 align:middle line:90%


00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:26.790 align:middle line:84%
These extraterrestrials,
they behaved themselves

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:28.710 align:middle line:90%
like ethnologists would do.

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:32.220 align:middle line:84%
They studied their group
before visiting them.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.520 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not shocked at all
if the stranger speaks

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.220 align:middle line:90%
to Enoch in Enoch's language.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And the stranger says to
Enoch, don't be afraid.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And he says, if you wish,
you can come with us.

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:45.200 align:middle line:90%
We teach you.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:51.300 align:middle line:84%
Enoch says yes, I
wish to be teached.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.220 align:middle line:90%
He receives an aura.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Something like the same
spacesuit which they had on.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:57.830 align:middle line:90%
Then they go up.

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:01.980 align:middle line:84%
He describes over the Earth,
I saw the round Earth,

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:03.840 align:middle line:90%
and I saw gigantic things.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.840 align:middle line:84%
He compares them with
brilliance, with diamonds,

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:07.740 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:10.200 align:middle line:90%
Doors open, doors close.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.500 align:middle line:90%
They go in there.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.040 align:middle line:84%
He passes through
strange gardens

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.020 align:middle line:84%
with vegetables
and flowers, which

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.030 align:middle line:90%
he had never seen on Earth.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.220 align:middle line:84%
Then he comes into a
big room, and there

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:22.560 align:middle line:84%
in the center of the
room, there was a throne.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And on this throne, the
highest was sitting.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:29.210 align:middle line:84%
When the three came in there,
two of the extraterrestrials

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.770 align:middle line:84%
and Enoch, the
highest stands up,

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:35.760 align:middle line:84%
walks a few steps toward
Enoch, shakes his hand,

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:40.539 align:middle line:84%
and says to him, welcome
here at our place.

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:43.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I just told you is
part of the Book of Enoch,

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:49.510 align:middle line:84%
but not the way I told it to
you because some 160 years ago,

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.750 align:middle line:84%
when Enoch was translated first
from the Ethiopian language

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:55.510 align:middle line:84%
into English, all these
brilliant professors

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:58.900 align:middle line:84%
at that time, they knew
nothing about space travel,

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.960 align:middle line:84%
nothing about space ships,
nothing about flying.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.170 align:middle line:84%
So they believed we have
to see all these things

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:06.910 align:middle line:90%
in a religious context.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:10.210 align:middle line:84%
So the translation is
different to what I say.

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:18.510 align:middle line:90%


00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:22.390 align:middle line:84%
I am a deep believer in
God, and all these things--

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:24.710 align:middle line:90%
what is handed down--

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:28.050 align:middle line:90%
is not belonging to God.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.880 align:middle line:90%
God is omnipotent.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.810 align:middle line:84%
Imagine for a second that
my idea would be correct.

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:37.330 align:middle line:84%
So we were visited by
beings from outer space.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:41.140 align:middle line:84%
The next question is where
did these visitors come from?

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:42.460 align:middle line:90%
What is their evolution?

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.950 align:middle line:84%
Have they been influenced
by another solar system?

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:47.090 align:middle line:84%
OK, where did the
other come from?

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:47.980 align:middle line:90%
And so on.

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.950 align:middle line:84%
You can play it back
again for thousands,

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:52.510 align:middle line:90%
hundreds of thousands of years.

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Finally, you arrive
to a starting point,

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.750 align:middle line:84%
where in every respect with
region, you have to confess

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:00.910 align:middle line:90%
and to say, here is God.

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:02.140 align:middle line:90%
Here is the beginning.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.400 align:middle line:90%
Here is the spirit.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:04.990 align:middle line:90%
So you never lose God.

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:07.210 align:middle line:90%
I never lost my God.

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:10.870 align:middle line:84%
I am one of these figures
who still pray every evening,

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.650 align:middle line:84%
but my prayer really
changed completely.

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Educated as a
Christian, of course,

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:20.710 align:middle line:84%
I was praying to the holy mother
Mary or to Jesus and the cross.

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:23.920 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, I prayed
to what I call God.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.340 align:middle line:84%
All true, I have no
definition of God.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:33.640 align:middle line:84%
I read quite some intelligent
books about what is God.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.730 align:middle line:84%
None of these scientists was
able to make a definition

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:39.440 align:middle line:90%
of God, but our little spirit--

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.070 align:middle line:84%
our little
understanding says there

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:43.720 align:middle line:90%
is a beginning of the universe.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:48.650 align:middle line:84%
There must be creation, and
this is what we call God.

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:52.411 align:middle line:84%
I call it today, the
spirit of the universe.

00:10:52.411 --> 00:11:03.490 align:middle line:90%


00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:09.550 align:middle line:84%
First, I read as many books
as possible, concerning

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:11.570 align:middle line:90%
the beginning of the religions.

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:15.490 align:middle line:84%
So how did the Sumerian
religion begin?

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:18.940 align:middle line:84%
How did the Egyptian
religion begin?

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:23.050 align:middle line:90%
How did the Maya religion begin?

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And then being critical, and
saying what's going on here?

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:32.740 align:middle line:84%
Give you an example every
culture has its calendar,

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.230 align:middle line:84%
and every calendar
has a starting point.

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:36.040 align:middle line:90%
We're Christian.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.770 align:middle line:84%
We have a Christian calendar,
and the starting point

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:41.530 align:middle line:90%
was the birth of Jesus Christ.

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:45.400 align:middle line:84%
So the starting point is
always very, very important

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.400 align:middle line:84%
for the certain culture
because you just don't

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.980 align:middle line:90%
start the calender for nothing.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.050 align:middle line:84%
The same thing happened
in Central America.

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:54.850 align:middle line:84%
There's the calendar
of the Maya,

00:11:54.850 --> 00:12:02.200 align:middle line:84%
and the Mayan calendar starts
on August 11th 3114 BC.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.040 align:middle line:84%
So asking myself,
what was the reason?

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:10.120 align:middle line:84%
Why I have they started their
Maya calendar on August 11,

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.250 align:middle line:90%
3114 BC?

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:14.810 align:middle line:90%
What was so important?

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:18.200 align:middle line:84%
When the Spanish conqueror
arrived in Central America,

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.350 align:middle line:84%
they found thousands
and thousands

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:22.720 align:middle line:90%
of books written by the Maya.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:28.310 align:middle line:84%
They destroyed them all, except
three books which have left.

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:32.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, now just imagine in
our society, if for a war

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:35.450 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, every Bible
would be destroyed,

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:38.650 align:middle line:84%
but the priest and the
believers in Christianity,

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:42.470 align:middle line:84%
they know the context of
the Bible in their brain.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:45.340 align:middle line:84%
So they start to
rewrite the Bible.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.710 align:middle line:84%
The same thing happened
in Central America.

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:49.870 align:middle line:90%
All the books were destroyed.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:54.430 align:middle line:84%
The priests re-wrote
their old knowledge,

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:57.680 align:middle line:84%
and so the Chilam
Balam book happened,

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.190 align:middle line:84%
and in the Chilam Balam
book, one of the priests

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:03.340 align:middle line:84%
explains why have
our forefathers

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:08.380 align:middle line:84%
started the calendar of the
Maya on August 11, 3114 BC.

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.580 align:middle line:84%
Because that was the
day when the Gods

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:14.230 align:middle line:90%
descended from the firmament.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:17.830 align:middle line:90%
That was the starting point.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:20.220 align:middle line:90%
So the next step was archeology.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.830 align:middle line:84%
First, you look in
archaeological textbooks.

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:26.700 align:middle line:84%
You see what discovery were
made, and then you go there.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.460 align:middle line:84%
I was in every
archaeological place

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:32.510 align:middle line:84%
where I have written about,
and not just like a tourist.

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:37.680 align:middle line:84%
I was sometimes there
for months or weeks.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, in Central America,
they found a secret groove.

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:43.300 align:middle line:90%
A tomb with a stone plate.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:48.510 align:middle line:84%
Quite a block, weighing 10
pounds, and on this stone

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:49.720 align:middle line:90%
block, an engraving.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.610 align:middle line:90%
Incredible engraving.

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:55.690 align:middle line:84%
You see something like a frame,
and in the center of the frame,

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:59.350 align:middle line:84%
a young man is sitting,
bending forward, almost

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:01.660 align:middle line:90%
like a motor racing cyclist.

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.600 align:middle line:10%
You clearly see he has an
oxygen mask on his nose.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.360 align:middle line:10%
He uses his two hands to
manipulate some control.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.920 align:middle line:10%
You see the upper hand.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:09.730 align:middle line:10%
His fingers.

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:11.772 align:middle line:10%
The lower hand with the
four fingers in the back.

00:14:11.772 --> 00:14:13.430 align:middle line:90%
He's winding up something.

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:16.540 align:middle line:84%
He's sitting on a chair,
and outside the frame,

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.660 align:middle line:90%
you see a linking flame.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:24.320 align:middle line:84%
I was completely fascinated
because the stone was chiseled

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.300 align:middle line:90%
unknown thousands of years ago.

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.160 align:middle line:90%


00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.670 align:middle line:84%
So I was there for
at least 12 days,

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.610 align:middle line:84%
talking with
archaeologists, and finally,

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:35.420 align:middle line:90%
bring it into my books.

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:39.790 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of
the optical proofs

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:42.100 align:middle line:84%
to say we were
influenced by God.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:50.680 align:middle line:90%


00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.960 align:middle line:84%
The difference between
my point of view,

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.710 align:middle line:84%
and that point of view
of an archaeologist

00:14:56.710 --> 00:15:00.760 align:middle line:84%
is the archaeologist does not
take mythology for serious.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.270 align:middle line:84%
They think mythology
is all nonsense,

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:06.700 align:middle line:84%
and I take these mythologies
and these religious books

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:07.870 align:middle line:90%
for honest.

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:11.040 align:middle line:90%


00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.930 align:middle line:84%
I say these writers, some
thousands of years ago,

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:16.830 align:middle line:84%
they did not tell us
science fiction story.

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:20.610 align:middle line:84%
You know, when the first man
started to learn writing,

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:21.840 align:middle line:90%
cuneiform learning.

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:26.400 align:middle line:84%
So only a few people
were able to write.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.290 align:middle line:84%
They did not write
science fiction.

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:30.060 align:middle line:84%
The high priest
would come looking.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.220 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing here?

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:32.020 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:34.850 align:middle line:90%


00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:39.230 align:middle line:84%
Many mythologies are just fairy
tales, but not all of them,

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:42.780 align:middle line:84%
and mythologies you
can never take precise.

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:48.620 align:middle line:84%
It's not a scientific story,
but it's the common knowledge

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:49.700 align:middle line:90%
of the people.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:50.750 align:middle line:90%
What they knew.

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:54.350 align:middle line:84%
There was always a core
of truth in mythology,

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:58.400 align:middle line:84%
and you can easily separate
which one is the truths,

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.590 align:middle line:84%
and which one is
just an allegory.

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:04.130 align:middle line:90%


00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:05.930 align:middle line:90%
Let me explain you this.

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:07.760 align:middle line:84%
Enoch, again, he's
in the spaceship.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.210 align:middle line:90%
He learned the language.

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:12.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the teachers
says to Enoch, human,

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:14.410 align:middle line:90%
look out of the window.

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:16.430 align:middle line:84%
Do you see this little
light out there?

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:19.620 align:middle line:84%
You humans, you
call it the moon,

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:21.980 align:middle line:84%
but the moon has
no light by itself.

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.590 align:middle line:84%
The moon receives his
light from the sun,

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:27.420 align:middle line:84%
and then the extraterrestrials
explains to Enoch

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:30.970 align:middle line:84%
why is the moon sometimes
full in light, bright, shiny.

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:33.180 align:middle line:90%
Only why it appears.

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:36.020 align:middle line:84%
So this is
astronomical knowledge.

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:38.000 align:middle line:90%
This is not fiction.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And then he explains
Enoch our calendar.

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:43.460 align:middle line:84%

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:58.950 align:middle line:84%
So maybe we are on the wrong
track fighting against CO2,

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:01.570 align:middle line:84%
hoping that this would
change our climate.

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:04.180 align:middle line:84%
So we can ask the
extraterrestrials.

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:06.740 align:middle line:84%
We have a problem,
climate change.

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:09.340 align:middle line:84%
What can we do
against to help it?

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they teach
us it's not CO2.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.962 align:middle line:90%
It's some seem different.

00:25:13.962 --> 00:25:15.170 align:middle line:90%
You have to fight against it.

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:25.050 align:middle line:90%


00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:29.190 align:middle line:84%
40 years from now, I
was invited by NASA.

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:31.150 align:middle line:90%
It was a secret speech.

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:35.760 align:middle line:84%
Both parties agreed that
none would go to public.

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.830 align:middle line:84%
All the high professors
in rocketry were there.

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:41.410 align:middle line:10%
In that speech, I
shortly also speak

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:44.033 align:middle line:10%
about the prophet Ezekiel
in the Old Testament.

00:25:44.033 --> 00:25:47.420 align:middle line:90%


00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:49.670 align:middle line:10%
Later, we were all sitting
together at dinner,

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:51.710 align:middle line:10%
and then the chief
of the construction

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:55.490 align:middle line:10%
of NASA at that time,
Mr. Josef Blumrich,

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:56.490 align:middle line:10%
came to me at the table.

00:25:56.490 --> 00:26:00.020 align:middle line:10%
Said Erich, you are the
first person who brings me

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:02.180 align:middle line:10%
to this prophet Ezekiel.

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:03.650 align:middle line:90%
I never read of this.

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:06.150 align:middle line:84%
I will read this
in the next weeks.

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:06.980 align:middle line:90%
He did it.

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:12.420 align:middle line:84%
He read Ezekiel, and
he became astonished,

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:16.350 align:middle line:84%
and started to take
Ezekiel seriously.

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Then two other NASA scientists
came to him-- to Blumrich,

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:22.800 align:middle line:84%
and said what are you doing
with the Bible on your desk?

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.800 align:middle line:84%
He said, look, there's a
prophet calling Ezekiel.

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.900 align:middle line:84%
He describes a vehicle
which came down.

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:31.560 align:middle line:84%
We can reconstruct,
recalculate, what this vehicle

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:33.030 align:middle line:90%
must have looked like.

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:37.660 align:middle line:84%
Slowly, piece by piece, they
took every phrase of Ezekiel

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:40.650 align:middle line:84%
seriously, not just
a few examples,

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:44.320 align:middle line:84%
and they reconstructed
the spaceship of Ezekiel.

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.490 align:middle line:10%
Mr. Jo Blumrich, Chief of the
NASA Constructing Department,

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:48.720 align:middle line:10%
came out with the book.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:52.050 align:middle line:10%
The English title was "The
Spaceship of Ezekiel."

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:56.790 align:middle line:84%
In the foreword, he
confesses he started his work

00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:58.830 align:middle line:90%
against Erich von Daniken.

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:02.880 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to disprove
this idea of Ezekiel,

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.630 align:middle line:84%
but he found on the
contrary, was true,

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:08.040 align:middle line:90%
and he was very happy with his.

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:11.740 align:middle line:90%


00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:14.950 align:middle line:84%
Still today, there
are a lot of skeptics

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:18.340 align:middle line:84%
who think whatever Erich von
Daniken writes is garbage,

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:22.630 align:middle line:84%
is nonsense, and I love the
discussions with skeptics

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:25.630 align:middle line:84%
because they lose anyhow
in all discussion.

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And whenever I come
together with skeptics

00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:31.040 align:middle line:84%
who think I'm an
idiot, I ask them,

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.200 align:middle line:84%
which book-- which of
your titles have you read.

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.750 align:middle line:90%
They say none.

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:35.770 align:middle line:90%
They read nothing.

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:39.280 align:middle line:10%
They simply knew in
advance it's all nonsense.

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.830 align:middle line:10%
Of course, I learned
from the skeptics too.

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:44.890 align:middle line:10%
In many cases, the critics
were correct, and I had to say

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:47.980 align:middle line:10%
oh, come on, this point
of view makes more sense

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:52.000 align:middle line:10%
than my point of view, which
is normally the discussion.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.760 align:middle line:84%
But roughly, the
extraterrestrials

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:57.010 align:middle line:84%
were here some
thousands of years ago.

00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:59.980 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestors at that time could
not understand what it was.

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.260 align:middle line:90%
They called it the gods.

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:06.400 align:middle line:84%
Roughly, this story I
can prove by indication.

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:13.190 align:middle line:90%


00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:15.840 align:middle line:90%
There are no gods, in reality.

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:18.020 align:middle line:84%
So it's all a
misunderstanding, but they

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:21.290 align:middle line:90%
believed these are the gods.

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:23.720 align:middle line:84%
That's why the
so-called gods entered

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:27.140 align:middle line:84%
into the big religions,
the mythologies, legends,

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:28.310 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:31.880 align:middle line:10%
It's all a misunderstanding.

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, my life has
changed because I'm

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:37.640 align:middle line:84%
an enthusiastic man, and
I'm a man full of curiosity.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.410 align:middle line:90%
I always have new questions.

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:42.110 align:middle line:90%


00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:45.310 align:middle line:84%
I still have no idea where did
these extraterrestrials come

00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:50.470 align:middle line:84%
from, which solar system, how
far away, with what technology?

00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:53.160 align:middle line:90%


00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.610 align:middle line:90%
What was finally the purpose?

00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:59.300 align:middle line:10%
Why have they chosen to come to
our planet or our solar system?

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:03.030 align:middle line:84%
There are still hundreds of
open questions, which I've tried

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:04.330 align:middle line:90%
to come closer and closer.

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:08.320 align:middle line:90%


00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.590 align:middle line:84%
I've found brilliant
indications to support

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:13.600 align:middle line:84%
that extraterrestrials
were here,

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:16.600 align:middle line:84%
but I never found
a conclusive proof.

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Until today, I am
missing an object.

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:22.390 align:middle line:84%
An object which is not
from this planet, which

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:26.230 align:middle line:84%
I could present proudly with
the scientific community.

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:28.240 align:middle line:84%
This object is not
from our planet.

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.290 align:middle line:90%
So help me out.

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:31.600 align:middle line:90%
What is the situation?

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:35.320 align:middle line:84%
But I know such objects do
exist because they were here,

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.330 align:middle line:84%
and we have descriptions,
for example.

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:39.100 align:middle line:84%
In the Bible, we
have descriptions

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:43.790 align:middle line:84%
of the Ark of the Covenant,
and the Ark of the Covenant

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:47.480 align:middle line:90%
was not a human object.

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:48.960 align:middle line:10%
It was an
extraterrestrial object.

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:50.870 align:middle line:10%
So we know that some
of these objects

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:52.830 align:middle line:10%
exist, but we have
never found them.

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:56.520 align:middle line:90%


00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:58.920 align:middle line:84%
In many other fields,
I know nothing.

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:02.580 align:middle line:84%
I am just a student, happy
to learn from the others.

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:05.320 align:middle line:84%
But in my field, I
know quite a lot.

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:08.280 align:middle line:84%
So I can debate, and
that makes me happy.

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:11.290 align:middle line:84%
New paradigms, new
way of thinking,

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:15.100 align:middle line:84%
a new way of curiosity, a
new way of question mark.

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:16.620 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm
bringing forward,

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:18.870 align:middle line:84%
and I hope that
society continues.

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:22.150 align:middle line:90%


00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:24.910 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime,
I hope some of us

00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:28.130 align:middle line:90%
have learned we are not alone.

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:30.250 align:middle line:84%
There are other
societies out there.

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:34.180 align:middle line:84%
We have learned to become
a little more humble.

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:37.170 align:middle line:84%
We have learned that
space travel is possible,

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:38.430 align:middle line:90%
even from star to star.

00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:42.800 align:middle line:90%


00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:47.480 align:middle line:10%
We have learned that it is
possible to change the cell--

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.590 align:middle line:10%
the DNA in the cell.

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:54.580 align:middle line:84%
So it is possible
to create something.

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:57.720 align:middle line:84%
I am sure we are the
product of evolution.

00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:01.920 align:middle line:84%
We cannot deny evolution,
but there was always,

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:05.550 align:middle line:84%
in the past thousands of years,
somebody who did something

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:07.140 align:middle line:90%
in our evolution.

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:09.990 align:middle line:84%
Extraterrestrials,
from time to time,

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:12.790 align:middle line:84%
made a little changing
in our evolution.

00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:17.050 align:middle line:84%
So in the future, our genetics
are brilliant personalities.

00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:21.030 align:middle line:84%
They will find out
this in the genes.

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:25.110 align:middle line:84%
Soon as we notice, we all
are part of evolution,

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:26.760 align:middle line:90%
but not only.

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:29.760 align:middle line:84%
We are a little part of
extraterrestrials too.

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.265 align:middle line:90%
That's why we understand them.

00:31:31.265 --> 00:31:33.390 align:middle line:84%
That's why we will understand
each other very well.

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:39.090 align:middle line:90%


00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:42.050 align:middle line:84%
So my latest book
in English language

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:44.480 align:middle line:84%
is a sequel of
"Chariots of the Gods."

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.670 align:middle line:84%
I continue with
"Chariots of the Gods."

00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:50.450 align:middle line:84%
I say what happened
in the past 50 years?

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:53.070 align:middle line:84%
What happened and
where do we stand now?

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:54.870 align:middle line:90%
And it comes close to it.

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:57.380 align:middle line:10%
We are under observation.

00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:03.570 align:middle line:10%
We have some UFO case which
we should take for serious.

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:06.030 align:middle line:84%
That's the content
of my new book.

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:07.510 align:middle line:90%
Be prepared.

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:10.980 align:middle line:10%
We are under observation,
and sooner or later, they

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:12.540 align:middle line:10%
will show up again.

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:17.360 align:middle line:84%
The title is "The
Gods Never Left Us."

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:23.382 align:middle line:90%
