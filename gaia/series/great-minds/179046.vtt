00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.680 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Dr. Barbara De Angelis.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.640 align:middle line:10%
I'm a bestselling author,
a transformational teacher,

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.180 align:middle line:10%
and a long-time
seeker of freedom.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.900 align:middle line:84%
For as long as I can remember,
really, a long time ago,

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.540 align:middle line:84%
when I was three,
four years old,

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.590 align:middle line:84%
I was always asking what I
call the sacred questions,

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:51.890 align:middle line:90%
even as a child.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:52.690 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.360 align:middle line:90%
What am I doing here?

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.070 align:middle line:90%
Why are we here?

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.630 align:middle line:84%
What am I supposed
to do in this life?

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.010 align:middle line:84%
Why sometimes do I feel
so happy and sometimes

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.629 align:middle line:90%
do I feel so disconnected?

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.120 align:middle line:90%
What is the answer?

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.320 align:middle line:84%
What is the path I'm
supposed to go on?

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.850 align:middle line:84%
These are really
strange questions

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.640 align:middle line:90%
for a 9-year-old, a 10-year-old.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.250 align:middle line:84%
When I was in my teens,
they depressed me.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.770 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I didn't
understand life.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.810 align:middle line:84%
I saw so much
unhappiness in the world.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.530 align:middle line:84%
I saw so much cruelty
and lack of love.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And I hurt because of the
hurt I saw on the planet.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.850 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, like so many
of us, that heartbreak,

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.900 align:middle line:84%
that heartache, started
me on a path of seeking.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And when I was 18 years old,
I saw a poster that said,

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.290 align:middle line:90%
"learn to meditate."

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.070 align:middle line:84%
It had a picture of an Indian
master, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.070 align:middle line:84%
I was at the University of
Wisconsin, and it was 1969.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.950 align:middle line:90%
There was bombs.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.810 align:middle line:90%
There was marches.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And everyone was
either dropping acid

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.270 align:middle line:90%
or doing something spiritual.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.940 align:middle line:10%
So I knew what my
choice was going to be.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately,
I thought, maybe

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.759 align:middle line:84%
this is the answer
to look within,

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.210 align:middle line:84%
to be able to understand more
about the meaning of life.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.750 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea what it
was going to lead to.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.580 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have a
desire, at that point,

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.920 align:middle line:84%
to be a transformational
teacher.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.236 align:middle line:84%
There really weren't any
transformational teachers.

00:02:23.236 --> 00:02:25.360 align:middle line:84%
There really wasn't even
a personal growth movement

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.350 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.360 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, it was
my destiny, my dharma.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And the questions that I had
been asking myself for so long

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.360 align:middle line:90%
began to be answered.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.210 align:middle line:84%
My real spiritual
journey began when

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.710 align:middle line:84%
I was exposed to my
first spiritual teacher

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:50.011 align:middle line:84%
and heard a lecture
that said, go inside,

00:02:50.011 --> 00:02:51.760 align:middle line:84%
and everything in the
outside will change.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, this was not a
common understanding that

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.320 align:middle line:90%
was happening in those days.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.210 align:middle line:84%
This wasn't anything
I'd ever been taught.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.300 align:middle line:84%
My family was completely
not spiritual.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.860 align:middle line:84%
But the idea that,
instead of having

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.330 align:middle line:84%
to manage and perform
and control everything,

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.420 align:middle line:84%
there was an answer
within and that I could

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.920 align:middle line:90%
go to the root of a plan--

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.260 align:middle line:90%
he gave this analogy of a plant.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.660 align:middle line:84%
If you wanted to get
the leaves to be green,

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.450 align:middle line:90%
you don't paint them green.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.620 align:middle line:90%
You water the root.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.270 align:middle line:84%
The minute I heard "water
the root," I thought,

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.370 align:middle line:90%
that makes so much sense to me.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.590 align:middle line:90%
What's the root for me?

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.480 align:middle line:90%
And the root was consciousness.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.820 align:middle line:84%
That's when I
realized that I needed

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.980 align:middle line:84%
to water the root
of my consciousness

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.910 align:middle line:84%
to shift from inside, not
realizing that, eventually, I'd

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.370 align:middle line:84%
end up teaching that to
millions and millions of people

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.060 align:middle line:90%
and writing about it.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.140 align:middle line:84%
My first book was called "How
to Make Love All the Time."

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.480 align:middle line:84%
It was not about sex,
but it was a good title.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And it was about the experience
of being in love all the time.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.610 align:middle line:84%
It was really about the
idea that relationships

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.110 align:middle line:90%
are a journey.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And there's things we can
do to create joy in them

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.540 align:middle line:90%
or to get in the way of them.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And decided to put
everything together

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.266 align:middle line:84%
in what I call
practical spirituality.

00:04:07.266 --> 00:04:09.140 align:middle line:84%
Because it's one thing
to sit around and say,

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.500 align:middle line:84%
I know I am one with
everything, or I'm going

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.270 align:middle line:90%
to just send love to the world.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.950 align:middle line:84%
What do you do when your
husband drives you crazy?

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.160 align:middle line:84%
What do you do when
somebody betrays you?

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.990 align:middle line:84%
What do you do when you're
disappointed in yourself?

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.200 align:middle line:84%
You can do all the
affirmations you want,

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.050 align:middle line:84%
but there has to
be some mechanics.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And I call this the
mechanics of transformation.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.250 align:middle line:84%
There's really systems that
can help us be at our best

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.315 align:middle line:84%
or not be at our best, be
more clear or not be clear.

00:04:36.315 --> 00:04:40.720 align:middle line:84%
I have a very analytical
mind, so I've mapped out

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.730 align:middle line:84%
the path of transformation
in really specific ways

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.735 align:middle line:84%
so that people
understand the pitfalls,

00:04:45.735 --> 00:04:47.110 align:middle line:84%
they understand
what to watch out

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.660 align:middle line:84%
for, they understand how
to make it go faster,

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.670 align:middle line:84%
how they can screw it up
and make it go slower.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And so I've taken all of
that big wisdom, made it

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.930 align:middle line:84%
very down to earth
and practical,

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.190 align:middle line:84%
and I'm really known for that,
I guess, as being down to earth

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.030 align:middle line:90%
and real.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.710 align:middle line:84%
It was a very unique
book at the time.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.480 align:middle line:84%
Because when I first
began writing it--

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.720 align:middle line:90%
I think it was in the mid-'80s--

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.794 align:middle line:84%
most of the people out there
writing self-help books--

00:05:14.794 --> 00:05:16.960 align:middle line:84%
and they weren't even called
self-help at the time--

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.660 align:middle line:84%
were psychologists,
psychiatrists,

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.480 align:middle line:84%
writing about people's issues
and patterns and things

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.280 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.950 align:middle line:84%
But the idea of
personal transformation,

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.410 align:middle line:84%
of taking things and
learning yourself

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.710 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to going into
therapy forever, was really new.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.890 align:middle line:84%
There really weren't any
women, and certainly not even

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.660 align:middle line:84%
men, who were doing
that at the time.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.500 align:middle line:84%
It was mostly doctors who
were giving advice or looking

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.370 align:middle line:90%
very professional.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.590 align:middle line:84%
I was professional, but I was
with everybody on the journey,

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.690 align:middle line:84%
not analyzing them
on the journey.

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was one of the
important things at that time.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.420 align:middle line:10%
And myself, Wayne Dyer, my
beloved friend, Deepak Chopra,

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.230 align:middle line:10%
we all used to tour together.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.820 align:middle line:10%
And we all really had
that understanding come up

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.930 align:middle line:10%
from within us that there
was a new way of teaching,

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.030 align:middle line:10%
a new way of guiding people.

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And I really
honored to have been

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.410 align:middle line:84%
one of the first
people who began

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.140 align:middle line:84%
the personal
transformation movement.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I meet
lots of young people,

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.990 align:middle line:84%
they can't imagine there was
ever a time when there wasn't

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.610 align:middle line:84%
a personal
transformation movement

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.250 align:middle line:84%
or there wasn't a yoga
studio every five minutes.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.970 align:middle line:84%
But it was a very
different time.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And the bridge from
psychiatry and psychology

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.000 align:middle line:84%
and medicine to
personal transformation

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.410 align:middle line:84%
was one that I helped build and
one of the great achievements

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.960 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.120 align:middle line:84%
I've been using the
phrase "emotional freedom"

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.770 align:middle line:90%
for decades.

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.050 align:middle line:84%
Most of us hear it and
think, what does that mean?

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm emotional, and I'm free.

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:58.320 align:middle line:84%
So what does emotional
freedom mean?

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.010 align:middle line:84%
How does it look
different from that?

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.890 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is
that most of us--

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.290 align:middle line:90%
in fact, all of us--

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:08.520 align:middle line:84%
have been psychologically,
neurologically programmed

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.830 align:middle line:90%
from the time we were born--

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.830 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes, people
believe, from other times--

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.770 align:middle line:84%
so that how we're
experiencing life,

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.790 align:middle line:84%
how we're interpreting
reality, how we're reacting,

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:22.620 align:middle line:90%
isn't coming from freedom.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.600 align:middle line:90%
It's coming from patterns.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.990 align:middle line:84%
It's coming from
old experiences.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:28.540 align:middle line:90%
It's coming from wounds.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:29.340 align:middle line:90%
I have a saying.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.280 align:middle line:84%
"We see the world through
the eyes of our issues."

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.390 align:middle line:84%
So somebody could just, for
instance, say, you look great.

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:39.940 align:middle line:84%
If your issue is, I'm not good
enough, you could hear it as,

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:40.740 align:middle line:90%
why?

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.540 align:middle line:90%
Didn't I look good before?

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.900 align:middle line:84%
Are you saying that
I look better now?

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:52.170 align:middle line:84%
If your issue is, "people don't
love me if I'm not perfect,"

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:56.140 align:middle line:84%
you could think, OK, well, then
I have to look great next time.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.920 align:middle line:84%
We're always
interpreting reality,

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.050 align:middle line:84%
interpreting what
people say to us,

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:05.280 align:middle line:84%
and also projecting our
own issues onto reality.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.650 align:middle line:84%
We all have a big truck of
baggage, emotional baggage,

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:09.280 align:middle line:90%
that we carry around with us.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.340 align:middle line:84%
So the idea that we're
free, for instance,

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:16.110 align:middle line:84%
to love as much as we want
or to tune into ourselves as

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:20.520 align:middle line:84%
deeply as we can or to react
from our highest is not true.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:25.200 align:middle line:84%
The whole world, really,
is just a big kind

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.044 align:middle line:84%
of mosh pit of patterns,
emotional patterns.

00:08:28.044 --> 00:08:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And most of us,
when we hear this,

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:30.720 align:middle line:90%
we can go, yeah, that's true.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.350 align:middle line:84%
My family, when I go visit them
for Thanksgiving or Christmas,

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:38.789 align:middle line:84%
it's just a big, big stew
of people's patterns,

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:41.880 align:middle line:84%
of this person's anger,
this person's insecurity.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.480 align:middle line:84%
But we usually don't think that
we're part of that process.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.280 align:middle line:90%
But we are.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:51.450 align:middle line:84%
So to me, emotional freedom
means learning all the ways

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:54.450 align:middle line:84%
that we are not free, seeing
the ways that we are not

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:59.280 align:middle line:84%
free to love as much as we want,
to be as powerful as we can be,

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:03.450 align:middle line:84%
to be as offering as
we can be in the world,

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:07.500 align:middle line:84%
and to begin to heal those
patterns so that we can,

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:12.060 align:middle line:84%
in each moment, be free
to be fully who we are,

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.140 align:middle line:90%
fully who we're meant to be.

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.590 align:middle line:84%
We all know that we have
our highest moments.

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.830 align:middle line:84%
We all have our moments we feel
loving and enlightened and wise

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.540 align:middle line:90%
and life makes sense.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And then we all have
our lowest moments

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:26.040 align:middle line:84%
when nothing makes
sense and we feel

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:30.180 align:middle line:84%
disconnected and everything
we've been doing is useless.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
everything in between.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:37.770 align:middle line:84%
My contention was those
moments don't just

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.700 align:middle line:90%
happen by themselves.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.180 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason, in a
moment, we're at our highest.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.340 align:middle line:90%
There's a reason we're not.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:49.140 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason that we fall
somewhere in that spectrum.

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.070 align:middle line:90%
And that we have a choice.

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:55.560 align:middle line:84%
We can make a choice to
shift and to be, in a sense,

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.400 align:middle line:84%
shifting into our highest soul
or our highest consciousness,

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.280 align:middle line:84%
if you will, as opposed
to that other part of us.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.690 align:middle line:90%
Imagine a car.

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And in the back seat
is your human self,

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:10.559 align:middle line:84%
kind of like a child who's
antsy and impatient and says,

00:10:10.559 --> 00:10:11.850 align:middle line:90%
when are we going to get there?

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And is hitting their
brother, making noise.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And in the front
seat of the vehicle,

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.120 align:middle line:84%
the adult-- let's
call it the soul,

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.160 align:middle line:84%
the highest-- is
trying to drive.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And you can hear what's
in the back seat,

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:24.960 align:middle line:84%
but you're not letting
it stop the car.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:29.400 align:middle line:84%
For many of us, we switch
who's in the driver's seat

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.900 align:middle line:90%
and who's in the back seat.

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.140 align:middle line:84%
Our highest self, our soul,
gets sitting in the back seat,

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:37.260 align:middle line:84%
maybe meditates once in
a while or reads a book.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And driving the car are our
patterns, our limitations,

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:44.940 align:middle line:84%
our human self, our
not highest self.

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And then our highest has
to kind of intervene,

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:51.450 align:middle line:84%
fix things up for a while, and
then gets in the back seat.

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:55.560 align:middle line:84%
So having a soul shift means
being able to shift in a moment

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.990 align:middle line:90%
into your highest.

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:01.099 align:middle line:84%
Going through something, being
confronted with something,

00:11:01.099 --> 00:11:03.390 align:middle line:84%
being upset about something,
and asking a really simple

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:04.710 align:middle line:90%
question--

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:08.880 align:middle line:84%
what is the highest thought
I can have about this?

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.000 align:middle line:84%
What is the highest choice
I can make right now?

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.310 align:middle line:84%
The minute you say,
what is the highest?

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:17.130 align:middle line:84%
It activates that
backseat part of you.

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:18.660 align:middle line:90%
It activates the soul.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.760 align:middle line:84%
It activates your
highest consciousness.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.200 align:middle line:90%
Because we all have it.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.160 align:middle line:84%
Normally, that's not
the question we ask.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.140 align:middle line:84%
We say, what can I do to get
this person to do what I want?

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.300 align:middle line:90%
Or we complain.

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:34.710 align:middle line:90%
Or we get down on ourselves.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:37.160 align:middle line:84%
What is the highest choice
I can make right now?

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.400 align:middle line:84%
What's the highest way to
look at this, shifts us.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And so a soul shift is
shifting from something that's

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:47.240 align:middle line:84%
contracting us to expanding us,
something that's limiting us

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.760 align:middle line:84%
to something that's
opening us up,

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:54.050 align:middle line:84%
something that cuts us off from
feeling to opening to feeling

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:57.020 align:middle line:84%
so that we're activating the
highest part of who we are.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And these can
happen in a second.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.540 align:middle line:84%
I wrote about 50, 60, a hundred
soul shifts people can make,

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:06.590 align:middle line:84%
things to shift you
from moment to moment

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:10.240 align:middle line:84%
into that you that
is the best you.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And not telling yourself
that, not saying,

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.140 align:middle line:84%
I should be nice right
now, but actually

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:16.610 align:middle line:90%
accessing a part of you.

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And there's a soul
shift mantra that

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.900 align:middle line:84%
can help anyone have a soul
shift, which is amazing.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.460 align:middle line:90%
And I created it.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:23.810 align:middle line:90%
Actually, it came to me.

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And it is, "Today, I'm going
to see what there is to see,

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.610 align:middle line:84%
to feel what there is
to feel, and to know

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:32.960 align:middle line:90%
what there is to know."

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Today, I'm going to see what
there is to see, as opposed

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:37.380 align:middle line:90%
to what we normally do.

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Today, I'm going to
see things I want.

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And if I don't want to deal
with it, it's not happening.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm not seeing it.

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:46.075 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to pretend
it doesn't exist.

00:12:46.075 --> 00:12:48.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to feel what
there is to feel, as opposed

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.610 align:middle line:90%
to what most of us do.

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:51.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to feel
what feels good.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.810 align:middle line:84%
If I don't feel good,
I'm going to shut off.

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:55.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to disconnect.

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:56.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have
10 glasses of wine.

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to yell at somebody.

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:01.737 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to feel anything
that's not making me feel good.

00:13:01.737 --> 00:13:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to know
what there is to know.

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Because when you see what is and
you feel how you feel about it,

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:10.430 align:middle line:90%
wisdom and knowingness develops.

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:12.350 align:middle line:84%
That soul shift
mantra has been used

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:14.450 align:middle line:84%
by so many tens of
thousands of people,

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:16.580 align:middle line:84%
and I use it all the
time and in each moment.

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.470 align:middle line:84%
You're going into
a business meeting.

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:20.180 align:middle line:90%
You know it's going to be tense.

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:23.420 align:middle line:84%
In this meeting, I'm going
to see what there is to see.

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to feel
what there is to feel.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.993 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to know
what there is to know.

00:13:26.993 --> 00:13:29.140 align:middle line:90%
It pulls your consciousness up.

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:32.350 align:middle line:90%
That's a soul shift.

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:36.880 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons that I
began teaching the way I do

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:43.570 align:middle line:84%
is because I saw so many sincere
seekers reading, learning,

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:45.760 align:middle line:84%
meditating, doing
whatever it was,

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:49.900 align:middle line:84%
having a vision of what was
possible, of what could be,

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.930 align:middle line:84%
and then coming
back to what was.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:55.330 align:middle line:90%
And the two things didn't match.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And the result
for many people is

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:02.950 align:middle line:84%
a feeling of self-criticism,
that they're not doing well,

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:06.650 align:middle line:84%
that they're behind, that
they're not doing it right,

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:08.830 align:middle line:84%
that other people are
growing and more enlightened

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:11.560 align:middle line:84%
than they are, even
sometimes people

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:14.620 align:middle line:84%
who will go to hear a
teacher or a speaker,

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.530 align:middle line:84%
beautiful, inspirational
person, or read a book.

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And that person, of
course, is talking

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:22.390 align:middle line:84%
about the highest and maybe
some experience they had

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:26.309 align:middle line:84%
or what life is like
when you're enlightened.

00:14:26.309 --> 00:14:27.850 align:middle line:84%
I realized that a
lot of people leave

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:30.540 align:middle line:90%
those things feeling depressed.

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.080 align:middle line:90%
They think, I'm not that way.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.570 align:middle line:84%
I was upset yesterday
with my mother.

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:36.370 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't feeling divine love.

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:38.470 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't talking to an angel.

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:40.390 align:middle line:90%
I yelled at my son.

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:41.780 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with me?

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.520 align:middle line:90%
I must not be growing.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.470 align:middle line:84%
There's a strange
spiritual inferiority

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:51.520 align:middle line:84%
that I think has been a
result, inadvertently,

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:54.280 align:middle line:84%
of the personal growth
movement where people have

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:59.140 align:middle line:84%
what I call a kindergarten
understanding of spirituality

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:02.840 align:middle line:84%
that once you start on a path,
everything should be fine.

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:03.650 align:middle line:90%
How do I know this?

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:05.140 align:middle line:90%
Because that's how I started.

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:09.440 align:middle line:84%
When I began meditating
and I was 18 years old,

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.490 align:middle line:84%
I really thought, all I have to
do is meditate every day, twice

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:16.270 align:middle line:90%
a day, and do nice things.

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And in a few years, I'll
be totally enlightened.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.030 align:middle line:90%
I'll never be unhappy.

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:22.120 align:middle line:90%
I'll never get sick.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.250 align:middle line:84%
Nothing bad will
ever happen to me.

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:27.264 align:middle line:84%
And I'll be taken off
in the happy spaceship.

00:15:27.264 --> 00:15:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's what a lot
of people believe,

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:30.370 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is
that they're doing,

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:32.500 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is that
they're going to practice.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.275 align:middle line:84%
If I do this, I will
end up in bliss.

00:15:35.275 --> 00:15:38.680 align:middle line:90%


00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.330 align:middle line:90%
You will contact bliss.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.130 align:middle line:84%
There is a place
of bliss inside.

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:45.110 align:middle line:84%
But we're spiritual beings,
as the great Ram Dass said,

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:46.870 align:middle line:90%
having a human experience.

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And the human experience
is limitation.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.030 align:middle line:90%
It's an experience of collision.

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:53.770 align:middle line:84%
It's an experience
of imperfection.

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:55.600 align:middle line:90%
The world is imperfect.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
Earth School, I believe,

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:01.780 align:middle line:84%
is about, to force us
into situations where

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:05.570 align:middle line:84%
we have to find our love,
find our compassion,

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:06.970 align:middle line:90%
find our highest.

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:09.700 align:middle line:84%
If we were sitting around
in bliss all the time,

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.510 align:middle line:90%
the truth is we wouldn't grow.

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:12.310 align:middle line:90%
We really wouldn't.

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And everyone, as much
as we hate to admit it,

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:17.500 align:middle line:84%
has to look back on
times in our life

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.550 align:middle line:84%
that had been the most
difficult and say, I hated it,

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:23.950 align:middle line:84%
but if it weren't for
that, I never would have--

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:25.564 align:middle line:90%
and you can fill in the blank.

00:16:25.564 --> 00:16:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Never would have
stopped drinking.

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.360 align:middle line:84%
Never would have
started seeking.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.568 align:middle line:90%
Never would have read a book.

00:16:29.568 --> 00:16:31.210 align:middle line:84%
Never would have
gone into therapy.

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Because of that
discomfort, I was forced.

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And I call that the divine
discomfort, something

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.280 align:middle line:84%
that happens that's
trying to birth us.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:43.760 align:middle line:84%
So all of us on any
kind of path of growth,

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.870 align:middle line:84%
whether formal or
informal, I believe,

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:50.020 align:middle line:84%
need to have compassion
for our humanity,

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:52.580 align:middle line:90%
not to try to bypass it.

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:53.380 align:middle line:90%
I tried to do it.

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:54.180 align:middle line:90%
I really did.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.140 align:middle line:84%
I went like, can I just
forget this whole thing

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.617 align:middle line:90%
and get into a heavenly state?

00:16:57.617 --> 00:16:59.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe
that's why we're here.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.890 align:middle line:84%
I think we're supposed
to uplift our humanity,

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:06.950 align:middle line:84%
to infuse it with the divinity,
but to still have it be there.

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:09.710 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, here's what happens.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:12.460 align:middle line:84%
Somebody is thinking,
if I'm really spiritual

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:15.160 align:middle line:84%
or if I'm really
evolved, I won't ever

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:18.020 align:middle line:90%
get upset or angry or depressed.

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:21.569 align:middle line:84%
And let's say something happens,
and it's really hurtful.

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:23.740 align:middle line:84%
Or that person is going
through a time of a lot

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.609 align:middle line:90%
of questioning of their life.

00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And not only do they go
through their motions about it,

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.160 align:middle line:84%
then they're feeling
bad about themselves

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.110 align:middle line:84%
for even having them
in the first place.

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:34.900 align:middle line:84%
If I was more
enlightened, I wouldn't

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.880 align:middle line:90%
be so upset at my mother.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.340 align:middle line:84%
If I was more enlightened,
it wouldn't bother me

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:40.750 align:middle line:90%
that my husband did this.

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:44.860 align:middle line:84%
This is not helpful, and
it's not even accurate.

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:48.640 align:middle line:84%
Because I have
some enlightenment,

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.760 align:middle line:84%
I need to have compassion
for this human experience

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:55.300 align:middle line:84%
that I'm having right now and
to drench it with compassion

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.650 align:middle line:90%
and to drench it with love.

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:59.080 align:middle line:84%
The choice to love
ourselves even

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.930 align:middle line:84%
when we're sitting in the
midst of our imperfection,

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:05.370 align:middle line:84%
because that love will
raise our imperfection up.

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:08.050 align:middle line:84%
It will vibrate it
to a higher level.

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:13.360 align:middle line:84%
Not in spite of our
humanity we evolve,

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:17.740 align:middle line:84%
but because of it,
we become whole.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:20.860 align:middle line:84%
My journey has been
one of my own path,

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:24.880 align:middle line:84%
experiencing
things, finding ways

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:30.610 align:middle line:84%
to shift myself, accelerate
myself, and create techniques

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.020 align:middle line:90%
and tools for everybody else.

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:35.470 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing I teach
that I didn't create,

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:40.420 align:middle line:84%
that I don't practice myself
or experiment with on myself.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why
I know things work.

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:46.750 align:middle line:84%
Every time in my life, when I've
gone through a difficult time

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:48.380 align:middle line:90%
and I've thought, what can I do?

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:49.390 align:middle line:90%
How can I shift?

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:50.500 align:middle line:90%
Where am I stuck?

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.080 align:middle line:84%
What's the thought
that's keeping this way?

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:57.340 align:middle line:84%
Over time, putting that together
into an incredible manual

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:02.570 align:middle line:84%
of transformational offerings
is why those things are alive.

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:03.370 align:middle line:90%
They're real.

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:04.510 align:middle line:90%
They actually work.

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:05.740 align:middle line:90%
They're not theory.

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And for myself, every
time I'm confronted

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:13.360 align:middle line:84%
with anything in life, either
from within or without,

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.600 align:middle line:84%
that is disappointing or
hurtful or frightening,

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:21.470 align:middle line:84%
I have to identify in that
moment that I have a choice.

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And the choice is always
between my highest, my greatest

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:30.920 align:middle line:84%
knowingness, my love, my trust,
and all those other parts

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:31.720 align:middle line:90%
of me.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.720 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, in really
difficult times,

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:37.000 align:middle line:84%
I've had to remind
myself of that choice

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.430 align:middle line:90%
every single minute.

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:45.190 align:middle line:84%
There's times we all go through,
times of great betrayal or pain

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:48.790 align:middle line:84%
or illness, when even
if we get centered,

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:51.070 align:middle line:84%
we get off center again
five minutes later.

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:52.150 align:middle line:90%
And that's OK.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:54.370 align:middle line:84%
We need to sometimes
recenter ourself

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:58.210 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:02.170 align:middle line:10%
I wrote "The Choice for
Love," because, especially

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:04.210 align:middle line:10%
in the times that we're
in where, many times,

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:07.990 align:middle line:10%
people don't feel we have as
many choices as we'd like,

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:11.080 align:middle line:10%
when so many of us are in
accelerated personal times

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:15.250 align:middle line:10%
of change, of challenge,
of lot of pressures

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:18.250 align:middle line:10%
and stresses in our life
that are beyond our control,

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:21.040 align:middle line:10%
to remind people
that in each moment,

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:24.220 align:middle line:10%
we're either making
a choice for love

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:28.840 align:middle line:10%
or a choice for separation,
a choice to give

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.630 align:middle line:10%
or a choice to withhold,
a choice to love and have

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:35.330 align:middle line:10%
compassion for ourselves
or a choice for judgment

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:37.640 align:middle line:10%
and belittling ourselves.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:41.750 align:middle line:84%
The idea that we're not doing
anything is not accurate.

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:43.230 align:middle line:90%
We're always making choices.

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:45.860 align:middle line:84%
The question is, what
choice are we making?

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And love is not an
emotion, actually.

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.010 align:middle line:90%
It's not even a relationship.

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:54.110 align:middle line:84%
It's not even a set
of nice behaviors.

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:58.070 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a love-drenched,
limitless, vibrational field.

00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:00.560 align:middle line:90%
I think it's the source energy.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:04.130 align:middle line:84%
When people have near-death
experiences, for instance,

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:07.310 align:middle line:84%
they never come back and
say, there was nothing.

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:08.340 align:middle line:90%
There was just nothing.

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:10.460 align:middle line:84%
It was just a big,
white nothing.

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:14.480 align:middle line:84%
They say, there was love beyond
anything I could even imagine.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.120 align:middle line:84%
Great saints and
mystics have always

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.790 align:middle line:84%
written about their highest
spiritual experiences

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:24.420 align:middle line:84%
talking about this amazing
place of kind of absolute divine

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:25.220 align:middle line:90%
love.

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:26.660 align:middle line:90%
Not personal love.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.460 align:middle line:90%
Love with a capital L.

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:31.550 align:middle line:84%
I believe that is our
nature, that everything's

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:33.320 align:middle line:90%
been created out of that.

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:35.870 align:middle line:84%
Babies, when they come into
the world, you can tell.

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:37.340 align:middle line:90%
They're fresh from that.

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:39.800 align:middle line:90%
They are so full of love.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.210 align:middle line:84%
They radiate it
to everybody else.

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And then over time, we put
up walls around our heart

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:46.610 align:middle line:90%
because of hurt.

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:49.100 align:middle line:84%
We unplug ourselves
from our emotions.

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:52.620 align:middle line:84%
We freeze up emotions
in places inside of us

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:55.550 align:middle line:84%
so that we get a lot of
ice around our heart.

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:57.350 align:middle line:90%
Our love can't flow out.

00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:59.390 align:middle line:90%
Other people's can't flow in.

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:02.360 align:middle line:84%
So the choice for love
is the choice to defrost.

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.340 align:middle line:90%
It's the choice to plug back in.

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:07.640 align:middle line:84%
It's the choice to see how,
moment by moment, we're

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:10.040 align:middle line:90%
making choices not for love.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.820 align:middle line:90%
It's the choice for compassion.

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very practical
way, moment by moment,

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:19.410 align:middle line:84%
to realign and recalibrate
ourselves to love.

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:21.980 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the
culmination of things

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:26.030 align:middle line:84%
that I've taught for a long
time and wrapped all together

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:30.860 align:middle line:84%
in a beautiful recipe for people
that is practical spirituality.

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:33.170 align:middle line:84%
Because it's one thing
to sit around and say,

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:34.340 align:middle line:90%
I want to love everybody.

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:35.570 align:middle line:90%
And I'm blessing the world.

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to bless all
my enemies or whatever it is.

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And then how do you
live that every day?

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is where a lot of us
have our humanity colliding

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:45.320 align:middle line:90%
with our divinity.

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:48.260 align:middle line:84%
We can go to a yoga class
or we can meditate or read

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:52.370 align:middle line:84%
the Bible or whatever it is
that we do to expand ourselves.

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And in those moments, we
feel great and confident.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Then one of our kids drives
us crazy or somebody upsets us

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:01.400 align:middle line:84%
or we read something
in the news,

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.530 align:middle line:90%
and we feel ourselves contract.

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:05.960 align:middle line:84%
So we're always
bouncing back and forth

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:09.500 align:middle line:84%
between our humanity
and our divinity.

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:10.650 align:middle line:90%
How do we integrate them?

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:13.190 align:middle line:84%
How do we bring all
of the great things

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:17.570 align:middle line:84%
we're doing for ourselves into
a practical, grounded way, day

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:19.280 align:middle line:90%
by day, minute by minute?

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.280 align:middle line:90%

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.770 align:middle line:10%
One of the things that
gives me great joy

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:26.160 align:middle line:10%
is seeing the tremendous
expansion of consciousness

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:29.950 align:middle line:10%
and awakening that's
happened in the last three,

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:33.150 align:middle line:10%
four decades on the
planet, particularly

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:36.190 align:middle line:10%
in North America but,
really, all over the world.

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:39.420 align:middle line:84%
There's been a tremendous
growth of consciousness,

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:42.270 align:middle line:84%
of certain things that are
now kind of understood,

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:47.250 align:middle line:84%
of mainstream acceptance
of the idea of growth,

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:49.230 align:middle line:90%
of the idea of going within.

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:52.800 align:middle line:84%
These were not
common understandings

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.370 align:middle line:90%
not that long ago.

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:56.290 align:middle line:90%
Now, they're just accepted.

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:58.950 align:middle line:84%
But it was really
revolutionary, and it really

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:01.410 align:middle line:84%
was the baby boomers,
teachers like myself

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:04.110 align:middle line:84%
and so many other people,
who began talking about this

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:06.690 align:middle line:84%
so that now, there's
Oprah teaching

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:07.860 align:middle line:90%
people how to meditate.

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:12.730 align:middle line:84%
But this wasn't something
that was part of society.

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:16.170 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's been both
a growth in consciousness

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:19.860 align:middle line:84%
but also an illumination
of things that are stuck.

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:21.150 align:middle line:90%
I have a saying.

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:25.740 align:middle line:84%
"When the light is imminent,
the darkness gets agitated."

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:28.590 align:middle line:84%
When the light is imminent,
the darkness gets agitated.

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:32.530 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot of light
coming up on the planet.

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's been,
also, a tremendous agitation

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:37.830 align:middle line:84%
in the last 20, 30
years of darkness,

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:40.290 align:middle line:84%
of the worst elements
of everything.

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:44.820 align:middle line:84%
So you see this juxtaposition
of incredible consciousness

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:48.190 align:middle line:84%
and love and inclusion
and diversity.

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And then you see
the exact opposite.

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:54.840 align:middle line:84%
There's really, in a sense,
a spiritual war going on.

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.780 align:middle line:84%
All the more reason
each person, really,

00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:00.330 align:middle line:84%
who thinks of himself as
a light worker in any way

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:03.780 align:middle line:84%
needs to rise up and
be part of that army

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:06.630 align:middle line:90%
of high, vibrational offering.

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:09.315 align:middle line:84%
We're all always
affecting everybody.

00:25:09.315 --> 00:25:11.220 align:middle line:84%
I always tell people,
there's no way

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:12.930 align:middle line:84%
you can say I'm just
staying out of it.

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:14.010 align:middle line:90%
There is no out.

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:15.540 align:middle line:90%
We're all vibrationally in.

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:18.040 align:middle line:84%
We're all impacting
everybody all the time.

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:22.620 align:middle line:84%
So this is the time when we
each need to pick our side--

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:25.630 align:middle line:84%
and not politically--
inside of ourself.

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:26.430 align:middle line:90%
We need to decide.

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:27.810 align:middle line:90%
Who's in charge?

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And we need to elect that
part of ourselves that

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:35.910 align:middle line:84%
is the highest and
stand by it and insist

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:37.890 align:middle line:90%
on it operating in our life.

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:41.760 align:middle line:84%
More than ever, now, that's
needed for our own lives

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.970 align:middle line:90%
and for the world.

00:25:43.970 --> 00:26:01.750 align:middle line:90%
