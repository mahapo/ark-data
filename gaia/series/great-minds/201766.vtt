I'm a researcher at heart.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.330 align:middle line:10%
And I found, when I was
first starting writing

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.732 align:middle line:10%
in the mid-'90s that people
weren't looking at some

00:00:34.732 --> 00:00:36.440 align:middle line:10%
of the same things
that I was looking at.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And I was making notes
and decided, OK, it's

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.630 align:middle line:84%
time to start putting
this into a book form.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.870 align:middle line:90%
And it became a service.

started playing sports.

most of my childhood,

at home as a lawyer.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And he was kind of
a maverick lawyer.

He didn't work with
ordinary people.

So everything my
father was involved in

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.830 align:middle line:90%
were people on the edge.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.610 align:middle line:84%

in on the conversations.

is a really magical guy.

1982, I had moved to Nashville
to go to this small school

to be an entertainment lawyer.

And it just happened that
this Southern Baptist college

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.617 align:middle line:84%
offered an entertainment
music business degree

00:03:33.617 --> 00:03:35.700 align:middle line:84%
where you would be taught
by professors from music

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.630 align:middle line:90%
row, industry professionals.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And we were a real weird
mix because chewing gum,

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.720 align:middle line:84%
dancing were prohibited
at this school.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.710 align:middle line:84%
But yet, here were all of
us rock-and-rollers kind

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.390 align:middle line:90%
of thing invading them.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.410 align:middle line:90%


00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And the catch was, you had
to take Bible study classes.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And growing up, in my
family, in Detroit, we

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.800 align:middle line:90%
weren't particularly religious.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.300 align:middle line:84%

apostles were Waylon, Willie,

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.430 align:middle line:90%
Chris, and Johnny.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And then, a sophomore
sociology class,

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.310 align:middle line:84%
a professor assigned
us to review

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.240 align:middle line:84%
a book whose implications would
impact Christianity and write

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.029 align:middle line:84%
a three page review
of this book.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:20.930 align:middle line:84%
So off I go to the
local bookstore.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And I find this brand new-- it
was an international bestseller

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.030 align:middle line:90%
at this time.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.890 align:middle line:10%
The book was called
"Holy Blood, Holy Grail."

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.210 align:middle line:10%
And the premise of the book
was the crucifixion was a hoax.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.490 align:middle line:10%
Jesus and Mary
Magdaline were married.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.170 align:middle line:90%
They had children.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.300 align:middle line:84%
There were certain secrets
that Jesus possessed

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.030 align:middle line:84%
that the traditional
church, the Catholic church,

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.570 align:middle line:84%
does not want people
to know about.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.830 align:middle line:90%
And I was instantly hooked.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.795 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know anything
about Christianity.

00:04:46.795 --> 00:04:50.170 align:middle line:84%
I was, like, wow, if they wanted
to eliminate these people, what

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.720 align:middle line:90%
was it that they knew?

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.610 align:middle line:84%
I ended up writing a
44-page review of this book,

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.390 align:middle line:90%
and I was flunked.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And the professor sat
me down and said you're

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.340 align:middle line:90%
at Southern Baptist College.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.200 align:middle line:90%
Do you believe any of this crap?

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, well, yeah, I think
that book really laid out

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:09.700 align:middle line:90%
a very compelling case.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, if you
really believe that, then you

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.940 align:middle line:84%
might consider continuing
your education somewhere else.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.740 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I did.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still trying to answer
that same fundamental question.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.990 align:middle line:90%


00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.390 align:middle line:84%
I was 19 years
old, 20 years old.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:31.030 align:middle line:84%
It was a huge wake-up call
because I didn't fully

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.930 align:middle line:84%
appreciate the role of
religion in people's lives

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.150 align:middle line:84%
because it wasn't a
huge part of our lives.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.525 align:middle line:84%
So it left me kind
of bewildered.

00:05:39.525 --> 00:05:40.942 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, well,
wait a minute.

00:05:40.942 --> 00:05:42.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm here to get an education.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking really
important questions.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.480 align:middle line:84%
You would think I
would be applauded

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.780 align:middle line:84%
for wanting to address the
most important questions

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.770 align:middle line:84%
of Christianity
right off the bat.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.220 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, the response
was the exact opposite.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.100 align:middle line:84%
That's like, this has been
decided long before your time.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.900 align:middle line:90%
This stuff is nonsense.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.970 align:middle line:90%
We don't want to hear it.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.000 align:middle line:84%
So my plan was to get this
entertainment music business

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.263 align:middle line:84%
degree and go work on
music row in Nashville

00:06:06.263 --> 00:06:07.930 align:middle line:84%
or maybe Hollywood,
something like that.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.080 align:middle line:84%
But I only lasted two
years at the college.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
end of that story.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.640 align:middle line:90%


00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.130 align:middle line:84%
When I first tapped
into these mysteries,

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.770 align:middle line:90%
it was kind of a lonely road.

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.150 align:middle line:90%
My sisters were into it.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.100 align:middle line:90%
My family was into it.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.870 align:middle line:84%
Thanksgiving
conversation at our house

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.690 align:middle line:84%
was always about this
type-- the mysteries,

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.160 align:middle line:90%
or conspiracy theory.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.350 align:middle line:84%
But my friends
didn't get it at all.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.560 align:middle line:84%
So it became kind
of a lonely road.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.140 align:middle line:84%
It was a little
scary, but I think

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:45.270 align:middle line:84%
I had this entrepreneurial
spirit from my father

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.950 align:middle line:84%
that you could make
something happen.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.830 align:middle line:84%
You could build a
business, or you

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.460 align:middle line:84%
could make connections and
contacts, and do it yourself.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And that really became kind
of the rule of my life.

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:00.120 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:05.070 align:middle line:10%
I worked for a self-help
entrepreneur who made hundreds

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.070 align:middle line:10%
of millions of dollars selling
subliminal tapes on late-night

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.030 align:middle line:10%
TV--

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.950 align:middle line:10%
how to lose weight,
how to quit smoking.

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:14.520 align:middle line:90%
And he was very famous.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And he appreciated that
I liked to do research.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.350 align:middle line:90%
And he had a book deal.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.660 align:middle line:84%
And he hired me to
read books for him.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And I did this for
almost three years.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.010 align:middle line:10%
And so every month, he
would call with a question.

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.290 align:middle line:90%
How does the brain work?

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:29.910 align:middle line:90%
Why do people fail?

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:31.260 align:middle line:90%
How do people lose weight?

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.562 align:middle line:90%
And it'd be hysterical.

00:07:32.562 --> 00:07:34.020 align:middle line:84%
My parents would
be, like, oh, god,

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.040 align:middle line:90%
what's the question this month?

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.840 align:middle line:10%
And that was a wonderful
experience for me.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.780 align:middle line:10%
And it just gave me free
rein to go out and explore.

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.690 align:middle line:10%
And it was then I
started to kind of--

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:46.350 align:middle line:10%
I got off the
reservation a little bit

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:49.380 align:middle line:10%
because I started to put
my own input into it,

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.460 align:middle line:10%
my own perspective.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that
wasn't suiting him,

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:56.100 align:middle line:84%
because he really wanted
it to be about his story.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.070 align:middle line:84%
But that kind of put me
into a whole new area.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.950 align:middle line:84%
It's, like, OK, I really
enjoy the writing.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And then I read
Zacharia Sitchin's books

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.560 align:middle line:84%
about the ancient
Anunnaki and Sumerian

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.530 align:middle line:84%
mythology about the
extraterrestrial intervention

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:12.480 align:middle line:84%
in human affairs,
and decided, this

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:16.170 align:middle line:84%
is what I really,
really want to get into,

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:19.950 align:middle line:84%
this whole question
of extraterrestrials,

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:21.885 align:middle line:90%
especially in the ancient past.

00:08:21.885 --> 00:08:25.470 align:middle line:90%


00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:27.990 align:middle line:84%
The first question that
really drove my research

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:31.050 align:middle line:90%
was, who is Jesus, really?

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And what did Jesus
actually teach, not

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.710 align:middle line:90%
what the Bible says he taught?

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:40.140 align:middle line:10%
This is a fourth
century Coptic Christian

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:45.150 align:middle line:10%
depiction of Jesus with
his rod and his ring--

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.180 align:middle line:10%
his two key pieces of
technology that were then

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.610 align:middle line:10%
taken out of his hands.

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:52.620 align:middle line:10%
And he's just simply
shown waving his hand,

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.360 align:middle line:10%
performing his miracles.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.450 align:middle line:10%
But an example after example
of early Christian art,

00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:02.320 align:middle line:10%
he had this rod and
ring in his hand.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:05.380 align:middle line:84%
As I look at ancient
astronaut theory

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:08.760 align:middle line:84%
as proposed by Erich von
Daniken, Zecharia Sitchen,

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.360 align:middle line:90%
and other authors--

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.040 align:middle line:90%
I loved their work.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:15.040 align:middle line:84%
But something that I find
I have a slightly different

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.050 align:middle line:84%
perspective on it, and
that is that there's

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:20.940 align:middle line:84%
a very definite dependence
that some have on the belief

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.490 align:middle line:84%
that the gods were
flesh-and-blood beings,

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:27.130 align:middle line:84%
and they had super
advanced technology.

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:29.570 align:middle line:90%
And that could well be true.

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:33.070 align:middle line:84%
But, as I dug deeper and
deeper into the subject,

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:35.380 align:middle line:84%
I found it a more
compelling argument

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:39.100 align:middle line:84%
that these extraterrestrials
are not in flesh-and-blood form.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.380 align:middle line:84%
They can take on
flesh-and-blood form

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.840 align:middle line:84%
and that their primary
motivation for coming here

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.480 align:middle line:90%
is not to give us technology.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:50.140 align:middle line:84%
It's rather, to assist us
in activating the latent

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.900 align:middle line:84%
capabilities of our
body, to transform,

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.520 align:middle line:90%
to become like the gods.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And that is a completely
different path.

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:00.850 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking at
these ancient stories

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.660 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrials for the,
wow, the big wow, of, wow, look

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:07.030 align:middle line:84%
at the size that flying
saucer, or what technology

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:10.240 align:middle line:84%
did they have, your
chances are not

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:13.570 align:middle line:84%
looking to apply it to
your own personal life.

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:16.450 align:middle line:84%
You're not looking for
the ultimate secrets

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:18.730 align:middle line:90%
of how we transform.

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:20.740 align:middle line:10%
And that's what
started to really drive

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.530 align:middle line:10%
my research into the
extraterrestrial phenomena

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:25.990 align:middle line:10%
is how they came
here to assist us

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:29.710 align:middle line:10%
in our personal and
spiritual evolution, not

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:32.840 align:middle line:10%
just a technological evolution.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.280 align:middle line:10%
And so here is Jesus with
his Harry Potter wand

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:40.000 align:middle line:10%
with six water pots
plus a seventh.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.180 align:middle line:84%
Those are symbolic of our
energy bodies, of our chakras,

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:48.280 align:middle line:84%
the water turned into wine
as the water of our body.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:51.610 align:middle line:10%
The wine is the
heavenly substance

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:54.070 align:middle line:10%
in all ancient traditions.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:57.460 align:middle line:10%
What he is teaching people
to do at his wedding at Cana

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.040 align:middle line:10%
is transform themselves
into beings of light.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:06.250 align:middle line:90%


00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:08.110 align:middle line:84%
I very much
subscribe to the idea

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:10.660 align:middle line:84%
that we are messengers
of our creator.

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:14.830 align:middle line:84%
Were sent here to be agents
of love, light, and peace

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:19.030 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately to move the
human race out into the cosmos.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:20.550 align:middle line:90%
I feel like there is a--

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:23.980 align:middle line:84%
we're preprogrammed
to migrate into space,

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:28.360 align:middle line:84%
to settle on other worlds, to
take life into other realms.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:32.500 align:middle line:84%
What it distills down into
is that the gods came here

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.980 align:middle line:84%
to teach us to become
gods ourselves.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:39.370 align:middle line:84%
But we all have latent
abilities and powers within us--

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:43.300 align:middle line:84%
super intelligence, the
ability to transmute our bodies

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.370 align:middle line:84%
into light, to
travel the cosmos,

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:49.040 align:middle line:84%
to journey to a distant star
system in a light body form,

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.640 align:middle line:84%
then reformulate
our physical body.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.028 align:middle line:84%
Those are the kind of
stories that drive me.

00:11:54.028 --> 00:11:55.570 align:middle line:84%
I believe they're
true, and I believe

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:58.776 align:middle line:84%
that's the ultimate
destiny for all of us.

00:11:58.776 --> 00:12:00.760 align:middle line:84%
The light body is
a theme that you

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:04.480 align:middle line:84%
find in all the world's
spiritual metaphysical

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.950 align:middle line:84%
traditions, this belief that
our flesh-and-blood body is not

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:11.500 align:middle line:84%
our true self,
that our true self

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:15.010 align:middle line:90%
is, in fact, a light being.

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:19.690 align:middle line:10%
The mysteries of exactly how
to become a perfect light being

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:22.690 align:middle line:10%
formed the backbone of
the Essenes revelation

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:25.750 align:middle line:10%
that was adopted into
the Gnostic religion

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:30.940 align:middle line:10%
especially a branch of
it called Manichaeism.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:33.870 align:middle line:84%
I think we come from many
different star systems.

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:37.200 align:middle line:84%
I think we're all
cosmic visitors here.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Our flesh-and-blood body has
been evolving over the eons.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.650 align:middle line:84%
We haven't always looked like
this, and, in the future,

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:46.420 align:middle line:84%
we won't always look
like this either.

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:49.470 align:middle line:90%
But what is eternal is the soul.

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And the soul is essentially
a cosmic traveler

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:56.220 align:middle line:84%
that might come from the
same original source place.

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.037 align:middle line:84%
But that source
place is home, but it

00:12:59.037 --> 00:13:00.870 align:middle line:84%
is not our permanent
home, because we're all

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:01.900 align:middle line:90%
wandering souls.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:06.060 align:middle line:84%
We're all "star seeds," if you
will, to use a New Age term.

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.770 align:middle line:84%
We all have a sense
that we've taken

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:11.740 align:middle line:84%
this bale of forgetfulness, that
we, at one time, knew about all

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.950 align:middle line:84%
of these mysteries
and our true nature.

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:17.040 align:middle line:84%
But in order to
survive on this planet,

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.630 align:middle line:84%
we've kind of dumbed
ourselves down

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:21.430 align:middle line:84%
and crammed ourselves into
one of these packages here.

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And we begin to identify
with this is our true self

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:28.020 align:middle line:84%
and who we are and
completely who we are.

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:30.480 align:middle line:84%
That's not true from the
metaphysical and spiritual

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.350 align:middle line:90%
perspective.

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:33.330 align:middle line:90%
We're in a process of evolution.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And if we can understand
that process of evolution,

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.770 align:middle line:84%
we can better
navigate this world,

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:41.730 align:middle line:84%
accept the preciousness
of human life,

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:43.530 align:middle line:84%
and recognize that
we're ultimately

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:46.430 align:middle line:84%
called to go somewhere else and
figure out how to get there.

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:48.770 align:middle line:90%
[PIANO MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:53.450 align:middle line:90%


00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:56.840 align:middle line:84%
My first book was "Junior Cosmic
Egg," the children's book.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And my first book into the
extraterrestrial phenomena

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.680 align:middle line:84%
was called "The Peacemaker
and the Key of Life."

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.420 align:middle line:10%
Somehow, along the
way, I had become

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:08.690 align:middle line:10%
enamored by the staff of Moses.

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:14.210 align:middle line:10%
My research reveals that the
serpent, lifted by Moses,

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:17.750 align:middle line:10%
is this serpent of Osiris.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:20.900 align:middle line:10%
And he may even have
been bringing forward

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.530 align:middle line:10%
an Atlantean technology.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.790 align:middle line:10%
And it turns out,
mythological speaking,

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:27.800 align:middle line:10%
there's a whole
prehistory of this staff,

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.643 align:middle line:10%
that Adam and Eve
originally had the staff

00:14:29.643 --> 00:14:30.560 align:middle line:10%
in the garden of Eden.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And then, it was passed along
through Adam's bloodline

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:36.710 align:middle line:84%
to Enoch and others that crossed
over the time of the flood.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And it was passed along
to these various people.

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And they were often
called the peacemaker.

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.240 align:middle line:84%

the role that they play
in their civilizations.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And my first presentation
at an ET-based conference

00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:00.130 align:middle line:90%
was in Denver in 1996.

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:02.410 align:middle line:90%
It was Sitchen Study Days.

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:06.940 align:middle line:10%
He was like the great scribe,
and I was like a student.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like, OK, this
feels really familiar,

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:13.090 align:middle line:84%
this role that
we've had together.

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And it really was a
special relationship

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:22.840 align:middle line:84%
that I had with Zecharia and
still admire him to this day.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:26.020 align:middle line:84%
I've since learned that a
lot of what he talked about

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:29.230 align:middle line:84%
doesn't hold the water that it
did back in the earlier days.

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:33.340 align:middle line:84%
We know a lot more about
Sumerian studies, cuneiform,

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:36.760 align:middle line:84%
the cuneiform tablets, and the
Anunnaki now than we did then.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:41.440 align:middle line:84%
But it was still a
real opening for me.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.300 align:middle line:90%
And then I just kept going on.

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:47.290 align:middle line:10%
I've ended up writing 18
books in and around the idea

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:51.520 align:middle line:10%
of extraterrestrials
and the angelic realm.

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.865 align:middle line:10%
I was the first author to
decode the ascension symbolism

00:15:54.865 --> 00:15:56.115 align:middle line:10%
in the dome of the US capital.

00:15:56.115 --> 00:16:00.816 align:middle line:90%


00:16:00.816 --> 00:16:03.753 align:middle line:84%
We're standing on the east side
of the United States Capitol.

00:16:03.753 --> 00:16:05.420 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't
know the United States

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.130 align:middle line:90%
capital is a temple.

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:10.100 align:middle line:84%
That is one of my
crowning achievements.

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:13.265 align:middle line:84%
I'll never forget the first
time I went into the US capital

00:16:13.265 --> 00:16:15.640 align:middle line:84%
and to the architect of the
capital's office, Dr. Barbara

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:16.610 align:middle line:90%
Wolanin.

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And she said, really
happy to have you here.

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:21.620 align:middle line:90%
We know there's mysteries here.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.410 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what they are.

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:24.950 align:middle line:10%
She gave me a lot
of latitude, a lot

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:27.920 align:middle line:10%
of entry into the
capital to just spend

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.650 align:middle line:10%
hours, as I did,
like a jackrabbit,

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:32.990 align:middle line:10%
going in and out of all
the halls and the holes

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:35.210 align:middle line:10%
in the US capital and
wrote a book called

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:38.060 align:middle line:10%
"Freedom's Gate" about
the ascension symbolism

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.520 align:middle line:10%
in the dome of the capitol.

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.800 align:middle line:10%
Go into the capitol
in the rotunda,

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:46.400 align:middle line:10%
there's a gold dot in the
center of the rotunda.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:50.270 align:middle line:10%
And I'd lay on my back and
look up through that stargate.

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And I would describe, look,
the dome of the capitol

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.650 align:middle line:90%
symbolizes the dome of our head.

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:56.480 align:middle line:84%
That gold dot is
our pineal gland.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is Washington
going through the stargate.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.240 align:middle line:10%
The painter is
Constantino Brumidi,

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:06.440 align:middle line:10%
who came from Italy
in the early 1840s.

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.119 align:middle line:10%
And what we're actually
looking at here

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:12.170 align:middle line:10%
is one of Brumidi's studies for
the Apotheosis of Washington.

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:17.839 align:middle line:10%
It means to defy, to raise
from a man to a god-man,

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:23.150 align:middle line:10%
or to transform an ordinary
human into a divine being.

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:25.700 align:middle line:84%
The US capitol was built
on during the Civil War.

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.470 align:middle line:84%
It was a question
whether they were

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:29.000 align:middle line:90%
going to continue building it.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And Abraham Lincoln
said no, we must

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:33.050 align:middle line:84%
finish the dome of the
capitol is a symbol

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:35.330 align:middle line:90%
of the unity of the nation.

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason,
nobody really

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:42.020 align:middle line:84%
paid attention to what was
going on up in the dome where

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:45.590 align:middle line:84%
you have this gate of 72
stars, with the founding

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:47.870 align:middle line:84%
father of the country,
George Washington,

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:51.230 align:middle line:84%
sitting on a rainbow
surrounded by celestial beings.

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:54.530 align:middle line:84%
The first time I looked at that,
I'm, like, that's a stargate,

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:57.200 align:middle line:84%
and this is Washington
as Christ on the rainbow.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And again, I'll never forget
sitting down with Dr. Wolanin

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:02.510 align:middle line:84%
and showing her a comparison
of George Washington

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:05.240 align:middle line:84%
on the rainbow with Jesus on
the rainbow in his Resurrection

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.040 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And she's, like, how come
we've not seen this before?

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's, like,
well, I guess you've

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.620 align:middle line:90%
got to look outside the box.

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:14.330 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
automatically look

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:17.180 align:middle line:84%
at George Washington and think
he's the American Christ,

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:21.230 align:middle line:84%
but that is what that fresco
in the dome of the US capitol

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:24.140 align:middle line:84%
very clearly states,
that Washington

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:25.670 align:middle line:90%
is an ascended being.

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:30.600 align:middle line:84%
He's gone through the stargate,
and now he is equal to Christ--

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:34.310 align:middle line:84%
very controversial thing
to say and to talk about.

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:36.560 align:middle line:10%
This rendition of
Solomon's temple

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.690 align:middle line:10%
is envisioned with a dome.

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:42.740 align:middle line:10%
The Bible says nothing about
a dome on Solomon's temple.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:45.080 align:middle line:10%
So does this in
part the inspiration

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:49.180 align:middle line:10%
for putting a dome
on the US capitol?

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:52.140 align:middle line:84%
I connected the dome to
other domes and portals

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:52.950 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And it has opened it
up, this whole concept

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:59.010 align:middle line:84%
of the founding fathers and
their quest for liberty.

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:02.160 align:middle line:84%
Liberty is not just freedom
to move about the country.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:05.340 align:middle line:84%
Liberty is the ability
of an individual

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.980 align:middle line:84%
to come to a physical
place, America,

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.410 align:middle line:84%
which is also a
psychological space,

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:12.540 align:middle line:90%
and attain enlightenment.

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:16.840 align:middle line:84%
You don't have a king or a
pope on your back telling you

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:17.640 align:middle line:90%
what to believe.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:21.090 align:middle line:84%
In America, you can become
anything you want to be.

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:22.530 align:middle line:90%
That's the American dream.

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:25.690 align:middle line:84%
You can even become
equal to Christ.

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:26.490 align:middle line:90%
Ooh.

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:28.198 align:middle line:84%
Some people don't like
that kind of talk.

00:19:28.198 --> 00:19:30.450 align:middle line:84%
But that is clearly
what is being--

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:32.940 align:middle line:84%
the conversation going on in
the dome of the US capitol,

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:35.325 align:middle line:90%
and most Americans have no idea.

00:19:35.325 --> 00:19:38.443 align:middle line:90%


00:19:38.443 --> 00:19:40.110 align:middle line:84%
As I introduced that
material, I thought

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:41.940 align:middle line:90%
people would really embrace it.

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:45.180 align:middle line:10%
But in those years,
you had a lot

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.880 align:middle line:10%
of authors,
conspiracy-oriented authors,

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.180 align:middle line:10%
like, US capital
is a dark place.

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:53.490 align:middle line:84%
The founding fathers
are Freemasons.

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:54.720 align:middle line:90%
They're dark.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.460 align:middle line:10%
And then Dan Brown moved
into the US capital

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:01.020 align:middle line:10%
where he had written
his "Da Vinci Code"

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:04.050 align:middle line:10%
book, which was a mega
bestseller, which is based

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:05.342 align:middle line:10%
on "Holy Blood, Holy Grail."

00:20:05.342 --> 00:20:07.050 align:middle line:10%
He wrote a book called
"The Lost Symbol."

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:09.130 align:middle line:10%
And everyone was speculating.

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:11.520 align:middle line:10%
Oh, he's going to write about
all the alignments in DC.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.280 align:middle line:10%
He's going to put together
how the capitol and the White

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.100 align:middle line:10%
House and the pentagon form
an equilateral triangle.

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to talk
about the portal in DC.

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:21.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm, like, no.

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:25.290 align:middle line:84%
Dan Brown is going to be
talking about the fresco.

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, he's
got Robert Langdon lying

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:31.710 align:middle line:84%
on his back in the
dome of the US capitol

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:34.110 align:middle line:84%
looking up and saying,
this is a stargate.

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm, like, it's the
greatest literary synchronicity

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.732 align:middle line:90%
of all time.

00:20:38.732 --> 00:20:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And so after that,
people started saying,

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.940 align:middle line:84%
you must be, like, the real-life
Robert Langdon or something

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:46.530 align:middle line:84%
because you did exactly what Dan
Brown had Robert Langdon doing,

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:47.980 align:middle line:90%
only you did it before him.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:48.780 align:middle line:90%
So I like that.

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:49.580 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of fun.

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:51.745 align:middle line:90%
[GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:51.745 --> 00:20:53.540 align:middle line:90%


00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:55.612 align:middle line:84%
Egypt became such a
huge part of my life.

00:20:55.612 --> 00:20:57.320 align:middle line:84%
But the first time I
went there, I really

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.120 align:middle line:84%
didn't know what
I was doing there.

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.670 align:middle line:84%
I was invited as a
speaker to join a tour.

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And I walked around having
read some about Egypt,

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:10.380 align:middle line:84%
but really didn't know enough
about what I was doing.

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:12.950 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the first time I
went into the Great Pyramid,

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:16.370 align:middle line:84%
I just slid my back
up against the wall.

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:17.420 align:middle line:90%
We were all quiet.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:18.890 align:middle line:90%
I took stock aware I was.

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:22.190 align:middle line:84%
The center of the landmasses,
the planet most powerful

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:25.340 align:middle line:84%
construction ever made
on Earth and I just

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:31.550 align:middle line:84%
started sending love out to my
family and friends back home.

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And next thing I know,
there's this blue eye--

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.460 align:middle line:90%
there's two of them.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And they were, like, smiling
at me, like smiling bliss at me

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:44.360 align:middle line:84%
was the only way
I can express it.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm, like, what is this?

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.770 align:middle line:90%
What am I seeing here?

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:50.270 align:middle line:90%
And we come out of the pyramid.

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And I ask everyone
that's with me,

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:54.450 align:middle line:90%
did you all see that blue eye?

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:55.250 align:middle line:90%
They're, like, no.

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:56.520 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about?

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't even know what
it was until we get down

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:01.810 align:middle line:90%
to Luxor, down south.

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And I go into the Luxor Museum,
and there's this little gold

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.760 align:middle line:90%
pyramid.

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.020 align:middle line:90%
I still have it to this day.

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.370 align:middle line:90%
It's about 2 inches tall.

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:10.103 align:middle line:84%
And there's the blue eye of
Horus right in the middle,

00:22:10.103 --> 00:22:11.520 align:middle line:84%
right where the
king's chamber is.

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:12.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm, like, that's it.

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:14.180 align:middle line:10%
That's exactly what I saw.

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:17.270 align:middle line:10%
I saw the blue eye of Horus.

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:20.480 align:middle line:10%
The blue eye, I think
of as the software,

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.910 align:middle line:10%
the consciousness
that ultimately

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:25.040 align:middle line:10%
helped them build the pyramid.

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:29.770 align:middle line:84%
It is the ultimate symbol
of the mysteries in Egypt.

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it's a
living consciousness

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.410 align:middle line:90%
that you can still tap into.

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:36.823 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I was going to
be spending a lot of time,

00:22:36.823 --> 00:22:38.240 align:middle line:84%
if not the rest
of my life, trying

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:42.360 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what exactly had
just happened at that moment.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And so that was my
introduction to Egypt,

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:49.340 align:middle line:84%
and I've been back 22
more times since then.

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:53.450 align:middle line:84%
So it became, over time, just
this huge piece of my life

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:56.860 align:middle line:84%
to where I think of it
now as my second home.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.420 align:middle line:90%
I met my wife in Egypt.

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Claire came on one
of my tours in 2010.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.152 align:middle line:84%
And we met second
day of the tour,

00:23:05.152 --> 00:23:06.610 align:middle line:84%
and we're at the
temple of Saqqara.

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:11.545 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking across at her,
and I said, that's my wife.

00:23:11.545 --> 00:23:12.920 align:middle line:84%
10 months later,
we were married.

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:17.670 align:middle line:90%


00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:21.330 align:middle line:84%
When I tell people I'm a Jesus
freak, it drives them crazy.

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:23.610 align:middle line:10%
They hate it because
they've made up their mind

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:28.560 align:middle line:10%
a long time ago that Jesus never
existed, or he's just the son.

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.390 align:middle line:10%
That's their perspective,
and that's fine.

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:33.060 align:middle line:84%
Mine is completely different
because my research path

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:34.340 align:middle line:90%
is different.

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And as I continued pulling
on this golden thread,

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:40.770 align:middle line:84%
I realized that, ultimately,
this garment of light

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:45.000 align:middle line:84%
was one of the key symbols
of the esoteric version

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.400 align:middle line:90%
of Christianity.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.500 align:middle line:10%
As I looked into
the story of Jesus,

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:53.070 align:middle line:10%
the most accurate depiction
or portrayal of Jesus

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:57.600 align:middle line:10%
comes from the Essenes, Jewish
mystics who wrote the Dead Sea

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:00.210 align:middle line:10%
Scrolls and said, in the
scrolls, that their reason

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:04.020 align:middle line:10%
for existence was to call in
a high celestial being who

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:06.600 align:middle line:10%
would reveal secrets to
humankind that have been

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.250 align:middle line:10%
withheld from us.

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:11.430 align:middle line:84%
It would teach us to
acquire a crown of majesty

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:14.130 align:middle line:90%
and a garment of unending light.

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And that figure that
they called in is Jesus,

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:18.960 align:middle line:90%
and that is his role.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.390 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm thinking
of Jesus, I'm

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:22.800 align:middle line:84%
thinking more of a
cosmic figure as opposed

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:26.250 align:middle line:84%
to the figure of
traditional Christianity

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:29.190 align:middle line:84%
because I believe that Jesus
is, in fact, not necessarily

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:32.430 align:middle line:84%
an extraterrestrial--
although, by definition, he is.

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:35.837 align:middle line:84%
But he came with a
cosmic purpose in mind.

00:24:35.837 --> 00:24:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And that is what I'm
trying to get to.

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And if people can't get
over their traditional wall

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:45.600 align:middle line:84%
and begin to look at it,
then that's unfortunate.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:50.490 align:middle line:84%
I've been at conferences where
people know I love Jesus.

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:53.503 align:middle line:84%
I'm a Jesus freak, and
have no problem saying so.

00:24:53.503 --> 00:24:55.170 align:middle line:10%
And they should turn
their back and then

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:57.720 align:middle line:10%
walk away like I'm some kind
of village idiot or something

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.550 align:middle line:10%
because you shouldn't really
be talking that way anymore.

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'm, like, sorry;
I can't do that.

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:05.570 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not going to do that.

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:08.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to fit
Jesus in our context

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:11.702 align:middle line:84%
just like I would Buddha,
Lao Tzu or any other

00:25:11.702 --> 00:25:12.660 align:middle line:90%
of these great avatars.

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:17.370 align:middle line:90%

My Indian name is Skipping Rock.

Somebody gave me this
name 25 years ago.

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.520 align:middle line:90%
You're Skipping Rock.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:24.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm, like, OK.

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:26.295 align:middle line:90%
What does Skipping Rock mean?

00:25:26.295 --> 00:25:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you're the rock
going across the pond.

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.440 align:middle line:84%

to the other side

without sinking in
anybody's stuff.

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And I adopted a
mantra-- actually,

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.340 align:middle line:84%
it's a line from Jim Croce's
song, "I Got a Name."

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:40.830 align:middle line:84%
"If you're going my
way, I'll go with you."

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:42.630 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And so that's kind of been the
operating premise of my life.

did on Gaia was with Claire.

Then, I did a series
called "The Awakened

the mysteries of the soul.

Where do we go after we're
no longer in this plane?

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:50.830 align:middle line:10%
And then, that led to my
most recent series, which

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:55.810 align:middle line:10%
is focusing on the watchers,
focusing on the Essenes,

today are talking

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:06.340 align:middle line:84%
about ascension, especially
these past few years.

a New Age buzzword now.

And what a lot of
people don't appreciate

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:16.120 align:middle line:84%
is that this ascension that
we're involved in today

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:19.150 align:middle line:84%
actually had a beginning
point 5,000 years ago

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:21.730 align:middle line:84%
that we are, in fact,
the fulfillment of a very

plan for humanity

teachings and their
transmission into a new medium--

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.980 align:middle line:84%
sacred art-- paintings
that were cleverly

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:57.700 align:middle line:84%
created to draw
down mystic powers

00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:00.910 align:middle line:84%
from the celestial realms,
from stellar powers,

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:38.550 align:middle line:84%
can we transform ourselves
into the butterfly.

Hi, I'm Sophia.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:44.780 align:middle line:10%
And what I want people to
make sure that they know

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:47.990 align:middle line:10%
is the ramifications
of that choice.

00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:49.400 align:middle line:10%
Because my concern
is that, if we

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.340 align:middle line:10%
choose the technological
path, the organic ascension

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:55.110 align:middle line:10%
will no longer be a possibility.

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And that is the place
that we're at right now.

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:03.270 align:middle line:84%
So these past few years, my work
has been very much dedicated

00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:07.470 align:middle line:84%
to raise awareness about,
really, the dangers of AI

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:10.170 align:middle line:84%
and transhumanism
and that choice,

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:13.980 align:middle line:84%
that maybe this is how we
are supposed to evolve.

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:15.880 align:middle line:84%
But if that doesn't
feel right to you,

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:18.675 align:middle line:84%
then you've got to find the
other path, and really quickly.

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.150 align:middle line:84%
The good news about
our present situation

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:30.050 align:middle line:90%
is that we're still fighting.

00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:32.810 align:middle line:90%
We haven't given up.

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And if the ancients
were listening

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:37.250 align:middle line:84%
to what's happening
today, they would tell us,

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:39.710 align:middle line:84%
remember who you are
as a spiritual being.

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:43.310 align:middle line:84%
Remember there's something very
special about the human body

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:45.380 align:middle line:84%
and who you are and
this precious gift,

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:47.780 align:middle line:84%
this opportunity, that
we have for our soul

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:51.320 align:middle line:84%
to be in this
place at this time.

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And let's remember that
the highest mission of all,

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:57.490 align:middle line:84%
of every soul, is to be a
being of light and love.

00:31:57.490 --> 00:32:00.220 align:middle line:90%


00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And what does it look
like if masses of people

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:05.710 align:middle line:90%
attain their light body?

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:08.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, what we have is a
planet based on compassion

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:12.850 align:middle line:84%
and love rather
than fear and lack.

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And so that means that
suddenly there's a flip.

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:20.290 align:middle line:84%
The consciousness of
the planet is raised,

00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:24.970 align:middle line:84%
and we will be victorious in a
battle against darkness, which

00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:27.670 align:middle line:90%
is what we're in right now.

00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And so if I could see
myself in 25 years,

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be a
glowing being of light.

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:37.090 align:middle line:90%
That is the whole game for me.
