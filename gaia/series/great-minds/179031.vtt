00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.490 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Nassim Haramein.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.590 align:middle line:10%
I'm a researcher
in unified physics.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.470 align:middle line:10%
I'm the Director of Research
at the Resonance Science

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.690 align:middle line:10%
Foundation.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.160 align:middle line:10%
And I'm the Executive
Director of R&D at Torus Tech.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.160 align:middle line:10%
The "Holographic
Mass" paper was really

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.950 align:middle line:10%
an extension of a
nerdier paper in which

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.870 align:middle line:10%
I was making calculations
about the nuclei of atoms,

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.600 align:middle line:10%
the proton.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And its capacity to create
nucleis throughout the table

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.280 align:middle line:84%
of elements, that is the
capacity of confining protons

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.080 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.100 align:middle line:84%
That is, protons are
positively charged.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And just like when you
bring two magnets together

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.300 align:middle line:84%
of the same polarity,
they want to repel,

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.580 align:middle line:84%
and they want to
repel very strongly.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.310 align:middle line:84%
Protons are highly
charged and they're

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.880 align:middle line:84%
squished together in
a very small radius

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.740 align:middle line:90%
of the nuclei of an atom.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And so these forces
are extreme that

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.250 align:middle line:84%
keep it there
against the repulsion

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.590 align:middle line:84%
they should experience
from their charge.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.620 align:middle line:84%
That force is not well
described in quantum theory.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And I was coming from
more of cosmology approach

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.920 align:middle line:84%
and the physics that I was
applying kind of worked

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.420 align:middle line:90%
in this earlier paper.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.520 align:middle line:84%
That is, I start to describe the
little proton as a black hole,

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.020 align:middle line:84%
as a mini-black hole, a
teeny, weeny black hole,

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.660 align:middle line:84%
because it has a lot
of those qualities.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And when I calculated, I
calculated the strength

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.530 align:middle line:84%
that a little mini-black
hole the size of a proton

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.010 align:middle line:84%
would have in terms of its
gravitational attraction

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.030 align:middle line:90%
to another proton.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And it matched--
not approximately--

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.010 align:middle line:84%
it matched exactly
that force that

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.040 align:middle line:84%
seems to be holding
the protons together

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.390 align:middle line:90%
in the nuclei of the atom.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.150 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, this is very
interesting and it cannot be

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.950 align:middle line:90%
a coincidence.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And it led, eventually, to
the "Holographic Mass" paper

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.510 align:middle line:84%
because I had to explain
how the little proton could

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.770 align:middle line:84%
be a black hole, although it
doesn't have the mass that you

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.210 align:middle line:90%
would expect from a black hole.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.770 align:middle line:90%


00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.230 align:middle line:84%
It is a different kind of black
hole than the black holes that

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.060 align:middle line:90%
are typically described.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.450 align:middle line:84%
In astrophysics,
the black holes are

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.540 align:middle line:84%
thought to be these monsters
that are absorbing everything

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.650 align:middle line:90%
around them.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.940 align:middle line:84%
My physics and how I
looked at these objects,

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.520 align:middle line:84%
even in terms of
astrophysics, I started

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.670 align:middle line:84%
to think about them in a
little bit different ways

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.300 align:middle line:84%
because I added
spin and Coriolis

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.260 align:middle line:84%
effect in the
structure of spacetime

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.060 align:middle line:90%
to make these black holes spin.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And I calculated how fast
it would be spinning.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And I started to realize that
actually, very little material

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.010 align:middle line:84%
could fall in a black hole
because it would get flung out,

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.820 align:middle line:84%
if you'd like, from
Coriolis forces

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.530 align:middle line:84%
and from centrifugal
forces, and so that very

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.270 align:middle line:90%
little material could fall in.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And I started to describe
these things early on.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And actually, this has
been confirmed now.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.580 align:middle line:84%
We're starting to see from
astrophysical black hole

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.610 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, the
center of galaxies,

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.810 align:middle line:90%
that they spin very, very fast.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.080 align:middle line:84%
Some of the latest
measurements show black holes

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.590 align:middle line:84%
at the center of galaxies, which
are huge, spinning at some 85%

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.220 align:middle line:84%
of the speed of light,
it's remarkable,

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.870 align:middle line:84%
and that very little matter
can fall in at those speeds.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.250 align:middle line:10%
And so I was looking
at the nuclei of atoms,

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.270 align:middle line:10%
and I was finding that there
was a lot of relationship,

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.610 align:middle line:10%
the way the nuclei behaves.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that
I should apply this.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.020 align:middle line:84%
But when I did, I
had to describe it

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.140 align:middle line:90%
a little differently.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.670 align:middle line:10%
And this is why a movie
was published called "Black

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:50.400 align:middle line:10%
Wholes," W-H-O-L-E, because
it's no longer a hole in space.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.850 align:middle line:84%
It's actually-- it's
a different animal.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.720 align:middle line:84%
Because when I had applied
it at the quantum level

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.110 align:middle line:84%
and I calculated a
little bit differently

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.430 align:middle line:84%
than astrophysical black
holes, I found a new solution

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.170 align:middle line:90%
to Einstein field equation.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:13.440 align:middle line:84%
That is, Einstein's equation
predicted black holes.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.390 align:middle line:84%
Einstein himself, then,
think they existed.

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:21.450 align:middle line:84%
He thought part of his
general relativistic equation

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:27.000 align:middle line:84%
was wrong, like that was just
a mathematical problem, not

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.280 align:middle line:84%
actual physical thing
that you could find

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.520 align:middle line:90%
a singularity in the universe.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.620 align:middle line:84%
Of course at this time, it
was inconceivable those things

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.420 align:middle line:90%
would exist.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.900 align:middle line:84%
So in general, that part of
his equations were ignored.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.280 align:middle line:10%
John Wheeler, later on,
coined the term black hole,

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.640 align:middle line:10%
and started to write the math
of what that singularity would

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.840 align:middle line:10%
look like.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.930 align:middle line:10%
And eventually, black
holes were found,

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.840 align:middle line:10%
mostly in the center
of all galaxies, which

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.310 align:middle line:10%
my equations predicted.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:03.870 align:middle line:84%
But as well, it was found that
black holes have a quantum

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:04.770 align:middle line:90%
interaction.

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.780 align:middle line:10%
That is, that the surface--

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.430 align:middle line:10%
this is called
the event horizon.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.370 align:middle line:10%
This is the boundary
in which light

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.990 align:middle line:10%
is no longer able to escape.

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.690 align:middle line:10%
It's sucked into
the singularity.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.750 align:middle line:10%
That boundary is
actually made up

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.530 align:middle line:10%
of little Planck
pixels, little pieces

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:27.360 align:middle line:10%
of information of all the stuff
that fell into the black hole.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And this mathematical
solution to black holes

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:37.090 align:middle line:84%
was actually thought to
be a holographic solution.

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the holographic
approach was first born.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.960 align:middle line:10%
And you might have
seen on magazines,

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.880 align:middle line:10%
do we live in a
holographic universe?

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.260 align:middle line:10%
It became more and more popular.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.170 align:middle line:84%
So I applied that
solution, but a little bit

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:56.640 align:middle line:84%
differently to the nuclei of an
atom, that we call the proton.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.660 align:middle line:10%
And when I did, something
remarkable happened.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.600 align:middle line:84%
I didn't do it the way
the standard model was

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.570 align:middle line:90%
doing the holographic solution.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:10.020 align:middle line:84%
But I made the little
pixels little spheres.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And I calculated how
many of these pixels

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.540 align:middle line:84%
were on the surface of
a proton and how many

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.640 align:middle line:90%
were on the inside.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And when I did that,
something remarkable

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:24.750 align:middle line:84%
happened because the
energy, or the mass

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:29.370 align:middle line:84%
of all the little Planck spheres
that would be inside a proton

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:33.660 align:middle line:84%
was the exact mass of all the
other protons in the universe.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.620 align:middle line:10%
That is, the mass of the
universe was inside one proton.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.500 align:middle line:90%


00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.840 align:middle line:84%
That made it
significantly holographic.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.030 align:middle line:90%
That made it really holographic.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:50.190 align:middle line:84%
Not just as an analogical
terminology, but actually

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:53.290 align:middle line:84%
really holographic,
in which every proton

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.600 align:middle line:84%
had the information of
all the other protons.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, if the mass
of the universe in terms

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:00.460 align:middle line:84%
of information is
inside one proton,

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.290 align:middle line:90%
it made it a black hole.

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:04.120 align:middle line:10%
Of course, when
I published this,

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.240 align:middle line:10%
it was very difficult
for people to accept.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.180 align:middle line:10%
I had to be able to
explain, how is it

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.940 align:middle line:10%
that the proton has
such an incredible mass?

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.160 align:middle line:90%
So I started to think about it.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, well, if the
mass is inside the black hole,

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:19.812 align:middle line:90%
you can't measure it.

00:08:19.812 --> 00:08:20.770 align:middle line:90%
What are you measuring?

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.530 align:middle line:84%
You're measuring
the relationship

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:26.090 align:middle line:90%
of that mass with its surface.

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:29.080 align:middle line:84%
So then I counted how
many of these little bits

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.650 align:middle line:84%
of information are
on the surface,

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:34.539 align:middle line:90%
the holographic surface?

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And I made the relationship
between the information that's

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:41.030 align:middle line:84%
inside and the information
that's outside on the surface.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And so how much
information is actually

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:47.610 align:middle line:84%
able to reach us, in terms
of their relationship?

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'll put it exactly
the mass of the proton,

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.980 align:middle line:90%
but I mean, exactly.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:56.860 align:middle line:84%
So now you imagine,
you have an equation

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:01.000 align:middle line:84%
that involves the mass of
the universe, which is huge.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And by the time you're done with
the simple ratio relationship,

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:08.650 align:middle line:84%
you output the exact mass of
the object you are observing,

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:10.670 align:middle line:90%
or that you're measuring.

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:13.150 align:middle line:84%
So and from those
equation, then I

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:16.570 align:middle line:84%
was able to predict what
exactly the radius should be.

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I made that
prediction that eventually

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:22.900 align:middle line:84%
was measured in a laboratory in
an accelerator in Switzerland,

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:24.370 align:middle line:90%
and confirmed.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.560 align:middle line:90%
So it's very exciting.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.480 align:middle line:84%
And it says something
very fundamentally

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.580 align:middle line:90%
different about atoms.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:34.290 align:middle line:90%


00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:38.430 align:middle line:84%
This Schwarzschild Solution is
the solution that was given--

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.560 align:middle line:84%
it was the first
exact solution that

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.800 align:middle line:84%
was given to Einstein
field equations.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Einstein described
gravity by saying

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:53.910 align:middle line:84%
spacetime is curving in the
vicinity of mass or energy.

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:58.740 align:middle line:84%
So he took gravity
out of the object,

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:02.940 align:middle line:84%
basically, as was described
before him by Newton,

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.690 align:middle line:84%
saying that the object
was producing this force.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And he said, actually, it's
the mass of the object curving

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:14.190 align:middle line:84%
spacetime, curving the
structure around it.

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Like if you put a
ball on a trampoline,

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.690 align:middle line:90%
the surface tend to curve.

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And then if you
put another ball,

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.000 align:middle line:84%
it looks like it's attracted
because the surface is

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.110 align:middle line:90%
curved, right?

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:28.350 align:middle line:84%
So this is described as
the curvature of spacetime

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:29.760 align:middle line:90%
by Einstein.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.330 align:middle line:84%
He give the concept,
and it sounds simple,

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.470 align:middle line:84%
but it's hard to
describe in mathematics.

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:39.090 align:middle line:84%
So he had to go through
all sorts of gyration

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:43.230 align:middle line:84%
to actually describe the
elasticity of the membrane,

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.490 align:middle line:84%
and how it curves,
and all this stuff.

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:47.000 align:middle line:90%
So it was very complex.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.350 align:middle line:84%
When he wrote it,
they didn't solve it.

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:52.410 align:middle line:84%
Him and his collaborators
were not able to solve it,

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:55.110 align:middle line:84%
and so they published
it as a concept.

00:10:55.110 --> 00:11:01.890 align:middle line:10%
And this physicist that was
sick, bedridden at home,

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:04.050 align:middle line:10%
coming back from
the Russian front

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:08.700 align:middle line:10%
where he was fighting,
actually found Einstein papers

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.940 align:middle line:10%
within weeks of Einstein
publishing it, and thought,

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:13.110 align:middle line:10%
oh, I can solve that.

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And while very ill,
actually solved--

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:21.540 align:middle line:84%
Karl Schwarzschild solved
Einstein's field equation

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.400 align:middle line:90%
for the first exact solution.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.150 align:middle line:90%
And guess what it predicted?

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.450 align:middle line:90%
It predicted singularity.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:30.210 align:middle line:84%
It predicted that there
would be places in space

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:33.270 align:middle line:84%
where the mass would be so
high that not even light could

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:34.200 align:middle line:90%
escape.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And he sent it back, and
Einstein was pretty excited

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:41.670 align:middle line:90%
that it had been solved already.

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:44.910 align:middle line:84%
He thought maybe it would take
years and years before somebody

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:47.580 align:middle line:90%
would solve these equations.

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:51.360 align:middle line:84%
But he was very disappointed
that it predicted singularity

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.650 align:middle line:84%
because it was like, does that
mean this concept is wrong?

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:58.550 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean these equations
are wrong, and so on?

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:00.430 align:middle line:84%
So it produced
some doubt as well.

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:04.260 align:middle line:84%
But he succeeded in getting
the solution published,

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.990 align:middle line:84%
and that became the
Schwarzschild Solution

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:12.240 align:middle line:84%
to Einstein field equation that
is used widely in astrophysics

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:16.350 align:middle line:84%
everyday today to solve
for gravitational field,

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:19.210 align:middle line:84%
and how things orbit around
other things, and all

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:20.010 align:middle line:90%
this stuff.

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:25.440 align:middle line:84%
But it's commonly ignored when
we use them in those equations.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Like if we're trying to
figure out the Earth spinning

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:32.300 align:middle line:84%
around the sun, that, in fact,
if you look at the formulas,

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you look at the
equations very cleanly,

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:38.700 align:middle line:84%
very appropriately,
the equations

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.100 align:middle line:84%
are actually making
the sun a black hole

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.140 align:middle line:84%
and making the
earth a black hole.

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And then looking at the
relationship between these two

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:49.200 align:middle line:84%
black holes, it kind
of struck me right away

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:53.010 align:middle line:84%
that this is not so
understood, actually.

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:57.240 align:middle line:84%
Why is this happening
and what is it

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.250 align:middle line:90%
telling us about the universe?

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:01.770 align:middle line:84%
So I used the
Schwarzschild equation

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:03.910 align:middle line:84%
to eventually
describe the proton.

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:06.240 align:middle line:84%
I called it the
Schwarzschild proton.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.590 align:middle line:84%
I basically said, you could
have called it the black hole

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:12.450 align:middle line:84%
proton, but I was trying
to at least not be

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:14.880 align:middle line:90%
so abrasive to the mainstream.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.180 align:middle line:84%
To the layman, or even to
many physicists out there,

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:23.250 align:middle line:84%
what I'm saying right now may
sound like heresy or craziness.

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:26.070 align:middle line:84%
But I assure you that more
and more physicists are now

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:29.040 align:middle line:90%
coming to the same conclusions.

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:32.800 align:middle line:90%


00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.610 align:middle line:84%
It actually says
something really

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:36.890 align:middle line:84%
interesting about
our universe and how

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:39.260 align:middle line:84%
matter production is
occurring, and how

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.300 align:middle line:90%
our universe came to be.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:44.630 align:middle line:10%
If you actually look at
the cosmological horizon,

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:49.100 align:middle line:10%
that is the boundary that
we think our universe is,

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:50.480 align:middle line:10%
the radius of our universe.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.300 align:middle line:84%
So there's something really
interesting about that

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.250 align:middle line:90%
and I found that very early on.

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:58.300 align:middle line:84%
I was calculating with the
Schwarzschild solution,

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.650 align:middle line:84%
the solution that describes
black holes, the solution

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:02.220 align:middle line:90%
to Einstein field equation.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:06.140 align:middle line:84%
If you take the
horizon radius, so

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:08.360 align:middle line:84%
if you take our
universe's radius,

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.880 align:middle line:84%
and you plug it
into the equation,

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.340 align:middle line:84%
it gives you exactly the
mass we see in the universe.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:20.380 align:middle line:84%
So that is, the universe obeys
the condition of a black hole.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:22.760 align:middle line:84%
Now you'd say, well,
how can that be?

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.790 align:middle line:84%
A black hole supposed to
be super dense and super

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:27.260 align:middle line:90%
energetic, and so on.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.240 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't look so
dense out there.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's because it's
a huge bubble, right?

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:35.360 align:middle line:84%
The universe is extremely large,
has billions of galaxies in it.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And each galaxy have billions
of stars in it and all this.

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:41.870 align:middle line:84%
So a large black
hole doesn't have

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:45.050 align:middle line:84%
to be so dense to
have enough mass

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:46.610 align:middle line:90%
to be considered a black hole.

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:51.215 align:middle line:84%
For instance, cosmological black
holes at the center of galaxies

00:14:51.215 --> 00:14:55.850 align:middle line:84%
have about the density of water,
the super-massive black holes

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:57.540 align:middle line:90%
in the center of the galaxy.

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:01.250 align:middle line:84%
So it's really
interesting that we have

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:03.950 align:middle line:90%
black holes inside black holes.

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And solutions in
physics have been

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.810 align:middle line:84%
shown that you can have worlds
living inside black holes.

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:10.880 align:middle line:84%
You can have orbitals
and all this stuff--

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.800 align:middle line:84%
not from me, from
other physicists.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.230 align:middle line:90%
But as well, now you have--

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:19.190 align:middle line:84%
remember the fractal structures,
like fractal black hole

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:24.380 align:middle line:84%
structures from very large
to smaller, galactic-centered

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:27.260 align:middle line:84%
and standard black holes,
and so on, and then

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.930 align:middle line:84%
atomic black holes,
mini-black holes and so on.

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And so I started to
calculate all this,

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:36.570 align:middle line:84%
and some really remarkable
things happened.

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:40.880 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, if I calculated
how many bits of information

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.880 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of every
proton in the universe,

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.710 align:middle line:84%
I got the number
of bits that are

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:52.410 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of the horizon
of our universal black hole.

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And so that there was a
one-to-one relationship

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.110 align:middle line:84%
between all the
information that's

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:59.870 align:middle line:84%
emitted from the protons
inside the universe

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:02.070 align:middle line:90%
to the surface of our universe.

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
to calculate well,

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:11.120 align:middle line:84%
what if our universe was a
proton that swelled up, right?

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:15.440 align:middle line:84%
So then I shrunk our universe
into the size of a proton

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.890 align:middle line:84%
and I got the exact
amount of information

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:21.750 align:middle line:84%
that I was calculating
inside a proton.

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:24.710 align:middle line:84%
So that is, if you take
a proton and you grow it

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:28.070 align:middle line:84%
to the size of our universe,
you get exactly what

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:32.840 align:middle line:84%
is called dark energy, or the
energy we see in our universe,

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:37.370 align:middle line:84%
in space, which is the majority
of the mass of our universe.

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:40.130 align:middle line:84%
So it comes out just
right, and so all

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:42.530 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden it's
like, oh this is

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:45.510 align:middle line:84%
where dark matter or
dark energy comes from.

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And so I started to
think about it and I--

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.920 align:middle line:90%
this is actually unpublished.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.450 align:middle line:84%
I am publishing
papers now showing

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:57.390 align:middle line:84%
that our universe
could have been

00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:59.705 align:middle line:90%
a proton in another universe.

00:16:59.705 --> 00:17:03.110 align:middle line:84%
So imagine a bubble
universe, OK,

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:06.200 align:middle line:84%
and you have got a proton
in there and it escapes?

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And when it escapes,
its escaping

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:13.190 align:middle line:84%
in a larger bubble in which
the density is much lower.

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And so the inside density of
that proton pushes it out,

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:24.319 align:middle line:84%
inflates it very, very quickly
to the size of our universe.

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And so now you could
imagine universes foaming

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.670 align:middle line:84%
off the surface of
other universes.

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And when I was writing this,
which I started in 2013--

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:36.140 align:middle line:84%
I know I'm writing slow
these papers because there's

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.070 align:middle line:90%
some complexity.

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:41.010 align:middle line:10%
But remarkably,
at the same time,

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:45.110 align:middle line:10%
Einstein published
a paper in 2013.

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Most people know that
Einstein hasn't been around,

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:49.070 align:middle line:90%
so how is he publishing papers?

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, there was a
paper that was lost

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:53.790 align:middle line:90%
and that was found in 2013.

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly,
in this paper,

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Einstein was giving
a counter-argument

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:02.975 align:middle line:84%
to the Big Bang
approach, saying that it

00:18:02.975 --> 00:18:07.760 align:middle line:84%
was most likely proton are
being created from the vacuum

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:12.050 align:middle line:84%
fluctuation, from these
Planck oscillators in space,

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:15.140 align:middle line:84%
and that proton are
escaping our universe,

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:18.960 align:middle line:84%
describing our universe as a
continuous creation process.

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:22.850 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really happy
that I can cite Einstein

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:29.990 align:middle line:84%
in my paper, Einstein 2013, in
my paper, and it's remarkable.

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:34.220 align:middle line:84%
I think it opens the door to
a completely different view

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:40.010 align:middle line:84%
of matter creation and of
cosmological evolution that

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:44.360 align:middle line:84%
doesn't involve a big bang, but
actually a continuous creation

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:48.800 align:middle line:84%
process occurring at
incredibly large scales,

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.670 align:middle line:84%
and all the way down to
incredibly small scales.

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:54.200 align:middle line:90%


00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:58.970 align:middle line:84%
This, actually, is the
ultimate as above, so below.

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:02.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's actually
the mathematical equation

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:06.680 align:middle line:84%
that proved that that concept,
that statement that everything

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:12.410 align:middle line:84%
is connected, is not just a
philosophical idea, not just

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:15.370 align:middle line:84%
a bunch of stuff that a
bunch of spiritual masters

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:19.700 align:middle line:84%
have said through history, but
actually is the way things are.

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.070 align:middle line:84%
That actually, that's
how mass emerged, that's

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:27.540 align:middle line:84%
how gravity's produced, out
of this fundamental idea

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:31.560 align:middle line:84%
that everything is connected,
that from any point,

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.710 align:middle line:84%
you have access to
any other point,

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:38.570 align:middle line:84%
is very, very fundamental
to this theory.

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:40.400 align:middle line:84%
But what is powerful
is that it's

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.020 align:middle line:84%
no longer just a philosophy,
a concept out there.

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:47.150 align:middle line:90%
But it is the way things work.

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:49.820 align:middle line:90%
It is how the world comes to be.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:54.260 align:middle line:84%
This is how you're made
and why you organize

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.570 align:middle line:84%
into such a complex
being, and you're

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:59.540 align:middle line:84%
able to actually reflect
on that complexity

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:04.076 align:middle line:84%
itself, which is a
remarkable thing.

00:20:04.076 --> 00:20:05.450 align:middle line:10%
It's interesting
because when you

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:08.630 align:middle line:10%
look at the life and the
research of Isaac Newton

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:10.700 align:middle line:10%
and what we know in
modern times now,

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:12.740 align:middle line:10%
that this was unknown
for a very long time

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.540 align:middle line:10%
because it was censored.

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:18.170 align:middle line:84%
But his private writings
have reemerged now,

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:21.380 align:middle line:84%
and we know that he
was very much involved

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:26.090 align:middle line:84%
in alchemy and the study of
various ancient civilizations,

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:30.550 align:middle line:84%
very much as well ancient
Hebrewaic traditions.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:33.410 align:middle line:84%
He learned ancient Hebrew
to decode his own text.

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:36.640 align:middle line:84%
He built replicas of
the Temple of Solomon.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.960 align:middle line:10%
He believed,
literally, that there

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:43.310 align:middle line:10%
was solutions in the geometry
of the Temple of Solomon

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:46.370 align:middle line:10%
that explain gravity, and
that if we could decode it,

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:49.130 align:middle line:10%
we would understand
gravity at a deeper level.

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:56.090 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, I had a similar
path in that, early on,

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:59.870 align:middle line:84%
since I was not confined by
the institutional structure,

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:05.420 align:middle line:84%
I was studying independently,
I studied ancient civilization

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:08.270 align:middle line:84%
because I was finding parallels
between what I was finding

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:12.600 align:middle line:84%
in physics and what was
present in ancient texts

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:16.460 align:middle line:84%
all from all around the world,
from many different cultures.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:23.150 align:middle line:84%
This idea that you find
in these ancient views

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:28.010 align:middle line:84%
is that there is
a way to influence

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:33.620 align:middle line:84%
matter and energy in such a
way to make them work for you.

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And what happens in
this new view of physics

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:43.070 align:middle line:84%
is that, yes there is, like the
idea of chi, the idea of mana,

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:46.950 align:middle line:84%
the idea of this
field of energy that's

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:49.790 align:middle line:84%
in space that you can
influence is absolutely

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:51.930 align:middle line:90%
present in these new physics.

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:55.150 align:middle line:84%
It actually flushes
out the mathematics

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:57.290 align:middle line:90%
on how it does this stuff.

00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And so it leads to very advanced
technology, funny enough,

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:09.930 align:middle line:84%
based on very ancient knowing
that was present all along.

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And I believe
Newton instinctively

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:17.750 align:middle line:84%
knew it was in there somewhere,
and worked most of his time

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:18.800 align:middle line:90%
on this.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And actually, what he
produced in his laws of motion

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.450 align:middle line:84%
and entropy and
gravity and so on,

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:26.420 align:middle line:84%
is actually like a
side chapter for him.

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:28.640 align:middle line:84%
His main interest
was to understand

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:34.160 align:middle line:84%
how to get chemical formulas
to influence matter and energy.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that there's
a lot of validity there.

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:42.360 align:middle line:84%
And the exciting part is that
if this theory is confirmed,

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:46.320 align:middle line:84%
and is confirmed by experiments
now, so it's very strong,

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:50.450 align:middle line:84%
give legitimacy to this
concept-- for instance,

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:53.540 align:middle line:84%
everything is connected,
everything is one--

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:55.610 align:middle line:90%
but in a very grounded way.

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And it leads to the application
of these understanding,

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:03.200 align:middle line:84%
these ancient understanding
to very advanced technology

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.480 align:middle line:84%
that could bring us to
the stars, literally.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:10.370 align:middle line:84%
That can allow us to birth our
civilization into the universe,

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:15.890 align:middle line:84%
into our galaxy, into space
travel, wormhole creation,

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:17.810 align:middle line:90%
the sky is no longer the limit.

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:21.890 align:middle line:84%
It's beyond the sky, and
so it's very exciting.

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:26.560 align:middle line:90%


00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:29.910 align:middle line:84%
I think, fundamentally,
what I'm publishing,

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:34.740 align:middle line:84%
how it's changing people's
lives, other than the physics

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:39.870 align:middle line:84%
understanding of reality,
is that it empowers people

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:45.540 align:middle line:84%
to understand that they have
an impact, that they do matter,

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:47.740 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES] if I can use the pun.

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And that the matter that they're
made of is where it's at,

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:53.160 align:middle line:84%
meaning spiritual
people have a tendency

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.590 align:middle line:84%
to think that it's
outside themselves.

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:59.610 align:middle line:84%
True, but your
physicalness is actually

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:01.710 align:middle line:84%
where you can connect
to that field,

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:04.110 align:middle line:84%
and that's the place
you want to be in.

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:07.110 align:middle line:84%
That's why so many
ancient masters talked

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:10.200 align:middle line:84%
about going inwards
and turning your senses

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.200 align:middle line:84%
inward, because that's
where your seat of power

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.000 align:middle line:90%
is, inside of you.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And so people get
the mechanisms,

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:20.940 align:middle line:84%
that this is not just
some nice philosophy,

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:24.000 align:middle line:84%
or I'm just going
to do my nice yoga,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.090 align:middle line:84%
or I'm going to do that nice
meditation because it kind

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:29.160 align:middle line:90%
of calms me down and it's nice.

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:33.480 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually,
wow, I could have

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:40.470 align:middle line:84%
all of the power available to
me in the universe present in me

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:42.630 align:middle line:90%
in each one of my atoms.

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:45.780 align:middle line:84%
If I can reach that,
if I can connect

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:50.580 align:middle line:84%
with that at a deep level, I can
have this incredible influence

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.560 align:middle line:90%
on the world around me.

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And so it empowers people
to understand they matter

00:24:56.190 --> 00:25:00.210 align:middle line:84%
and they are amazing
miracles of nature,

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:02.900 align:middle line:90%
and these mechanisms are real.

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:05.050 align:middle line:90%
