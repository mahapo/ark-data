00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.730 align:middle line:10%
>> My name is Darryl Anka.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.810 align:middle line:10%
I am the channel for an
entity known as Bashar.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.590 align:middle line:10%
I am also a writer,
producer, director.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.130 align:middle line:84%
As a young boy, I've always
been artistically inclined.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.520 align:middle line:84%
I could start drawing as soon as
I could pick up a pencil, when

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.390 align:middle line:90%
I was 2-years-old.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.110 align:middle line:84%
But I had an incident that
happened at 3-years-old

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.290 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't remember
until much later in my life.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And I was playing in the living
room of my parents' home.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- one of those things
where kids make a fort with

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.837 align:middle line:90%
a card table and a blanket--

00:01:01.837 --> 00:01:02.670 align:middle line:90%
I was underneath it.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.230 align:middle line:90%
I was drawing.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And what appeared
to me in mid air

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.600 align:middle line:84%
was this whirlpool of
light, just hanging there.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.500 align:middle line:84%
Now as a child, I didn't
think anything of it because I

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.230 align:middle line:84%
didn't know what was
normal and what wasn't.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.620 align:middle line:84%
But my perception is that there
was somebody communicating

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.630 align:middle line:84%
to me through that, as if it
was a window to somewhere else.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.480 align:middle line:84%
For me, that became
what I would consider

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.930 align:middle line:84%
to be the inciting incident
that indicated that there was

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.760 align:middle line:84%
some kind of an
agreement here that

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.640 align:middle line:84%
was going to unfold at
some point in my life, that

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.320 align:middle line:90%
had to do with the channeling.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.860 align:middle line:10%
But it didn't really get
triggered until 1973.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.790 align:middle line:10%
In 1973, I was in
my early 20s, when

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.840 align:middle line:10%
on two occasions in broad
daylight, a week apart,

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.250 align:middle line:10%
I had two very close UFO
sightings with friends

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.720 align:middle line:10%
with me both times.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.550 align:middle line:10%
The first time was only
about 125 feet away.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.450 align:middle line:10%
The second time was only
about 60 or 70 feet away.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.840 align:middle line:10%
Some kind of an advanced
technological ship.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.650 align:middle line:10%
No sound.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.990 align:middle line:10%
Being able to move
in unusual ways.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.000 align:middle line:10%
You don't think much of
it until you actually

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.418 align:middle line:10%
see something yourself.

00:02:13.418 --> 00:02:15.210 align:middle line:10%
And then your whole
world turns upside down

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.480 align:middle line:10%
because those things weren't
supposed to really exist.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.640 align:middle line:84%
But seeing something
like that solidly

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.350 align:middle line:84%
made me realize that things
were much different than we

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.150 align:middle line:90%
were being told.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.540 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to find
out more about it.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.980 align:middle line:84%
I started doing the
research, finding any book.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.740 align:middle line:90%
I could on UFO sightings.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And at that time in 1973,
the metaphysical section

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.870 align:middle line:90%
in bookstores wasn't very big.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.420 align:middle line:84%
You could probably find
everything on one shelf.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.470 align:middle line:90%
There was UFO stuff.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.558 align:middle line:90%
There was psychic stuff.

00:02:41.558 --> 00:02:42.975 align:middle line:10%
There was channeling
stuff. mostly

00:02:42.975 --> 00:02:45.560 align:middle line:10%
"The Seth Material"
at that time,

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.090 align:middle line:10%
was becoming pretty popular.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.240 align:middle line:84%
So I read all of that,
and I started just

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.650 align:middle line:90%
digesting all of this stuff.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And realizing that there was,
sort of, a whole other world

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.440 align:middle line:90%
going on here.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.650 align:middle line:84%
10 years after the
sighting, I was

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.250 align:middle line:84%
introduced to a channel
who was conducting seminars

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.570 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.100 align:middle line:84%
I went into the
class not because I

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.170 align:middle line:84%
thought I wanted to be a channel
in any way, shape, or form.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.462 align:middle line:84%
But I was curious as to how
channeling could be taught.

00:03:13.462 --> 00:03:15.087 align:middle line:84%
Because I just assumed
it was something

00:03:15.087 --> 00:03:17.190 align:middle line:84%
that just sort of happened
to you out of the blue.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.020 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted to
further my research

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.273 align:middle line:90%
so I went into the class.

00:03:20.273 --> 00:03:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And it was a series of
different guided meditations.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't like
you were necessarily

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.392 align:middle line:84%
expected to have to
channel with an entity.

00:03:26.392 --> 00:03:28.808 align:middle line:84%
But it was about getting in
touch with your creative side,

00:03:28.808 --> 00:03:29.970 align:middle line:90%
your own higher mind--

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.260 align:middle line:84%
however you wanted to
use the meditations.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.060 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.230 align:middle line:84%
But about halfway
through the course,

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.290 align:middle line:84%
we were in a particular
guided meditation

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.743 align:middle line:84%
being given by the entity
through the channel.

00:03:39.743 --> 00:03:41.160 align:middle line:84%
Something happened
that I can only

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.465 align:middle line:84%
describe as a kind of an instant
telepathic contact from Bashar.

00:03:45.465 --> 00:03:49.670 align:middle line:90%


00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.270 align:middle line:84%
It was like somebody just shoved
this information in my head

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.570 align:middle line:90%
in a split second.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.310 align:middle line:84%
I instantly remembered making
an agreement before this life

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.960 align:middle line:90%
to do this with him.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.750 align:middle line:84%
I understood the UFO had
been shown to me by him,

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.410 align:middle line:84%
to get me to start doing the
research that I needed to do.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.390 align:middle line:84%
So when it came time to
fulfill the agreement,

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.090 align:middle line:84%
I would have enough information
to not be afraid of it.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.450 align:middle line:84%
To be somewhat understanding
of what was happening.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.529 align:middle line:84%
And the message
basically was now

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:21.330 align:middle line:84%
you know it's time to begin,
is this something you still

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.130 align:middle line:90%
want to do?

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.530 align:middle line:90%
It was a choice.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.880 align:middle line:84%
Now all of this happened
in a split second.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.962 align:middle line:84%
It's like somebody
just took a DVD

00:04:27.962 --> 00:04:30.170 align:middle line:84%
and just shoved it in your
head, and suddenly, you've

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.910 align:middle line:90%
got the whole story.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And I thought OK,
am I hallucinating?

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.957 align:middle line:84%
Is this a side effect
of the meditation?

00:04:35.957 --> 00:04:37.290 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what was going on.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.810 align:middle line:84%
But the second this
was happening--

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.060 align:middle line:84%
because I hadn't said
anything out loud--

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.860 align:middle line:84%
the entity stopped
talking to the class,

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.023 align:middle line:90%
and turned right to me.

00:04:44.023 --> 00:04:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And said there is an
entity here for you

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.750 align:middle line:84%
right now, if you're
ready to begin.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And in that same moment, I
happened to glance behind me

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.700 align:middle line:84%
at one of the other
classmates had somehow

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.790 align:middle line:84%
picked up on the image of
Bashar I saw in my head.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And she was sketching it on
a piece of paper-- his face.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.560 align:middle line:84%
So I said, OK, this is
not just my imagination.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.570 align:middle line:90%
There's something going on here.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.390 align:middle line:84%
I guess I'll just
keep exploring,

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:06.780 align:middle line:90%
and see what happens.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.980 align:middle line:84%
So by the end of the
next class, a woman

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.520 align:middle line:84%
named Margot Chandler who
was doing the first thesis

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.210 align:middle line:84%
paper for her doctorate on the
connection between psychology

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.820 align:middle line:84%
and channeling, asked me
to be one of the subjects

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.580 align:middle line:84%
that she could study
to write her paper.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:23.877 align:middle line:90%
And so I would go to her house.

00:05:23.877 --> 00:05:26.210 align:middle line:84%
She would invite friends, I
would sit there and channel.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.630 align:middle line:84%
She would take her notes,
and write her paper.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.392 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first week, it
was like five friends.

00:05:32.392 --> 00:05:34.100 align:middle line:84%
Well the next week,
there was 10 friends,

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.390 align:middle line:84%
and then there would be 20
friends, and 30 friends.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And then we had to start
renting auditoriums

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.010 align:middle line:90%
to get all the people in.

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.435 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as people in other
cities and other countries

00:05:42.435 --> 00:05:44.060 align:middle line:84%
started hearing the
tapes, they started

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.270 align:middle line:84%
inviting me to travel to
their city or their country.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.140 align:middle line:84%
And here I am, 36 years
later, still doing this.

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:55.280 align:middle line:90%


00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.890 align:middle line:10%
So in a nutshell,
that was my journey

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.740 align:middle line:10%
as to how I wound up where
I am right now, channeling

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.660 align:middle line:10%
this entity that we call Bashar.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.460 align:middle line:10%
Good to day to you.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.460 align:middle line:10%
[NON-ENGLISH] How are you all?

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.650 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.990 align:middle line:90%


00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.790 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:19.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm his past self, he's a future
self as we look at linear time.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.880 align:middle line:90%
Bashar is not the entity's name.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.240 align:middle line:84%
In their reality, they're
telepathic with each other,

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.670 align:middle line:90%
they don't need names.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.940 align:middle line:84%
But he knew we needed
to call him something.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.050 align:middle line:84%
I am half Irish and half
Syrian, my father's side

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.400 align:middle line:90%
is Middle Eastern.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.890 align:middle line:90%
It is a Middle Eastern word.

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.330 align:middle line:84%
I didn't speak the language, I
still don't speak the language.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And I actually had to be told
two or three years after I

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.602 align:middle line:84%
started channeling,
when somebody did speak

00:06:49.602 --> 00:06:51.310 align:middle line:84%
the language, they
came up to me it said,

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.880 align:middle line:84%
do you understand
what Bashar means?

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.720 align:middle line:90%
And I said no, I have no idea.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.270 align:middle line:84%
He said it actually
is a Syrian word,

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.600 align:middle line:84%
it means messenger or
bringer of good news.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.130 align:middle line:90%
So I said, OK, I get it.

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.850 align:middle line:84%
He had to choose something out
of my background somewhere that

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.370 align:middle line:84%
is at least representative
of what he is doing.

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And allows us to
give him a name,

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.510 align:middle line:84%
even though it's not
literally his name.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is part of
these breadcrumbs

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.460 align:middle line:84%
that he drops for me
throughout my life that

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.470 align:middle line:84%
are a puzzle that
is just personally

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.070 align:middle line:90%
for me to pull together.

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:23.060 align:middle line:84%
But at least it allows
us to identify with him

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.260 align:middle line:90%
in some way, shape, or form.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And allow him to have a
normal back and forth.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:32.270 align:middle line:10%
This, for us, is
how contact begins.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:36.860 align:middle line:10%
By the dissemination of ideas,
reflections, and information

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:41.720 align:middle line:10%
that give you the opportunity
to absorb them at your own pace,

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.840 align:middle line:10%
in your own timing, at
your own discretion.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.990 align:middle line:10%
For we force no ideas upon you.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:51.200 align:middle line:84%
The feeling of
connecting with Bashar

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.690 align:middle line:84%
telepathically is,
like, I can describe it,

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.930 align:middle line:84%
like, it's a vibrational
resonance that

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:00.860 align:middle line:84%
is a particular frequency that
I recognize as not my own.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.340 align:middle line:84%
Or at least, a much
bigger part of me.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And I sort of liken it to
the idea of two tuning forks.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.860 align:middle line:84%
When you start one vibrating,
if they're keyed to each other,

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.690 align:middle line:84%
then the other one starts
vibrating in harmony.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as they
start matching frequency

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:21.560 align:middle line:84%
and vibrating together,
that's kind of what it's like.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.490 align:middle line:10%
So the channeling class,
as I understood it,

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:30.170 align:middle line:10%
ultimately was training you to
shift your brainwave frequency

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:33.890 align:middle line:10%
to a point where you
go into a state called

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:38.400 align:middle line:10%
gamma, which is about 40 to 45
or 40 to 100 cycles per second.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.230 align:middle line:84%
But I stay in the range of about
40 to 45 when I'm channeling.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And then Bashar
makes an adjustment

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:45.350 align:middle line:90%
in his brainwave frequency.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And somewhere in
the middle, we lock.

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And as we vibrate
together, what you get

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:54.530 align:middle line:84%
is a translation of his
thoughts into the language

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:55.620 align:middle line:90%
that I'm programed with.

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:59.840 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of channeling is
not possession or anything

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.840 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.250 align:middle line:84%
It is a synchronization
of frequencies

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:08.270 align:middle line:84%
that allow you to have the
same thoughts at the same time

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:13.280 align:middle line:84%
as whoever you are vibrating
on the same wavelength with.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.800 align:middle line:10%
First and foremost, you are
always manifesting something.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.360 align:middle line:10%
If you were not,
you wouldn't have

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.910 align:middle line:10%
an experiential physical
reality, correct?

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:23.930 align:middle line:10%
Correct.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:29.090 align:middle line:10%
So the idea is you do not
have to learn how to manifest,

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:31.060 align:middle line:10%
this is automatic.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:34.850 align:middle line:84%
It's Bashar's perspective
that if we understand

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:38.900 align:middle line:84%
the nature of reality,
the nature of existence,

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.270 align:middle line:84%
we'll understand
our nature better.

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.730 align:middle line:90%
Our relationship to existence.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:45.080 align:middle line:90%
Why we're here.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Why we experience
reality the way we do.

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:50.870 align:middle line:84%
He is letting us know
that there is a way

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:53.030 align:middle line:84%
to take all of the
different things

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:55.100 align:middle line:84%
that people have been
talking about on Earth

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.560 align:middle line:84%
for thousands of years
that might be considered

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:02.810 align:middle line:84%
philosophies or more recently,
new age concepts and-- no pun

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:05.150 align:middle line:84%
intended-- bring
them down to Earth.

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:09.590 align:middle line:84%
In the sense that
we are often left

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:13.550 align:middle line:84%
with new age concepts that
sound wonderful, but what do

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.390 align:middle line:90%
they mean?

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:17.480 align:middle line:10%
What you are simply
learning is how

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.610 align:middle line:10%
to manifest more consciously.

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:22.580 align:middle line:10%
To be more aware of how you
manifest so that you can

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:26.000 align:middle line:10%
manifest what you prefer,
instead of manifesting

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.500 align:middle line:10%
your unconscious beliefs.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:34.340 align:middle line:84%
For example, one of the concepts
you hear constantly in new age

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:38.420 align:middle line:84%
thought, or whatever you want to
call it, is follow your bliss.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:39.950 align:middle line:90%
Act on your passion.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:41.420 align:middle line:90%
Live your dreams.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:44.900 align:middle line:84%
Now that is a wonderful
sentiment, and it sounds great.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:49.410 align:middle line:84%
But where's the practical side
of understanding that concept?

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:50.490 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:52.640 align:middle line:84%
How do you go about
really living your bliss,

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.310 align:middle line:84%
and knowing that you'll be OK,
knowing you'll be supported?

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:56.750 align:middle line:10%
He takes that concept--

00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:00.380 align:middle line:10%
follow your passion-- and
he starts breaking it down.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:01.940 align:middle line:90%
Well, what is that?

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.320 align:middle line:90%
What is that state of being?

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.240 align:middle line:90%
What is that feeling?

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.128 align:middle line:84%
You can think about
things all day long,

00:11:07.128 --> 00:11:08.670 align:middle line:84%
you can talk about
them all day long.

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.730 align:middle line:84%
But if you're not
willing to actually act

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:14.650 align:middle line:84%
on something that is supposed
to be representative of who you

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:18.250 align:middle line:84%
are, what your truth really
is, who the person is that

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:20.650 align:middle line:90%
you truly were created to be--

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:22.900 align:middle line:84%
if you don't on that, you're
not speaking the language

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:25.130 align:middle line:90%
of physical reality.

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:27.340 align:middle line:10%
Everything is
fundamentally neutral.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.140 align:middle line:10%
Life is meaningless.

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:32.050 align:middle line:10%
You're the one that's
designed to give life meaning.

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:34.960 align:middle line:10%
If you give situations
a positive meaning,

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.220 align:middle line:10%
you will get a beneficial
positive effect.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:39.010 align:middle line:10%
If you give them a
negative definition,

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:42.250 align:middle line:10%
you can only get an effect
that is representative

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:47.200 align:middle line:10%
of negativity, such as
struggle, strife, difficulty,

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.220 align:middle line:10%
and obstacle.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.820 align:middle line:10%
What you put out is
what you get back.

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:54.590 align:middle line:84%
He's saying physical reality
is basically like a mirror.

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:56.110 align:middle line:90%
We're creating our reality.

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:58.060 align:middle line:84%
It's a projection of
our consciousness.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:00.575 align:middle line:84%
Even a lot of our physicists
are beginning to say this now

00:12:00.575 --> 00:12:02.200 align:middle line:84%
that they understand
there's not really

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.620 align:middle line:84%
a physical world out
there, it's in here.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's a
translation of energy.

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:10.610 align:middle line:84%
It's a translation
of our consciousness.

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And so when you think of
physical reality like a glass

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:18.400 align:middle line:84%
mirror, you start to realize
that what you're experiencing

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.600 align:middle line:90%
is a reflection.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And it gives you an opportunity
to use the mirror as a guiding

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.670 align:middle line:84%
mechanism to say,
well, do I prefer

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:26.230 align:middle line:90%
what I'm getting back here?

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:28.900 align:middle line:84%
Or is there something I would
like to change about this?

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And Bashar takes it
down fundamentally

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.660 align:middle line:90%
to the idea of belief.

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.940 align:middle line:84%
What you believe to
be true, what you've

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:38.950 align:middle line:84%
been taught to
define and believe

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:42.940 align:middle line:84%
as true for you is what you
experience your reality to be.

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:46.030 align:middle line:84%
Because it can only give you
back what you're giving out.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:49.430 align:middle line:84%
To him, that is a
law of the universe.

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:52.660 align:middle line:84%
He gives you that as a literal
tool so that when you finally

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.780 align:middle line:84%
reveal them to yourself
m you can actually

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.430 align:middle line:84%
see that you've
probably picked them up

00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:00.200 align:middle line:84%
from your parents, your friends,
your society, your school.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.860 align:middle line:84%
They probably have
nothing to do with you.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And now that you
see that it really

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.580 align:middle line:84%
has nothing to do with
you, the belief kind of

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:08.020 align:middle line:90%
becomes nonsensical.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:10.480 align:middle line:90%
It takes on this illogical tone.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as it
does, it vanishes.

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And the behavior changes, the
emotions change, the thoughts

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:18.940 align:middle line:90%
change, the experience changes.

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:22.060 align:middle line:10%
We call this the
rubber band analogy.

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:25.540 align:middle line:10%
Fret not, despair not
that you have experienced

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:28.150 align:middle line:10%
that degree of darkness,
that degree of limitation,

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.100 align:middle line:10%
that degree of negativity.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.010 align:middle line:10%
Because the farther back into
darkness you pull the rubber

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:36.270 align:middle line:10%
band, when you
finally let go, it's

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:39.230 align:middle line:10%
going to fly that much
faster and that much farther

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:40.030 align:middle line:10%
into the light.

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:41.590 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:43.690 align:middle line:84%
The thing that I
love about Bashar

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:47.410 align:middle line:84%
is because he says that he
actually is a physical being,

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:50.740 align:middle line:84%
he understands
physical reality, he

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:52.630 align:middle line:90%
experiences physical reality.

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:55.630 align:middle line:84%
He understands how you
have to take those concepts

00:13:55.630 --> 00:14:00.550 align:middle line:84%
and ground them into physical
reality into a form of physics.

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:03.340 align:middle line:84%
A toolkit that we can
actually physically

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:05.890 align:middle line:90%
apply and get an effect.

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:10.120 align:middle line:10%
And by him explaining what
the tools are in that kit,

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.400 align:middle line:10%
we have tools we can
apply to physical reality

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.310 align:middle line:10%
and actually get an effect.

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.740 align:middle line:10%
Every single one of you
talks about the idea

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:20.920 align:middle line:10%
of applying some sort
of tool or technique

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.455 align:middle line:10%
to make changes in your lives
in a positive and constructive

00:14:23.455 --> 00:14:24.488 align:middle line:10%
way.

00:14:24.488 --> 00:14:26.530 align:middle line:10%
And we have had many
discussions with many of you

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:29.860 align:middle line:10%
about the idea of exactly
what sort of tools to apply.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.240 align:middle line:10%
And how to apply them.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:35.330 align:middle line:10%
And how to get a result. And
how to get a manifestation.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:38.320 align:middle line:84%
So by letting go of all
the negative beliefs,

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:42.100 align:middle line:84%
fear-based beliefs, questioning,
doubting-- all that-- you

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.740 align:middle line:90%
start relaxing into the flow.

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Then after two
years, it actually

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:50.740 align:middle line:84%
starts to uplift you and
energize you when you're done.

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.290 align:middle line:84%
I kind of liken it to
the analogy of if you're

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:55.540 align:middle line:84%
standing in the
ocean and let's say,

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.640 align:middle line:84%
you're about waist
deep in the water.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And a wave comes
along, and you get

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:00.652 align:middle line:84%
that feeling where
it's suddenly just

00:15:00.652 --> 00:15:02.770 align:middle line:84%
buoys you up off the
ground for a moment

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:04.120 align:middle line:90%
and sets you back down--

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.440 align:middle line:90%
it was literally like that.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.170 align:middle line:84%
I suddenly shifted
from feeling like I

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:12.910 align:middle line:84%
was trying to get the energy to
come through to where suddenly,

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:15.310 align:middle line:90%
I was just riding the wave.

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:17.950 align:middle line:84%
I stopped wondering what was
going to come through worrying.

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:19.450 align:middle line:84%
Whether it was going
to be accurate.

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:21.610 align:middle line:84%
Worrying whether it was
going to sound crazy.

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:23.350 align:middle line:90%
All that stuff had to go away.

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And I had to just get to
the point of realizing

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.180 align:middle line:84%
this is something
that is happening

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:29.800 align:middle line:90%
for a beneficial reason.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.030 align:middle line:90%
I can't judge it.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:33.580 align:middle line:84%
I have to trust that it is
doing what it needs to do,

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.980 align:middle line:84%
and that the person
who's asking a question

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.267 align:middle line:90%
is getting something out of it.

00:15:38.267 --> 00:15:39.850 align:middle line:10%
You have to get all
of that negativity

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:41.548 align:middle line:10%
out on the table in
front of your face

00:15:41.548 --> 00:15:43.840 align:middle line:10%
so that you can consciously
decide what kind of a world

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.270 align:middle line:10%
you really prefer to have.

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:48.580 align:middle line:84%
When I channel, I'm
aware that there

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.160 align:middle line:90%
is a communication going on.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.800 align:middle line:84%
I don't really hear the
words because I'm sort of

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.750 align:middle line:90%
lost in this dynamic daydream.

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:59.800 align:middle line:84%
I can't really pay
attention to the translation

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.440 align:middle line:84%
that's coming out because
that's secondary to what

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm receiving.

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:07.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm receiving these telepathic
concepts in a very dynamic,

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:11.890 align:middle line:84%
energetic way that allows me to
experience imagery and emotion

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:15.830 align:middle line:84%
that's so all-encompassing
that if I were to pay attention

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:18.090 align:middle line:84%
to the translation-- which
is for the person asking

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:18.890 align:middle line:90%
the question--

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:22.190 align:middle line:84%
I would take myself out
of the altered state.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.430 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of similar to
the idea that if you're

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:27.952 align:middle line:84%
having a very deep daydream
and somebody walks in the room,

00:16:27.952 --> 00:16:30.410 align:middle line:84%
and they have to call your name
three times before you even

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:32.280 align:middle line:84%
understand somebody's
talking to you--

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.290 align:middle line:90%
it's like that.

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:37.970 align:middle line:84%
[MUMBLING] It's very muffled,
nothing to do with me.

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it's not what
I'm paying attention to.

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.250 align:middle line:10%
Anyone who is following
their passion, who's

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:45.740 align:middle line:10%
doing what they love to
do, who gets in that zone,

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:48.740 align:middle line:10%
and sometimes even
in a deep meditation

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:51.710 align:middle line:10%
goes into the gamma state--

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:55.220 align:middle line:10%
I did a channeling with my head
wired to a brainwave machine,

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.510 align:middle line:10%
EEG machine.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:58.280 align:middle line:10%
And there were
many unusual things

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:02.000 align:middle line:10%
that happened in my brain
during that channeling state.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.130 align:middle line:10%
One of the most
profound things is

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:06.140 align:middle line:10%
that there are certain
centers of the brain that

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:10.400 align:middle line:10%
are responsible-- supposedly--
for processing the personality.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:15.030 align:middle line:84%
During the channeling state, my
personality center is shut off.

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:18.710 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm not there,
who's speaking?

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:20.540 align:middle line:84%
The other thing we
found out is that there

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.670 align:middle line:84%
are certain things
in brainwave patterns

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:25.579 align:middle line:84%
that are called set points,
that are not supposed

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:27.500 align:middle line:84%
to change throughout
your lifetime

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:30.320 align:middle line:84%
unless you have some kind
of massive head injury

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.490 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:34.160 align:middle line:84%
The set point when I
channel changes in seconds,

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.080 align:middle line:84%
and that's not supposed
to be possible.

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.020 align:middle line:84%
So there are some
definitive things

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:41.420 align:middle line:84%
that we were able to demonstrate
to prove that channeling

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:43.100 align:middle line:90%
is a real altered state.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.410 align:middle line:84%
But the most important thing
we wanted to get across

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:47.420 align:middle line:90%
is that everyone does this.

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.865 align:middle line:84%
And it's just about
redefining what channeling

00:17:49.865 --> 00:17:53.090 align:middle line:84%
is that will allow people
to get into that state

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:55.520 align:middle line:84%
when they need to be
more creative, to be more

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.820 align:middle line:84%
connected to themselves, to
process information and energy

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.680 align:middle line:90%
in a more efficient way.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:04.670 align:middle line:84%
The telepathic contact
still brings with it

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:08.000 align:middle line:84%
a definitive feeling of a
different level of energy.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And it took me a good two years
to get used to that, to where

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:12.650 align:middle line:90%
it wouldn't tire me out.

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:16.070 align:middle line:84%
Because when you have a higher
frequency of energy suddenly

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:18.980 align:middle line:84%
opening up through
your neurological net,

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.350 align:middle line:84%
you find that there are
resistances within you.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:22.910 align:middle line:84%
Because of your
own belief systems

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:25.880 align:middle line:84%
or just what you've been
taught to think about the world

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:26.720 align:middle line:90%
and how things work.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.553 align:middle line:84%
And you have to suddenly
realize things work

00:18:28.553 --> 00:18:30.870 align:middle line:90%
in a very different way.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:32.450 align:middle line:10%
So it's all based on belief.

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:34.070 align:middle line:10%
It's all based on consciousness.

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:35.750 align:middle line:10%
It's all based on vibration.

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:37.460 align:middle line:10%
It's all based on resonance.

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:39.780 align:middle line:10%
It's all based on
state of being.

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:44.040 align:middle line:10%
That's why we say
circumstances do not matter,

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.220 align:middle line:10%
only state of being does.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:53.100 align:middle line:90%


00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:56.070 align:middle line:84%
In terms of my background,
how I was raised, part of that

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:57.390 align:middle line:90%
helped.

00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:00.750 align:middle line:84%
I still did have to let go of
things that were associated

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.480 align:middle line:84%
with the specific
religion I was raised in,

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.120 align:middle line:84%
which was Catholic because
my mother was Irish Catholic.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.040 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that
was interesting

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:12.270 align:middle line:84%
and what I discovered when
I mentioned the woman who

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:15.540 align:middle line:84%
was doing the doctoral
thesis and she had subjects,

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:17.070 align:middle line:90%
I believe there were 13 of them.

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And 12 of them
were ex-Catholics.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.590 align:middle line:84%
So there is something
about the Catholic religion

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:27.400 align:middle line:84%
that allows for mystery
beyond what you can see.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think that helped
form a foundation of well,

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:33.210 align:middle line:90%
sure this might be possible.

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:36.450 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't really contradict
what I was taught as a Catholic

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:39.202 align:middle line:84%
in terms of reaching
out into the cosmos,

00:19:39.202 --> 00:19:41.160 align:middle line:84%
and understanding that
you can make connections

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.760 align:middle line:90%
with other kinds of mysteries.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:46.430 align:middle line:90%


00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:47.230 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:50.650 align:middle line:10%
The story of my people
began in a parallel reality,

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:53.930 align:middle line:10%
on an alternate
version of Earth.

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:57.700 align:middle line:10%
The humans on that Earth
were technologically far

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:02.020 align:middle line:10%
in advance of the humans
in your civilization.

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:07.150 align:middle line:10%
However, they became focused
on technology and intellect.

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:11.650 align:middle line:10%
Over generations, they lost
connection to their humanity.

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:16.180 align:middle line:10%
But in doing so, they slowly
destroyed their environment.

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:20.530 align:middle line:10%
In a last desperate attempt
to perpetuate their species,

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:24.520 align:middle line:10%
they moved underground, and
began to clone themselves.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:29.200 align:middle line:10%
But discovered that their
DNA was no longer viable.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.500 align:middle line:84%
They are in a
parallel dimension.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.170 align:middle line:84%
So we can't see
their star system

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:37.990 align:middle line:84%
without making a shift to
their parallel reality,

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:40.000 align:middle line:84%
just as they wouldn't
be able to perceive ours

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.570 align:middle line:84%
without making a shift to
our reality, vibrationally.

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:46.900 align:middle line:84%
But they do describe
their world, their people.

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.230 align:middle line:84%
They are what are called a
hybrid artificially created

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:51.040 align:middle line:90%
race.

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.830 align:middle line:84%
They are genetically
connected to us.

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Their world, which in their
ancient language which

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.990 align:middle line:84%
they no longer use, is
called Essassani, which

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:01.420 align:middle line:90%
means place of living light.

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:03.850 align:middle line:84%
It is similar to Earth,
it's a little smaller.

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:08.860 align:middle line:84%
Has more water, more oxygen,
a little less gravity.

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:12.160 align:middle line:84%
They said we could, if we made
the shift to their reality,

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:15.090 align:middle line:84%
be relatively comfortable
on their planet.

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:16.870 align:middle line:10%
They're about 5 feet tall.

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:18.370 align:middle line:10%
They have very pale skin.

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:19.910 align:middle line:10%
They're very thin.

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:21.880 align:middle line:10%
The males don't have
hair, the females do.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:25.270 align:middle line:10%
They said it tends to be white,
though there are exceptions.

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:27.760 align:middle line:84%
They have much larger
eyes than we do.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.800 align:middle line:84%
Smaller noses, smaller
mouths, smaller ears.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.480 align:middle line:84%
Their heads are slightly
larger than ours.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:36.400 align:middle line:84%
They are a typical hybrid,
kind of a combination

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.820 align:middle line:84%
of human that we
understand ourselves to be

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:42.490 align:middle line:84%
and the beings that have
been called the grays.

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:45.910 align:middle line:10%
And are the result of what
has been typically called

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:49.030 align:middle line:10%
the abduction experiences,
where people have reported

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:51.030 align:middle line:10%
them creating hybrid beings.

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:53.620 align:middle line:84%
Bashar says his
civilization is one

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:58.090 align:middle line:84%
of the races that was created
from this particular agenda

00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:00.160 align:middle line:90%
of hybridization.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:03.190 align:middle line:84%
But because they feel we
are connected genetically

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:05.950 align:middle line:84%
and our family, they are
also willing to share

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:09.550 align:middle line:84%
this information with us to
help us in our evolution.

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Because we've helped them
come into being, as well.

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:14.950 align:middle line:84%
Their lifespan, in
general, as they've

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:17.500 align:middle line:84%
explained that on average
is about 300 years,

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.210 align:middle line:84%
although there are
people on their planet

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:21.160 align:middle line:90%
who do live longer.

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:25.930 align:middle line:84%
Bashar himself has said that his
own father is well over 1,000.

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And they are, in
his family line,

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:33.520 align:middle line:84%
they have been and are being
what they call first contact

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:34.630 align:middle line:90%
specialists.

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:36.310 align:middle line:84%
So one of the
reasons he's actually

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:38.470 align:middle line:84%
contacting us is
because that's actually

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:40.990 align:middle line:84%
what he does for a
living, is he contacts

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:43.090 align:middle line:84%
different civilizations
when he feels

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:45.910 align:middle line:84%
they are ready to begin
to make first contact

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:47.620 align:middle line:90%
with their civilization.

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:49.220 align:middle line:84%
Just as his father
did before him.

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:54.020 align:middle line:90%


00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:57.710 align:middle line:84%
Until such time as they feel
it's right to actually make

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:00.170 align:middle line:84%
open physical
contact with us, this

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:03.620 align:middle line:84%
is the first stage in their
mind of making contact

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:05.390 align:middle line:90%
with another civilization.

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:07.820 align:middle line:84%
Because it allows
them the opportunity

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:10.050 align:middle line:84%
to share information,
to share ideas,

00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:12.140 align:middle line:84%
to share perspectives
that can be

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.600 align:middle line:84%
radically different
than the way we think.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.730 align:middle line:90%
And see what we do with that.

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:18.480 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
force themselves on us.

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.750 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to change
our society in any way

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:23.530 align:middle line:90%
that we don't want it to change.

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:27.160 align:middle line:10%
We took a lot of the images
I see about him, his planet,

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:30.280 align:middle line:10%
and used computer graphics to
put them in the "First Contact"

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:31.820 align:middle line:10%
documentary.

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:33.250 align:middle line:10%
So we're giving
people the chance

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:34.870 align:middle line:10%
to see what I'm
seeing in my head

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:36.670 align:middle line:10%
when he's describing
these things.

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:39.760 align:middle line:10%
In that way, I have
seen him and his world.

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.100 align:middle line:10%
We've had those kinds
of interactions.

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.500 align:middle line:10%
Hopefully, one day,
it would be nice

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:47.290 align:middle line:10%
if we could actually take a
visit and go to his reality,

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:50.110 align:middle line:10%
and walk upon the
surface of his world.

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:53.440 align:middle line:10%
They don't actually build major
structures on their planet.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:56.410 align:middle line:10%
They build spaceships that
can hold hundreds of thousands

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:57.950 align:middle line:10%
of people, if necessary.

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:03.390 align:middle line:10%
So in their reality, their
spaceships are their cities.

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:05.160 align:middle line:84%
The planet was
terraformed for them

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:09.240 align:middle line:84%
specifically so it was
given to them as their home.

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And they basically leave it
in the most natural state

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:13.690 align:middle line:90%
they possibly can.

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:16.800 align:middle line:84%
They might erect a temporary
building here and there

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:21.190 align:middle line:84%
for various purposes, but it
usually goes away after a time.

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.990 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:23.850 align:middle line:10%
Because we are genetically
connected to you,

00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:25.230 align:middle line:10%
we are family.

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:28.590 align:middle line:10%
For we are, in that
sense, your descendants,

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:31.650 align:middle line:10%
and you are your ancestors.

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:37.200 align:middle line:10%
And thus, our deep, deep
connection to you as family

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.580 align:middle line:10%
is profound.

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:42.810 align:middle line:10%
By interaction through open
contact our family grows.

00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:44.070 align:middle line:10%
We expand each other.

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:45.610 align:middle line:10%
We support each other.

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:47.040 align:middle line:10%
We grow together.

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.530 align:middle line:10%
And together, we grow into
something that neither of us

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:52.950 align:middle line:10%
individually can ever become.

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:54.930 align:middle line:90%
They see us evolving.

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And one day, again,
if open contact

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:01.560 align:middle line:84%
is going to be something that
we choose to have with them,

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.220 align:middle line:90%
they will present themselves.

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:05.490 align:middle line:90%
They will live one day among us.

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And we will become a larger
society and in a sense,

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:11.030 align:middle line:90%
a galactic society with them.

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:16.200 align:middle line:90%


00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:20.340 align:middle line:84%
When we absorb and apply the
information that they give us,

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:22.080 align:middle line:90%
it changes our frequency.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And it helps us change
our frequency of energy

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:27.930 align:middle line:84%
to something closer to
the level they exist on.

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:30.570 align:middle line:84%
So it makes us more
vibrationally compatible

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:32.200 align:middle line:90%
with their society.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:37.150 align:middle line:84%
So that when the time comes to
actually interact face-to-face,

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:40.470 align:middle line:84%
there will be less difference,
there will be less shock

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:41.410 align:middle line:90%
to our system--

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:42.210 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:45.490 align:middle line:84%
Because they operate on a
very high level of energy.

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:47.850 align:middle line:84%
He's sort of likened it
to the idea of saying,

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:50.130 align:middle line:84%
we're like a very
slow turning gear.

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:51.720 align:middle line:90%
They're like a high speed gear.

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:55.230 align:middle line:84%
If you jam those gears together,
you're going to strip them.

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:58.950 align:middle line:84%
But if you can get this gear to
turn faster, then they'll mesh,

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:01.013 align:middle line:84%
and it'll be easier
on our society.

00:26:01.013 --> 00:26:03.180 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't want to
do anything to damage us,

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:04.380 align:middle line:90%
whatsoever.

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:07.320 align:middle line:84%
They're certainly willing to
invite us to join the party,

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.640 align:middle line:84%
but we can refuse
the invitation.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.820 align:middle line:90%
It's totally in our hands.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:17.870 align:middle line:10%
Contact is an ongoing
experience and part

00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:22.430 align:middle line:10%
of the natural evolution
of you, as a species,

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:27.260 align:middle line:10%
from what you may loosely
call Homo sapiens to Homo

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:29.000 align:middle line:10%
galacticus.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.640 align:middle line:10%
We are not just talking
about having open contact

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:32.870 align:middle line:10%
with humans.

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:36.225 align:middle line:10%
Open contact is with
all life on your planet.

00:26:36.225 --> 00:26:39.350 align:middle line:90%


00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:42.440 align:middle line:10%
And you will become
truly, one society

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:46.970 align:middle line:10%
in a variety of differences
that are validated and supported

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:51.660 align:middle line:10%
to form a true harmony
and unity upon your world.

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:54.240 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't care whether
you believe him.

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:57.380 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't care whether you
take the information and use it.

00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:00.320 align:middle line:84%
He leaves that
completely in your hands.

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:04.310 align:middle line:84%
Because he has his own life to
live, he doesn't need yours.

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:06.950 align:middle line:84%
He's not asking
you for your power.

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:09.440 align:middle line:84%
He's attempting
to get you to tap

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.870 align:middle line:84%
into your own
self-empowerment, and live

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:12.950 align:middle line:90%
your life to the fullest.

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Because it makes everything
better for everyone everywhere.

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:18.740 align:middle line:84%
The simplest way
he's explained that--

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:20.910 align:middle line:84%
and I know this sounds a
little bit like a riddle,

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:23.300 align:middle line:84%
but if you think about
it deeply enough,

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.700 align:middle line:90%
it actually appears to be true--

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:30.380 align:middle line:84%
that which exists cannot become
that which does not exist

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:35.460 align:middle line:84%
because by definition,
non-existence doesn't exist.

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:38.550 align:middle line:84%
That's its quality,
to not exist.

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:42.900 align:middle line:84%
So that which does exist
can't become nonexistent.

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.900 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't get
something in this experience,

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:47.400 align:middle line:90%
you'll get it somewhere else.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, they have
no rush, no hurry.

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:50.780 align:middle line:90%
They're sharing.

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:51.870 align:middle line:90%
It's up to you.

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:54.353 align:middle line:84%
It's your pace,
it's your timing.

00:27:54.353 --> 00:27:55.520 align:middle line:90%
They leave it in your hands.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.110 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:01.370 align:middle line:10%
As the relationship between your
world and other world grows,

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:06.260 align:middle line:10%
you will venture out
to the stars yourself.

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:09.590 align:middle line:10%
And you will visit other worlds.

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:12.876 align:middle line:10%
And you will become their UFOs.

00:28:12.876 --> 00:28:16.190 align:middle line:90%


00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:23.760 align:middle line:84%
I think the idea behind all of
this-- the hope, so to speak--

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:27.020 align:middle line:84%
is that when people take
this information to heart,

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:28.790 align:middle line:84%
start realizing that
it actually does

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:32.090 align:middle line:84%
make a difference in their
lives when they apply it,

00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:33.800 align:middle line:84%
we can co-create
the kind of world

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:36.050 align:middle line:90%
we say we've always preferred.

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:38.420 align:middle line:90%
In essence, heaven on Earth.

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:40.400 align:middle line:90%
It's the way they live.

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And they're giving us an example
of the way we could live.

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:46.460 align:middle line:84%
Because he said if
you realize that there

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:49.088 align:middle line:84%
are an infinite number
of parallel realities,

00:28:49.088 --> 00:28:50.630 align:middle line:84%
it means there are
an infinite number

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:54.320 align:middle line:84%
of parallel versions of Earth
that coexist simultaneously

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.090 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:57.890 align:middle line:84%
So he's basically
saying you never

00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:03.480 align:middle line:84%
actually change the world
you're on, you change yourself.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And you shift
yourself incrementally

00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:10.520 align:middle line:84%
to different versions of
Earth that already exist,

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.730 align:middle line:84%
that are more and more and more
reflective of the change you

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:16.730 align:middle line:90%
make within you.

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:20.450 align:middle line:84%
People may still exist on
the world you left behind.

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:23.210 align:middle line:84%
But you may never
interact again.

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:26.600 align:middle line:84%
Because they may actually be
on another vibrational level

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:29.240 align:middle line:84%
of Earth that exists
simultaneously with the one

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:31.350 align:middle line:90%
you've shifted to.

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And when you think
of yourself as

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:36.160 align:middle line:84%
an indestructible
eternal infinite being,

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.650 align:middle line:90%
nothing is ever really lost.

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:43.300 align:middle line:10%
True unity is the product
of absolute validation

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:46.840 align:middle line:10%
of all of the individual
differences between you.

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:49.450 align:middle line:10%
Because each of
you was made to be

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:52.810 align:middle line:10%
a unique piece of the puzzle.

00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:55.840 align:middle line:10%
And like a piece of
a puzzle picture,

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.540 align:middle line:10%
if you are the shape
you were made to be,

00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:01.930 align:middle line:10%
then you will fit with all
the other unique shapes.

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:04.780 align:middle line:10%
And together, form
one big picture

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:06.490 align:middle line:10%
that will support
all the pieces,

even as the pieces
support the whole picture.

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:12.970 align:middle line:10%
You will all fit, and
play a beautiful song

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:16.100 align:middle line:10%
that will surround your world.

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:19.920 align:middle line:10%
And in that bubble, will you
find the harmony and unity

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:20.720 align:middle line:10%
that you seek.

If I had to distill everything
that Bashar has ever said down

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:37.760 align:middle line:84%
into one simple message,
it would probably

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:42.980 align:middle line:84%
be the age old
saying, know thyself.

00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:43.910 align:middle line:90%
Be authentic.

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:44.990 align:middle line:90%
Be your true self.

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:46.340 align:middle line:90%
Live your true life.

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:49.040 align:middle line:84%
Understand what it means
to act on your passion.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.260 align:middle line:84%
Because that is your
magnetic compass

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:53.510 align:middle line:84%
needle pointing to
your magnetic north.

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:56.972 align:middle line:84%
Know who you are,
and live who you are.

00:30:56.972 --> 00:30:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Because the most
difficult thing is

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:00.180 align:middle line:84%
to actually try and
be someone you're not.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:03.110 align:middle line:90%
