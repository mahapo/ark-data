00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.030 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was an intern, my wife
and I could not get pregnant.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And I called the seven
most famous doctors

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.987 align:middle line:84%
I'd ever heard of,
holistic doctors,

00:00:21.987 --> 00:00:23.820 align:middle line:84%
and I asked, what do
you do for infertility?

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.710 align:middle line:90%
They all told me what they do.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.880 align:middle line:90%
I put a program together.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.400 align:middle line:90%
We were pregnant in six weeks.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.189 align:middle line:84%
My neighbors in married housing
heard about that of course

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.390 align:middle line:90%
because we were so happy.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And they asked if
I'd work with them.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And she had been through
artificial insemination,

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.360 align:middle line:90%
and nothing had worked.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I'm
not sure it will help.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.190 align:middle line:84%
But sure, it certainly
not going to hurt you.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.380 align:middle line:84%
She was pregnant
in three months.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.360 align:middle line:84%
So before I was
out in practice, I

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.480 align:middle line:84%
was hot to trot to help every
couple get pregnant that

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.170 align:middle line:90%
wanted to get pregnant.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And there there's not
much in health care that's

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.200 align:middle line:90%
all or every.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.000 align:middle line:90%
Not much.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.890 align:middle line:90%
But this is an every.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.520 align:middle line:84%
Every person that had some
type of a hormone-related

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.660 align:middle line:90%
imbalance--

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.000 align:middle line:84%
whether it was infertility,
recurrent miscarriages, PMS,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.510 align:middle line:84%
perimenopausal symptoms--
every single one of them

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.270 align:middle line:84%
were eating foods that
their immune system said

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.490 align:middle line:84%
was a problem for
them, thus causing

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.630 align:middle line:90%
inflammation in their body.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.857 align:middle line:84%
So we took the
offensive foods out.

00:01:22.857 --> 00:01:23.940 align:middle line:90%
First, we'd look for them.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And then, we'd take
the offensive foods out

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.760 align:middle line:84%
for every person that had
a hormone related problem.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.810 align:middle line:90%
And most, if not all of them--

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:32.610 align:middle line:90%
I can't say all.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.190 align:middle line:84%
But certainly most
of them got better

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.070 align:middle line:84%
as that being part
of the protocol.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, that got me looking at it
to every health condition that

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.700 align:middle line:84%
came into our office from
migraines to diabetes

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.710 align:middle line:90%
to musculoskeletal pains.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And we found
consistently that people

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.730 align:middle line:84%
were eating foods
that they didn't

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.210 align:middle line:90%
know were a problem for them.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.227 align:middle line:90%
They just didn't know.

00:01:53.227 --> 00:01:55.560 align:middle line:84%
Because if you eat something
and it makes you feel sick,

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.817 align:middle line:90%
you stop eating it.

00:01:56.817 --> 00:01:59.400 align:middle line:84%
But if you eat something and the
next day you have a migraine,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.700 align:middle line:84%
you don't associate what you
ate yesterday with the migraine,

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.720 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.800 align:middle line:84%
So a basic premise is
body language never lies.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.020 align:middle line:90%
It never lies.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.550 align:middle line:84%
I'll say to patients,
Mrs. Patient,

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.990 align:middle line:90%
you do speak a foreign language?

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.440 align:middle line:90%
Well, yes.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.240 align:middle line:90%
I speak French.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.480 align:middle line:90%
Oh, very nice.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.120 align:middle line:84%
Or someone else will
speak Spanish and English.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.078 align:middle line:84%
But people don't know
how to speak body.

00:02:21.078 --> 00:02:22.620 align:middle line:84%
They don't know how
to listen to what

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.030 align:middle line:90%
their body is saying to them.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.350 align:middle line:90%
We've never been taught.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And so if you have a migraine or
if you wake up with joint pain

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.900 align:middle line:84%
and you're stiff as can be
until you get out of the shower,

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.660 align:middle line:90%
there is a reason for that.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And very often, what we eat
has a strong contribution

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.260 align:middle line:90%
to the symptoms that we get.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.690 align:middle line:90%
Very often.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.440 align:middle line:84%
The most common food that people
tend to have a sensitivity to--

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.250 align:middle line:84%
according to the literature,
the most common food is wheat.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And I started reading
about this back in 2001.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.750 align:middle line:84%
David Perlmutter, Dr. David
Perlmutter gave a presentation.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.730 align:middle line:84%
About 10 people with
unrelenting migraines and they

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.740 align:middle line:84%
were in the workman's
compensation system

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.180 align:middle line:90%
meaning they couldn't work.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And they were collecting some
types of payments every month

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.890 align:middle line:90%
from the government.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And the average was
eight years that they

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.640 align:middle line:90%
had been unable to work.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.817 align:middle line:90%
Eight years!

00:03:15.817 --> 00:03:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm listening
to that presentation

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.580 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, what about
the kids in that family?

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.380 align:middle line:90%
What's it like?

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.730 align:middle line:90%
Sh.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:23.080 align:middle line:90%
Sh.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.880 align:middle line:90%
Quiet.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.020 align:middle line:90%
Dad's got a headache.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.910 align:middle line:84%
What kind of
suppression might be

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.730 align:middle line:84%
occurring in that family
for kids growing up?

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And how are they surviving if
you can't work for eight years?

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.080 align:middle line:84%
They've gone through
their savings.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.280 align:middle line:90%
They're just trying to make it.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.530 align:middle line:90%
They're doing the medications.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.720 align:middle line:90%
The medications aren't working.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And what this study by
Dr. Marios Hadjuvassiliou

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.510 align:middle line:84%
that Dr. Perlmutter
talked about and presented

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.140 align:middle line:84%
was every one of them had
a sensitivity to gluten.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.580 align:middle line:90%
Every one of them.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And when they took
gluten out of the diet,

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.350 align:middle line:90%
9 out of the 10 people--

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.010 align:middle line:84%
7 out of 10 never
had a migraine again.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.850 align:middle line:90%
2 out of 10 had partial relief.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And the 10th one
refused the diet.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.250 align:middle line:84%
So those are pretty
good numbers, right?

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.480 align:middle line:90%
That was in 2001.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And that got me to see,
wow, this wheat thing.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.014 align:middle line:84%
This is really
something more than just

00:04:16.014 --> 00:04:17.950 align:middle line:84%
it's a pretty good
idea, Mrs. Patient,

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.579 align:middle line:84%
to cut down on your
wheat exposure.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:22.840 align:middle line:90%
And so I ordered that study.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.010 align:middle line:90%
I read the study.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And all 10 of them had
lesions in the brain.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And now, I understand
the mechanism by which

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.160 align:middle line:90%
they got lesions in the brain.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.690 align:middle line:84%
There are 14
different mechanisms

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.770 align:middle line:84%
by which wheat will negatively
impact on your brain

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:35.570 align:middle line:90%
that I'm aware of.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.180 align:middle line:90%
14.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.170 align:middle line:84%
But they all had
lesions on their brain.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And 7 out of 10,
complete relief.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:43.810 align:middle line:90%
2 out of 10, partial relief.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.505 align:middle line:90%
10th one refused the diet.

00:04:45.505 --> 00:04:46.380 align:middle line:90%
I ordered that paper.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.400 align:middle line:90%
I read that paper.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.340 align:middle line:84%
I ordered the references
in the back of that paper.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.590 align:middle line:90%
And I was on my way.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And I have been a geek ever
since just reading study

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.460 align:middle line:84%
after study after
study that keeps

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.450 align:middle line:90%
dropping my jaw to see that--

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.330 align:middle line:90%
here's a big picture view.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.240 align:middle line:84%
Every degenerative disease,
every digestive disease as far

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.720 align:middle line:84%
as I know, is a disease
of inflammation.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.540 align:middle line:84%
At the cellular level,
it's always inflammation.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.660 align:middle line:90%
Always.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:14.460 align:middle line:90%
Just depends.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.500 align:middle line:84%
Is it a kidney cell
or a brain cell?

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.480 align:middle line:90%
Is it gasoline or kerosene?

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.830 align:middle line:90%
But it's always inflammation.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.010 align:middle line:84%
So the first rule of
thumb, Mrs. Patient,

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.110 align:middle line:84%
in wanting to get better,
the first rule of thumb

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.610 align:middle line:84%
is stop throwing
gasoline on the fire.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:30.540 align:middle line:90%
You think?

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:31.540 align:middle line:90%
You know, of course!

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:32.500 align:middle line:90%
It just makes sense.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.160 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know
if a food we're

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.130 align:middle line:84%
eating-- if it doesn't make
us sick when we eat it,

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.580 align:middle line:84%
we don't know that that could be
contributing to what causes us

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.460 align:middle line:84%
to get MS. For example, there
are many studies showing

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.910 align:middle line:84%
the dairy sensitivity, that
when your body makes antibodies

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.490 align:middle line:84%
to dairy, it gets
confused sometimes.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And it can attack the
myelin, the Saran Wrap

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.480 align:middle line:84%
around your nerves, which
is the mechanism of MS.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.650 align:middle line:90%
It's called cross-reactivity.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.100 align:middle line:84%
The antibodies to dairy
attack your nerves.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's very
common with wheat.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.810 align:middle line:84%
The antibodies to wheat
will attack your thyroid.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.190 align:middle line:90%
Or they'll attack your brain.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.990 align:middle line:90%
Or they'll attack your heart.

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.970 align:middle line:84%
Mayo Clinic has
published studies

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.940 align:middle line:84%
on reversing
cardiomyopathy-- that's

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.490 align:middle line:84%
when your heart muscle doesn't
work very well anymore--

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.390 align:middle line:84%
reversing cardiomyopathy
on a gluten-free diet.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:25.410 align:middle line:84%
Reversing irregular
heartbeats and arrhythmias

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:26.580 align:middle line:90%
on a gluten-free diet.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.830 align:middle line:84%
This is Mayo Clinic
publishing these studies.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.160 align:middle line:84%
You see these studies, and
it just drops your jaw.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.620 align:middle line:84%
How come all the
docs don't know this?

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.920 align:middle line:84%
Because this is hard
science, you know?

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.680 align:middle line:84%
Because we think if you eat the
food and you don't get sick,

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.130 align:middle line:90%
you don't have a problem.

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.170 align:middle line:84%
But when you throw
gasoline on the fire,

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:46.560 align:middle line:90%
where's the fire in your body?

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.110 align:middle line:84%
That's determined by--
if you pull at a chain,

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.432 align:middle line:84%
the chain always breaks
at the weakest link.

00:06:51.432 --> 00:06:53.640 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's at one end,
the middle, the other end,

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.682 align:middle line:84%
your heart, your brain,
your liver, your kidneys,

00:06:55.682 --> 00:06:57.507 align:middle line:84%
wherever your
genetic weak link is.

00:06:57.507 --> 00:06:59.340 align:middle line:84%
The week link is
determined by your genetics

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.950 align:middle line:84%
and by the, what are
called, antecedents,

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:03.190 align:middle line:90%
how you've lived your life.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.980 align:middle line:84%
So if you eat a
lot of tuna, tuna's

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.720 align:middle line:84%
got mercury, high
levels of mercury.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.550 align:middle line:90%
So you get mercury accumulation.

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.790 align:middle line:84%
That's an antecedent if you
have heavy metal poisoning.

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.040 align:middle line:84%
So between your genetics
and the antecedents

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.920 align:middle line:84%
determines where's the
weak link in your chain.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.980 align:middle line:84%
So you throw
gasoline on the fire.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.150 align:middle line:90%
You pull at the chain.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.160 align:middle line:84%
The chain breaks at
the weakest link.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.100 align:middle line:84%
That's why a
sensitivity to gluten--

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.630 align:middle line:90%
not gluten-- to wheat.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:31.530 align:middle line:84%
A sensitivity to wheat-- it may
be the gluten proteins in wheat

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.630 align:middle line:90%
or other components of wheat.

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.360 align:middle line:84%
But the sensitivity
to wheat can manifest

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.340 align:middle line:84%
as hundreds of
different symptoms

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.050 align:middle line:90%
that you would never think of.

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:42.930 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:47.250 align:middle line:90%


00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.860 align:middle line:84%
I think our young
mothers have to go back

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:53.970 align:middle line:84%
to the basic premise of
eat god-made foods and not

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:55.350 align:middle line:90%
man-made foods.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean to be
spiritual or religious.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean the stuff that
grows on planet Earth

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.640 align:middle line:84%
is what humans are
supposed to be eating.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:07.380 align:middle line:84%
The simpler the food, the likely
the healthier the food for you.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Convenience foods and
convenience packaging

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.270 align:middle line:90%
are useful at times.

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:16.050 align:middle line:84%
But living a life of convenience
food just sets us up.

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:19.380 align:middle line:84%
It sets us up to have
dysfunction wherever

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.506 align:middle line:90%
the weak link in our chain is.

00:08:21.506 --> 00:08:28.650 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:31.140 align:middle line:84%
Here's the way to
get the big picture

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.690 align:middle line:90%
about intestinal permeability.

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:36.150 align:middle line:90%
Permeability is not bad for you.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.760 align:middle line:84%
It's how we absorb our
vitamins and minerals.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:43.770 align:middle line:84%
It's excessive permeability
that's bad for you.

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:46.430 align:middle line:84%
Intestinal
permeability is normal.

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:49.750 align:middle line:84%
Excessive intestinal
permeability is abnormal.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:51.000 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean?

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Mrs. Patient, your
intestines are a tube.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.430 align:middle line:90%
The tube is 20, 25 feet long.

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Starts with the mouth,
goes to the other end.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.180 align:middle line:84%
Kind of winds around
in the abdomen,

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.740 align:middle line:90%
twists around in there.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:06.160 align:middle line:84%
The inside-- if you think of
your intestines like a donut

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.270 align:middle line:84%
and if you could just
stretch the donut out

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:10.020 align:middle line:84%
and you looked down
the hole of the donut,

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.710 align:middle line:90%
it's one big, long donut.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:12.510 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.140 align:middle line:90%
It's one big, long tube.

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:17.620 align:middle line:84%
So when we eat food,
it's not yet in our body.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:18.670 align:middle line:90%
It's in the donut.

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:19.470 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's got to go through
the walls of the donut

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:24.690 align:middle line:84%
to get into the bloodstream
so we can use the vitamins

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.930 align:middle line:84%
and minerals to make new
brain cells, and muscle cells,

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.450 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:34.680 align:middle line:84%
The inside of the tube is
lined with shag carpeting.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.580 align:middle line:90%
Big, thick shags of carpeting.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:40.020 align:middle line:84%
They're called the villi
and the microvilli.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:44.610 align:middle line:84%
The microvilli are coated
with a cheese cloth.

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And our grandmothers used to
pour gravy into a cheese cloth.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And the liquid
would come through,

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:53.490 align:middle line:84%
and the clumps of flour and
stuff that didn't break down

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.260 align:middle line:84%
would stay on the other
side, so the gravy

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.030 align:middle line:84%
was very smooth to pour on
the pot roast and everything.

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:58.830 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.260 align:middle line:90%
That's cheese cloth.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Our shags in the intestines
have cheese cloth.

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:08.340 align:middle line:84%
That's why your intestines
are 20 to 25 feet long.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:13.380 align:middle line:84%
One reason is because some
foods break down really quickly.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.880 align:middle line:84%
Other foods take a long
time to break down.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.970 align:middle line:84%
They have to go further
down the intestines.

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:23.370 align:middle line:84%
So Mrs. Patient, proteins
are like a pearl necklace.

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.530 align:middle line:84%
Hydrochloric acid
made in your stomach

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:27.840 align:middle line:84%
undoes the clasp of
the pearl necklace.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.930 align:middle line:90%
Now you have a string of pearls.

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Our enzymes act as
scissors to break off

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.580 align:middle line:84%
each pearl of the
pearl necklace.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.260 align:middle line:90%
They're called amino acids.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:38.970 align:middle line:84%
They're really
tiny little pearls.

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And they go right
through the cheesecloth

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:43.260 align:middle line:90%
into the bloodstream.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.920 align:middle line:84%
Bigger clumps of pearls can't
get through the cheesecloth.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.170 align:middle line:84%
They have to go further
down the intestines

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:52.680 align:middle line:84%
to be broken down small enough
to get through the cheesecloth

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.310 align:middle line:90%
into the bloodstream.

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:56.790 align:middle line:84%
That's how we absorb our
vitamins, our minerals,

00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:00.120 align:middle line:84%
our proteins, our fats, is that
they get broken down, broken

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.580 align:middle line:84%
down, broken down until they're
small enough to go right

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:03.580 align:middle line:90%
through the cheesecloth.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.730 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:08.670 align:middle line:84%
What happens-- Harvard
published a study last year.

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Doctor Hollon-- H-O-L-L-O-N.
Everybody can go online and get

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:12.270 align:middle line:90%
the paper.

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:13.530 align:middle line:90%
It's free online.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:17.130 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Hollon and Fasano at Harvard
published the studies that

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:20.310 align:middle line:84%
validated-- this was the
fourth one in my library now--

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:23.700 align:middle line:84%
that shows when
humans eat wheat.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.880 align:middle line:84%
Every human that eats
wheat, not just the celiacs,

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.320 align:middle line:84%
but every human that eats wheat
gets tears in the cheesecloth

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.940 align:middle line:84%
every time they're
exposed to wheat.

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:35.010 align:middle line:90%
Every time, every human.

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:38.220 align:middle line:84%
I think their word
was all humans.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:41.280 align:middle line:84%
I think that counts for
everyone that's watching this.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.810 align:middle line:90%
All humans.

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:44.610 align:middle line:84%
They get tears in
the cheesecloth

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:47.100 align:middle line:84%
every time they're
exposed to wheat.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:51.510 align:middle line:84%
But we have an entire new
body every seven years, right?

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:53.550 align:middle line:84%
Some cells turn
over very quickly,

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:55.380 align:middle line:84%
like the inside
lining of the gut.

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.660 align:middle line:84%
Every three to seven days,
you have a whole new lining

00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:58.460 align:middle line:90%
to your gut.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:11:59.760 align:middle line:90%
It's like the skin of a snake.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.137 align:middle line:90%
It just kind of sheds right off.

00:12:02.137 --> 00:12:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And some cells, like
your bones cells,

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.030 align:middle line:90%
are very slow to rebuild.

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:08.460 align:middle line:84%
So every seven years,
you have a new body.

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.890 align:middle line:84%
So you eat wheat, you
tear the cheesecloth.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:11.760 align:middle line:90%
But it heals.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.698 align:middle line:84%
Fastest growing
cells in the body.

00:12:14.698 --> 00:12:15.990 align:middle line:90%
So you had toast for breakfast.

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:16.930 align:middle line:90%
You tear the cheesecloth.

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:17.640 align:middle line:90%
It heals.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:18.780 align:middle line:90%
You have a sandwich for lunch.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:19.720 align:middle line:90%
Tear the cheesecloth.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.590 align:middle line:90%
It heals.

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:21.390 align:middle line:90%
Pasta for dinner.

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:23.610 align:middle line:84%
Tear the cheesecloth,
but it heals.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:24.780 align:middle line:90%
Croutons on your salad.

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Tear the cheesecloth,
but it heals.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:27.300 align:middle line:90%
A cookie.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.860 align:middle line:84%
Tear the cheesecloth,
but it heals.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:32.160 align:middle line:84%
Day after week after month after
year after year after year.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Until one day, you
don't heal anymore.

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:40.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you don't heal, you
get tears in the cheesecloth.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.850 align:middle line:84%
That's pathogenic
intestinal permeability.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:43.650 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:45.420 align:middle line:90%
Now what happens?

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:48.060 align:middle line:84%
You've got these pearl
necklaces of food being clipped

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:51.840 align:middle line:84%
into small pieces going down
the tube of the intestines, down

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.180 align:middle line:84%
the donut, all the way
until they're small enough

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.440 align:middle line:90%
to go through the cheesecloth.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.080 align:middle line:84%
But now, some of these
larger clumps of food

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.000 align:middle line:84%
get through the tears
in the cheesecloth

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.320 align:middle line:90%
into the bloodstream.

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.640 align:middle line:90%
They're not supposed to.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.710 align:middle line:90%
They're called macromolecules.

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:06.360 align:middle line:90%
Big molecules.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.990 align:middle line:84%
They're not supposed
to get through,

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:10.733 align:middle line:84%
but tears in the
cheesecloth occur.

00:13:10.733 --> 00:13:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And these tears
in the cheesecloth

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:16.605 align:middle line:84%
can occur and stay torn
when you lose tolerance

00:13:16.605 --> 00:13:19.950 align:middle line:84%
and you don't heal anymore
when you're 2 years old, 22

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:21.900 align:middle line:90%
years old, 72 years old.

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.900 align:middle line:84%
It just depends on when you
cross that threshold as to when

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.040 align:middle line:90%
this happens.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.020 align:middle line:90%
But it happens for everyone.

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.140 align:middle line:84%
So now, you've got the
tears in the cheesecloth

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.250 align:middle line:90%
that don't heal.

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:35.610 align:middle line:84%
The macromolecules get
through into the bloodstream.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And your immune
system says, whoa!

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.520 align:middle line:90%
What's this?

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.560 align:middle line:84%
This is not something
that's good for me.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:41.730 align:middle line:90%
I better fight this.

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:44.610 align:middle line:84%
I can't make new brain cells
or new muscle cells out

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.500 align:middle line:90%
of this raw material.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:47.940 align:middle line:90%
I better fight this.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And now, you make antibodies
to that macromolecule.

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And if it was a tomato, now
you're sensitive to tomatoes.

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:55.700 align:middle line:84%
Or now you're
sensitive to chicken.

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:57.990 align:middle line:84%
Or now you're sensitive
to beef or to bananas.

00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:59.580 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter what it is.

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:02.700 align:middle line:84%
If you get macromolecules
getting into the bloodstream,

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.100 align:middle line:84%
your immune system,
trying to protect you,

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.630 align:middle line:90%
says, I got to fight this thing.

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.490 align:middle line:90%
This is not good for me.

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:11.490 align:middle line:84%
That's the person that gets
a 90-food IGG and blood

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:14.080 align:middle line:84%
test done for sensitivities
and it comes back

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.590 align:middle line:84%
they're sensitive
to 20, 25 foods.

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:16.590 align:middle line:90%
And they say, oh my god.

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:17.970 align:middle line:90%
That's everything I eat.

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:19.170 align:middle line:90%
Of course it is.

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:21.510 align:middle line:84%
Your immune system is
trying to protect you.

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:24.450 align:middle line:84%
So you don't shut down
the immune system.

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:26.550 align:middle line:84%
You stop throwing
gasoline on the fire

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:29.970 align:middle line:84%
and allow the tears in
the cheesecloth to heal.

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Then, six months
to a year later,

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.540 align:middle line:90%
you do the blood test again.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.558 align:middle line:84%
Now you're sensitive to
two foods, maybe three.

00:14:36.558 --> 00:14:39.402 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:39.402 --> 00:14:43.200 align:middle line:90%


00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.800 align:middle line:84%
Every human needs to
understand this concept.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.152 align:middle line:90%
And it takes a little wrap.

00:14:48.152 --> 00:14:50.110 align:middle line:84%
You know, you might have
to listen to it again.

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:51.780 align:middle line:84%
But when you wrap
your head around it,

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.920 align:middle line:84%
you say, well, this just
makes perfect sense.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:54.720 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.570 align:middle line:84%
So you want to have a healthy
environment of your gut.

00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:59.400 align:middle line:90%
That's called the microbiome.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.200 align:middle line:84%
Because when you have
a bad environment,

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.617 align:middle line:84%
you tear the cheesecloth just
because of a bad environment

00:15:03.617 --> 00:15:04.417 align:middle line:90%
in your gut.

00:15:04.417 --> 00:15:05.220 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:07.600 align:middle line:84%
So it's not only wheat
that tears the cheesecloth.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.880 align:middle line:90%
There are many, many things.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.220 align:middle line:84%
GMO foods will tear
the cheesecloth.

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:14.460 align:middle line:84%
The glyphosate and the
inert ingredients in Roundup

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:15.990 align:middle line:90%
will tear the cheesecloth.

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:17.760 align:middle line:84%
Chlorine will tear
the cheesecloth.

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.590 align:middle line:84%
There are many, many
different compounds

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:21.000 align:middle line:90%
that can tear the cheesecloth.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.710 align:middle line:84%
We just know for a fact that
all humans tear the cheesecloth

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:26.910 align:middle line:90%
when they eat wheat.

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:29.350 align:middle line:90%
Every time they eat wheat.

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:32.190 align:middle line:84%
So when you cross
that threshold and you

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:35.130 align:middle line:84%
can't compensate anymore
and heal the cheesecloth,

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:38.490 align:middle line:84%
then you get pathogenic
intestinal permeability.

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:40.530 align:middle line:84%
Remember, intestinal
permeability is normal,

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:42.720 align:middle line:84%
but excessive
permeability is not.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.870 align:middle line:84%
So now, you get pathogenic
intestinal permeability.

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:47.500 align:middle line:90%
It gets into your bloodstream.

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:51.010 align:middle line:84%
Your body makes antibodies
to that food, whatever it is.

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And then, there's a mechanism
called cross-reactivity.

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:58.680 align:middle line:84%
So let's take the
example of wheat.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.740 align:middle line:84%
The most common clump
of the pearl necklace

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:04.140 align:middle line:84%
that your immune system
will make antibodies to

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.215 align:middle line:90%
is 33 amino acids long.

00:16:06.215 --> 00:16:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And every laboratory
in the world

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:10.620 align:middle line:84%
will check for that one to see
if you make antibodies to that.

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.880 align:middle line:84%
There are many other clumps
of the pearl necklace.

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And most labs don't check the
others, which they should.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.660 align:middle line:84%
We know there's 62 different
clumps of the pearl necklace

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:21.300 align:middle line:84%
and wheat that have
been identified

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.010 align:middle line:84%
that the immune
system may react to.

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:27.870 align:middle line:84%
But every labs checks
for the big one, the 33.

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:32.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you have antibodies to
that 33 amino acid peptide--

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:33.660 align:middle line:90%
it's called a peptide.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to refer
to it as AABCD.

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:39.878 align:middle line:84%
Now it's 33 letters long,
but let's just say AABCD.

00:16:39.878 --> 00:16:42.420 align:middle line:84%
So now you have the antibodies
going through your bloodstream

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:43.580 align:middle line:90%
looking for AABCD.

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:44.380 align:middle line:90%
Over there.

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:44.730 align:middle line:90%
Sh.

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:45.150 align:middle line:90%
Over there.

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:45.600 align:middle line:90%
Sh.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And they're firing
these chemical bullets

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:51.550 align:middle line:84%
to destroy this macromolecule
that's in your bloodstream.

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:54.770 align:middle line:90%


00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:58.870 align:middle line:84%
What our immunologists tell
us is that it only takes

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:02.170 align:middle line:90%
eight amino acids of the 33--

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:03.430 align:middle line:90%
only eight.

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:06.932 align:middle line:84%
That sequence of the eight
amino acids of the 33

00:17:06.932 --> 00:17:08.349 align:middle line:84%
that the antibodies
are being made

00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:11.680 align:middle line:84%
to, that-- when your blood's
going past the thyroid,

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:15.040 align:middle line:84%
for example, the surface
of the thyroid facing

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.470 align:middle line:84%
the bloodstream as
the blood's going by,

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:20.140 align:middle line:84%
the surface of the thyroid
facing the bloodstream

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:21.890 align:middle line:90%
is made up of proteins and fats.

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:24.280 align:middle line:84%
Proteins are made up of
a lot of amino acids.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.109 align:middle line:90%
Hundreds of amino acids.

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:28.930 align:middle line:84%
Some of the amino acid
sequences in the surface

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:33.040 align:middle line:84%
of the thyroid facing the
bloodstream include AABCD.

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.340 align:middle line:90%
Eight amino acids of AABCD.

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:38.080 align:middle line:84%
So the antibodies
that are looking

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.580 align:middle line:84%
for the wheat molecules
in your bloodstream

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:41.830 align:middle line:90%
see the-- oh, look over there.

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:42.630 align:middle line:90%
Sh.

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And they fire a
chemical bullet at AABCD

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.640 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of your thyroid
facing the bloodstream.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:53.110 align:middle line:90%
That's called molecular mimicry.

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:57.220 align:middle line:84%
When our antibodies to
wheat fire a chemical bullet

00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:00.050 align:middle line:84%
at the thyroid, in this
example, or your brain cells--

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:02.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the studies are
very clear on the stuff,

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:03.110 align:middle line:90%
that it happens.

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:04.570 align:middle line:90%
Or your brain cells.

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:09.070 align:middle line:84%
When it fires a chemical bullet,
it damages that thyroid cell.

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:13.450 align:middle line:84%
Now the immune system
makes thyroid antibodies

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:16.575 align:middle line:84%
in general to clean up the
old thyroid cells, right?

00:18:16.575 --> 00:18:17.950 align:middle line:84%
So you get rid of
the old thyroid

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:19.940 align:middle line:84%
cells to make room
for new cells to grow.

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:21.730 align:middle line:84%
That's why you
have a normal level

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:24.793 align:middle line:84%
of antibodies to your brain and
to your thyroid and your heart.

00:18:24.793 --> 00:18:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Because we're getting rid of the
old, damaged cells, making room

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:28.580 align:middle line:90%
for new cells to grow.

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.038 align:middle line:84%
So it's a kind of
wash out process.

00:18:30.038 --> 00:18:30.838 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:18:30.838 --> 00:18:31.900 align:middle line:90%
And that's normal.

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:35.265 align:middle line:84%
But now, you've got these
extra antibodies to AABCD

00:18:35.265 --> 00:18:36.265 align:middle line:90%
going after the thyroid.

00:18:36.265 --> 00:18:37.000 align:middle line:90%
Sh.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:37.800 align:middle line:90%
Sh.

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:38.920 align:middle line:90%
Sh.

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.870 align:middle line:84%
Now you make more
antibodies to your thyroid

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:43.900 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of these extra
damaged cells, right?

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's not a problem except
you had toast for breakfast.

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:47.980 align:middle line:90%
A sandwich for lunch.

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:48.910 align:middle line:90%
Pasta for dinner.

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:50.420 align:middle line:90%
Croutons on your salad.

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.560 align:middle line:84%
There is gluten in the makeup,
in lipstick that you use,

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:54.460 align:middle line:90%
in your shampoo.

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.680 align:middle line:84%
So you're getting exposure
day after day after week

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.900 align:middle line:84%
after month after year
after year after year.

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And if the weak link in
your chain is your thyroid,

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:03.040 align:middle line:90%
it's going after your thyroid.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:06.460 align:middle line:84%
The antibodies to wheat are
also going after your thyroid.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.470 align:middle line:84%
You make more thyroid
antibodies to get rid

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:10.690 align:middle line:84%
of those damaged
cells, and it's called

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:13.090 align:middle line:90%
a self-perpetuating mechanism.

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:16.280 align:middle line:84%
At some point, it
continues on its own.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:20.140 align:middle line:84%
Now you develop Hashimoto's
autoimmune thyroid disease.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:21.850 align:middle line:84%
That's why there are
so many studies that

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:25.150 align:middle line:84%
say when you get off of
wheat, your thyroid antibodies

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:26.990 align:middle line:90%
may go down.

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:28.210 align:middle line:90%
That's the mechanism.

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same
mechanism for the brain.

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:32.330 align:middle line:84%
It's the same mechanism
for the heart.

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:33.970 align:middle line:84%
That's why the
studies I referred

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:36.680 align:middle line:84%
to earlier, Mayo Clinic, with
cardiomyopathy and irregular

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:40.040 align:middle line:84%
Get them off wheat, and their
cardiomyopathy calms down

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.974 align:middle line:84%
and their heart starts
functioning better.

00:19:41.974 --> 00:19:42.774 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:42.774 --> 00:19:43.870 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's unbelievable.

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:45.730 align:middle line:90%
>> This is profound.

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:48.370 align:middle line:84%
This is what
"Betrayal" is about.

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:51.430 align:middle line:90%
This is what my book is about.

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:53.290 align:middle line:90%
We have to wake up to this.

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:56.680 align:middle line:84%
If we just wake up to this
and we start checking for it--

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.450 align:middle line:84%
remember, body
language never lies.

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:00.670 align:middle line:84%
You just have to learn
how to speak body.

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:02.410 align:middle line:84%
So you have to
have the laboratory

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:05.140 align:middle line:84%
tests that are
properly looking to see

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:07.330 align:middle line:90%
is this going on for you.

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:09.250 align:middle line:90%
And if it's going on, OK.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Then, let's see
why it's going on.

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And then, you get
rid of the trigger,

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:16.450 align:middle line:90%
the gasoline on the fire.

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And then many
times-- not always--

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:22.450 align:middle line:84%
but many times the rheumatoid
arthritis calms down.

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:25.090 align:middle line:90%
The psoriasis calms down.

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:27.820 align:middle line:90%
The lupus calms down.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:30.070 align:middle line:90%
The migraines calm down.

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:33.370 align:middle line:84%
The attention deficit that
children suffer with calm down.

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And the "Journal of
Attention Disorders" in 2006,

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:39.320 align:middle line:84%

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:42.100 align:middle line:84%
They put them on a
gluten-free diet.

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:54.670 align:middle line:84%

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:16.260 align:middle line:84%
We highly-- no, they
didn't say highly.

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:19.920 align:middle line:84%
They said, we recommend that
every attention deficit child

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.530 align:middle line:84%
be checked for a
gluten sensitivity

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:25.170 align:middle line:84%
just because it's so
commonly is a trigger.

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:27.600 align:middle line:84%
They're not saying
every attention deficit

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.490 align:middle line:90%
child has a gluten sensitivity.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:30.930 align:middle line:90%
That would sound fanatical.

it's so prevalent,

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:34.858 align:middle line:90%

That's a question
I frequently get--

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:46.890 align:middle line:84%
what are the common
symptoms that people

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:49.710 align:middle line:84%
suffer from when they have
a sensitivity to wheat?

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And the comprehensive
answer is, where's

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.940 align:middle line:90%
the weak link in your chain?

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.620 align:middle line:90%
Is it fatigue?

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:57.480 align:middle line:90%
Is it brain fog?

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:01.582 align:middle line:90%
Is it failure to thrive?

00:22:01.582 --> 00:22:03.540 align:middle line:84%
Were you one of the

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:08.340 align:middle line:90%
Is it headaches?

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.050 align:middle line:90%
Is it autoimmune disease?

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:14.100 align:middle line:84%
There's no symptom that might
not-- that's the key here.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:19.110 align:middle line:84%
There is no symptom that might
not be caused by a sensitivity

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:20.160 align:middle line:90%
to wheat.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:23.610 align:middle line:84%
It'd be foolish to say
every symptom is caused

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:25.530 align:middle line:90%
by a sensitivity to wheat.

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:28.500 align:middle line:84%
But it's rational
and scientific to say

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:33.010 align:middle line:84%
any symptom may be caused
by a sensitivity to wheat.

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:34.650 align:middle line:84%
So what symptoms
should we consider

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:36.720 align:middle line:90%
before we look at this?

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.490 align:middle line:90%
Any symptom.

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:41.430 align:middle line:90%
I can't say this, this, or this.

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:43.380 align:middle line:90%
Because it's any symptom.

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:45.510 align:middle line:90%
It might be skin for one person.

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:49.260 align:middle line:84%
It could be acne or all
the way to psoriasis.

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.300 align:middle line:84%
It might be brain
with another person.

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:53.730 align:middle line:84%
It could be brain fog all
the way to schizophrenia.

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:56.910 align:middle line:84%
There are many papers on
reversing schizophrenia

00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:58.540 align:middle line:90%
on a gluten-free diet.

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:03.540 align:middle line:84%
So the spectrum of any symptom
from mild to really severe

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:06.598 align:middle line:84%
may be caused by a
sensitivity to gluten.

as to where it's

gasoline on the
fire that's causing

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:39.220 align:middle line:90%
that particular dysfunction.

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:41.460 align:middle line:84%
So in my all-day
seminar for physicians,

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:42.990 align:middle line:90%
I showed the studies.

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:44.970 align:middle line:84%
The first concept
I have to give them

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:48.840 align:middle line:84%
is that it's an inflammatory
process at the cellular level.

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.820 align:middle line:90%
It's always inflammation.

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:53.070 align:middle line:84%
And then, we go through
different systems of the body.

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:55.740 align:middle line:84%
I show them the shags
of the shag carpeting

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:59.940 align:middle line:84%
and that the inflammation is
the first step before the shags

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:01.110 align:middle line:90%
start to wear down.

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:02.865 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
celiac disease comes

00:25:02.865 --> 00:25:04.350 align:middle line:90%
is when the shags wear down.

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:06.780 align:middle line:84%
But the pictures of the
inflammation, the white blood

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:09.780 align:middle line:84%
cells that are there called
leukocytes that are there.

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:13.410 align:middle line:84%
Then later on in the day, we
talk about muscle function.

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And I show them the
pictures of muscle

00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:18.750 align:middle line:84%
of people that have
inflammation in the muscle.

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:21.330 align:middle line:84%
It looks exactly the
same as in the shags

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:22.620 align:middle line:90%
of the shag carpeting.

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:23.420 align:middle line:90%
It's the same.

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:26.100 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole lot of
lymphocytes and white blood

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:27.930 align:middle line:84%
cells in there
causing inflammation.

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:29.010 align:middle line:90%
It's the same.

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:32.130 align:middle line:84%
So for our athletes, when
they can function better,

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:36.340 align:middle line:84%
it's because they've lowered the
inflammation in their muscles.

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:38.160 align:middle line:84%
So there's less
white blood cells

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:41.160 align:middle line:84%
causing that inflammatory
cascade in their muscles,

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:44.010 align:middle line:84%
so their nutrients are more
available to make their muscle

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:45.750 align:middle line:90%
function better.

You know, that's a
really good question.

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's the major emphasis
of my message to carry out

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:58.210 align:middle line:90%
is how has this happened.

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:24.460 align:middle line:84%
What did our immune
system have to protect us

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:26.650 align:middle line:90%
from thousands of years ago?

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:30.490 align:middle line:84%
Bugs, parasites, viruses,
molds, and fungus.

00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:31.705 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:26:31.705 --> 00:26:33.580 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing else
that our immune system

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:34.538 align:middle line:90%
had to protect us from.

00:26:34.538 --> 00:26:36.910 align:middle line:84%
Bugs, parasites, viruses,
mold, and fungus.

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:38.470 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:40.960 align:middle line:84%
We have the same
immune system today

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:44.690 align:middle line:84%
as we had thousands and
thousands of years ago.

00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:47.860 align:middle line:84%
So our immune system is
designed to protect us

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:51.820 align:middle line:84%
from bugs, parasites,
viruses, molds, and fungus.

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:53.320 align:middle line:84%
But what happens
when you're exposed

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:57.420 align:middle line:84%
to Bisphenol A, the chemical
that softens plastic

00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:00.670 align:middle line:84%
in water bottles or your
soft contact lenses?

00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:02.380 align:middle line:84%
It's a toxic
chemical in the body.

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:04.690 align:middle line:84%
It's called an
endocrine disruptor.

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:07.180 align:middle line:84%
It's only one of thousands
and thousands of chemicals,

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:09.130 align:middle line:84%
but we use that
one as an example.

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:12.178 align:middle line:84%
It binds on your estrogen
receptor sites in your body,

00:27:12.178 --> 00:27:13.720 align:middle line:84%
and your immune
system gets activated

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.880 align:middle line:90%
to try and protect you.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:17.410 align:middle line:84%
So what does the
immune system think

00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:19.480 align:middle line:90%
when Bisphenol A comes in?

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.240 align:middle line:84%
It acts as if it's a bug,
parasite, virus, mold,

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.200 align:middle line:90%
or fungus.

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.940 align:middle line:90%
It can't do anything else.

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:27.490 align:middle line:90%
We haven't changed genetically.

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:30.340 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
background information.

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:36.450 align:middle line:90%
Now wheat is a mild parasite.

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:39.690 align:middle line:90%
It's a mild toxin.

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:40.500 align:middle line:90%
It's mild.

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:41.505 align:middle line:90%
It's not a big deal.

00:27:41.505 --> 00:27:42.990 align:middle line:90%


00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And the body usually
has tolerance for wheat.

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:48.730 align:middle line:84%
So we have a little
bit of wheat.

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:50.190 align:middle line:90%
It's not a problem.

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Some of those wheat molecules
come down through the shags,

00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:55.957 align:middle line:84%
and the immune system
looks at it inside the body

00:27:55.957 --> 00:27:56.790 align:middle line:90%
and says, all right.

00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:57.620 align:middle line:90%
It's not a big deal.

00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:57.930 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:27:57.930 --> 00:27:58.950 align:middle line:90%
Everything's fine.

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And then we have what's
called a tolerant response.

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:04.740 align:middle line:84%
We make these cells
called tolerogenic cells.

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:06.000 align:middle line:90%
IL-10.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.370 align:middle line:84%
There's a number of cells
we make that say, OK, this

00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:08.760 align:middle line:90%
is fine.

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:09.760 align:middle line:90%
Not a big deal.

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:11.820 align:middle line:90%
Let's just keep an eye on it.

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:16.440 align:middle line:84%
But in this world we
live in today, we have--

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:19.830 align:middle line:84%
it's called loss
of oral tolerance.

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:22.410 align:middle line:84%
We've lost our tolerance
that our immune system--

00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:25.710 align:middle line:84%
70% of the immune
system is in your gut.

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Because that's where
our ancestors had

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:31.140 align:middle line:84%
the most assault from bugs,
parasites, viruses, molds,

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:32.030 align:middle line:90%
or fungus.

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:33.060 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:34.350 align:middle line:90%
But it's all here in the gut.

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:37.080 align:middle line:84%
It's what we eat and
what we drink, right?

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:40.080 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have bad
air so much back then,

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.870 align:middle line:84%
so there's not as strong
immune system in the lungs.

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:44.920 align:middle line:84%
There's a little bit,
but it's all in the gut

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:47.880 align:middle line:84%
because it's what
we eat and drink.

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:53.570 align:middle line:84%
So now, we've got mercury,
and lead, and DDT, and PCBs,

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:55.850 align:middle line:84%
and Bisphenol A.
The average, now,

00:28:55.850 --> 00:29:01.070 align:middle line:84%
the average in the United
States is 250 pounds

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:05.720 align:middle line:84%
of toxic chemicals
per person per day

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.360 align:middle line:90%
are being dumped in the US now.

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:12.080 align:middle line:90%
250 pounds per person per day.

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.910 align:middle line:84%
As you're watching
this video, if there

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:16.010 align:middle line:84%
is three people in
the room with you,

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:21.080 align:middle line:84%
that's 750 pounds of
chemicals for you every day.

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:24.410 align:middle line:84%
Now how many 50-pound bags
does it take to stack up

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:27.620 align:middle line:90%
750 pounds of toxic chemicals?

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:29.840 align:middle line:90%
That's on our lawns.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.880 align:middle line:84%
That's on our
sidewalks, our streets.

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:34.970 align:middle line:84%
That's what's making up the
asphalt that we lay down

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:36.740 align:middle line:90%
and we walk on every day.

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:43.010 align:middle line:84%
That's in our pressed
wood cabinets that outgas.

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:45.500 align:middle line:84%
That's in our carpeting
that's outgassing.

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.900 align:middle line:84%
That's from the cleaners
cleaning our clothing

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:49.370 align:middle line:90%
that we're breathing in.

00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:51.960 align:middle line:84%
That's the flame retardants
that our infants wear

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.780 align:middle line:90%
in the clothing that they wear.

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:58.040 align:middle line:84%
We're being exposed every
day, multiple times a day.

00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.780 align:middle line:90%
I like flowers in my home.

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:02.023 align:middle line:84%
But the flowers come from
somewhere in South America.

00:30:02.023 --> 00:30:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And there's lots
of chemicals they

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.150 align:middle line:84%
are using to grow
those flowers to make

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:07.920 align:middle line:84%
sure they're fresh when they
get here to the United States,

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:08.720 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.840 align:middle line:84%
So we're breathing some
of that chemical residue.

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:15.200 align:middle line:84%
There are so many layers
and layers of toxins

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.420 align:middle line:90%
that we're being exposed to.

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:20.270 align:middle line:84%
The immune system
gets overwhelmed.

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:23.090 align:middle line:84%
So normally, our
immune system, designed

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:27.360 align:middle line:84%
to handle bugs, parasites,
viruses, molds, and fungus.

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's having
to deal with this.

00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:29.320 align:middle line:90%
Sh.

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:30.010 align:middle line:90%
Having to deal with this.

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:30.340 align:middle line:90%
Sh.

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:30.760 align:middle line:90%
Having to deal with this.

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:30.920 align:middle line:90%
Sh.

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:31.820 align:middle line:90%
Having to deal with this.

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:32.390 align:middle line:90%
All day.

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:32.900 align:middle line:90%
Every day.

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:33.110 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.320 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:34.120 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:37.910 align:middle line:84%
Now you get this mild irritant
called wheat coming in.

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:40.460 align:middle line:84%
It's a mild irritant,
but your immune system

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:43.320 align:middle line:84%
is so hypersensitive just trying
to protect you from everything,

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:44.445 align:middle line:90%
it goes, oh there's an elk.

00:30:44.445 --> 00:30:45.530 align:middle line:90%
Pew.

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And once you make the
antibodies to wheat--

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:53.115 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand the reason
why, but that's the only food.

00:30:53.115 --> 00:30:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole mechanism
we can go into if you wish.

00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:57.260 align:middle line:84%
But that is the
only food that I'm

00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:59.420 align:middle line:84%
aware of, that I can
find the studies on,

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:01.740 align:middle line:84%
once you have elevated
antibodies to wheat,

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.050 align:middle line:90%
it's permanent.

00:31:03.050 --> 00:31:04.520 align:middle line:90%
You can't go back.

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Any other food,
you have a chance

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:08.160 align:middle line:84%
of being able to
eat the food again.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.130 align:middle line:90%
Wheat, you can't.

00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:10.670 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know why.

00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:12.110 align:middle line:90%
Why is this one so different?

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:14.090 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to
immunologists about this.

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:18.170 align:middle line:84%
No one has given me an answer
that really makes sense

00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:20.030 align:middle line:90%
to that yet.

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:22.820 align:middle line:84%
But it's a loss
of oral tolerance.

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Our immune system, designed
to deal with bugs, parasites,

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:29.270 align:middle line:84%
virus, molds, and fungus, is
overwhelmed by the toxicity

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:31.610 align:middle line:84%
of the world that
we live in today.

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:34.830 align:middle line:84%
We lose this thing
called oral tolerance.

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:38.060 align:middle line:84%
Then the minor irritants
become just as much

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:41.870 align:middle line:84%
of a response mechanism
as the major irritants.

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:45.279 align:middle line:84%
It's a question of toxicity,
not the wheat itself.

00:31:45.279 --> 00:31:48.213 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:31:48.213 --> 00:31:52.130 align:middle line:90%


00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:53.570 align:middle line:90%
The big kahuna term--

00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:55.760 align:middle line:84%
the International
Celiac Symposium

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:56.840 align:middle line:90%
occurs every two years.

00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And in 2011, we finally
agreed on the classifications.

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:05.010 align:middle line:84%
The big kahuna term is a
"wheat related disorder."

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:06.285 align:middle line:90%
That's the big kahuna.

00:32:06.285 --> 00:32:08.660 align:middle line:84%
Underneath that-- now there
are many different components

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:09.470 align:middle line:90%
in wheat.

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And we could respond to many
of the different components.

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:16.070 align:middle line:84%
Underneath that, if it
reacts, if your genetics say

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:19.190 align:middle line:84%
the weak link in your
chain is in your gut,

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:21.230 align:middle line:84%
then with a
wheat-related disorder,

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:23.810 align:middle line:90%
you can get celiac disease.

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:26.720 align:middle line:84%
Or if you don't have the
genes and you don't go down

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:29.180 align:middle line:84%
that pathway, you may
go down the pathway

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:32.450 align:middle line:84%
of what they're currently
calling non-celiac gluten

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:33.300 align:middle line:90%
sensitivity.

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.510 align:middle line:84%
So you're sensitive to
the proteins in wheat,

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:37.580 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't manifest
a celiac disease.

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:39.890 align:middle line:84%
It may manifest
as cardiomyopathy.

00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:42.200 align:middle line:84%
It may manifest as
attention deficit.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.000 align:middle line:90%
It may manifest as psoriasis.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.790 align:middle line:84%
It can manifest as
many other things

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:48.710 align:middle line:84%
that there's not
as much research

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:52.610 align:middle line:84%
as to where the priorities
are of how it'll manifest.

00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:55.460 align:middle line:84%
But we know for every
one person with celiac,

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:59.150 align:middle line:84%
there's somewhere
between 6 to 30

00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:02.473 align:middle line:84%
that have non-celiac
gluten sensitivity.

00:33:02.473 --> 00:33:03.890 align:middle line:84%
It just depends
on which study you

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:09.800 align:middle line:84%
read as to how many people
have NCGS compared to celiac.

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:12.890 align:middle line:84%
Or it may go from a
wheat-related disorder

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:15.980 align:middle line:84%
down to what are called
FODMAP sensitivities.

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:18.620 align:middle line:84%
That's the fermentable
carbohydrates in wheat.

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:20.308 align:middle line:84%
That's why people
can go to Europe

00:33:20.308 --> 00:33:22.100 align:middle line:84%
and they think they
can eat the wheat there

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:24.952 align:middle line:84%
because they don't get the
bloating that they get when

00:33:24.952 --> 00:33:26.160 align:middle line:90%
they eat the wheat in the US.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:30.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's because the wheat
in Europe is lower in FODMAPs.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's the FODMAPs that cause
the bloating, not the proteins,

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:36.630 align:middle line:90%
for most people.

00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:40.160 align:middle line:84%
So if you have lower
FODMAP-concentrated wheat,

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.680 align:middle line:84%
then you have less chance
of getting the bloating.

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.810 align:middle line:84%
But you still get the
immune system activated

00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:47.750 align:middle line:84%
from the proteins, so you
get the molecular mimicry

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:50.427 align:middle line:84%
with your brain or your thyroid
or your heart, your liver.

00:33:50.427 --> 00:33:52.010 align:middle line:84%
So people go to
Europe, and they think

00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:53.930 align:middle line:90%
they're fine eating the wheat.

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:56.480 align:middle line:84%
But they still activate
the immune system,

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.507 align:middle line:90%
and they can't feel it.

00:33:57.507 --> 00:33:59.090 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't
feel it when you get

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:00.930 align:middle line:84%
elevated antibodies
to your thyroid.

00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:02.930 align:middle line:84%
You don't feel it if you
get elevated antibodies

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:04.650 align:middle line:90%
to your cerebellum.

00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:08.060 align:middle line:84%
So the big kahuna term is
a wheat-related disorder.

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And underneath that, celiac
is one manifestation, about 1

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:12.080 align:middle line:90%
out of 100.

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.929 align:middle line:90%
In Finland, it's 4 out of 100.

00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:15.679 align:middle line:84%
So it just depends
what part of the world.

00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:18.230 align:middle line:84%
But the average is
about 1 out of 100.

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:21.440 align:middle line:84%
Non-celiac gluten sensitivity,
the conservative estimate

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.475 align:middle line:90%
is 6 out of 100.

00:34:22.475 --> 00:34:24.590 align:middle line:84%
Six times more
common than celiac.

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:28.350 align:middle line:84%
But when you talk to clinicians,
it can be 30 times more common.

00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:32.210 align:middle line:84%
So 30 out of 100 may come
in with a non-celiac gluten

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:33.170 align:middle line:90%
sensitivity.

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:35.840 align:middle line:84%
In my clinic, it
was 68 out of 100,

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.280 align:middle line:90%
so I did very advanced testing.

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.420 align:middle line:90%
I checked everyone.

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:40.909 align:middle line:84%
68 out of 100 would
have elevated antibodies

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:44.270 align:middle line:84%
to peptides of wheat of the
people that come into my clinic

00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:46.940 align:middle line:90%
with any complaints whatsoever.

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:48.920 align:middle line:90%
It can be a FODMAP sensitivity.

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:52.699 align:middle line:84%
It can be another component of
wheat called gluteomorphins.

00:34:52.699 --> 00:34:55.370 align:middle line:84%
Those are the
components of wheat

00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:58.160 align:middle line:84%
that are in the family
of benzodiazepines.

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:01.110 align:middle line:84%
That's the drugs that
deal with brain disorders.

00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:03.830 align:middle line:84%
So people like
wheat and because,

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:06.740 align:middle line:84%
if they produce the
gluteomorphins with wheat,

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:09.440 align:middle line:84%
it stimulates the opiate
receptors in the brain.

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And I just feel good
when I eat wheat.

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:11.990 align:middle line:90%
I just feel good.

00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.990 align:middle line:90%
Well, of course, you do.

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:16.460 align:middle line:84%
You're stimulating the opiate
receptors in your brain.

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:19.790 align:middle line:84%
It can be the wheat
germ glutenins out

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:22.370 align:middle line:84%
of wheat, which is the
lectins that causes

00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:25.820 align:middle line:90%
clots, miscarriages, strokes.

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:28.970 align:middle line:84%
So there are many different
components of wheat that

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:30.807 align:middle line:90%
may cause a problem for people.

00:35:30.807 --> 00:35:32.755 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:35:32.755 --> 00:35:37.630 align:middle line:90%


00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:40.340 align:middle line:84%
Create a healthy
environment in the gut.

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Now that is a two-hour talk in
creating a healthy environment

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:47.690 align:middle line:90%
in the gut.

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:50.842 align:middle line:84%
So the way I recommend
people look at this--

00:35:50.842 --> 00:35:52.300 align:middle line:84%
if there's only
one thing you could

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:56.770 align:middle line:84%
do to have a healthier body
is have a healthier gut.

00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And so, OK, how do I
have a healthy gut?

00:35:58.570 --> 00:35:59.590 align:middle line:90%
Give me the lowdown.

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:00.390 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:01.730 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work like that.

00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:03.460 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
to spend one hour.

00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Mrs. Patient, spend
one hour a week.

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:07.720 align:middle line:90%
One hour a week.

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:08.590 align:middle line:90%
And just focus.

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:10.840 align:middle line:84%
All right, on
Tuesdays at 8:00 PM--

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:13.120 align:middle line:84%
whenever it is--
one hour a week.

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:16.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to read more about
the gut, about the microbiome.

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:18.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to learn
more about this.

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:19.600 align:middle line:90%
And one hour a week.

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And if you can allocate that
time, in two or three months,

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:24.850 align:middle line:90%
that's 10 hours, 12 hours.

00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:29.080 align:middle line:84%
In six months, you've
15 or 20 articles,

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.300 align:middle line:90%
and you've got it down.

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:32.862 align:middle line:84%
This is not a simple
give me a pill,

00:36:32.862 --> 00:36:34.570 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
continue living my life.

00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:36.640 align:middle line:84%
But I'll take this pill
to get a healthy gut.

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:37.570 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:40.120 align:middle line:84%
You have to learn how to
take care of this gut,

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:41.380 align:middle line:90%
how to create the environment.

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Because there's nothing
more powerful to protect you

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:45.580 align:middle line:90%
than a healthy microbiome.

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:48.820 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing more powerful
to get optimal brain function

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:51.070 align:middle line:84%
than having a
healthy microbiome.

00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:54.130 align:middle line:84%
For every one message from the
brain going down to the gut,

00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:57.310 align:middle line:84%
there are nine messages from
the gut going back to the brain

00:36:57.310 --> 00:36:59.260 align:middle line:90%
to tell the brain how to work.

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:01.020 align:middle line:84%
So the brain sends
one message down

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:02.290 align:middle line:90%
to tell the gut how to work.

00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:04.300 align:middle line:84%
The gut sends nine
messages back up

00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:06.010 align:middle line:90%
to tell the brain how to work.

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:10.480 align:middle line:84%
That's the healthy microbiome in
the gut or unhealthy microbiome

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.520 align:middle line:84%
in the gut that
sends the messages up

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:15.250 align:middle line:90%
what neurotransmitters to make.

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:17.020 align:middle line:90%
Those are nerve hormones.

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:19.420 align:middle line:84%
What concentrations of
those nerve hormones?

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:21.850 align:middle line:84%
That all comes from
the microbiome.

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:26.520 align:middle line:84%
So my message is base
hits win the ballgame.

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:29.290 align:middle line:84%
In the game of baseball,
base hits win the ballgame.

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:31.660 align:middle line:90%
Stop going for home runs.

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:34.630 align:middle line:84%
Stop looking for the magic
pill that's going to fix you.

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:37.240 align:middle line:84%
Rather, take ownership
that I'm going

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:39.213 align:middle line:90%
to allocate one hour a week.

00:37:39.213 --> 00:37:40.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
go crazy on this.

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:41.790 align:middle line:90%
One hour a week.

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And in three to six months,
I'll have this down.

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And there are a couple
of recommendations

00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:49.540 align:middle line:84%
I do give to everyone
to do right now.

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:53.020 align:middle line:84%
The first one is we have
health food stores here

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:54.910 align:middle line:90%
in the US called Whole Foods.

00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And they're in some
other countries also.

00:37:56.890 --> 00:37:59.370 align:middle line:84%
But they tend to
be healthier foods.

00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:01.650 align:middle line:84%
I say, Mrs. Patient,
go to Whole Foods.

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:05.140 align:middle line:84%
Buy five different kinds
of fermented vegetables.

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:07.450 align:middle line:84%
Just make sure they're
not pasteurized

00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:10.120 align:middle line:84%
because pasteurization
kills bacteria.

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:12.220 align:middle line:84%
That you want the
fermented vegetables

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:14.800 align:middle line:84%
because when vegetables
ferment, they

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:18.700 align:middle line:84%
make the bacteria that are
the families in your gut.

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:20.290 align:middle line:84%
We've got thousands
and thousands

00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:21.610 align:middle line:90%
of families in your gut.

00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter how
much of one particular family

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:25.960 align:middle line:90%
you've got.

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:29.350 align:middle line:84%
What matters is how balanced
are all the families.

00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:30.940 align:middle line:90%
Is it a community?

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And is your gut in a
community working together?

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:35.290 align:middle line:90%
So you eat.

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:36.410 align:middle line:90%
Walk by your refrigerator.

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Every day, just take
one fork full of one

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:40.390 align:middle line:90%
of the fermented vegetables.

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:41.340 align:middle line:90%
Just one of them.

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:42.790 align:middle line:90%
And every day, switch them out.

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:47.170 align:middle line:84%
So they've got
sauerkraut, kimchi, curry

00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:49.450 align:middle line:90%
flavored, Italian flavored.

00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:51.460 align:middle line:90%
Just get a bunch of them.

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And you take one forkful a
day because every vegetable

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:57.850 align:middle line:84%
that ferments is producing
different families

00:38:57.850 --> 00:38:59.980 align:middle line:90%
of good bacteria for you.

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:02.350 align:middle line:90%
So you're inoculating every day.

00:39:02.350 --> 00:39:04.310 align:middle line:90%
That's the first thing you do.

00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:05.710 align:middle line:90%
The second thing is go online.

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:09.670 align:middle line:84%
Go to Google, and type in
"list of prebiotic foods."

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And every day, you
make sure to have

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:13.930 align:middle line:90%
at least two prebiotic foods.

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:16.810 align:middle line:90%
Not probiotic, prebiotic.

00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:21.460 align:middle line:84%
Because the prebiotic foods feed
the good bacteria in your gut.

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.320 align:middle line:84%
They won't feed
the bad bacteria.

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:25.940 align:middle line:84%
They feed the good
bacteria in your gut.

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:28.840 align:middle line:84%
So you're inoculating
every day with a little bit

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:29.830 align:middle line:90%
of good bacteria.

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:33.040 align:middle line:84%
You're varying it, so you're
not getting a dominance of one.

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:34.270 align:middle line:90%
You're varying it every day.

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And then every day,
you're feeding it

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:37.660 align:middle line:90%
with some of the good bacteria.

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:39.190 align:middle line:90%
And you change it out.

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:41.350 align:middle line:90%
Every week, you change it out.

00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:45.010 align:middle line:84%
A good family event prebiotics
include the root vegetables

00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:48.430 align:middle line:90%
such as sweet potatoes and yams.

00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:50.180 align:middle line:84%
Chinese yams are
excellent for you.

00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:50.980 align:middle line:90%
For many.

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:52.150 align:middle line:90%
You want to lose weight?

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:53.620 align:middle line:90%
Eat Chinese yams.

00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:54.670 align:middle line:90%
Just read the science.

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:55.930 align:middle line:90%
It's really clear.

00:39:55.930 --> 00:39:59.140 align:middle line:84%
Because the Chinese
yams and bitter melon--

00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:01.990 align:middle line:84%
those two together--
feed good bacteria

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:05.830 align:middle line:84%
in the gut that help
you lose weight.

00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:08.260 align:middle line:84%
For most people who are trying
to lose weight and they're

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:10.492 align:middle line:84%
having difficulty and
they're really being careful

00:40:10.492 --> 00:40:11.950 align:middle line:84%
and they're not
losing weight, it's

00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:13.600 align:middle line:84%
because they've
created an environment

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:18.100 align:middle line:84%
in the gut of bacteria that's
hoarding calories, storing

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:19.150 align:middle line:90%
calories.

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:22.120 align:middle line:84%
So you eat just a little
bit, but your body stores it.

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:25.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, you want the bacteria that
allows you to utilize calories

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:27.820 align:middle line:84%
for the amount of energy
that you're putting out

00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:30.580 align:middle line:90%
and not store excess calories.

00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:33.100 align:middle line:84%
Chinese yams and
bitter melons do that.

00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:38.050 align:middle line:84%
So you alternate every day
the prebiotics you eat.

00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:39.890 align:middle line:90%
Inoculate with probiotics.

00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:41.770 align:middle line:90%
And one hour a week, you read.

00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:45.041 align:middle line:84%
In six months,
you've got it down.

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:54.408 align:middle line:84%
I had the privilege of
living in Japan for a while.

00:40:54.408 --> 00:40:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And I lived in a
martial arts school.

00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:57.330 align:middle line:90%
I was a deshi.

00:40:57.330 --> 00:41:00.810 align:middle line:84%
That means I got to
clean the toilets.

00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And one day, the grand
master was teaching.

00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And he was teaching
a teacher's class.

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And he talked about when you
are talking to a young beginning

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:17.460 align:middle line:90%
student, be kind and be gentle.

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:21.580 align:middle line:84%
When you're talking to a black
belt, tell them, no, wrong way.

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:22.380 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:28.470 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be able to adapt
to the environment you're in.

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:30.870 align:middle line:84%
Carrying the
message out on stage

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:35.160 align:middle line:84%
and on a platform around the
world to reach the most people

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:37.980 align:middle line:84%
is to give the big
picture overview.

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:42.000 align:middle line:84%
The first most important
thing for most of us

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.580 align:middle line:84%
is stop throwing
gasoline on the fire.

00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:47.700 align:middle line:84%
That's what my message
has been for the last 15

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:51.630 align:middle line:84%
years is let's find
out where the fuel is

00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:55.650 align:middle line:84%
that's fueling the fire and stop
throwing gasoline on the fire.

00:41:55.650 --> 00:42:00.770 align:middle line:84%
Then, you can deal with so
much of everything else.

00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:03.250 align:middle line:84%
The big picture
overview, though,

00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:05.950 align:middle line:84%
is nothing is more
powerful than spirit.

00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:07.210 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:11.650 align:middle line:84%
But we have to get to a certain
point of understanding to be

00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:13.750 align:middle line:90%
able to hear that message.

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:17.890 align:middle line:84%
You can't have a big picture
overview if you're continually

00:42:17.890 --> 00:42:19.900 align:middle line:84%
throwing gasoline on
the fire and your body

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:21.790 align:middle line:90%
is fighting for survival.

00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:24.880 align:middle line:84%
It's really difficult
to be a spiritual being

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:28.270 align:middle line:84%
or to touch that heart
inside each of us

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:30.370 align:middle line:84%
if your body is
fighting for survival.

00:42:30.370 --> 00:42:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And your immune system is
designed to protect you.

00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:36.790 align:middle line:84%
So when you have an overly
activated immune system trying

00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:39.400 align:middle line:84%
to protect you and it's
attacking your brain,

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:41.830 align:middle line:84%
or attacking your heart,
or attacking your thyroid,

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:44.350 align:middle line:84%
it's really hard to
find the peace in life

00:42:44.350 --> 00:42:47.080 align:middle line:90%
and the spiritual big picture.

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:50.200 align:middle line:84%
But nothing is bigger than
the big picture, right?

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:53.440 align:middle line:90%
Of course, that's true.

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:57.340 align:middle line:84%
But I've read stories of
these Indian yogis that

00:42:57.340 --> 00:43:01.060 align:middle line:84%
are masters of spirit
who can sit there

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:05.320 align:middle line:84%
and they took
Ramdas's bag of LSD.

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:07.690 align:middle line:90%
And they just took all the LSD.

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:10.330 align:middle line:90%
10, 15 hits of LSD.

00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And they just sat
there for a few hours

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:14.650 align:middle line:84%
and said, oh, that's very
interesting but were still

00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:17.155 align:middle line:84%
there the holy
person and spirit.

00:43:17.155 --> 00:43:18.280 align:middle line:90%
That it didn't affect them.

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And I can't imagine
how that's possible,

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:22.960 align:middle line:90%
but that's what they report.

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:27.370 align:middle line:84%
So I do believe the spirit is
more powerful than anything.

00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:29.590 align:middle line:84%
But when you're on
fire, it's really hard

00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:31.180 align:middle line:90%
to be in touch with spirit.

00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:33.630 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:38.530 align:middle line:90%


00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:40.840 align:middle line:84%
I have the privilege of
being on the teaching

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:43.570 align:middle line:84%
faculty of the Institute
for Functional Medicine.

00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:46.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't know of a bigger
picture view in medicine

00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:51.760 align:middle line:84%
than functional medicine
taught properly, that we really

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:52.780 align:middle line:90%
see the big picture.

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And mind-body medicine is
a critical component, just

00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:58.190 align:middle line:90%
a critical component.

00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, that's what needs
to be addressed for a person

00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:03.790 align:middle line:84%
to help them heal
from their disease.

00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it's they're
throwing gasoline

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:08.620 align:middle line:84%
on the fire that needs
to be addressed to help

00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:10.630 align:middle line:90%
them heal from their disease.

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it's their ability
or inability to detoxify

00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:17.170 align:middle line:84%
that's preventing
them from healing

00:44:17.170 --> 00:44:19.630 align:middle line:90%
from a particular disease.

00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:21.220 align:middle line:84%
There's no question
that medicine

00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:22.990 align:middle line:90%
is going in this direction.

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:25.570 align:middle line:84%
We've invited the
deans of medicine

00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:29.770 align:middle line:84%
of every medical school to
come to our five-day program.

00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:31.990 align:middle line:90%
And many, many have attended.

00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:35.660 align:middle line:84%
At one event, we had the deans
of some of the major Ivy League

00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:36.460 align:middle line:90%
schools--

00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:38.770 align:middle line:84%
Harvard, Stanford,
Yale, and others.

00:44:38.770 --> 00:44:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And they were there
for five days with us.

00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And in the meetings with them,
they said, yeah, of course.

00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:46.540 align:middle line:84%
This is the medicine that
we all need to practice.

00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:47.800 align:middle line:90%
We will take this back.

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:52.032 align:middle line:84%
But it'll take 10 years before
our students will learn this.

00:44:52.032 --> 00:44:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And at first, we were
kind of startled by this.

00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:55.780 align:middle line:84%
We said, we have
to go back and talk

00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:59.950 align:middle line:84%
to the dean of gastroenterology
who has his own fiefdom

00:44:59.950 --> 00:45:02.530 align:middle line:84%
and all of the professors
in gastroenterology

00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:04.160 align:middle line:90%
follow his lead.

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And he's been in the
business 30 years.

00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:07.480 align:middle line:90%
He's the world expert.

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:10.460 align:middle line:84%
But he doesn't have the
functional medicine approach,

00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:11.260 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:13.660 align:middle line:90%
So we have to slowly educate.

00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we've been doing now

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:19.150 align:middle line:84%
for over 20 years is educating
the young physicians who

00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:22.990 align:middle line:84%
are now becoming the experts in
the field, writing the books,

00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:25.390 align:middle line:84%
writing the textbooks,
teaching in the universities,

00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:28.550 align:middle line:84%
being promoted, who soon will
be the deans of medicine.

00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:29.350 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:45:29.350 --> 00:45:30.400 align:middle line:90%
And so, yes.

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:34.030 align:middle line:84%
Functional medicine is
the health care of today

00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:35.170 align:middle line:90%
and of the future.

00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:36.460 align:middle line:90%
It's the most comprehensive.

00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:38.530 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't leave anybody out.

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:42.070 align:middle line:84%
It brings everybody into
the fold to say, sometimes,

00:45:42.070 --> 00:45:43.780 align:middle line:90%
you have to look at spirit.

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:46.300 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you have
to look at detoxing.

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:48.550 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you have
to look at foods.

00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you have
to look at energy,

00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:53.830 align:middle line:84%
that we need the
big picture when

00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:55.180 align:middle line:90%
we're looking at our patients.

00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:58.048 align:middle line:90%

To attain more fulfillment
and happiness in life,

00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:11.000 align:middle line:84%
I believe the first step in
that is stop throwing gasoline

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.550 align:middle line:90%
on the fire.

00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:17.110 align:middle line:84%
If you recognize, how do I take
care of this vehicle that's

00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:18.890 align:middle line:90%
carrying me through life?

00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:22.420 align:middle line:84%
How can I take care of it
so it's carrying me instead

00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:24.640 align:middle line:90%
of me having to carry it?

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:27.260 align:middle line:84%
So you learn how to take
care of this machine.

00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:28.570 align:middle line:90%
What foods really work for it?

00:46:28.570 --> 00:46:29.770 align:middle line:90%
What foods don't?

00:46:29.770 --> 00:46:31.870 align:middle line:84%
How much sleep do
you really need?

00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:33.550 align:middle line:84%
When do you need a
little quiet time?

00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:35.410 align:middle line:90%
When do you need a break?

As you learn the impact
of your current lifestyle

00:46:41.290 --> 00:46:44.470 align:middle line:84%
and you see what's a
detriment to this machine--

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:50.050 align:middle line:84%
if you use this machine,
this body, as your dashboard,

00:46:50.050 --> 00:46:53.890 align:middle line:84%
there's two ways that you can
read the dashboard in a car.

00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:56.710 align:middle line:84%

you've pushed it too far,

00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:58.940 align:middle line:84%
the hot light comes
on the dashboard.

00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:00.760 align:middle line:84%
You need to pull
over right away.

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:03.850 align:middle line:84%
That's when you have symptoms
and a disease, right?

00:47:03.850 --> 00:47:06.850 align:middle line:84%
In other cars, they've
got temperature gauges

00:47:06.850 --> 00:47:09.310 align:middle line:90%
that slowly start to climb.

00:47:09.310 --> 00:47:11.602 align:middle line:84%
And you say, oh, my
car's heating up.

00:47:11.602 --> 00:47:13.060 align:middle line:84%
It's getting close
to the red zone.

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:13.870 align:middle line:90%
I wonder what that is.

00:47:13.870 --> 00:47:15.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to pull over
here and check it out.

00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:17.427 align:middle line:84%
And then you see, oh,
it's low on water.

00:47:17.427 --> 00:47:18.730 align:middle line:90%
You put water in the radiator.

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:19.563 align:middle line:90%
That's the old days.

00:47:19.563 --> 00:47:21.370 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what they do today.

00:47:21.370 --> 00:47:23.410 align:middle line:90%
But you understand the point.

00:47:23.410 --> 00:47:26.230 align:middle line:84%
When we treat these
bodies like machines

00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:29.470 align:middle line:84%
and we look for what are
the temperature gauges that

00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:31.720 align:middle line:84%
are climbing-- of course,
deal with the hot lights.

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:33.430 align:middle line:84%
But also, what are
the temperature gauges

00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:34.570 align:middle line:90%
that are climbing?

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And you get this
machine working for you.

00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:40.210 align:middle line:84%
It gives you the
ability to then have--

00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:43.650 align:middle line:84%
if I can refer to it, and I've
never used this term before--

00:47:43.650 --> 00:47:46.330 align:middle line:90%
leisure consciousness time.

00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:51.280 align:middle line:84%
That you have a little
leisure time of awareness

00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:55.640 align:middle line:84%
where you can look at the
bigger view of your life.

00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:58.420 align:middle line:84%
But I believe it starts
with stop throwing gasoline

00:47:58.420 --> 00:47:59.393 align:middle line:90%
on the fire.

00:47:59.393 --> 00:48:01.808 align:middle line:90%

00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:12.160 align:middle line:84%
When my son was 17 and
thinking about colleges,

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:15.460 align:middle line:84%
I said to him one
day, Jason, I don't

00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:16.900 align:middle line:90%
care if you go to college.

00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:18.100 align:middle line:90%
I really don't care.

00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:20.410 align:middle line:90%
And he looked at me.

00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:22.630 align:middle line:84%
I love it when I
can catch his mind.

00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:23.980 align:middle line:90%
I can't do that very often.

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:26.740 align:middle line:84%
He's a very, very
smart young man.

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, he was working me
when he was six months old.

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:34.290 align:middle line:84%
He knew how to get exactly
what he wanted from me, right?

00:48:34.290 --> 00:48:36.760 align:middle line:90%
I said, I really don't care.

00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:38.860 align:middle line:84%
That if you look at a
brick wall and you say,

00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:40.720 align:middle line:90%
wow, I wonder how they did that.

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:41.620 align:middle line:90%
That's really cool.

00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:45.010 align:middle line:84%
I can see that I-- and
if it just grabs you,

00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:49.480 align:middle line:84%
it really grabs you, you find
the brick wall maker there is.

00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:51.050 align:middle line:84%
I'll finance you
for a year or two.

00:48:51.050 --> 00:48:52.620 align:middle line:90%
You go work for him for free.

00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:53.905 align:middle line:90%
I'm financing school.

00:48:53.905 --> 00:48:55.418 align:middle line:90%
I'll finance this.

00:48:55.418 --> 00:48:57.210 align:middle line:84%
Or if you want to be
a rock and roll star--

00:48:57.210 --> 00:48:58.000 align:middle line:90%
I mean, really, man.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:58.810 align:middle line:90%
It's in your blood.

00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:00.470 align:middle line:90%
You've just got to do it.

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:01.270 align:middle line:90%
You go do that.

00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:02.800 align:middle line:84%
I'll finance you
for a year or two.

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.090 align:middle line:90%
Check it out.

00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:07.150 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't have
something that grabs you

00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:11.200 align:middle line:84%
and it just won't let
go, you go to school.

00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:14.080 align:middle line:84%
Because that's where you get
more exposure than anywhere

00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:15.410 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:17.890 align:middle line:84%
And my prayer for
you in your life

00:49:17.890 --> 00:49:20.530 align:middle line:84%
is that you find something
that just grabs you.

00:49:20.530 --> 00:49:21.910 align:middle line:90%
You've just got to do it.

00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:24.490 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it is.

00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:26.710 align:middle line:84%
As long as you don't
hurt people, then

00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:28.180 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
have a happy life.

00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:31.680 align:middle line:84%
You're going to make a valuable
contribution to the planet.

00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:36.090 align:middle line:84%
So to your question,
find what grabs you.

00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:38.190 align:middle line:84%
What do you just
have to do in life?

00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:42.730 align:middle line:84%
What is it that you
have a calling to do?

00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:45.530 align:middle line:84%
You just gotta do this
to help the planet.

00:49:45.530 --> 00:49:46.330 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:49:46.330 --> 00:49:48.460 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter what it is.

00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:50.680 align:middle line:84%
If your heart and your
soul are behind it,

00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:52.639 align:middle line:84%
you're going to help
a lot of people.

00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:04.720 align:middle line:84%
As I've done a little bit of
reading, some of the spiritual

00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:05.960 align:middle line:90%
texts over the years.

00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:06.760 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:08.410 align:middle line:90%
A little bit of the Dalai Lama.

00:50:08.410 --> 00:50:10.190 align:middle line:90%
A little bit of the Buddha.

00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:12.640 align:middle line:84%
A little bit of
Paramahansa Yogananda.

00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:14.290 align:middle line:90%
A little bit.

00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And they all say the same thing,
that service is the big kahuna.

00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:21.700 align:middle line:90%
To be of service to others.

00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:26.140 align:middle line:84%
I find, for me, that
what I have to do

00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:28.930 align:middle line:90%
is talk about these things.

00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And if I do that,
I feel fulfilled.

00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:35.710 align:middle line:90%


00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:37.390 align:middle line:90%
I feel grateful.

00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And just the other day, I
was thinking what the impact

00:50:41.290 --> 00:50:42.930 align:middle line:90%
of this message going out--

00:50:42.930 --> 00:50:46.450 align:middle line:90%


00:50:46.450 --> 00:50:47.250 align:middle line:90%
this is great.

00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:51.920 align:middle line:90%


00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:53.340 align:middle line:90%
I feel complete.

00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:54.140 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:59.240 align:middle line:84%
If my life were to end
today, I wouldn't want it to.

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:02.320 align:middle line:84%
But I know that
I've had an impact.

00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's a sense of
completion that I've never

00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:06.680 align:middle line:90%
had before in my life.

00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:07.880 align:middle line:90%
And I'm very grateful.
