[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.210 align:middle line:84%
>> I think for some
of us to wake up,

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.590 align:middle line:90%
we need a wake-up call.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.650 align:middle line:90%
And in 1986, I got the call.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.700 align:middle line:84%
I was in a triathlon in
Palm Springs, California.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And I was on the biking
portion of the race.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.870 align:middle line:90%
And I was making a turn.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And there was a police
officer on the corner.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And he was pointing to
me to make the turn.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.120 align:middle line:84%
But he had his back to
the oncoming traffic.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.350 align:middle line:84%
So I was passing two
cyclists on the corner.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And when I made the turn,
a four-wheel drive vehicle

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.720 align:middle line:84%
going pretty fast catapulted
me out of my bike.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.290 align:middle line:84%
When I landed, I broke
six vertebrae in my spine.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.920 align:middle line:84%
And when you land in
a vertical position,

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.790 align:middle line:84%
the compressive force takes
the columns of the vertebrae

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:57.790 align:middle line:90%
and flattens them.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.720 align:middle line:84%
So I had compressed
six vertebrae.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.430 align:middle line:84%
But when you compress
those vertebrae,

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.670 align:middle line:84%
the volume of that mass
has to go somewhere.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And it went back
against my spinal cord.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.370 align:middle line:84%
When my body landed, it
kind of whipped forward.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And the top vertebrae out
of the six that were broken

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.140 align:middle line:90%
was more than 60% collapsed.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And the arch that the
spinal cord passed through

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.940 align:middle line:90%
had broken like a pretzel.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.400 align:middle line:84%
So I had multiple
compression fractures.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.860 align:middle line:84%
I had bone fragments
on a spinal cord.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And I had the neural arch of
the 8th thoracic vertebrae

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.750 align:middle line:90%
compressing the cord.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And I was in a little
bit of trouble.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.835 align:middle line:84%
And I had four
opinions from four

00:01:38.835 --> 00:01:41.160 align:middle line:84%
of the leading surgeons
in Southern California.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And a typical surgery
for that type of injury

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.130 align:middle line:84%
is called the
Harrington rod surgery.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And they do a
complete laminectomy

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.340 align:middle line:84%
of the back parts
of your vertebrae.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And they cut them
all, back parts, off.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And then they screw in these
long stainless steel rods.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And in my case, it was
from the base of my neck

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.280 align:middle line:90%
to the base of my spine.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.540 align:middle line:84%
They're we're going to
fuse my entire spine to try

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.260 align:middle line:84%
to cantilever and pull the
bone fragments off the cord

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.870 align:middle line:84%
and open up room
for a spinal cord

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.380 align:middle line:90%
to flow up and down to the body.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think if it was
anybody else that I

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.490 align:middle line:84%
had seen an X-ray for
or a CAT scan or an MRI,

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.410 align:middle line:84%
I probably would've recommended
the Harrington rod surgery.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.680 align:middle line:90%
But this was me.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't so quick
to make that decision,

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.920 align:middle line:84%
because I thought that
I would be spending

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.520 align:middle line:84%
the rest of my life in pain
or at least on medications

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.210 align:middle line:90%
or partially handicapped.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And so I decided
against the surgery.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, when you go
against convention like that,

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.510 align:middle line:84%
you're always considered
foolhardy and insane.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:57.350 align:middle line:84%
But I was willing to weigh
what I knew as in my studies

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.990 align:middle line:90%
against what I didn't know.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And I was willing
to take a chance

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.250 align:middle line:84%
and see if I could heal
myself without having

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.230 align:middle line:90%
any surgical intervention.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.450 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they thought I
had post-traumatic stress

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.250 align:middle line:90%
disorder--

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.900 align:middle line:84%
I hit my head-- and that
I was not making any sense

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.630 align:middle line:90%
or I wasn't being reasonable.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.030 align:middle line:84%
But I just had this thought, you
know, I'm not going anywhere.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm not doing anything.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm laying face down.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.840 align:middle line:84%
I had some neurological
problems, of course.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought, you
know, the power that

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.890 align:middle line:90%
made the body heals the body.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And this vitalistic
intelligence that's

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.120 align:middle line:84%
giving us life on a
moment-to-moment basis

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.020 align:middle line:90%
is a consciousness.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And consciousness
is an awareness.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.877 align:middle line:84%
And awareness is
paying attention.

00:03:38.877 --> 00:03:40.640 align:middle line:90%
It's an intelligence.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.080 align:middle line:90%
And it has an amazing will.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.790 align:middle line:90%
It has an unlimited mind.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.530 align:middle line:90%
And it's loving us in the life.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, if my
will could match its will,

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.700 align:middle line:84%
if my mind could match its
mind, and my love for life

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.460 align:middle line:84%
could match its
love for life, maybe

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.160 align:middle line:84%
I could make contact
with it, give it a plan,

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.530 align:middle line:84%
give it a template,
give it a design.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.957 align:middle line:84%
And when I was happy
with that design,

00:04:03.957 --> 00:04:05.540 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I couldn't
do the healing.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.800 align:middle line:84%
So I would surrender my
creation to a greater mind

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.380 align:middle line:84%
and just see what the autonomic
nervous system could do.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.640 align:middle line:90%
So it sounds really easy.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.480 align:middle line:84%
But I think that when
we're in crisis or trauma,

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.630 align:middle line:84%
we tend to focus on what we
don't want to have happen

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.010 align:middle line:84%
instead of what we do
want to have happen.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.460 align:middle line:84%
So I made a deal with
myself that I was going

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.140 align:middle line:90%
to reconstruct my entire spine.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't going to let any
thought slip by my awareness

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.580 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't want
to experience.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I went through about six
or seven weeks of total hell

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.350 align:middle line:84%
because I couldn't get my mind
to do what I wanted it to do.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.900 align:middle line:84%
I'd start off reconstructing
the vertebrae in my spine.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
thing you know,

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.800 align:middle line:84%
I'd be thinking about
living the rest of my life

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.427 align:middle line:90%
in a wheelchair.

00:04:51.427 --> 00:04:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And I'd become conscious
that I was focusing

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.820 align:middle line:84%
on what I didn't
want to have happen

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.920 align:middle line:84%
instead of what I did
want to have happen.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.930 align:middle line:84%
Then I'd start from the
very beginning again.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.742 align:middle line:90%
And I reconstruct my spine.

00:05:00.742 --> 00:05:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd be thinking
about should I sell my home?

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.180 align:middle line:90%
Should I sell my practice?

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And all the people
in my life were

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.340 align:middle line:90%
telling me to sell everything.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.710 align:middle line:84%
But if I accepted the
belief on some level

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.290 align:middle line:84%
that I would be
able to walk again,

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.350 align:middle line:84%
I should never sell my
home and sell my practice.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And so no one could
relate with me.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the beginning
of the dark night of the soul

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.180 align:middle line:90%
when nobody gets you but you.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And you're crossing
a river of change,

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.970 align:middle line:84%
and you're weighing
what you know

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.137 align:middle line:90%
against what you don't know.

00:05:29.137 --> 00:05:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And you realize nobody
has the answers but you.

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.870 align:middle line:84%
So in those six weeks, it
would take me 2 and 1/2

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.730 align:middle line:90%
hours to reconstruct my spine.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
about six weeks,

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.710 align:middle line:84%
beginning of the seventh week, I
went through the entire process

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.540 align:middle line:90%
without losing my focus.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And it was like hitting a
tennis ball in the sweet spot.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.340 align:middle line:90%
Something clicked for me.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And from that point on,
everything got easier.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.380 align:middle line:84%
I was able to do what I
was doing in 2 and 1/2

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.840 align:middle line:90%
hours in 45 minutes.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.940 align:middle line:84%
Little did I know that
I was firing and wiring

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.220 align:middle line:84%
circuits in my brain
and at the same time,

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.720 align:middle line:84%
I was increasing my ability to
pay attention and stay present.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And so when I started
noticing those strong changes

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:15.700 align:middle line:90%
in my body--

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:16.540 align:middle line:90%
the numbness went away.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:17.340 align:middle line:90%
The pain went away.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.530 align:middle line:84%
I started having
more motor function--

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.020 align:middle line:84%
I started to correlate what
I was doing inside of me

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.080 align:middle line:84%
with the effects I was
producing outside of me.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And the moment I was able to
correlate that connection,

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.010 align:middle line:84%
I did it with more passion,
more sincerity, more enthusiasm,

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.650 align:middle line:84%
instead of dreading going
through the process.

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And that was the switch for me,
because from that moment on,

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.360 align:middle line:84%
my body started to respond
to my mind very quickly.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And they told me that I'd
probably never walk again.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:51.070 align:middle line:84%
They told me that I
would have to live

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.220 align:middle line:90%
in a body cast for a year.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And that I'd be
handicapped in some way.

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And was back on my feet in
a little less than 10 weeks.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.520 align:middle line:90%
I was back training at 12 weeks.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And to this day I really
have no pain in my spine.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And I just made a
deal with myself.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.680 align:middle line:84%
In those lonely
nights, you know,

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.140 align:middle line:84%
I thought if I'm ever
able to walk again,

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.750 align:middle line:84%
I promised myself
that I'll spend

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.720 align:middle line:84%
the rest of my life studying
the mind-body connection

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.890 align:middle line:90%
and mind over matter.

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I've
been doing since 1986.

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.856 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:27.856 --> 00:07:32.260 align:middle line:90%


00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually, it was
an 83-year-old woman--

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Was it really?

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Going 55 miles an hour.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.030 align:middle line:84%
She shouldn't have even
been on the course.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't even
know that she hit me.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:46.770 align:middle line:84%
So my bicycle shot about
10 feet in the air.

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:48.670 align:middle line:90%
And the truck kept coming.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And I just grabbed
onto the bumper.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:53.425 align:middle line:84%
And she dragged me down
the road about 30 yards.

00:07:53.425 --> 00:07:54.550 align:middle line:90%
And then she stopped short.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:56.772 align:middle line:90%
And I just rolled down the road.

00:07:56.772 --> 00:07:59.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's an elaborate
story that goes along with it.

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:03.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just I had one side of
my body was complete road rash.

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:06.820 align:middle line:84%
When I woke up the next
morning from the injury,

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.680 align:middle line:90%
I was stuck to the sheets.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.130 align:middle line:84%
My whole body was-- they had
to come with spray bottles

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:15.790 align:middle line:84%
and spray the sheets and
slowly peel them off me.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And I had gravel all in
my-- it was pretty crazy.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:23.020 align:middle line:84%
But I never had
any anger at all.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because I knew
that on some level

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:30.040 align:middle line:90%
that this was my initiation.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.289 align:middle line:84%
And in order for
us to be initiated,

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:34.480 align:middle line:90%
we have to be challenged.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so glad
that it happened,

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.740 align:middle line:84%
because I would
never be where I am

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:40.440 align:middle line:90%
today or doing what I'm doing.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'd also created a level
of humility and understanding

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.490 align:middle line:84%
for me that I think that
I needed at the time.

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:49.900 align:middle line:90%
And it just changed me.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And the challenge is,
of course, after you're

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.520 align:middle line:84%
initiated like that, you
step back into your life

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.475 align:middle line:84%
and you can't relate
with anybody anymore.

00:08:57.475 --> 00:08:59.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what was I going
to be unhappy about?

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.570 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I duff a golf shot.

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:03.760 align:middle line:90%
And I was like beautiful day.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.160 align:middle line:84%
I just happy to be
alive and standing up.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:12.340 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, that sparked
an interest in something else.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.520 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know
what happened to me.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:19.480 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know if anybody
else understood this.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.710 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know the
science behind it.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And in no science could
I find the explanation

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:28.390 align:middle line:90%
in the old models of science.

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:31.690 align:middle line:84%
I had to start looking at
the quantum model of reality

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:33.490 align:middle line:84%
and start looking
at epigenetics.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.410 align:middle line:84%
I had to start looking
at neuroplasticity,

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:38.500 align:middle line:84%
psychoneuroimmunology,
neuroendocrinology.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.990 align:middle line:84%
I had to piece together
a model of understanding.

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time, it stopped me

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.330 align:middle line:84%
enough to ask bigger
questions, like who am I?

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:47.677 align:middle line:90%
What am I doing here?

00:09:47.677 --> 00:09:48.760 align:middle line:90%
What's my purpose in life?

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:49.802 align:middle line:90%
What happens when we die?

00:09:49.802 --> 00:09:51.290 align:middle line:90%
Is it really about success?

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.840 align:middle line:90%
What is it about?

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And that started
my inward journey.

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And asking those
big questions, I

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:02.470 align:middle line:84%
think that you have to open
up doors of possibility

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:07.480 align:middle line:84%
and look to see for answers
that aren't based in tradition

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.040 align:middle line:90%
or religion or culture.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:13.540 align:middle line:84%
I think that those
languages are dated.

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think science is
the contemporary language

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:16.390 align:middle line:90%
of mysticism.

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:19.600 align:middle line:84%
I think science is what
demystifies the mystical.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And all of those
new sciences point

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:22.750 align:middle line:90%
the finger at possibility.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I understand
now how it happened.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened after
that I retreated from my life.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.220 align:middle line:90%
I left Southern California.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.440 align:middle line:84%
I moved to the
Pacific Northwest.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And I just disconnected, sold
everything, sold my practice,

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.485 align:middle line:84%
and really just started
to study and really try

00:10:42.485 --> 00:10:43.360 align:middle line:90%
to piece it together.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And then I got interested
in spontaneous remissions.

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And I started saying, anybody
else have these conditions?

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And so I traveled to
17 different countries

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.630 align:middle line:84%
and interviewed hundreds
and hundreds of people

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:59.110 align:middle line:84%
that were diagnosed
with a medical condition

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:00.610 align:middle line:84%
they were treating
conventionally or

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:02.080 align:middle line:90%
unconventionally.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.260 align:middle line:84%
They were staying the
same or getting worse

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.150 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden
they got better.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to know
what the cause was

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:11.270 align:middle line:90%
that produce that effect.

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And so I assembled
four basic principles,

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.860 align:middle line:84%
which stood right in alignment
with what happened to me

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:20.300 align:middle line:90%
and wrote a book.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And that book kind of was the
science of changing your mind

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.560 align:middle line:84%
and how this all
happens and kind of gave

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:33.340 align:middle line:84%
the principles of those
four specific relative

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.500 align:middle line:90%
commonalities.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.290 align:middle line:84%
But then the next part of
me was like, OK, well, I

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:41.770 align:middle line:84%
understand now that
it happens to people

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:43.130 align:middle line:90%
and they weren't mystics.

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:44.230 align:middle line:90%
They weren't spiritual.

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Some of them, you
know, ate meat.

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:49.210 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they're just all--

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:50.130 align:middle line:90%
smoke cigarettes.

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:53.530 align:middle line:84%
It was just no commonality
other than the fact

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:56.720 align:middle line:84%
that there was an element
of mind involved in it.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:00.790 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, if I know the
principles, it happened to me,

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:04.480 align:middle line:84%
and these people have
similar understandings,

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.520 align:middle line:90%
can I reproduce it?

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And so that's when I started
to teach the practical aspect

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:14.060 align:middle line:84%
and to see if we're able
to reproduce those changes.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:18.507 align:middle line:84%
And I think for the first year,
we didn't see many changes.

00:12:18.507 --> 00:12:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if I
wasn't saying it well enough

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:24.710 align:middle line:84%
or it was just the
consciousness at the time.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:26.980 align:middle line:84%
But after that
first year, people

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.800 align:middle line:84%
started to lock in and
start really applying it.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say that,
the common people are

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:35.750 align:middle line:90%
doing the uncommon.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:37.042 align:middle line:90%
And they're healing themselves.

00:12:37.042 --> 00:12:39.077 align:middle line:84%
Once they understand
the what and the why,

00:12:39.077 --> 00:12:40.160 align:middle line:90%
the how gets a lot easier.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.058 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:43.058 --> 00:12:47.845 align:middle line:90%


00:12:47.845 --> 00:12:49.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'll answer
the question pretty much

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.520 align:middle line:90%
on a couple of different levels.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:56.410 align:middle line:84%
I think that when we talk
about anxiety and depression,

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:58.510 align:middle line:84%
anxiety and depression on
a functional brain scan

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:00.520 align:middle line:90%
looks exactly the same.

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:04.420 align:middle line:84%
Anxiety is when we are
knocked out of balance.

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:06.615 align:middle line:84%
And when we are knocked
out of homeostasis

00:13:06.615 --> 00:13:07.990 align:middle line:84%
or we're knock
out of balance, we

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:10.250 align:middle line:84%
turn on what's called
a stress response.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And when the stress
response is turned on,

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:16.420 align:middle line:84%
we mobilize enormous amounts
of the body's resources

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.610 align:middle line:84%
for some threat in our
external environment.

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:21.010 align:middle line:84%
We turn on that sympathetic
nervous system, or the fight

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:23.030 align:middle line:90%
or flight nervous system.

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:26.680 align:middle line:84%
When we begin to mobilize
all that energy, of course,

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.500 align:middle line:84%
it gives the body a
rush of adrenaline.

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And the fear or the anger or
the aggression or the pain

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:38.050 align:middle line:84%
or the sadness that's created
from the long-term effects

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:41.500 align:middle line:84%
of that tend to become a little
bit addictive for people.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.670 align:middle line:90%
Now, they don't know that.

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:49.210 align:middle line:84%
But over time the
addiction to those emotions

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:52.750 align:middle line:84%
connect to people and
problems in their life.

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:54.640 align:middle line:84%
So they use the
people and problems

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.580 align:middle line:84%
in their life to reaffirm
an addiction to some emotion

00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.433 align:middle line:84%
that they don't even
know that they have.

00:13:59.433 --> 00:14:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't
like their life,

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:03.580 align:middle line:84%
they become addicted to the
life they don't even like.

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And so just like
an addict that's

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:09.490 align:middle line:84%
addicted to some
substance, when you

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:13.690 align:middle line:84%
have to break that addiction,
of course, there's withdrawals.

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And you start having
images and cravings.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what the brain

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:22.760 align:middle line:84%
does when it's going through
an emotional withdrawal.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.700 align:middle line:84%
So if a person has a
trauma in their life

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:27.520 align:middle line:84%
and it brands them
emotionally, the moment we

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.820 align:middle line:84%
feel a change in our
internal chemistry,

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.090 align:middle line:84%
we pay attention to what causes
it in our external environment

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:35.800 align:middle line:90%
and the brain takes a snapshot.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.660 align:middle line:90%
And that's called a memory.

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:39.790 align:middle line:84%
The higher the emotional
quotient, the stronger

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:41.560 align:middle line:90%
the long-term memory.

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.570 align:middle line:84%
So there's nothing
wrong with that

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:46.270 align:middle line:84%
except that when
we're in survival

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:50.230 align:middle line:84%
and we're living in stress,
we tend to anticipate

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:52.750 align:middle line:90%
that scenario happening again.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And we actually plan
for it unconsciously.

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And we begin to select
a future potential.

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:03.307 align:middle line:84%
And we begin to emotionally
embrace that outcome.

00:15:03.307 --> 00:15:04.390 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the challenge.

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:07.210 align:middle line:84%
When you combine a
thought with an emotion.

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:10.300 align:middle line:84%
You're creating a state
of being because thoughts

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.660 align:middle line:84%
are the vocabulary of the
brain and feelings are

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.620 align:middle line:90%
the vocabulary of your body.

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And how you think
and how you feel

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.520 align:middle line:90%
creates your state of being.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:23.620 align:middle line:84%
So the combination of selecting
the worst-case scenario

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:27.760 align:middle line:84%
in your life and
emotionally embracing it

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:32.810 align:middle line:84%
is turning on the stress
response just by thought alone.

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you turn on
the stress response

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:37.060 align:middle line:84%
and you can't turn
it off, now you're

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:39.760 align:middle line:84%
headed for disease,
because no organism

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.450 align:middle line:84%
can live in emergency mode
for extended periods of time.

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:46.540 align:middle line:84%
If you're tapping
the body's resources

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:49.750 align:middle line:84%
for some external threat, for
the short-term, that's great.

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:53.710 align:middle line:84%
When the stress is over, the
body turns back to homeostasis.

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the body
builds its resources again.

00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:59.440 align:middle line:84%
But if you keep turning
on that stress response

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.240 align:middle line:84%
and you can't turn
it off and you're

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.610 align:middle line:84%
mobilizing all this
energy for some threat

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:06.160 align:middle line:84%
in your external
environment, there's

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.080 align:middle line:84%
no energy in your
internal environment

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.140 align:middle line:90%
for growth and repair.

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:11.420 align:middle line:84%
There's no energy for
long-term building projects.

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.810 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's
a war out there,

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:15.580 align:middle line:84%
and you're sending
all the troops out,

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.350 align:middle line:84%
and there's no
Homeland Security.

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:21.370 align:middle line:84%
So as stress hormones go up,
immune function goes down.

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:23.050 align:middle line:90%
It's a fact.

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:25.008 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens
melatonin levels go down,

00:16:25.008 --> 00:16:26.383 align:middle line:84%
of course, which
means you're not

00:16:26.383 --> 00:16:28.270 align:middle line:84%
going to want to sleep
because if there's

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:29.740 align:middle line:84%
a predator out
there, why would you

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.120 align:middle line:84%
be vulnerable in the
middle of the night?

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.120 align:middle line:90%
You got to stay awake.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:36.140 align:middle line:84%
So the survival gene switches
on, and we get in trouble.

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And so if it's not a
predator that's in the cave

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.380 align:middle line:84%
or outside the cave
waiting for you,

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:48.830 align:middle line:84%
which was highly adaptive
thousands of years ago,

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:52.420 align:middle line:84%
but what if it's your co-worker
that's sitting in the cubicle

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:56.110 align:middle line:84%
next to you who you
resent and despise?

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:59.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, that primitive nervous
system that was once adaptive

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:02.140 align:middle line:90%
is now very maladaptive.

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:07.210 align:middle line:84%
But if we can turn on the stress
response just by thought alone,

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:10.599 align:middle line:84%
then as we begin to select that
future worst-case scenario--

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:12.817 align:middle line:84%
and, by the way,
we'll even go, well,

00:17:12.817 --> 00:17:14.859 align:middle line:84%
let's make it worse--
well, what if this happens?

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:15.734 align:middle line:90%
What if that happens?

00:17:15.734 --> 00:17:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And we start to
develop this model.

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And as we hold that
image in our mind,

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:22.270 align:middle line:84%
the body as the
unconscious mind is

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:25.210 align:middle line:84%
beginning to believe it's
living in that future reality

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:26.960 align:middle line:90%
in the present moment.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And the body's getting knocked
out of balance by thought

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.660 align:middle line:84%
alone, because it doesn't
know the difference

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:34.000 align:middle line:84%
between the
experience in our life

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.770 align:middle line:84%
that produces the
emotion and the emotion

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:37.690 align:middle line:90%
that we create by thought alone.

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:39.910 align:middle line:84%
To the body, it's
exactly the same.

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:41.950 align:middle line:84%
So the redundancy
of holding that

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:44.170 align:middle line:84%
thought, combining
it with the emotion,

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:46.900 align:middle line:84%
creating a state of being
over and over again,

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.590 align:middle line:84%
conditions the body to
subconsciously become

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:51.360 align:middle line:90%
the mind of fear.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.540 align:middle line:84%
So now, it's programmed
subconsciously.

00:17:55.540 --> 00:18:00.750 align:middle line:84%
So then anxiety is selecting
the worst-case scenario

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:03.120 align:middle line:84%
in your life and
emotionally embracing it

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.520 align:middle line:84%
until you condition the body
become the mind of fear.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And if you get
really good at it,

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:10.020 align:middle line:84%
the body is going to have
a panic attack without you.

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Try as you may to control
it with your conscious mind,

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:13.650 align:middle line:90%
you cannot.

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.860 align:middle line:84%
You programmed it
subconsciously.

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:19.750 align:middle line:84%
The flip side of the
coin is depression.

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:23.070 align:middle line:84%
The person has a
turbulent past or shocked

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:25.140 align:middle line:90%
or betrayed in some way.

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, when they
create that long-term memory,

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:31.530 align:middle line:84%
they're associating some
person, something in some place

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:34.050 align:middle line:90%
in some time with that event.

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And so what they don't know
is that after the trauma

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:41.640 align:middle line:84%
the betrayal, every time
they remember the experience

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:45.360 align:middle line:84%
or think about it, they're
producing the same chemistry

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:48.690 align:middle line:84%
in their brain and body as
if the event was occurring.

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:51.270 align:middle line:84%
So now the body as
the unconscious mind

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:56.640 align:middle line:84%
is believing it's in the same
past scenario 50 to 100 times

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.020 align:middle line:90%
in one day.

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And if those emotions
tend to drive our thoughts

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.070 align:middle line:84%
and our thoughts
then produce more

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:03.570 align:middle line:84%
of those emotions
and our emotions

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:07.740 align:middle line:84%
drive more thoughts, now
the repetition of that cycle

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.710 align:middle line:84%
conditions the body to
become the mind of depression

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:13.260 align:middle line:84%
or hopelessness
or powerlessness.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.968 align:middle line:84%
So now, the body's
stuck in the past.

00:19:15.968 --> 00:19:17.760 align:middle line:84%
The person wants to
get up and do something

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:21.130 align:middle line:84%
and the body says, you
conditioned me to be this way.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, our
biology, our neurocircuitry,

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:27.480 align:middle line:84%
our neurochemistry, and even our
genes change as a result of it.

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:32.730 align:middle line:84%
So then, the fact that we can
turn on the stress response

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:35.550 align:middle line:90%
just by thought alone--

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:38.730 align:middle line:84%
and it's a scientific fact
that the long-term effects

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.430 align:middle line:84%
of the hormones of
stress down regulate

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:46.530 align:middle line:84%
genes that create disease,
then by the very nature

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:50.500 align:middle line:84%
of those chemicals, our
thoughts can make us sick.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.130 align:middle line:84%
So the question is it for our
thoughts can make us sick,

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:56.520 align:middle line:84%
is it possible that our
thoughts can make us well?

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
fundamental question

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:01.470 align:middle line:84%
that needs to be asked,
because so many people have

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:05.250 align:middle line:84%
been conditioned and hypnotized
into believing that they need

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:08.860 align:middle line:84%
something outside of them to
change how they feel inside

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:09.660 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't have a problem
with pharmaceuticals.

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have a
problem with medicine.

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think it really
works for acute conditions.

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:22.080 align:middle line:84%
You break your arm,
you have appendicitis,

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.520 align:middle line:90%
acute care is great.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:27.420 align:middle line:90%


00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Medical care works
really great when

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:31.500 align:middle line:90%
there is an acute condition.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.800 align:middle line:84%
But chronic conditions
tend to be the challenge,

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:39.140 align:middle line:84%
because chronic conditions
require a lifestyle change.

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And if there's no
chemical change that's

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:44.910 align:middle line:84%
going to intervene to
reduce a chronic condition,

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:47.580 align:middle line:84%
a person has to begin to
make different choices.

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.650 align:middle line:84%
They have to demonstrate
different behaviors.

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:51.325 align:middle line:84%
They have to create
new experiences.

00:20:51.325 --> 00:20:52.950 align:middle line:84%
They have to change
the way they think.

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:55.050 align:middle line:84%
They have to change
the way they feel.

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And that requires them becoming
conscious of how unconscious

00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:59.580 align:middle line:90%
they were.

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:03.540 align:middle line:84%
So then chronic stress
and chronic conditions

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:06.690 align:middle line:84%
that require a
lifestyle change then

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:09.150 align:middle line:84%
means then that
the person is going

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:13.140 align:middle line:84%
to have to go from an old
state of mind and body

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:15.390 align:middle line:90%
to a new state of mind and body.

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And making that
choice to do that

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:21.120 align:middle line:84%
is going to be
uncomfortable, because you're

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.570 align:middle line:90%
stepping outside the known.

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
living in stress,

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:29.910 align:middle line:84%
the unknown is a
very scary place.

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:32.330 align:middle line:90%
So people cling to their fear.

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:36.020 align:middle line:84%
They cling to their guilt.
They cling to their sadness.

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:38.330 align:middle line:84%
They would rather hold on
to that than take a chance

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:42.830 align:middle line:84%
on possibility, because
in survival, or in stress,

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:44.750 align:middle line:90%
it's not a time to create.

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:46.400 align:middle line:90%
It's not a time to imagine.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.900 align:middle line:90%
It's not a time to learn.

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:49.370 align:middle line:84%
It's not a time to
open your heart.

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:51.330 align:middle line:90%
It's not a time to go within.

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:53.060 align:middle line:90%
It's not a time to sit still.

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:56.600 align:middle line:84%
It's a time to run,
to fight, or to hide.

00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And when that primitive
nervous system is activated

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:04.130 align:middle line:84%
and it switches on for
extended periods of time,

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:06.470 align:middle line:84%
the very nature
of those chemicals

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:09.830 align:middle line:84%
cause us to put a lot of
attention on our body.

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:12.110 align:middle line:84%
When you're being
chased by Mr. Big,

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:15.590 align:middle line:84%
you better make sure you're
paying attention to your body.

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:18.050 align:middle line:84%
When you're in a
survival situation,

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:20.390 align:middle line:84%
all of your attention
is on your outer world

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:21.480 align:middle line:90%
where the danger is.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.900 align:middle line:84%
On the person, thing,
place, we focus

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:28.370 align:middle line:84%
on the matter-- we narrow our
focus on things and people.

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:29.990 align:middle line:84%
We put our attention
our environment.

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And when we're living by
the hormones of stress

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:34.280 align:middle line:90%
our attention is on time.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:35.990 align:middle line:90%
We obsess about time--

00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:38.550 align:middle line:84%
the body, the
environment, and time.

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And the very nature
of those chemicals

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:43.760 align:middle line:84%
causes our senses to
become heightened.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.050 align:middle line:84%
We become materialists
that have to define reality

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:46.850 align:middle line:90%
with our senses.

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And if we can't see it, we can't
hear it, we can't smell it,

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:53.880 align:middle line:84%
we can't feel it, we can't
taste it, it doesn't exist.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:57.590 align:middle line:84%
So from the quantum perspective,
we're focusing on the particle.

00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And yet there is a wave of
possibility that we edit out.

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:08.180 align:middle line:84%
So in chronic stress, the reason
that chronic conditions are so

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:10.460 align:middle line:84%
heightened in our
world right now

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:15.530 align:middle line:84%
is because that chronic state
of imbalance of the stress

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:18.740 align:middle line:84%
response becomes
the new balance.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And then the person
then is looking

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:23.670 align:middle line:84%
for things outside of them
to bring themselves back

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:24.470 align:middle line:90%
into balance.

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's OK for
the short term.

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:33.170 align:middle line:84%
But what if your stress
is adding up and adding up

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:33.980 align:middle line:90%
and adding up?

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden we tend to try

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:41.960 align:middle line:84%
to force outcomes, control
outcomes, predict outcomes,

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:43.770 align:middle line:90%
because we feel powerless.

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:46.870 align:middle line:84%
We are matter, in a sense,
trying to change matter.

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And there's only a few
resources that we have.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.030 align:middle line:90%
We compete.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:51.290 align:middle line:90%
We fight.

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:52.400 align:middle line:90%
We force.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.420 align:middle line:90%
We manipulate.

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:54.560 align:middle line:90%
We deceive.

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.540 align:middle line:84%
We do what we can
to get what we need.

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And so amazing time in history
right now because people

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.240 align:middle line:84%
are beginning to
wake up to the idea

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:07.460 align:middle line:84%
that it's more
important for them

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:11.000 align:middle line:84%
to regulate internal states
independent of the conditions

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.950 align:middle line:90%
in their external environment.

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And when we begin to
break that conditioning,

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:18.650 align:middle line:84%
that something outside of us
is going to change how we feel

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:22.040 align:middle line:84%
inside of us, we start taking
responsibility for the way we

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:25.670 align:middle line:84%
manage our thoughts, the way
we manage our emotions, ,

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:28.130 align:middle line:84%
the choices we make, the
behaviors we demonstrate,

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:30.840 align:middle line:84%
the experiences we
want and we don't want.

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
that kind of shift

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:37.160 align:middle line:84%
that begins to bring
people back into balance.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately,
people love to wait

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:43.460 align:middle line:84%
for crisis or trauma or
disease or diagnosis or loss

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:45.910 align:middle line:84%
to finally make up
their mind to change.

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:47.840 align:middle line:90%
And my message is why wait?

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.757 align:middle line:84%
You can learn and change in a
state of pain and suffering,

00:24:50.757 --> 00:24:53.340 align:middle line:84%
or you can learn and change in
a state of joy and inspiration.

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:55.805 align:middle line:90%

00:24:55.805 --> 00:25:00.740 align:middle line:90%


00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:04.460 align:middle line:84%
>> So our research that we've
done just in the last year we

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:07.250 align:middle line:90%
took 120 people.

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And we measured their
cortisol levels.

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And we measured their immune
system response, a chemical

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:17.270 align:middle line:90%
called IgA, immunoglobulin A.

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:20.570 align:middle line:84%
It's the primary defense
against bacteria and viruses.

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:22.520 align:middle line:90%
It's better than any flu shot.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:27.050 align:middle line:84%
It's the body's innate mechanism
for internal protection.

00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:30.380 align:middle line:84%
So as cortisol levels go up,
as stress hormones go up,

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:32.510 align:middle line:84%
and you're tapping
the body's resources,

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:34.430 align:middle line:90%
immune function goes down.

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:36.410 align:middle line:90%
And that's a scientific fact.

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:40.910 align:middle line:84%
So we took 117 people, and we
measured their cortisol levels

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:44.660 align:middle line:84%
and IgA levels before they
started a 4-day event.

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, what
if we teach them how

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:50.370 align:middle line:90%
to create elevated emotions?

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:53.880 align:middle line:84%
Like gratitude, like
joy, like inspiration.

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And let's measure what
happens to their heart

00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:00.210 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that they're
regulating this state properly.

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:02.645 align:middle line:84%
It turns out when you're
living in fear, when you're

00:26:02.645 --> 00:26:04.020 align:middle line:84%
living in resentment,
when you're

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:06.720 align:middle line:84%
living in anger and
impatience, the heart

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.850 align:middle line:90%
beats very incoherently.

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And the mechanism of
sustained stress over time

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:15.570 align:middle line:90%
causes heart problems.

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:17.790 align:middle line:84%
So when a person
starts to feel more

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:20.880 align:middle line:84%
coherent elevated
emotions, the heart

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.430 align:middle line:84%
starts getting very
orderly and very rhythmic.

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And it sends a very strong
signal to the brain.

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:27.750 align:middle line:90%
And the person starts to relax.

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:29.450 align:middle line:90%
They start to feel safe.

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:30.960 align:middle line:84%
They start change
their breathing.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.400 align:middle line:84%
They start to
expand their energy.

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Everything changes because
the person's falling

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:36.708 align:middle line:90%
into the present moment.

00:26:36.708 --> 00:26:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And they're changing
their brainwaves

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:40.350 align:middle line:84%
when they do that from
the vigilant state

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:42.390 align:middle line:84%
of high beta brainwave
patterns when

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:44.400 align:middle line:84%
we're obsessing about
something and trying

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.790 align:middle line:84%
to control everything
to beginning

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:49.920 align:middle line:84%
to slow their brainwaves
down into more

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.200 align:middle line:90%
of an alpha coherent state.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And that imagination
creative state

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.000 align:middle line:84%
is the perfect
state to be in when

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.490 align:middle line:90%
we're executing in our life.

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:05.610 align:middle line:84%
So we measured their ability
to create elevated emotions.

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And we asked them to sustain
those elevated states

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:15.190 align:middle line:84%
for 10 minutes a day, 3
times a day for about 4 days.

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:19.530 align:middle line:84%
So my thought was, well,
if cortisol levels down

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:23.730 align:middle line:84%
regulate the gene to make
IgA, which is a protein--

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:25.770 align:middle line:90%
and all genes make proteins--

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:27.570 align:middle line:84%
what if an elevated
emotion could up

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:30.600 align:middle line:84%
regulate the gene for IgA
and all of a sudden increase

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.130 align:middle line:90%
the IgA levels?

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:38.040 align:middle line:84%
At the end of four days,
we had a 49.5% increase

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:42.250 align:middle line:84%
in immunoglobulin A just by
changing our emotional state.

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:45.810 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's look at
the mechanics of this.

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:49.620 align:middle line:84%
If you're living in the
same emotional state

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:52.350 align:middle line:84%
every single day,
as I said earlier,

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:54.300 align:middle line:84%
your body as the
unconscious mind

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:58.050 align:middle line:84%
is believing in it's in
some environmental condition

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:00.750 align:middle line:84%
because the emotion is the
end product of an experience

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:02.050 align:middle line:90%
in your environment.

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:05.340 align:middle line:84%
Latest research on genes tells
us genes don't create disease.

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:07.920 align:middle line:84%
It's the environment
that signals the gene

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.450 align:middle line:90%
to create disease.

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:11.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, an experience
in an environment

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:13.270 align:middle line:90%
produces an emotion.

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:15.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's the emotion
that signals the gene

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.850 align:middle line:84%
to either up regulate and
make a healthy protein

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:20.610 align:middle line:84%
or down regulate and
shut a protein off.

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:22.690 align:middle line:84%
So in a matter of
four days, people

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:26.760 align:middle line:84%
are able to up regulate
the gene to increase

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:30.270 align:middle line:84%
their immune function
just by thought alone.

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:31.993 align:middle line:84%
So 10 minutes of
gratitude a day,

00:28:31.993 --> 00:28:33.660 align:middle line:84%
the worst thing that
could happen to you

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:34.937 align:middle line:90%
is it could heal you.

00:28:34.937 --> 00:28:37.372 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:37.372 --> 00:28:42.250 align:middle line:90%


00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's fascinating that
you can give someone a sugar

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:51.890 align:middle line:84%
pill, a saline injection, or
perform some false surgery

00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:56.060 align:middle line:84%
or treatment, and a certain
percentage of those people will

00:28:56.060 --> 00:29:00.770 align:middle line:84%
accept, believe, and surrender
to the thought without any

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:04.040 align:middle line:84%
analysis that they're
getting the real substance

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:05.450 align:middle line:90%
or treatment.

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And they begin to program
their autonomic nervous system

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:12.140 align:middle line:84%
to make the exact
pharmacy of chemicals

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:14.300 align:middle line:84%
equal to the substance
or treatment they

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:16.250 align:middle line:90%
think they're getting.

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:18.770 align:middle line:84%
So the fundamental
question is, is it

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:20.690 align:middle line:84%
the inert substance,
the placebo,

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:22.160 align:middle line:84%
that's doing the
healing or is it

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:26.660 align:middle line:84%
the body's innate capacity
to heal by thought alone?

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:30.620 align:middle line:84%
So blue pills work
better than red pills.

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:33.380 align:middle line:84%
If you name a pill that
rhymes with something that it

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:38.420 align:middle line:84%
could increase its ability
for, it'll work better.

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:41.330 align:middle line:84%
People will subconsciously
associate with it.

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:46.370 align:middle line:84%
If you name a drug something
that a person can't pronounce,

00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:48.365 align:middle line:84%
they'll give their
power away to the drug

00:29:48.365 --> 00:29:49.490 align:middle line:90%
and it'll work even better.

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:52.460 align:middle line:90%
They'll be intimidated by it.

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.680 align:middle line:84%
If you charge more
for a medication,

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.390 align:middle line:90%
it will work better.

00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And if the doctor's
enthusiastic about it,

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:00.890 align:middle line:90%
it'll work even better.

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:05.360 align:middle line:84%
So that pill, that
sugar pill, works

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:08.320 align:middle line:84%
because a person's
gotten a substance

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.320 align:middle line:84%
that they've taken that's
taking away their pain

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:12.470 align:middle line:84%
or it's changed in
their internal state.

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:14.390 align:middle line:84%
The moment they notice
a change in their body,

00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:16.020 align:middle line:84%
they pay attention
to what caused it.

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And they start to
condition themselves

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:20.757 align:middle line:90%
to rely on that substance.

00:30:20.757 --> 00:30:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Give the person the
pill the next day.

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:23.923 align:middle line:84%
Give the person the
pill the next day.

00:30:23.923 --> 00:30:25.340 align:middle line:84%
Give the person
pill the next day.

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:27.048 align:middle line:84%
Conditioning,
conditioning, conditioning.

00:30:27.048 --> 00:30:29.390 align:middle line:84%
Then you give them a pill
that looks just like that pill

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:31.880 align:middle line:84%
and it's nothing more
than starch or sugar,

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:35.240 align:middle line:84%
and their body begins to
produce the same chemistry.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:38.510 align:middle line:84%
So when they get
that pill that's

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:41.150 align:middle line:84%
an inert substance,
if conditioning

00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:43.940 align:middle line:84%
is based on the past,
then expectation

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:45.410 align:middle line:90%
is based on the future.

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:49.760 align:middle line:84%
They begin to expect the
same outcome as the past.

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And the anticipation
of the event

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:54.770 align:middle line:84%
causes the body
to naturally begin

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:56.660 align:middle line:90%
to make its own chemicals.

00:30:56.660 --> 00:31:01.700 align:middle line:84%
So that pill then is a
symbol of possibility.

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:04.670 align:middle line:84%
And the moment that
person gets that pill,

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:07.280 align:middle line:84%
they begin to select the
potential in the quantum field

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:09.040 align:middle line:90%
called getting better.

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And a certain percentage
of those people

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:15.620 align:middle line:84%
begin to become optimistic,
excited, inspired, grateful.

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And when you combine
a clear intention

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:19.250 align:middle line:84%
with an elevated
emotion, you just

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:22.280 align:middle line:84%
changed your biology from living
in the past, present reality

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:25.620 align:middle line:84%
to living in a future
present reality.

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And when a person moves into
that future present reality,

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:30.950 align:middle line:90%
they're in a new state of being.

00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And that will begin to program
their autonomic nervous system

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:36.560 align:middle line:84%
to make the pharmaceuticals
equal to the substance they

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:38.010 align:middle line:90%
think they're taking.

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:41.265 align:middle line:84%
So the fundamental question
is, do you need a sugar pill?

00:31:41.265 --> 00:31:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Do you need a saline
injection to do that?

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:45.620 align:middle line:84%
Or can you combine
a clear intention

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:49.200 align:middle line:84%
with an elevated emotion and
move into a new state of being?

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.340 align:middle line:84%
In other words, instead
of selecting a known,

00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:56.210 align:middle line:84%
selecting an unknown and
keep revisiting that unknown

00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:59.960 align:middle line:84%
until it becomes a known and
your biology begins to change?

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is
absolutely yes.

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:07.070 align:middle line:84%
So my interest was,
OK, so if I understood

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:10.160 align:middle line:84%
the mechanics of
the placebo and how

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:12.800 align:middle line:84%
it works from a
scientific standpoint,

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:15.300 align:middle line:90%
can you teach people to do it?

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is
absolutely yes.

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:19.610 align:middle line:90%
Now, there's some conditions.

00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:21.440 align:middle line:84%
For example, in
depression studies,

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:25.220 align:middle line:84%
81% of people that are
in depression study

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:29.090 align:middle line:84%
get better in taking a placebo
or the substance the placebo

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:32.300 align:middle line:84%
works as well as the
antidepressant that the control

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:34.260 align:middle line:90%
group is taking.

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:39.260 align:middle line:84%
So 81% of those
people are making

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:42.120 align:middle line:84%
their own anti-depressants
by thought alone.

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.870 align:middle line:84%
You can do a functional
brain scan before.

00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:45.328 align:middle line:84%
You do functional
brain scan after.

00:32:45.328 --> 00:32:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And you can see visible
changes in their brain.

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:51.710 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's
not in their mind.

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:53.390 align:middle line:90%
It's in their brain.

00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:59.270 align:middle line:84%
But those people took that
placebo for eight weeks.

00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:03.020 align:middle line:84%
So every single day, they
were reminding themselves

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:06.430 align:middle line:84%
of that future a reality and
changing their state of being.

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of eight weeks,
they had biological changes.

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:13.340 align:middle line:84%
So there's no panacea,
like you do it once--

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:15.660 align:middle line:84%
although the placebo
sometimes works that way.

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And we see that
sometimes in our work--

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:20.540 align:middle line:84%
but if it took eight
weeks for those people

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:22.670 align:middle line:84%
to move into a state of
being every single day

00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:25.790 align:middle line:84%
to change their
biology and physiology,

00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:28.430 align:middle line:84%
then it may take us eight
weeks to heel ourselves

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:29.480 align:middle line:90%
from depression.

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And we just have to stay at
it for that extended period

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:32.770 align:middle line:90%
of time.

00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And it means then we
would have to break

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:38.050 align:middle line:84%
the conditioning that we
need something outside of us

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:38.850 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:40.100 align:middle line:90%
And that's just the belief.

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's just how
we've been programmed.

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:46.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can tell you that
I have no doubt that it's

00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:48.480 align:middle line:90%
absolutely possible to do it.

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:52.200 align:middle line:90%
We get emails every single day.

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.720 align:middle line:84%
People that were in
chronic pain, people

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:57.630 align:middle line:84%
with rheumatoid arthritis,
people with lupus,

00:33:57.630 --> 00:34:00.900 align:middle line:84%
people with depression,
people with anxiety,

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:05.850 align:middle line:84%
people with cancer, people
with rare genetic disorders

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:09.480 align:middle line:84%
that medical science
has no solution for that

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.060 align:middle line:84%
have completely
unregulated their genes,

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:14.610 align:middle line:84%
changed their
biological presentation,

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:17.148 align:middle line:90%
and they've healed.

00:34:17.148 --> 00:34:19.493 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:34:19.493 --> 00:34:24.087 align:middle line:90%


00:34:24.087 --> 00:34:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I could probably
talk about that for two hours.

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:30.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I start off my book
with this story of a man who

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:32.989 align:middle line:90%
was diagnosed with cancer.

00:34:32.989 --> 00:34:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor gave him a
certain period of time to live.

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And when he got the
diagnosis, he said, look,

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:45.199 align:middle line:84%
I just want to live long enough
to make it through Christmas

00:34:45.199 --> 00:34:47.060 align:middle line:90%
with my family.

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And after that, I don't
care what happens,

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:52.120 align:middle line:84%
but can you keep me
alive to that point?

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:57.150 align:middle line:84%
So they checked his values
and, you know, he was doing OK.

00:34:57.150 --> 00:35:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And a week after
the sentence that he

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:06.680 align:middle line:84%
got on how long he would be
living after the diagnosis,

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.498 align:middle line:90%
a week later, he passed.

00:35:08.498 --> 00:35:10.040 align:middle line:84%
But when they did
the autopsy on him,

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:13.040 align:middle line:84%
he had no cancer, not
even enough to kill him.

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:14.570 align:middle line:90%
So he died by thought alone.

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:17.960 align:middle line:90%
That's how powerful belief is.

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.570 align:middle line:84%
But, I mean, you can
take a group of people

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:22.450 align:middle line:90%
that have Parkinson's disease--

00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:24.380 align:middle line:84%
and Parkinson's
disease is deficiency

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:25.793 align:middle line:90%
in dopamine in the brain.

00:35:25.793 --> 00:35:27.710 align:middle line:84%
When there's not enough
dopamine in the brain,

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:30.407 align:middle line:84%
the upper motor neurons can't
communicate with each other.

00:35:30.407 --> 00:35:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
the motor neurons cause

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.970 align:middle line:90%
a spastic paralysis or tremors.

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:36.860 align:middle line:84%
People with Parkinson's
can't control

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:39.240 align:middle line:90%
that with their conscious mind.

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:44.810 align:middle line:84%
So they did an experiment where
they told these participants

00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:48.350 align:middle line:84%
that they had one of the most
powerful new drugs to treat

00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:50.000 align:middle line:90%
Parkinson's.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And after the saline injection,
more than 50% of those people,

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:59.760 align:middle line:90%
all of their symptoms went away.

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is the cool
part of the story,

00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:07.350 align:middle line:84%
because the doctors that did
the experiment said, well,

00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:09.080 align:middle line:90%
that's just the placebo.

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And one doctor said,
well, OK well if they're

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:13.730 align:middle line:84%
tremors went away,
is it possible

00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:16.130 align:middle line:84%
that they're making
their own dopamine?

00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:19.520 align:middle line:84%
So what they did was they
found a radioactive chemical

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.790 align:middle line:84%
that fit into the same
receptor sites as dopamine.

00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:26.030 align:middle line:84%
So think of receptor
sites as parking spaces.

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:29.180 align:middle line:84%
If the Parkinson's patients
were making their own dopamine

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:32.010 align:middle line:84%
by thought alone, then dopamine
would get to the parking spaces

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:32.810 align:middle line:90%
first.

00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:34.602 align:middle line:84%
And when they injected
the radioactive dye,

00:36:34.602 --> 00:36:36.740 align:middle line:84%
there would be no
radioactivity in the brain

00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:39.290 align:middle line:84%
because dopamine
got there first.

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:41.073 align:middle line:84%
If they weren't making
their own dopamine,

00:36:41.073 --> 00:36:42.740 align:middle line:84%
then there'd be a lot
of parking spaces.

00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:45.157 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden when they
injected the radioactive dye

00:36:45.157 --> 00:36:47.080 align:middle line:84%
would fit into those
receptor sites.

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And when they imaged the brain,
the brain would light up.

00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:51.620 align:middle line:84%
It turns out these
people were making

00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:57.650 align:middle line:84%
200 times the amount of
dopamine just by thought alone.

00:36:57.650 --> 00:36:59.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a
caveat to the story,

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:05.840 align:middle line:84%
because when those people
returned back to their life,

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:08.330 align:middle line:90%
all of their symptoms came back.

00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:10.400 align:middle line:90%
Now, the question is why?

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.640 align:middle line:84%
Because when they
saw their caregiver,

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.390 align:middle line:84%
when they played chess
with their friends,

00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:17.630 align:middle line:84%
when they saw their spouse,
when they slept in the same bed,

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:20.990 align:middle line:84%
the environment began to
remind them by association

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:23.000 align:middle line:90%
who they were as an identity.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And they returned back
to their past biology.

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, then
the next question

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:32.390 align:middle line:84%
is, if the environment
is that strong,

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:34.340 align:middle line:84%
it should be a good
idea every single day

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:35.750 align:middle line:84%
that we change
our state of being

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:37.710 align:middle line:84%
to be greater than
our environment.

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:39.140 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, people
that are treating

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:42.410 align:middle line:84%
for chronic conditions, the
question that I ask them is,

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:45.890 align:middle line:84%
tell me, how long
do you think it took

00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:47.570 align:middle line:90%
you to develop this condition?

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:49.760 align:middle line:84%
Tell me the choices
that you made.

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:52.580 align:middle line:84%
Tell me how your
stress levels were.

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:54.920 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about your
past, your traumas.

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And they can tell a narrative
that usually is years.

00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And I always tell them, OK, so
it took you two years or three

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:04.800 align:middle line:90%
years to create this condition.

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to have to
turn this battleship around.

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:08.995 align:middle line:84%
And by turning it
around to uncreate it,

00:38:08.995 --> 00:38:10.370 align:middle line:84%
it's going to take
a little time.

00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:12.980 align:middle line:84%
So every day, you
have to overcome

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:14.810 align:middle line:90%
some aspect of yourself.

00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:19.851 align:middle line:84%
Overcome, overcome, overcome
until you become someone else.

00:38:19.851 --> 00:38:22.256 align:middle line:90%

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:30.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we do a lot of
mental imaging in our work.

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of move past
the word visualization,

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:37.810 align:middle line:84%
because I think it
kind of conjures up

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:42.220 align:middle line:84%
a little bit too much of
a spiritual association.

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:46.210 align:middle line:84%
The word that's used in science
is called mental rehearsal.

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And mental rehearsal, there's
two types of mental rehearsal.

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:52.330 align:middle line:84%
There's what's called
internal mental imaging, which

00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:57.220 align:middle line:84%
means you're in the scene as the
first person experiencing it.

00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:59.390 align:middle line:84%
And then there's called
external mental imaging,

00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:01.390 align:middle line:84%
which is you're observing
yourself in the scene.

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:03.640 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that
when you are actually

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:06.430 align:middle line:84%
in the first person and
not the third person,

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:09.820 align:middle line:84%
that action of rehearsing
what you're doing

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:12.250 align:middle line:84%
produces the strong
biological change.

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:14.293 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's talk about this.

00:39:14.293 --> 00:39:16.210 align:middle line:84%
You can take a group of
people that have never

00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:18.400 align:middle line:90%
played the piano before.

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And you can do a functional
brain scan on them.

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And then you can teach them
one-handed scales and chords.

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And they'll practice those
chords two hours a day

00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:29.247 align:middle line:90%
for five days.

00:39:29.247 --> 00:39:31.330 align:middle line:84%
At the end of five days,
they grow a whole new set

00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:33.010 align:middle line:84%
of circuits on the
opposite side of the brain.

00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:34.030 align:middle line:90%
Well, that makes sense.

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:35.030 align:middle line:90%
You learn something new.

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:37.960 align:middle line:84%
Learning is making new
synaptic connections.

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:40.373 align:middle line:84%
You get your body involved
with some instruction, when

00:39:40.373 --> 00:39:41.790 align:middle line:84%
you get your body
involved, you're

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:43.082 align:middle line:90%
going to have a new experience.

00:39:43.082 --> 00:39:45.460 align:middle line:90%
Experience enriches the brain.

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:47.170 align:middle line:84%
You pay attention to
what you're doing.

00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:48.553 align:middle line:90%
You got to pay attention.

00:39:48.553 --> 00:39:49.720 align:middle line:90%
And you got to stay present.

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you repeat it over and
over again, firing and wiring

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:55.780 align:middle line:84%
firing and wiring, you assemble
new networks of neurons

00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:57.060 align:middle line:90%
equal to your experience.

00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:58.660 align:middle line:90%
And nothing new there.

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:00.570 align:middle line:84%
But you can take
a group of people

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:02.980 align:middle line:84%
and you can have them
close their eyes.

00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:05.410 align:middle line:84%
Do a brain scan on them
before their experiment.

00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:08.110 align:middle line:84%
Five days later, do
a brain scan after.

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And for two hours a
day, they mentally

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:13.120 align:middle line:84%
rehearse playing those
scales and chords.

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:16.148 align:middle line:84%
At the end of five days,
they grow the same amount

00:40:16.148 --> 00:40:18.190 align:middle line:84%
of circuits in their brain
as the people actually

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:19.900 align:middle line:90%
physically doing the exercise.

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:21.490 align:middle line:90%
So what's the relevance?

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:23.980 align:middle line:84%
Number one, when
you're truly focused

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:26.080 align:middle line:84%
and you're truly
paying attention,

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:27.970 align:middle line:84%
your brain does not
know the difference

00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:29.650 align:middle line:84%
between what's
going on out there

00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:30.910 align:middle line:90%
and what's going on in here.

00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:33.190 align:middle line:84%
So the thought becomes
the experience.

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And the brain looks
like it's been playing

00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:37.930 align:middle line:84%
the piano for the
last five days,

00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:40.090 align:middle line:90%
but they never lifted a finger.

00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:42.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, from a
biological standpoint,

00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:44.440 align:middle line:84%
our brains are a
record of the past.

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:45.970 align:middle line:84%
They're an artifact
of everything

00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:49.060 align:middle line:84%
we've learned and
experienced to this moment.

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:52.540 align:middle line:84%
When we prime the brain
to change its circuitry

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:54.940 align:middle line:84%
before the experience,
now the brain

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:56.960 align:middle line:90%
is no longer record of the past.

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:59.000 align:middle line:90%
It's now a map to the future.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And so as we warm up those brain
circuits, it's more easy for us

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:08.112 align:middle line:84%
to slip into a
supernatural behavior.

00:41:08.112 --> 00:41:09.820 align:middle line:84%
If you take those
people and you set them

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:11.752 align:middle line:84%
from in front of the
piano, and they've never

00:41:11.752 --> 00:41:13.210 align:middle line:84%
played the piano
before but they've

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:15.210 align:middle line:84%
been mentally rehearsing
for the last five days,

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:17.470 align:middle line:84%
they'll play those
scales and chords.

00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:19.750 align:middle line:84%
Like magic, they
just learned how

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:22.360 align:middle line:84%
to do it just by changing
their internal state.

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.250 align:middle line:90%
Take a group of men.

00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:26.110 align:middle line:84%
You can have them
close their eyes

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:30.880 align:middle line:84%
and for an hour day mentally
rehearse doing bicep curls.

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Over and over again, and they
add an emotional component

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:36.790 align:middle line:84%
called harder,
stronger, more intense.

00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And they put themselves
in that first person,

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:40.540 align:middle line:90%
internal mental image.

00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:45.010 align:middle line:84%
At the end of two weeks,
they have a 13.5 increase

00:41:45.010 --> 00:41:48.310 align:middle line:84%
in muscle strength, and they've
never performed the activity.

00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:51.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, not only is
the brain changed

00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:54.820 align:middle line:84%
to look like the experience
has already occurred,

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:58.120 align:middle line:84%
now the body has changed
by thought alone.

00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:00.310 align:middle line:84%
The body looks like
it's been working out

00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:02.390 align:middle line:90%
for the last two weeks.

00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:08.230 align:middle line:84%
So then, the power of mental
rehearsal, of imaging,

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:11.620 align:middle line:84%
primes the brain and body
to look like the future has

00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:12.910 align:middle line:90%
already occurred.

00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And when you set the
extent of your limit

00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:21.190 align:middle line:84%
and you can image what
you can do even further

00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:24.880 align:middle line:84%
than what's normal, then you
are stepping into the unknown.

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
then your body is

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:29.680 align:middle line:84%
going to follow your mind,
because the experience has

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:30.901 align:middle line:90%
already happened.

00:42:30.901 --> 00:42:33.306 align:middle line:90%

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:42.920 align:middle line:84%
>> In February of
2017, this year,

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:50.090 align:middle line:84%
we did a trial where we
measured 7,500 gene regulations.

00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
see if our students

00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:59.510 align:middle line:84%
by thinking differently,
making different choices,

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:01.460 align:middle line:84%
demonstrating
different behaviors,

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:04.760 align:middle line:84%
creating some novel
experiences, and changing

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:09.440 align:middle line:84%
their emotional state, if they
were able to regulate genes

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:14.120 align:middle line:84%
and to understand why students
in our work heal from cancer,

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:17.910 align:middle line:84%
why they heal from inflammation,
why their bodies begin

00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:18.710 align:middle line:90%
to change.

00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, your body is a
protein producing machine.

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And proteins are responsible
for the structure of your body

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.600 align:middle line:90%
and the function of your body.

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And the expression
of proteins really

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:33.720 align:middle line:90%
is the expression of life.

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:38.390 align:middle line:84%
And so in order for every cell
in your body, except red blood

00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:42.890 align:middle line:84%
cells, to make a protein,
a gene has to be regulated.

00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:45.170 align:middle line:84%
So genes are like
Christmas tree lights.

00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:47.480 align:middle line:84%
They're turning on
and off all the time.

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:51.110 align:middle line:84%
When they turn on or when
they become regulated,

00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:54.620 align:middle line:84%
they up regulate and make
a they make a new protein.

00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:57.320 align:middle line:84%
When they down
regulate, they shut off

00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:59.490 align:middle line:90%
and stop making that protein.

00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:02.007 align:middle line:84%
So if you're thinking
the same way,

00:44:02.007 --> 00:44:03.590 align:middle line:84%
you're making the
same choices, you're

00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:04.970 align:middle line:84%
demonstrating the
same behaviors,

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:06.290 align:middle line:84%
you're creating the
same experiences,

00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:08.750 align:middle line:84%
producing the same emotions,
you keep the same lights on

00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:10.040 align:middle line:90%
and the other lights off.

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And now you're headed
for a genetic destiny.

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:17.930 align:middle line:84%
So we found just in our
research that when people really

00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:22.190 align:middle line:84%
understand what they're doing
from an internal process

00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:24.320 align:middle line:84%
that they could
regulate and change

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:25.430 align:middle line:90%
their genetic expression.

00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:26.805 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what happened.

00:44:26.805 --> 00:44:29.030 align:middle line:84%
We had a lot of
genes up regulated.

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:33.170 align:middle line:84%
But we had nine very important
genes, and one of them

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:37.130 align:middle line:84%
was the gene to
suppress cancer growth.

00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:41.780 align:middle line:84%
Another one was nerve cells
actually regenerating, actually

00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:44.660 align:middle line:84%
not just making new
connections, but growing

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:48.260 align:middle line:84%
new neurons as the result
of novel experiences.

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:50.360 align:middle line:84%
In addition to
that, the gene that

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:54.500 align:middle line:84%
makes antioxidants that
creates youth and longevity

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:55.760 align:middle line:90%
was activated.

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:59.660 align:middle line:84%
The gene for stem cells to
become activated and migrate

00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:02.750 align:middle line:84%
to an area of damaged
tissue and regenerate

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:04.700 align:middle line:90%
was activated as well.

00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:09.080 align:middle line:84%
So I now know that we
can regulate genes.

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And when those genes
become regulate,

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:14.090 align:middle line:84%
they make proteins that
begin to heal the body.

00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:16.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's not uncommon
then-- the reason

00:45:16.070 --> 00:45:18.050 align:middle line:84%
I did the research
was because we

00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:20.660 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of
students in our work

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:23.420 align:middle line:90%
that were diagnosed with cancer.

00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And cancer, of course,
then every time a person

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:28.730 align:middle line:84%
hears the word
cancer and they're

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:33.860 align:middle line:84%
given that diagnosis, the first
emotion that they feel is fear.

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And the moment they feel
fear, no new information

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:40.310 align:middle line:84%
can enter their nervous
system that is not

00:45:40.310 --> 00:45:42.290 align:middle line:90%
equal to that emotional state.

00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:44.930 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they'll
only accept, believe,

00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:48.120 align:middle line:84%
and surrender to the thoughts
equal to that emotional state.

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:50.750 align:middle line:84%
So they get the diagnosis
of fear, all of a sudden

00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:52.530 align:middle line:90%
their bodies altered internally.

00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:53.780 align:middle line:90%
They're looking at the doctor.

00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:55.520 align:middle line:84%
They're taking a
snapshot of that moment.

00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:57.470 align:middle line:84%
They're creating a
long-term memory.

00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:59.580 align:middle line:84%
Every time I think about
what the doctor said,

00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:02.720 align:middle line:84%
they're conditioning their body
to become the mind the fear.

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:06.290 align:middle line:84%
They can with all of
their conscious mind,

00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:09.350 align:middle line:84%
which is 5% of who we are,
say I'm going to be healthy.

00:46:09.350 --> 00:46:10.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be healthy.

00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:11.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be healthy.

00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:11.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be healthy.

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:12.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm well.

00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:12.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm well.

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:12.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm well.

00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:13.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm well.

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And that thought is going to
stop right at the brain stem

00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:19.070 align:middle line:84%
and never make it to the body
because it's not in alignment

00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:21.270 align:middle line:90%
with our emotional state.

00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:24.530 align:middle line:84%
So then people then when they
hear the voodoo curse, when

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:26.780 align:middle line:84%
they get the death sentence
three months to live,

00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:29.930 align:middle line:84%
six months to live, nine months
to live, 12 months to live,

00:46:29.930 --> 00:46:32.060 align:middle line:90%
that information goes right in.

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And it begins the program
their autonomic nervous system

00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:35.320 align:middle line:90%
to that outcome.

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's nothing
wrong with that.

00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:42.560 align:middle line:84%
The problem is then the person
is at war with themselves

00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:46.520 align:middle line:84%
because they're waiting for
the diagnosis to change,

00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:48.680 align:middle line:84%
to feel the relief from
the fear and emptiness

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:50.020 align:middle line:90%
that they're experiencing.

00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:51.140 align:middle line:90%
And that's separation.

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:52.250 align:middle line:90%
That's lag.

00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:55.880 align:middle line:84%
What we now know is that change
of person's emotional state

00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:58.660 align:middle line:84%
and teach them how to regulate
those states, not just for five

00:46:58.660 --> 00:46:59.460 align:middle line:90%
minutes--

00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:02.030 align:middle line:84%
and we have people
that have mastered it,

00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:03.800 align:middle line:84%
that can regulate
heart coherence

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:06.410 align:middle line:84%
or an elevated
emotion for an hour.

00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:08.750 align:middle line:90%
So think about this.

00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:13.010 align:middle line:84%
You change a person's emotional
state from fear to gratitude,

00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:14.870 align:middle line:84%
the emotional
signature of gratitude

00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:17.450 align:middle line:90%
means it has already happened.

00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:19.830 align:middle line:84%
People give thanks when
they get something.

00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:23.360 align:middle line:84%
So gratitude is a
state of receivership.

00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:26.750 align:middle line:84%
Change a person's state
to a state of gratitude,

00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:29.330 align:middle line:84%
then they will accept, believe,
and surrender to the thoughts

00:47:29.330 --> 00:47:31.107 align:middle line:90%
equal to that emotional state.

00:47:31.107 --> 00:47:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And they begin to program
their autonomic nervous system

00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:35.150 align:middle line:90%
into a different destiny.

00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:38.321 align:middle line:90%
So that's the easy part.

00:47:38.321 --> 00:47:41.870 align:middle line:84%
The challenge is to get
beyond the emotional addiction

00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:46.880 align:middle line:84%
of fear, to get
beyond our doubt,

00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:50.840 align:middle line:84%
to get beyond feeling terrible
and not doing the work

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:55.070 align:middle line:84%
because we don't feel better
or we don't feel good,

00:47:55.070 --> 00:47:57.410 align:middle line:84%
getting beyond the stress
in our life of trying

00:47:57.410 --> 00:48:01.620 align:middle line:84%
to manage our world, while
we're facing a health condition.

00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:03.530 align:middle line:90%
This is the challenge.

00:48:03.530 --> 00:48:09.410 align:middle line:84%
But we had a lady that
is a psychotherapist.

00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And some years back her husband
went to the tallest building

00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:16.580 align:middle line:90%
in Holland.

00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:20.150 align:middle line:84%
While she was in the shower, he
left, said goodbye to the kids,

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:22.940 align:middle line:84%
went to the tallest
building in Holland

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:26.640 align:middle line:84%
and jumped off the top of that
building and committed suicide.

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:28.640 align:middle line:84%
She was waiting for her
husband to come home.

00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:29.710 align:middle line:90%
She didn't know where he was.

00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:30.710 align:middle line:90%
It was a Sunday morning.

00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:32.660 align:middle line:84%
She she's reading some
papers in psychology.

00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:34.820 align:middle line:90%
The kids are playing.

00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:37.430 align:middle line:84%
Police officers come to the
door and they give her the news.

00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the moment
she hears the news,

00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:42.320 align:middle line:90%
it's a stressful moment.

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And the moment she
feels that change

00:48:44.730 --> 00:48:46.820 align:middle line:84%
in our internal
chemistry, of course,

00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:48.485 align:middle line:84%
she pays attention
to what causes it.

00:48:48.485 --> 00:48:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And she creates a
long-term memory.

00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:52.670 align:middle line:90%
The children were upset.

00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:54.830 align:middle line:90%
She was angry.

00:48:54.830 --> 00:48:57.890 align:middle line:90%
She was sad.

00:48:57.890 --> 00:48:59.320 align:middle line:90%
She was confused.

00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:01.340 align:middle line:90%
She was guilty.

00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:05.270 align:middle line:84%
She was-- every single
emotion you can experience,

00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:09.290 align:middle line:84%
she went through all the
stress hormone emotions.

00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And every time she
thought about that event,

00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:14.283 align:middle line:84%
she was producing
the same chemistry

00:49:14.283 --> 00:49:15.200 align:middle line:90%
in her brain and body.

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, she was
conditioning her body

00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:19.460 align:middle line:90%
into the past.

00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, when you
have an experience like that,

00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:25.158 align:middle line:84%
people in your life treat
you equal to the experience.

00:49:25.158 --> 00:49:26.450 align:middle line:90%
And that becomes your identity.

00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And so you tell the story over
and over again reaffirming it.

00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And she found out after her
husband committed suicide

00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:37.310 align:middle line:84%
that he left her in a very
difficult financial situation,

00:49:37.310 --> 00:49:40.070 align:middle line:90%
huge debt, successful attorney.

00:49:40.070 --> 00:49:41.450 align:middle line:90%
But she knew nothing about it.

00:49:41.450 --> 00:49:43.940 align:middle line:84%
So now her stress
levels go up even more,

00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:46.640 align:middle line:84%
because now it's not only is
she facing a suicide or a loss,

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:50.250 align:middle line:90%
but now she's got a lot of debt.

00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:54.880 align:middle line:84%
So then over time, she
wakes up one morning

00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:58.238 align:middle line:84%
and she's completely
paralyzed from her waist down.

00:49:58.238 --> 00:49:59.280 align:middle line:90%
She can't get out of bed.

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:00.780 align:middle line:90%
She can't move.

00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:02.670 align:middle line:90%
They rushed to the hospital.

00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:05.760 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, she has a
gross inflammation in her body,

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:08.250 align:middle line:84%
but there's no
mechanical problem.

00:50:08.250 --> 00:50:11.630 align:middle line:84%
She's in the hospital for
an extended period of time.

00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:12.630 align:middle line:90%
She can't feel her legs.

00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:13.630 align:middle line:90%
She can't move her legs.

00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:15.430 align:middle line:90%
She can't take care of her kids.

00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:16.650 align:middle line:90%
She can't work.

00:50:16.650 --> 00:50:18.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, she can't pay all
the debts that she has.

00:50:18.690 --> 00:50:21.896 align:middle line:90%
Stress levels go up even more.

00:50:21.896 --> 00:50:24.110 align:middle line:84%
It took her a couple of
weeks to finally get out

00:50:24.110 --> 00:50:24.910 align:middle line:90%
of the hospital.

00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:27.370 align:middle line:84%
She still couldn't
walk on one leg.

00:50:27.370 --> 00:50:29.770 align:middle line:84%
She walked with a
walker and crutches,

00:50:29.770 --> 00:50:31.540 align:middle line:90%
couldn't take care of her kids.

00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:33.070 align:middle line:90%
Depression sets in.

00:50:33.070 --> 00:50:34.525 align:middle line:90%
Stress levels go up.

00:50:34.525 --> 00:50:36.880 align:middle line:84%
A few months later,
she develops all

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:40.030 align:middle line:84%
of these ulcerations in all the
mucous membranes of her body,

00:50:40.030 --> 00:50:43.960 align:middle line:84%
her esophagus, her upper gut,
her vagina, her anus, all

00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:45.700 align:middle line:84%
her mucous membranes
are ulcerated.

00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:47.410 align:middle line:90%
Now she can eat.

00:50:47.410 --> 00:50:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And now if you can't eat, you
become chemically imbalanced.

00:50:50.830 --> 00:50:52.330 align:middle line:84%
So now she's
emotionally imbalanced.

00:50:52.330 --> 00:50:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And now she's
chemically imbalanced.

00:50:53.830 --> 00:50:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And she's physically imbalanced
because she's injured.

00:50:56.890 --> 00:50:58.510 align:middle line:84%
So a few months
after that, she's

00:50:58.510 --> 00:51:00.970 align:middle line:90%
having problems swallowing.

00:51:00.970 --> 00:51:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And they find a tumor
right above her stomach.

00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:07.360 align:middle line:90%
And she has esophageal cancer.

00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor told her that
she had a very short amount

00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:12.460 align:middle line:90%
of time to live.

00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:17.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, she came to a workshop
that we were doing in Holland.

00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:19.620 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the
day she came in

00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:21.130 align:middle line:84%
because she came
in with crutches

00:51:21.130 --> 00:51:24.740 align:middle line:84%
and she sat in a room of
about 500 people on the side.

00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And I saw her walker
and her crutches.

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:29.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, she is a psychologist,
psychotherapist.

00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:31.880 align:middle line:90%
She is an educated woman.

00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:33.010 align:middle line:90%
Got a master's.

00:51:33.010 --> 00:51:34.960 align:middle line:90%
She treats conditions.

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:38.513 align:middle line:84%
She could, from a
psychological standpoint,

00:51:38.513 --> 00:51:40.180 align:middle line:84%
have the insight of
how it all happened,

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:41.980 align:middle line:90%
but she couldn't change it.

00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:45.340 align:middle line:84%
She did one chemotherapy
treatment for the cancer.

00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And she said it just
about killed her.

00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:49.630 align:middle line:90%
And she stopped.

00:51:49.630 --> 00:51:52.600 align:middle line:90%
So she came to our event.

00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:54.430 align:middle line:90%
And she started doing the work.

00:51:54.430 --> 00:51:57.550 align:middle line:90%
And she had a lot of doubt.

00:51:57.550 --> 00:51:59.530 align:middle line:90%
And she had a lot of fear.

00:51:59.530 --> 00:52:02.150 align:middle line:84%
She didn't feel like doing
her meditation certain days.

00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:06.550 align:middle line:84%
But every single day by creating
the elevated emotion combined

00:52:06.550 --> 00:52:09.610 align:middle line:84%
with a clear intention and
changing her state of being

00:52:09.610 --> 00:52:14.330 align:middle line:84%
and overcoming the
past every single day

00:52:14.330 --> 00:52:19.900 align:middle line:84%
in a matter of about a year,
all of her cancer disappeared.

00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:21.400 align:middle line:90%
The tumor shrunk.

00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:25.060 align:middle line:84%
All the ulcerations on all her
mucous membranes went away.

00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:27.300 align:middle line:90%
She has no paralysis, no pain.

00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:28.870 align:middle line:90%
She has no depression.

00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:34.040 align:middle line:84%
She owns a hospital
now in Holland.

00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:37.780 align:middle line:84%
She's one of my executive
corporate trainers.

00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And she has a new
husband and a great guy.

00:52:40.330 --> 00:52:42.520 align:middle line:90%
And he's a successful person.

00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:45.160 align:middle line:90%
And she's in love with life.

00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:50.000 align:middle line:84%
And so we have people that
heal from cancer quite a bit.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to tell you, it
takes an uncompromising world

00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:53.920 align:middle line:90%
to do it.

00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:58.390 align:middle line:84%
But the beauty behind it is
when she stands on the stage

00:52:58.390 --> 00:53:02.800 align:middle line:84%
and she tells her story and
she doesn't look any different

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:04.180 align:middle line:90%
than anybody else--

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:05.950 align:middle line:90%
she's not wearing white.

00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:08.110 align:middle line:90%
She's not young and fit.

00:53:08.110 --> 00:53:09.930 align:middle line:90%
She's just a common person--

00:53:09.930 --> 00:53:13.330 align:middle line:84%
that so many people,
when they hear the story

00:53:13.330 --> 00:53:16.330 align:middle line:84%
begin to change their belief
about what's possible.

00:53:16.330 --> 00:53:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And because of her
and a few other people

00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:21.160 align:middle line:84%
that heal themselves
of ovarian cancer

00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:24.430 align:middle line:84%
and a few other big cancers,
when they tell their story,

00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:middle line:84%
more and more people are
accepting that it's possible.

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we
change the paradigm.

00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:32.500 align:middle line:84%
It's no longer the philosophical
component that does it.

00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:34.120 align:middle line:84%
It's the example
of it that does it.

00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And to me, she is the
living example of truth.

00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:40.480 align:middle line:84%
So then so the interesting
thing about that

00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:42.730 align:middle line:84%
is that if you ask
her about her past,

00:53:42.730 --> 00:53:45.520 align:middle line:84%
she will tell you that it
was the best thing that

00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:47.170 align:middle line:90%
ever happened to her.

00:53:47.170 --> 00:53:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And if you ask her
about her disease,

00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:54.280 align:middle line:84%
she will tell you the disease
lives in the old personality.

00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:56.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm literally somebody else.

00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And just like a person with
multiple personality disorder

00:53:59.650 --> 00:54:02.650 align:middle line:84%
that has an allergy to nylon
stockings in one personality

00:54:02.650 --> 00:54:05.480 align:middle line:84%
and type 2 diabetes in
another personality,

00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:07.630 align:middle line:84%
she literally
became someone else.

00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And the disease exists
in the old person.

00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:14.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, the beauty behind
her is that she understood

00:54:14.110 --> 00:54:17.140 align:middle line:84%
that the emotion, if she could
truly be present and hold

00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:20.440 align:middle line:84%
an image and rehearse
a future and begin

00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:22.240 align:middle line:84%
to create the emotion,
her brain and body

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:25.820 align:middle line:84%
would change from living in the
past to living in the future.

00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:28.000 align:middle line:84%
So then if she's feeling
fear every single day,

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.580 align:middle line:84%
then she's in the past,
because the moment

00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:32.900 align:middle line:84%
she wakes up and
searches for that feeling

00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:35.290 align:middle line:84%
and she gets in touch with
that feeling, that feeling is

00:54:35.290 --> 00:54:37.720 align:middle line:84%
a record of the past and starts
influencing her thoughts,

00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:40.420 align:middle line:84%
then her entire state
of being is in the past.

00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:42.700 align:middle line:84%
Every day as she
starts overcoming

00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:44.800 align:middle line:84%
those emotions and those
doubts and those thoughts

00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:47.920 align:middle line:84%
and attitudes and
hardwired behaviors,

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:49.472 align:middle line:84%
she's changing her
neurocircuitry.

00:54:49.472 --> 00:54:50.680 align:middle line:90%
She's changing her chemistry.

00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:52.060 align:middle line:90%
She's changing her hormones.

00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:53.590 align:middle line:90%
She's even changing her genes.

00:54:53.590 --> 00:54:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And because she studied
it and she understood it,

00:54:56.590 --> 00:54:58.510 align:middle line:84%
she understood what
she was doing and why,

00:54:58.510 --> 00:55:00.130 align:middle line:90%
and the how it got easier.

00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And she said, which I
thought was so beautiful,

00:55:03.790 --> 00:55:07.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm not getting up
from this meditation

00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:09.460 align:middle line:90%
until I'm in love with life.

00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:13.930 align:middle line:84%
Now to the materialist
who's looking for evidence,

00:55:13.930 --> 00:55:16.240 align:middle line:84%
she has no reason to
be in love with life.

00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:17.570 align:middle line:90%
She lost her husband.

00:55:17.570 --> 00:55:19.010 align:middle line:90%
She was in financial crisis.

00:55:19.010 --> 00:55:19.970 align:middle line:90%
She lost her job.

00:55:19.970 --> 00:55:20.932 align:middle line:90%
She had no friends.

00:55:20.932 --> 00:55:22.390 align:middle line:84%
She couldn't take
care of her kids.

00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:23.240 align:middle line:90%
She was paralyzed.

00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:24.040 align:middle line:90%
She had cancer.

00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:24.840 align:middle line:90%
She had depression.

00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:26.340 align:middle line:90%
She had ulcerations.

00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:31.200 align:middle line:84%
But she said, I'm going to
teach my body emotionally

00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:34.780 align:middle line:84%
what my future is going to feel
like before it's made manifest.

00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And over time, overcoming,
overcoming, overcoming,

00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:39.460 align:middle line:90%
she became someone else.

00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And I just had dinner with
her in Switzerland last month.

00:55:43.770 --> 00:55:46.807 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you know, I'm
so in love with my life.

00:55:46.807 --> 00:55:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And I said, of course,
you are, you've

00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:51.756 align:middle line:84%
created your life from a place
of being in love with life.

00:55:51.756 --> 00:55:54.714 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:55:54.714 --> 00:55:58.660 align:middle line:90%


00:55:58.660 --> 00:56:02.860 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, the challenge
behind all of this is that

00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:06.640 align:middle line:84%
people have to understand that
there is a journey that they

00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:07.610 align:middle line:90%
have to take.

00:56:07.610 --> 00:56:10.660 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
95% of who we are

00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:12.730 align:middle line:84%
by the time we're
35 years old is

00:56:12.730 --> 00:56:16.610 align:middle line:84%
a set of memorized behaviors,
emotional reactions, beliefs,

00:56:16.610 --> 00:56:19.450 align:middle line:84%
perceptions,
attitudes, behaviors

00:56:19.450 --> 00:56:23.150 align:middle line:84%
that function like a
subconscious computer program.

00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:26.240 align:middle line:90%
95% of who we are is a habit.

00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:27.600 align:middle line:90%
And it's programmed in the body.

00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:29.350 align:middle line:84%
If you keep doing
something so many times,

00:56:29.350 --> 00:56:31.730 align:middle line:84%
the body knows now how to do
it better than your brain.

00:56:31.730 --> 00:56:36.240 align:middle line:84%
So if that's 95% of who we
are, the body becomes the mind.

00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And most of the time
people are unconscious.

00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:42.190 align:middle line:84%
So they're unconscious
to the way they think.

00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:44.950 align:middle line:84%
They're unaware of how they
act, what they look like.

00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:46.630 align:middle line:84%
They're not even
aware of what they're

00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:49.690 align:middle line:84%
feeling, because it just
feels like their normal self.

00:56:49.690 --> 00:56:51.970 align:middle line:84%
So then to go from the
old self to the new self,

00:56:51.970 --> 00:56:53.770 align:middle line:90%
you've got to cross a river.

00:56:53.770 --> 00:56:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And stepping into that river,
the hardest part about change

00:56:57.520 --> 00:57:01.120 align:middle line:84%
is not making the same choice
as you did the day before.

00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And the moment you decide
to make a different choice,

00:57:03.610 --> 00:57:06.650 align:middle line:84%
get ready, because it's
going to be uncomfortable.

00:57:06.650 --> 00:57:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And so then the moment they
step into that river of change,

00:57:11.170 --> 00:57:13.330 align:middle line:84%
the body has been
conditioned to be the mind.

00:57:13.330 --> 00:57:16.350 align:middle line:84%
The body doesn't
like the uncertainty.

00:57:16.350 --> 00:57:18.010 align:middle line:84%
It would rather
cling to its guilt.

00:57:18.010 --> 00:57:21.400 align:middle line:84%
It would rather cling to its
unworthiness, to its fear.

00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:24.162 align:middle line:84%
So then the moment the body
starts feeling uncomfortable

00:57:24.162 --> 00:57:25.870 align:middle line:84%
and it's been conditioned
to be the mind,

00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:28.300 align:middle line:84%
it starts sending signals
back to the brain.

00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:31.273 align:middle line:84%
And the brain starts
going, you start tomorrow,

00:57:31.273 --> 00:57:32.940 align:middle line:84%
this isn't really
going to work for you.

00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:34.510 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not the truth.

00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:35.390 align:middle line:90%
You're a failure.

00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:36.460 align:middle line:84%
You're too much
like your mother.

00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:37.360 align:middle line:90%
You'll never change.

00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:38.620 align:middle line:90%
This doesn't feel right.

00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:41.110 align:middle line:84%
That's the body
trying to unseat us.

00:57:41.110 --> 00:57:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And if we respond to that
thought or that voice

00:57:43.590 --> 00:57:47.280 align:middle line:84%
as if it's true, that same
thought leads the same choice.

00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:48.530 align:middle line:90%
It leads to the same behavior.

00:57:48.530 --> 00:57:49.630 align:middle line:90%
It creates the same experience.

00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:50.838 align:middle line:90%
It produces the same emotion.

00:57:50.838 --> 00:57:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And then we say, oh,
this feels right.

00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:55.570 align:middle line:90%
Well, no, that feels familiar.

00:57:55.570 --> 00:57:58.090 align:middle line:84%
Going from the old
self to the new self

00:57:58.090 --> 00:58:00.310 align:middle line:84%
is the neurological,
is the biological,

00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:03.967 align:middle line:84%
is the chemical, the hormonal,
genetic death of that old self.

00:58:03.967 --> 00:58:06.550 align:middle line:84%
But we do want to white knuckle
it when we're in that unknown,

00:58:06.550 --> 00:58:07.810 align:middle line:90%
we're in that void.

00:58:07.810 --> 00:58:10.960 align:middle line:84%
The question is, what thoughts
do you want to fire and wire

00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:11.760 align:middle line:90%
in your brain?

00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:14.050 align:middle line:84%
What do you want to put
your intention behind?

00:58:14.050 --> 00:58:16.300 align:middle line:84%
What behaviors do you
want to demonstrate today

00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:17.950 align:middle line:90%
in one lifetime?

00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:21.910 align:middle line:84%
The act of rehearsing
your behaviors

00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:24.160 align:middle line:84%
begins to install the
circuits in your brain,

00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:26.630 align:middle line:84%
priming your brain
for the future.

00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And if you keep installing the
hardware over and over again,

00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:31.600 align:middle line:84%
the hardware is going to
become a software program.

00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:33.142 align:middle line:84%
And who knows, you
may start thinking

00:58:33.142 --> 00:58:34.630 align:middle line:90%
like an unlimited person.

00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:38.630 align:middle line:84%
You may start feeling and
behaving like a healthy person.

00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:42.345 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, can you
teach your body emotionally

00:58:42.345 --> 00:58:43.720 align:middle line:84%
what that future
is going to feel

00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:45.730 align:middle line:90%
like before it's made manifest?

00:58:45.730 --> 00:58:48.870 align:middle line:84%
That means you don't wait for
your healing to feel wholeness.

00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:50.900 align:middle line:84%
You don't wait for your
wealth to feel success.

00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:53.710 align:middle line:84%
You don't wait for the
mystical moment to feel ah.

00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:56.770 align:middle line:84%
That's the old model of
reality of cause and effect--

00:58:56.770 --> 00:58:58.240 align:middle line:84%
waiting for something
outside of us

00:58:58.240 --> 00:58:59.890 align:middle line:84%
to change how we
feel inside of us.

00:58:59.890 --> 00:59:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And when we feel
better inside of us,

00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:03.220 align:middle line:84%
we pay attention to
whatever cause it.

00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:05.027 align:middle line:90%
But what if it doesn't happen?

00:59:05.027 --> 00:59:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Then we spend the
majority of our life

00:59:06.610 --> 00:59:09.640 align:middle line:84%
in lack waiting
for it to happen.

00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:12.610 align:middle line:84%
The quantum model of reality
is about causing an effect.

00:59:12.610 --> 00:59:15.670 align:middle line:84%
The moment we start feeling
whole, our healing begins.

00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:18.147 align:middle line:84%
The moment we in
awe of life, we're

00:59:18.147 --> 00:59:20.230 align:middle line:84%
going to have a mystical
experience, the moment we

00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:23.370 align:middle line:84%
feel worthy and abundant,
our wealth is coming.

00:59:23.370 --> 00:59:26.440 align:middle line:84%
When we feel empowered, we're
moving towards our success.

00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:29.200 align:middle line:84%
The moment we're in love with
life, in love with ourselves,

00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:30.580 align:middle line:90%
our world changes.

00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:32.630 align:middle line:90%
That's causing an effect.

00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:37.030 align:middle line:84%
So the model then of
change is becoming

00:59:37.030 --> 00:59:39.310 align:middle line:84%
conscious of our
unconscious self.

00:59:39.310 --> 00:59:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And the word
meditation literally

00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:44.940 align:middle line:90%
means to become familiar with.

00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:49.320 align:middle line:84%
So if 95% of who we are is
hard wired and conditioned,

00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:52.190 align:middle line:84%
you got to start thinking about
what you've been thinking about

00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:52.990 align:middle line:90%
and change it.

00:59:52.990 --> 00:59:55.390 align:middle line:84%
You got to become
aware of how you act

00:59:55.390 --> 00:59:56.680 align:middle line:90%
and what your habits are.

00:59:56.680 --> 01:00:00.010 align:middle line:84%
So familiar, so conscious
of it, that you would never

01:00:00.010 --> 01:00:01.570 align:middle line:90%
go unconscious again.

01:00:01.570 --> 01:00:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And then you gotta look
at those emotions that

01:00:03.490 --> 01:00:06.430 align:middle line:84%
keep you anchored to
the past and decide,

01:00:06.430 --> 01:00:09.040 align:middle line:84%
do these emotions
belong in my future?

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think that most
people try to create

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:13.660 align:middle line:84%
a new personal reality
as the same personality.

01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:14.980 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:17.088 align:middle line:84%
We literally have to
become someone else.

01:00:17.088 --> 01:00:18.880 align:middle line:84%
So then as you cross
the river and you say,

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:21.520 align:middle line:84%
what thoughts do I want to
fire and wire in my brain?

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.700 align:middle line:84%
What behaviors do I
want to demonstrate?

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:26.380 align:middle line:84%
If you keep firing and wiring
those circuits over and over

01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:28.770 align:middle line:84%
again, it's going to begin
become familiar to you.

01:00:28.770 --> 01:00:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And if you keep cultivating
elevated emotional states,

01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:33.340 align:middle line:84%
just like you cultivate
fear or guilt,

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:35.080 align:middle line:84%
if you keep doing
that enough times,

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:37.390 align:middle line:84%
it's going to begin to
become familiar to you.

01:00:37.390 --> 01:00:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And over time, you
change and transition.

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And so we use the
model of meditation

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:45.880 align:middle line:84%
because the whole
purpose of meditation

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:48.290 align:middle line:84%
is to get beyond
the analytical mind.

01:00:48.290 --> 01:00:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And what separates the conscious
mind from the subconscious mind

01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:53.510 align:middle line:90%
is the analytical mind.

01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:56.830 align:middle line:84%
So then we have ways in
different meditations

01:00:56.830 --> 01:01:00.420 align:middle line:84%
to teach our students how
to change their brainwaves,

01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:02.630 align:middle line:84%
from that high
alert beta brainwave

01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:05.880 align:middle line:84%
state that switches on when
a person's in chronic stress

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:07.500 align:middle line:84%
to be able to
regulate and change

01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:10.140 align:middle line:84%
their brainwaves, to teach
them how to go from focusing

01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:13.110 align:middle line:84%
on matter and objects and
things to focusing on nothing,

01:01:13.110 --> 01:01:15.480 align:middle line:84%
to focusing on space, to
go from a narrow focus

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:16.500 align:middle line:90%
to an open focus.

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And when that occurs,
brainwaves begin to slow down.

01:01:19.930 --> 01:01:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And if they're sensing
space and they're not

01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:24.510 align:middle line:84%
analyzing and thinking,
different compartments

01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:26.520 align:middle line:84%
of the brain that
were once subdivided

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:28.650 align:middle line:84%
because the hormones of
stress because they're

01:01:28.650 --> 01:01:30.960 align:middle line:84%
shifting their attention to
their kids, to their wife,

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:33.168 align:middle line:84%
to their job, to their
problems, to their cell phone,

01:01:33.168 --> 01:01:35.070 align:middle line:84%
to their emails, it's
one of those things

01:01:35.070 --> 01:01:36.870 align:middle line:84%
is a neurological
network in our brain.

01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:39.900 align:middle line:84%
Keep doing that, the brain
starts firing incoherently.

01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:42.030 align:middle line:84%
When the brain's incoherent,
we're incoherent.

01:01:42.030 --> 01:01:44.580 align:middle line:84%
When the brain isn't working
right, we're not working right.

01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:48.000 align:middle line:84%
So by regulating and changing
brainwaves and teaching

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.480 align:middle line:84%
our students how to
do it, in time then

01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:53.588 align:middle line:90%
the brain starts to synchronize.

01:01:53.588 --> 01:01:55.380 align:middle line:84%
If you're no longer
analyzing and thinking,

01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:57.480 align:middle line:84%
the autonomic nervous
system steps in,

01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:00.390 align:middle line:84%
which is its job is to
create order and balance,

01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:02.250 align:middle line:84%
as your brainwaves
change, you begin

01:02:02.250 --> 01:02:06.300 align:middle line:84%
to make contact and go from beta
brainwaves to alpha brainwaves.

01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And when that occurs, all of a
sudden different compartments

01:02:09.210 --> 01:02:10.830 align:middle line:84%
of the brain that
were once subdivided

01:02:10.830 --> 01:02:12.140 align:middle line:90%
start to synchronize.

01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And what syncs in the
brain, links in the brain.

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:16.488 align:middle line:84%
And all of sudden, we
start feeling more whole.

01:02:16.488 --> 01:02:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's the autonomic
nervous system

01:02:18.030 --> 01:02:21.120 align:middle line:84%
then that starts to regulate
balance and in the neocortex,

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:24.300 align:middle line:84%
and we start feeling
more in balance.

01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:27.660 align:middle line:84%
So to regulate and change
the brainwaves, when

01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:29.250 align:middle line:84%
you go from beta
to alpha, you're

01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:31.530 align:middle line:84%
moving right beyond
the analytical mind.

01:02:31.530 --> 01:02:33.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're in the
operating system

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:35.280 align:middle line:84%
where those programs
exist and where

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:37.540 align:middle line:90%
true change can take place.

01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And so our students can change
their brainwaves in 4 seconds,

01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:43.590 align:middle line:84%
in 5 seconds, in 9
seconds, in 13 seconds.

01:02:43.590 --> 01:02:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like a
race to get there.

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:46.960 align:middle line:90%
It's just a skill.

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.250 align:middle line:90%
They just know how to do it.

01:02:48.250 --> 01:02:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And so when they get
into the operating system

01:02:50.790 --> 01:02:53.640 align:middle line:84%
and they change those
associations or those emotions

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:56.820 align:middle line:84%
or those habits into more
productive ones, of course,

01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:58.930 align:middle line:84%
when they present
themselves to the world,

01:02:58.930 --> 01:03:01.180 align:middle line:84%
there is some change
in the process.

01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:05.880 align:middle line:84%
So we use the model of
meditation as a means to do it.

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And there's different
meditations that we use,

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:08.850 align:middle line:90%
of course.

01:03:08.850 --> 01:03:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And we like our students
to do the work every day.

01:03:13.170 --> 01:03:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And our students don't go, oh,
gosh, I got to meditate today.

01:03:16.410 --> 01:03:20.010 align:middle line:84%
They've had so many instrumental
effects because of it

01:03:20.010 --> 01:03:22.410 align:middle line:84%
that they look forward to
it, because not only does

01:03:22.410 --> 01:03:26.200 align:middle line:84%
their biology change,
but their life changes.

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the
benefit, because then

01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:34.290 align:middle line:84%
by changing ourselves
and presenting ourselves

01:03:34.290 --> 01:03:36.270 align:middle line:84%
to the world, of
course, we give people

01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:38.040 align:middle line:90%
permission to do the same.

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:41.306 align:middle line:84%
And the side effect of that is
we begin to change the world.

01:03:41.306 --> 01:03:43.736 align:middle line:90%

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So we have three
types of stress--

01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:51.797 align:middle line:84%
physical, chemical,
and emotional.

01:03:51.797 --> 01:03:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Physical stress, of
course, is trauma,

01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:55.330 align:middle line:90%
injuries, accidents, falls.

01:03:55.330 --> 01:03:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Chemical stress is flus,
bacterial infections,

01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:01.270 align:middle line:90%
blood sugar levels, hangovers.

01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Emotional stress-- family
tragedies, second mortgages,

01:04:04.450 --> 01:04:06.970 align:middle line:90%
single parenting, 401(k)s.

01:04:06.970 --> 01:04:10.760 align:middle line:84%
All of those things knock the
brain and body out of balance.

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:13.300 align:middle line:84%
So if we have three
types of stress

01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:16.450 align:middle line:84%
that knock the body
out of balance,

01:04:16.450 --> 01:04:19.670 align:middle line:84%
then there's three ways
to create balance back

01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:20.470 align:middle line:90%
in the body--

01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:23.170 align:middle line:84%
physically, chemically,
and emotionally.

01:04:23.170 --> 01:04:25.390 align:middle line:84%
In 31 years of
practice, I can tell you

01:04:25.390 --> 01:04:27.370 align:middle line:84%
when you get two
out of those three

01:04:27.370 --> 01:04:29.770 align:middle line:84%
in order with a
chronic condition,

01:04:29.770 --> 01:04:32.800 align:middle line:84%
the majority of time the
third one always comes around.

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:36.260 align:middle line:84%
Person is physically out of
balance and emotionally out

01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:38.702 align:middle line:84%
of balance, if you get them
more physically in balance

01:04:38.702 --> 01:04:40.160 align:middle line:84%
and emotionally in
balance, they're

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.785 align:middle line:84%
going to be more
chemically in balance.

01:04:41.785 --> 01:04:44.953 align:middle line:84%
You get someone more
chemically balanced,

01:04:44.953 --> 01:04:46.370 align:middle line:84%
more emotionally
balanced, they're

01:04:46.370 --> 01:04:48.140 align:middle line:84%
going to be more
physically balanced.

01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And so then it's a combination
of all those things

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:53.200 align:middle line:90%
with chronic conditions.

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And so whether the person wants
to pick the right foods to keep

01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:59.020 align:middle line:84%
her body chemically in balance,
take the right supplements,

01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:01.150 align:middle line:84%
work on their emotional
state, of course,

01:05:01.150 --> 01:05:03.280 align:middle line:84%
they're going to become
more physically balanced.

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:06.010 align:middle line:84%
Person starts working out
and doing yoga and doing

01:05:06.010 --> 01:05:08.890 align:middle line:84%
explosive exercise,
whatever it is,

01:05:08.890 --> 01:05:11.020 align:middle line:84%
and they're making the
proper food choices

01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:12.940 align:middle line:84%
and keeping their body
chemically in balance,

01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:15.398 align:middle line:84%
they're going to start feeling
more emotionally in balance,

01:05:15.398 --> 01:05:18.850 align:middle line:84%
which is going to help them make
better choices for the physical

01:05:18.850 --> 01:05:19.810 align:middle line:90%
and chemical state.

01:05:19.810 --> 01:05:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
how we climb out

01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:22.930 align:middle line:84%
of the hole with
chronic conditions.

01:05:22.930 --> 01:05:25.980 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]
