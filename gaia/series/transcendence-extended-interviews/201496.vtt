00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi, it's James here
from Food Matters.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.170 align:middle line:10%
And today I'm here
with Artie Wu.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.072 align:middle line:10%
Artie is an avid meditator.

00:00:14.072 --> 00:00:15.530 align:middle line:84%
He's been doing it
for a long time,

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.010 align:middle line:84%
and it took him into the
field of emotional healing.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.690 align:middle line:84%
He's the founder
of Preside Life,

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.210 align:middle line:84%
which helps people deal with
emotional trauma and helps.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Them transform it into
ultimately finding

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.770 align:middle line:84%
their true bliss
and today, we're

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.770 align:middle line:84%
going to be talking about
just that and much, much more.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:31.610 align:middle line:90%
Hello, Artie.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:32.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, James.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm excited to chat today,
and particularly interested

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.370 align:middle line:84%
in how you came upon sort of
this idea that meditation can

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.710 align:middle line:84%
be a powerful tool
for transformation.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.510 align:middle line:90%
How did this start for you?

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.760 align:middle line:84%
>> So for me, I grew up in an
environment where meditation,

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.390 align:middle line:84%
healing type things
were kind of the norm.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.080 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in New
York, and my mom

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.780 align:middle line:84%
had this constant what
I called a carnival

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.000 align:middle line:84%
parade of Taoist masters,
Shaolin monks, Tibetan priests

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.500 align:middle line:90%
coming through.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And as a child, they
would be doing the rounds

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.330 align:middle line:84%
around the world to raise money
for their temples at home.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And they would show up in
our living room with my mom.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And in the course of
peddling their wares--

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.860 align:middle line:90%
and I say that with love--

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.890 align:middle line:84%
they would say, Mrs. Wu, it's
perfectly safe, these practices

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.690 align:middle line:90%
I teach.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:33.950 align:middle line:90%
Don't listen to my rivals.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.242 align:middle line:90%
They're all scoundrels.

00:01:35.242 --> 00:01:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, you boy, how old
are you, about eight or nine?

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.330 align:middle line:90%
Come here.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.497 align:middle line:90%
Even a child could learn it.

00:01:39.497 --> 00:01:41.380 align:middle line:90%
Allow me to demonstrate.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.530 align:middle line:84%
I would be exposed
to all this stuff.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.170 align:middle line:84%
So growing up, it
seemed very normal

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.720 align:middle line:84%
that people would
meditate, that people would

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.730 align:middle line:90%
do these kinds of practices.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.205 align:middle line:84%
It just seemed like
a normal thing,

00:01:54.205 --> 00:01:55.580 align:middle line:84%
just like when
you grow up eating

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.060 align:middle line:84%
a certain kind of
traditional food

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.970 align:middle line:84%
that you don't realize
not everyone eats.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.300 align:middle line:90%


00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And so it wasn't
till I was in my 20s

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:15.050 align:middle line:84%
when I realized that not only
does not everyone meditate

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.510 align:middle line:84%
and have these common
practices, it's

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.630 align:middle line:84%
actually the fact that most
people don't do these things.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.887 align:middle line:90%
And it was a shock to me.

00:02:26.887 --> 00:02:28.970 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like, oh my gosh,
the world's messed up.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.260 align:middle line:84%
I was like, oh, the people
who brush their teeth

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.020 align:middle line:84%
in this manner are
in the minority.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, that
explains a lot.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.600 align:middle line:90%


00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I just tucked that
away, went about my business,

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.860 align:middle line:84%
you know, had a
career in high tech.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And after that phase
kind of stopped for me,

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.620 align:middle line:84%
I was looking for
the next thing to do.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that keep kept
coming up for me was this idea

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.820 align:middle line:84%
of somehow teaching not
just meditation in general,

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.520 align:middle line:84%
but the practices that I've
come to rely on in myself

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.320 align:middle line:84%
as a corporate executive,
high-tech founder,

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.660 align:middle line:84%
family person in
the modern world--

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.060 align:middle line:84%
people with just not a lot
of time and a lot of stress.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And what I realized is there
is a subset of practices

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.540 align:middle line:84%
that I just have come to
lean on in my own life.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And those are the ones
that I started teaching.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's just been,
for me, this peak

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.410 align:middle line:84%
into my bliss,
this emerging peak.

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.350 align:middle line:84%
Because at the time,
I was just like--

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.850 align:middle line:84%
after I sold my last
company in 2011, I was like,

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to take another
year off and figure out

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.100 align:middle line:90%
what else I might want to do.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And this meditation
thing kept coming up,

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.660 align:middle line:84%
to the point where
I finally started

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.010 align:middle line:90%
putting some things online.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.700 align:middle line:90%


00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.840 align:middle line:90%
And then that grew.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And then I got this strand
of feedback from people--

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.610 align:middle line:84%
first in the hundreds,
then in the thousands--

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.790 align:middle line:84%
were what they would
say is basically,

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.980 align:middle line:84%
already these
techniques have helped

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.250 align:middle line:84%
me calm the quiet
chatter and voice inside.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.660 align:middle line:90%
So that's great.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.940 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, great.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.290 align:middle line:90%
You're happy, I'm happy.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.000 align:middle line:90%
Let's just keep rolling.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And to a person they would
say, well, hang on a minute.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:34.740 align:middle line:90%
I actually have a question.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And my question
is, now that I've

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.590 align:middle line:84%
quieted this chattering
voice intermittently

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.840 align:middle line:84%
with meditation-- because
it always comes back anyway.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.930 align:middle line:90%
It's a part of you, right?

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.810 align:middle line:84%
I realized I actually
have a second problem.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.950 align:middle line:90%
I was like, OK, what's that?

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And they would say,
my problem is not

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.866 align:middle line:84%
that my inner voice is
chattering and nervous,

00:04:53.866 --> 00:04:56.960 align:middle line:84%
because I can quiet
that now when I need to.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.000 align:middle line:84%
My problem is that the tone and
content of what it says to me

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.790 align:middle line:90%
is basically abusive.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.640 align:middle line:90%
And it's in my head.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.110 align:middle line:84%
With a couple of
shots of whiskey,

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.777 align:middle line:84%
I can kind of hit it
with a two by four.

00:05:12.777 --> 00:05:17.980 align:middle line:84%
But it is a part of me, and I am
kind of not reconciled with it,

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.450 align:middle line:84%
or it is not
reconciled with me--

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.700 align:middle line:84%
however you want
to think about it.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And this, to me,
is the quintessence

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.480 align:middle line:90%
of not having inner peace.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.010 align:middle line:90%
You have inner conflict.

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.580 align:middle line:84%
It's not like, oh my gosh,
you have inner conflict.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.990 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.760 align:middle line:84%
There are voices and
forces within you,

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.850 align:middle line:84%
and they love you and they
do not agree with each other.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a tug of war
constantly back and forth.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:48.795 align:middle line:84%
So like any good tech business
person, I ignored the feedback.

00:05:48.795 --> 00:05:50.670 align:middle line:84%
I was like, well, just
keep trying, you know?

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.900 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what to do.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.800 align:middle line:84%
Until it became this
torrent, this pattern

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.110 align:middle line:90%
across thousands of people.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, I
think this is a thing.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And so I started really
diving into this,

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.710 align:middle line:84%
reading anything I
could get my hands on--

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.740 align:middle line:84%
the whole range of
scientific all the way

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:17.922 align:middle line:84%
to the really kind
of more alternative.

00:06:17.922 --> 00:06:19.630 align:middle line:84%
I would just intake
everything, because I

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.820 align:middle line:90%
was chewing on this problem.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And what basically happened
was that I got to this point

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.620 align:middle line:84%
where, I think in
hindsight, it had just

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.180 align:middle line:84%
stated enough within
me that at one point,

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:45.730 align:middle line:84%
it just came gushing out of
me basically fully formed.

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:51.070 align:middle line:90%


00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:56.040 align:middle line:84%
My family and I were on the
island of Hawaii in 2014

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.340 align:middle line:84%
in Hilo, literally
visiting the volcano there,

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.780 align:middle line:84%
which itself is this symbol
of a well of healing.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.440 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize that at the
time, but I was on a volcano

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.610 align:middle line:90%
while all of this happened.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.250 align:middle line:90%
It just came gushing out of me.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And I was just typing to save
my life, just to get it down

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.000 align:middle line:90%
on paper.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.280 align:middle line:90%


00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And as I was reading
what I was writing,

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:26.600 align:middle line:84%
I was fascinated
but also mortified.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.400 align:middle line:84%
Because I was like,
this is not meditation.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.870 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what this.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.000 align:middle line:90%
Is this emotional healing?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.920 align:middle line:84%
Is this talking about inner
wounds, why your voice is

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.600 align:middle line:90%
negative, what to do about it?

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And I basically just
barfed it all out,

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.740 align:middle line:84%
and then closed it and
put it in my desk drawer

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.480 align:middle line:84%
and left it alone
for six months.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.730 align:middle line:90%
I was like, I can't do that.

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:56.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as a former tech person,
being a meditation teacher

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.330 align:middle line:84%
is pretty much already the
last word in poor taste, right?

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.120 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, I can't take
this next step forward.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.820 align:middle line:84%
I just-- you know, I have
this muse that I refer to.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.190 align:middle line:90%
And I was just like, I'm sorry.

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:09.990 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.220 align:middle line:90%
This is too much.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.770 align:middle line:84%
So I left it in the
drawer for six months.

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And in December of
2014, I got an email

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.770 align:middle line:84%
from one of my
student's advisees

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:27.190 align:middle line:84%
who was taking one of
my meditation courses.

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And in these courses,
you can email me

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.750 align:middle line:84%
and I'll kind of give you
pointers and adjustments.

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:35.539 align:middle line:90%
And so this woman emailed.

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:38.272 align:middle line:84%
I was giving her
help with meditation.

00:08:38.272 --> 00:08:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And as these things
go, she started

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:42.810 align:middle line:84%
getting into her background and
her life story and everything.

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:46.870 align:middle line:90%


00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:51.070 align:middle line:84%
I'll spare you all the detail,
but basically, the thumbnail

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:55.000 align:middle line:84%
of her life story is
that from age four to 18

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.450 align:middle line:84%
had been sexually
abused and assaulted

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:04.870 align:middle line:84%
by basically every adult male in
her family and extended family.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.750 align:middle line:90%
Lifelong alcoholic, drug user.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:11.350 align:middle line:90%
Had recently graduated to meth.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:15.220 align:middle line:90%
Single mom, six-year-old son.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And just this very
much salt of the earth,

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:30.460 align:middle line:84%
good-hearted, good, just
solid person at the core

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:35.050 align:middle line:84%
but with an internal voice that
basically would rip into her

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:38.710 align:middle line:90%
like 150 times a day.

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you know,
I've been to AA three times.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.920 align:middle line:90%
I've been to rehab three times.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.320 align:middle line:84%
This warehouse that I work
in, I have great benefits

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.320 align:middle line:84%
and everything so I
can go to therapy.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:55.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm just trying to
stay alive for my son.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:10:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And so nothing else worked, and
I came across your meditation.

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying it, and it's
sort of started to work.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And at that point I
was just like, OK.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:10.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.715 align:middle line:90%
Just give me a week.

00:10:14.715 --> 00:10:15.840 align:middle line:90%
And she's like, no, no, no.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm fine doing-- I
was like, meditation

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.220 align:middle line:90%
is not what you need.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.060 align:middle line:90%
Just give me a week.

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.320 align:middle line:90%
I'll come up with something.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.445 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, well, I'm
not asking for a handout.

00:10:24.445 --> 00:10:29.400 align:middle line:90%
I was like, just give me a week.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.140 align:middle line:90%
And she was like, OK.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.350 align:middle line:84%
So at the end of 2014 and
the week between Christmas

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.290 align:middle line:84%
and New Year's, I holed up
in my studio with my mic

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:42.055 align:middle line:84%
and I basically recorded
this Eleven talk series.

00:10:42.055 --> 00:10:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And I don't name her,
but I'm basically

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.930 align:middle line:90%
talking to her the whole time.

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:50.590 align:middle line:90%


00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:55.060 align:middle line:84%
In that, I basically outline
the full arc of everything

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:59.350 align:middle line:84%
I barfed out in
Hilo on the volcano.

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that was
basically the muse, if you

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:06.280 align:middle line:84%
want to call her that, coming in
and saying, well, that's fine.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.900 align:middle line:90%
I've given you this.

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.400 align:middle line:90%
I've sent you all these signals.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.150 align:middle line:84%
I've pulled all the
stuff out of you,

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.160 align:middle line:84%
and you're still
being chickenshit.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:13.960 align:middle line:90%
And that's fine.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:18.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're just
human, and a man.

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:20.860 align:middle line:90%
It's all fine.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.740 align:middle line:84%
But I just want to make
it clear that if you

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:29.330 align:middle line:84%
turn your back on me, you're
turning your back on her too.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.550 align:middle line:90%
Fuck with me.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:34.430 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, fine.

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:37.135 align:middle line:90%
Fine.

00:11:37.135 --> 00:11:38.810 align:middle line:90%
So I recorded the Eleven talks.

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:41.840 align:middle line:90%
I sent them to her.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:48.570 align:middle line:90%
Long story short, she did well.

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:49.370 align:middle line:90%
She did well.

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:50.245 align:middle line:90%
She stopped drinking.

00:11:50.245 --> 00:11:54.540 align:middle line:84%
She stopped using, the
whole roller coaster.

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.840 align:middle line:90%
And to me, every now and then--

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.770 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we're friends.

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:00.720 align:middle line:84%
Every now and then, she'll
still email me saying, well,

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.180 align:middle line:90%
I fell off the wagon.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.370 align:middle line:84%
I had half a shot,
and I spit it out.

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:05.630 align:middle line:90%
It just tasted disgusting.

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:06.713 align:middle line:90%
But I'm such a bad person.

00:12:06.713 --> 00:12:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just like, every
time I get an email from you,

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:14.060 align:middle line:84%
I do a happy dance around
my office because I'm like,

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.160 align:middle line:90%
you're unkillable.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm just so happy every day
I know you're still alive

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:22.260 align:middle line:84%
and you're with your
son and all of that.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how I got
pulled kicking and screaming

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:29.240 align:middle line:90%
into healing.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.758 align:middle line:84%
And after I shot
that, I just gave

00:12:31.758 --> 00:12:33.050 align:middle line:90%
it to all my meditation people.

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And they were like, this is
like the best meditation.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, it's
not a meditation.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.370 align:middle line:90%
It's-- never mind.

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:39.170 align:middle line:90%
Fine.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:42.100 align:middle line:90%


00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.240 align:middle line:84%
And so the way I
characterize what

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:54.290 align:middle line:84%
I do is that the main arrow that
I care about that my bliss is

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:59.430 align:middle line:84%
is to help people to the
extent that they want--

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:02.750 align:middle line:84%
and many people don't
want this, and that's OK--

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:04.430 align:middle line:84%
to help people get
to a point where

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:08.060 align:middle line:84%
they are able to basically
ask the question of,

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:08.990 align:middle line:90%
what is my bliss?

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:11.870 align:middle line:84%
What is my meaning
and purpose in life?

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And then arrange
things in their life

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:17.310 align:middle line:84%
to be able to actually pursue
it and fulfill it, if they want.

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:18.110 align:middle line:90%
There is no should.

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:19.700 align:middle line:84%
If you don't want to do this,
you're not a bad person.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.050 align:middle line:90%
You're not wasting your life.

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:23.275 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe in any
of that finger-wagging.

00:13:23.275 --> 00:13:24.650 align:middle line:84%
But for the people
who want to do

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:31.400 align:middle line:84%
that, my job is to be
this kind of Mercury,

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:35.480 align:middle line:84%
kind of Hermes kind
of guide advisor

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:39.090 align:middle line:90%
to help them along that path.

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And what I've
discovered along the way

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:46.220 align:middle line:84%
is that when you hear
about bliss, it's like, oh,

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:50.330 align:middle line:84%
it's so wonderful, and rainbows
and unicorns on the one hand.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And on the other hand, you have
a whole school folks wagging

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.455 align:middle line:84%
the finger, well, if
you don't do this,

00:13:54.455 --> 00:13:55.510 align:middle line:90%
you're wasting your life.

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And I don't subscribe
to either of those.

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:02.030 align:middle line:84%
My view of bliss is
that to really get

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:07.220 align:middle line:84%
on the path of following your
bliss, it is a messy business.

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.530 align:middle line:90%
It is a messy business.

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:10.280 align:middle line:84%
Because when we're
brought into this world

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:15.080 align:middle line:84%
as it is and we're trained to
conform and put on a mask--

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.930 align:middle line:84%
women are typically told
to put on the mask that

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:21.635 align:middle line:84%
basically says "The Good
Girl" across the top, right?

00:14:21.635 --> 00:14:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And we could talk for
hours about all that.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And guys are basically
given this mask

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:29.030 align:middle line:84%
saying "The Strong Boy"
or "The Strong Man."

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:31.670 align:middle line:84%
Note that it's the "strong
man," not necessarily

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.770 align:middle line:90%
the good man, right?

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And if you realize
underneath the mask,

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.940 align:middle line:84%
your bliss takes you
in a direction which

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:45.320 align:middle line:84%
requires you to
take that mask off,

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:48.320 align:middle line:90%
you're in for a lot of trouble.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And the older you
are, the more time

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:56.420 align:middle line:84%
you have allowed to
elapse for your world

00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:01.730 align:middle line:84%
to accrete around you, presuming
that mask is the real you.

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.070 align:middle line:84%
When you start to take
that off, your entire world

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.170 align:middle line:90%
starts to wobble.

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, when
I sort of offer

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:20.480 align:middle line:84%
resources and tools for people
to do self-reflection and maybe

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.800 align:middle line:84%
try to self-heal some
things to the extent

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:29.270 align:middle line:84%
that they're comfortable,
the goal in my mind

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:36.860 align:middle line:84%
is always to see if you feel
ready and desirous of actually

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.030 align:middle line:90%
following your bliss.

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:43.730 align:middle line:84%
To me, the purpose of healing
is not the cessation of pain.

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:49.910 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of healing is
to recover your own fulsome

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:51.315 align:middle line:90%
wholeness.

00:15:51.315 --> 00:15:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's with that wholeness
that you're able to actually

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:56.180 align:middle line:84%
figure out, who
am I actually now

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:59.270 align:middle line:84%
that I've accounted
for everyone within me?

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And what do we
actually want to do?

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And what are the pitfalls
and risks and threats

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:08.900 align:middle line:84%
if we go down that path, and
do we actually want to do that?

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:11.770 align:middle line:84%
The answer may be
no, and that's OK.

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:14.000 align:middle line:84%
So that to me,
healing is a means

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.630 align:middle line:84%
to the end of getting you to
the point where you can actually

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:20.330 align:middle line:84%
even make consciously
the choice of go or no go

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:24.200 align:middle line:84%
on the full flowering
of why you're here.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Healing is not just
the cessation of pain.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:27.850 align:middle line:90%
A pill will do that, right?

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:33.590 align:middle line:84%
A couple of martinis
will do that temporarily.

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And so when people
come to me with things

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:40.460 align:middle line:84%
that they feel meditation
will help with,

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:42.620 align:middle line:84%
finding their bliss
will help with,

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:47.100 align:middle line:84%
recovering exiled parts of
themselves will help with,

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:47.900 align:middle line:90%
that's great.

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:51.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm a nerd, and I love
discussing all of that stuff.

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:55.310 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the
day, it is with this half

00:16:55.310 --> 00:17:06.650 align:middle line:84%
an eye to get you to willingly,
or in some cases accidentally,

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:11.420 align:middle line:84%
stumble across this glimmer
of a vision of like, oh, I

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:18.140 align:middle line:84%
think I'm actually here to do
something along this direction.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And once you have that
glimmer, it's hard to forget.

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:30.690 align:middle line:84%
That's what makes me
happy and excited.

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:31.490 align:middle line:90%
>> That's cool.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:34.860 align:middle line:90%


00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:35.660 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:38.687 align:middle line:84%
It helps describe, I guess, the
mission and the guiding force

00:17:38.687 --> 00:17:40.520 align:middle line:84%
behind what you do,
which you've discovered,

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.770 align:middle line:84%
which is to help really
people align with their place.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And this sort of meditation
to emotional trauma component

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:48.590 align:middle line:84%
is just a stepping
stone, in a way.

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:50.930 align:middle line:84%
So let's speak to
that a little bit.

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:55.130 align:middle line:84%
How typically do people
develop emotional wounds,

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:56.510 align:middle line:90%
as you call them?

00:17:56.510 --> 00:18:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And what sort of environments
might that happen in?

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Like, is it the environment
of the narcissistic father

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:05.600 align:middle line:84%
or the split
personality this or the

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:09.390 align:middle line:84%
bipolar this or in the language
that gets spoken to them?

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:12.770 align:middle line:84%
How do people develop these type
wounds, in your understanding?

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:14.525 align:middle line:90%
>> You know, it's interesting.

00:18:14.525 --> 00:18:17.060 align:middle line:90%


00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:19.070 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you kind of
this headline first,

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:21.330 align:middle line:84%
and then I want to
dive in a little bit.

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:25.280 align:middle line:84%
But the headline
for me is that I've

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.410 align:middle line:84%
worked with tens of thousands
of people at this point.

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And I don't consider myself
a professional or expert.

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:34.370 align:middle line:84%
I've just seen a
lot of patterns.

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And in my non-expert,
non-professional kind

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:44.580 align:middle line:84%
of feeling of the
things I've seen,

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:52.830 align:middle line:84%
my sense is that
everyone has a wound.

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's OK, and
that's actually normal.

00:18:56.670 --> 00:19:00.240 align:middle line:90%


00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:05.100 align:middle line:84%
It's not a-- it's hard
to find the right words,

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:08.310 align:middle line:84%
but it's not a tragedy
of epic proportions

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:13.180 align:middle line:84%
that everyone in humanity
ends up having a wound.

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:17.070 align:middle line:84%
It is tragic in the sense of
the severity of some people's

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:19.580 align:middle line:90%
wounds, right?

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:23.782 align:middle line:84%
You can't help but have
empathy for that and compassion

00:19:23.782 --> 00:19:24.990 align:middle line:90%
and feel that pain with them.

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:31.980 align:middle line:84%
But it's almost, to me at
this point with everything

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:35.160 align:middle line:84%
I've seen, a kind of universal
anatomical feature, if you

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.670 align:middle line:90%
will.

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is, in its own
way, a beautiful thing,

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:47.040 align:middle line:84%
because the wound is what
sets you up for bliss.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:51.330 align:middle line:84%
I think Joseph Campbell
used to quote someone else--

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:52.280 align:middle line:90%
and I don't remember.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:53.480 align:middle line:90%
I don't think I even know.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.910 align:middle line:84%
But the thing he used
to say over and over

00:19:56.910 --> 00:20:08.420 align:middle line:84%
is that your deepest wound is
the source of your greatest

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:11.360 align:middle line:90%
gift to the world.

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And so it's your wound that
basically throws the penny

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:22.350 align:middle line:84%
into the deep end
of the pool for you

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:25.040 align:middle line:84%
then to dive down in terms
of fulfilling and finding

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.810 align:middle line:90%
your bliss.

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:31.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how it turned
out to be like that,

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:33.990 align:middle line:84%
but that's the pattern
I see in everyone.

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:36.650 align:middle line:90%


00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And so to your question of
how do these wounds develop

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:42.350 align:middle line:84%
in general, I don't
think of it as like, oh,

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:45.353 align:middle line:84%
there's this part
of the population.

00:20:45.353 --> 00:20:46.770 align:middle line:84%
We know what's
going on with them,

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:48.650 align:middle line:90%
but everyone else is all right.

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:50.120 align:middle line:90%
For me, it's universal.

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And for me, the basic thumbnail
of how I have seen it happen

00:20:55.250 --> 00:21:00.010 align:middle line:84%
and I have heard it kind
of relayed thousands

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:05.030 align:middle line:84%
upon thousands of
times is this idea of,

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:07.670 align:middle line:84%
you're born into the
world as a child.

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:12.482 align:middle line:84%
As a child, you have no control
over your outer environment.

00:21:12.482 --> 00:21:13.940 align:middle line:84%
You don't get to
pick your parents.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.970 align:middle line:84%
You certainly don't get to
pick your siblings or any

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:18.530 align:middle line:90%
of that stuff, right?

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:20.600 align:middle line:84%
So you're born into
this environment.

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And pretty quickly, the
giants in your world--

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:33.170 align:middle line:84%
the adults-- look at you and
say, all right, little boy.

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:36.720 align:middle line:84%
Now we want you to put
this thing on, or else.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.480 align:middle line:90%
And they hand you this mask.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.030 align:middle line:90%


00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And the mask for boys
will say, you know,

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:46.520 align:middle line:90%
the strong silent type.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:48.980 align:middle line:84%
For women, it will be
the good girl typically,

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:51.710 align:middle line:90%
some form of the good girl.

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And you learn pretty
quickly that this mask comes

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:58.910 align:middle line:84%
with a set of expectations
around your behavior,

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:03.680 align:middle line:84%
around things you'll
say, around things you're

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:07.370 align:middle line:90%
allowed to think and not think.

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And the consequences for when
you take it off and speak your

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:16.520 align:middle line:84%
mind as a child, especially
in the wrong environment--

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:20.750 align:middle line:84%
touching things that you're
not supposed to touch,

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:22.670 align:middle line:84%
saying things, being
curious about things

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:25.662 align:middle line:84%
that you're not supposed
to be curious about.

00:22:25.662 --> 00:22:27.620 align:middle line:84%
What you realize as a
young person is that when

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:30.950 align:middle line:84%
you start to take that
mask off, justice is swift.

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:36.260 align:middle line:90%


00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:39.710 align:middle line:84%
The mask then comes with
its own penal code of like,

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:43.910 align:middle line:84%
if you take it off, here are
the escalating levels of voltage

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:45.680 align:middle line:84%
that will be applied
to you to get you

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:48.380 align:middle line:90%
to put the damn thing back on.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:50.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, for me there's nothing
wrong with this mask.

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:54.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we all need masks to
put on to get on with the world.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.510 align:middle line:90%
Society has to work.

00:22:56.510 --> 00:23:04.500 align:middle line:84%
It's just a natural part of
getting on as a social species.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:06.980 align:middle line:84%
But the issue that
often happens is

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:11.820 align:middle line:84%
that because you're being
asked to put this mask on--

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:14.450 align:middle line:84%
if you're my child, I may
enforce it pretty strictly, but

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:16.340 align:middle line:90%
because I want to protect you.

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:18.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't want you to get
beaten up in the schoolyard

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:19.100 align:middle line:90%
after school.

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't want you
to be ostracized.

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:23.602 align:middle line:84%
I want you to have prestige
and money and all the things

00:23:23.602 --> 00:23:24.560 align:middle line:90%
you want in this world.

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And that requires the
participation and cooperation

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.460 align:middle line:84%
and even adulation
of people around you,

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:34.760 align:middle line:84%
and you need to put a certain
kind of mask on for that.

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:40.910 align:middle line:84%
But where the wound comes
in then is where as a kid

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:45.890 align:middle line:90%
you're like, holy crap.

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:52.380 align:middle line:84%
Every time I take this thing
off, I get cattle prodded hard.

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:56.090 align:middle line:84%
So it must mean that they
want me to put this on.

00:23:56.090 --> 00:24:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And as a child, if nobody pulls
you aside to explain all this--

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.360 align:middle line:90%
kids are not stupid.

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:07.160 align:middle line:84%
They can connect the
dots and do the math.

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And for most kids
who are thinking

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:14.330 align:middle line:84%
about it, which is pretty much
all kids, they will conclude--

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:16.730 align:middle line:90%
and not unreasonably so--

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:22.610 align:middle line:84%
that if I take this mask
off, I will lose love.

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:24.590 align:middle line:90%
I will not be worthy of love.

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:26.330 align:middle line:90%
I will not be a good person.

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And the message for many people
is, you won't deserve love--

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:34.030 align:middle line:84%
which means, don't expect
love from anyone around you.

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:37.760 align:middle line:84%
But also, if you intrinsically
don't deserve love,

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.000 align:middle line:84%
you shouldn't even
love yourself.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.840 align:middle line:84%
You within you shouldn't
even love yourself.

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.890 align:middle line:90%
And that's poisonous.

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, unbeknownst to the
little six-year-old,

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:53.440 align:middle line:84%
the parents around
them could be perfectly

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.940 align:middle line:84%
willing to die for them, take
a bullet for them or whatever.

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:58.488 align:middle line:84%
But you don't know that as a
kid, because you've never held

00:24:58.488 --> 00:25:00.780 align:middle line:84%
your own little newborn in
your arms where you're like,

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:04.780 align:middle line:84%
oh my gosh, I would die for
this little peanut, right?

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:06.730 align:middle line:84%
So for you as a kid
you're like, well,

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:08.685 align:middle line:90%
it feels like I'm losing love.

00:25:08.685 --> 00:25:10.060 align:middle line:84%
When I don't get
to have dessert,

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:12.790 align:middle line:84%
when I get sent to my room,
when I get physically punished,

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:15.175 align:middle line:90%
it feels like I'm not loved.

00:25:15.175 --> 00:25:18.280 align:middle line:90%


00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.500 align:middle line:90%
Of course it feels like that.

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:24.520 align:middle line:84%
So in the absence of an elder
pulling them aside to say,

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.900 align:middle line:84%
look, you are loved
without condition.

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.170 align:middle line:84%
You are loved without
condition, period.

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:32.230 align:middle line:84%
Any of us here would
die for you, period.

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And if we wouldn't,
or if you think

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:36.560 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't, or if we actually
wouldn't, that's on us.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:37.360 align:middle line:90%
That's not on you.

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:38.920 align:middle line:90%
That's a wound that we have.

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:40.930 align:middle line:90%
It's a defect that we carry.

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:43.660 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to do with
your intrinsic loveability.

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Your love without
condition, period.

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:50.300 align:middle line:90%
Now, with that aside--

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:51.830 align:middle line:90%
love's not on the table--

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:54.310 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about how
we keep your mask on.

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:58.900 align:middle line:84%
Because I want you to have
all the things you want.

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:00.890 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about how to--

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:03.790 align:middle line:84%
and at that point,
you're their advisor,

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:09.650 align:middle line:84%
helping them, in their pit crew
while they're driving the race

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:13.090 align:middle line:84%
car, helping them win the
race that they choose to run.

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:16.270 align:middle line:90%


00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:20.680 align:middle line:84%
But for most people, they
don't pull their kids aside

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.320 align:middle line:84%
to explain that, because it
was never explained to them.

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.630 align:middle line:84%
They're still running
for their lives thinking,

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:28.540 align:middle line:84%
I need to make my
revenue this quarter

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:32.026 align:middle line:84%
or I will not deserve love,
even from my own self.

00:26:32.026 --> 00:26:35.520 align:middle line:90%
And that's a great motivator.

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:36.520 align:middle line:90%
It's great for earnings.

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.020 align:middle line:84%
It's great for
your bank account.

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:41.850 align:middle line:90%
It's great for a lot of things.

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that I am
against any economic growth

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:47.350 align:middle line:90%
and thriving or whatever.

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:49.105 align:middle line:84%
But it's just a
question of the cost.

00:26:49.105 --> 00:26:51.700 align:middle line:90%


00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:56.390 align:middle line:84%
To have that sort of
fear hanging over you

00:26:56.390 --> 00:27:00.610 align:middle line:84%
and have that be the reason you
are so productive in your life,

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:04.450 align:middle line:90%
that to me is too high a cost.

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's not even an issue
of the practical cost.

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:11.670 align:middle line:84%
It's the fact that it
isn't actually true.

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:16.840 align:middle line:84%
No matter how bad your dad was,
how harsh he was, at the end

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:20.980 align:middle line:84%
of the day he would
give his life for you.

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And every now and then I'll
come across someone who says,

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.240 align:middle line:90%
no, that's not true.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.407 align:middle line:90%
That's just not true.

00:27:27.407 --> 00:27:28.990 align:middle line:84%
Actually, there was
an actual incident

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:31.330 align:middle line:84%
where my dad said,
take him and not me.

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:33.970 align:middle line:90%
I've heard everything.

00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And even in that
case I'm like, well,

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:38.140 align:middle line:84%
it still doesn't impinge on
your inherent loveability.

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:40.990 align:middle line:90%


00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:44.640 align:middle line:84%
Because if a parent doesn't look
after their kid in that way,

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:47.950 align:middle line:90%
the parent is wounded.

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And I've never heard anyone say
their parent didn't love them

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:55.480 align:middle line:84%
and then when I ask them, well,
do you think they were wounded,

00:27:55.480 --> 00:28:00.430 align:middle line:84%
100% of the time they're like,
oh, yeah, let me tell you.

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:07.282 align:middle line:84%
No normal healthy person
isn't willing at a snap

00:28:07.282 --> 00:28:08.740 align:middle line:84%
to give their life
for their child.

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:10.840 align:middle line:90%


00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:13.990 align:middle line:90%
Whales will do that.

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:15.250 align:middle line:90%
Mother bears will do that.

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:16.708 align:middle line:84%
You don't even have
to be a mammal.

00:28:16.708 --> 00:28:18.698 align:middle line:90%
Chickens will do that.

00:28:18.698 --> 00:28:19.990 align:middle line:90%
And so humans are no different.

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:22.633 align:middle line:84%
We're wired for protection
of our offspring.

00:28:22.633 --> 00:28:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And to the extent that
that fails in practice,

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:28.030 align:middle line:90%
it's simply because of a wound.

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:32.710 align:middle line:84%
But very rare is the
child where someone pulls

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:35.410 align:middle line:84%
them aside to kind of chalk
talk all this through, to say,

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:38.690 align:middle line:84%
OK, there's nothing
wrong with you.

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:40.600 align:middle line:90%
You're actually awesome.

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.820 align:middle line:84%
And despite all this,
there's a little bit

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:44.500 align:middle line:84%
of navigating we
need to get you out

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:47.800 align:middle line:84%
of the minefield to go on and
find and follow your bliss.

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:51.880 align:middle line:84%
Because when you do
that, the importance--

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:53.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as a tech
person, the scalability

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:57.730 align:middle line:84%
of helping people find
and follow their bliss

00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:05.110 align:middle line:84%
is powerful, because when a
person is following their bliss

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:07.990 align:middle line:84%
there's kind of two
orders of benefit.

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:12.700 align:middle line:84%
The first order is, when you
find and follow your bliss,

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:16.950 align:middle line:84%
it is the things you love
to do for no good reason,

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:20.980 align:middle line:84%
that you would pay to do if you
had to and you had the means--

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:25.780 align:middle line:84%
which also, as a byproduct,
as a sort of happy accident,

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:29.450 align:middle line:90%
creates value for other people.

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:32.200 align:middle line:84%
So there's all these things
you love to do, some of which

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.520 align:middle line:90%
create value for people.

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And then at the
bottom is what I call

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:38.990 align:middle line:84%
a bliss target, or
an empathy target,

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:42.040 align:middle line:84%
which is a
constituency of people

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:47.770 align:middle line:84%
that you have just
disproportionate empathy for.

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:50.980 align:middle line:84%
You will drop everything to
help this stranger, friend

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:54.190 align:middle line:84%
of a friend of a friend,
build their backyard

00:29:54.190 --> 00:30:01.960 align:middle line:84%
deck for barbecuing, if that
happens to be your bliss.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.420 align:middle line:84%
You have those three
things together

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:08.110 align:middle line:84%
and you've got a
complete bliss circuit.

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And so when you find
and follow your bliss,

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:17.410 align:middle line:84%
the first order of benefit
is your empathy target.

00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:20.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they are benefiting
all the live long day

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:23.530 align:middle line:84%
from you just doing the
thing you love selfishly.

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:25.510 align:middle line:84%
But then the
second-order benefit

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:30.040 align:middle line:84%
is that you become a signpost
to other people around you.

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.905 align:middle line:84%
When you're finding and
following your bliss, you are--

00:30:32.905 --> 00:30:34.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we talk about
soothing and shielding.

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:38.200 align:middle line:84%
Following your bliss is
the ultimate soothing,

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:41.890 align:middle line:84%
because it feels good
minute to minute.

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's also the
ultimate shielding,

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:46.690 align:middle line:84%
because you have this
goofy smile on your face

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:48.340 align:middle line:84%
the whole time, and
you really don't

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:49.660 align:middle line:90%
care what other people think.

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:51.327 align:middle line:84%
I mean, someone taps
you on the shoulder

00:30:51.327 --> 00:30:55.780 align:middle line:84%
and asks you who your mother
is, and you don't know,

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:59.620 align:middle line:84%
because you're so in the
flow of what you're doing.

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And people can smell
that a mile away.

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:07.990 align:middle line:90%


00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:11.030 align:middle line:84%
You can feel it when you're
sitting in the room with them.

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And so that is to me
an even more powerful--

00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:14.770 align:middle line:90%
because it's more generalized.

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:16.728 align:middle line:84%
When you're following
your bliss, your own sort

00:31:16.728 --> 00:31:19.150 align:middle line:84%
of nerdy empathy
target benefits,

00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:20.830 align:middle line:84%
you become a
signpost for everyone

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:23.920 align:middle line:84%
around you, because
people look at you when

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.510 align:middle line:90%
you're following your bliss.

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, the reaction is,
first of all, they're inspired.

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:31.520 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh my gosh,
she's so amazing.

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:35.110 align:middle line:84%
But then hopefully, their next
reaction is like, and I mean,

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:36.460 align:middle line:90%
what's so special about him?

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:39.220 align:middle line:84%
If he could do it,
I must have a shot.

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.590 align:middle line:90%
I must have shot.

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:middle line:84%
In an ideal world, we
reach a tipping point

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:46.180 align:middle line:84%
where enough people
are doing it where

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:49.270 align:middle line:84%
there's a critical
mass, where it becomes

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:50.620 align:middle line:90%
more of this normal thing.

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:54.730 align:middle line:90%


00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And there is this constant
tug of war between the two

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:01.210 align:middle line:90%
forces of bliss--

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:06.570 align:middle line:84%
doing the thing you do out
of love, not fear, and fear,

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:09.820 align:middle line:84%
doing the thing you do
out of just abject fear,

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:14.060 align:middle line:84%
fear of being
poor, being shamed.

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:18.010 align:middle line:84%
But basically, it all boils
down to fear of loss of love,

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:19.970 align:middle line:90%
fear of, again, that mask.

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:22.702 align:middle line:84%
You keep the mask
on out of fear.

00:32:22.702 --> 00:32:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
the problem comes,

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:28.600 align:middle line:84%
because you're keeping it
on, in my opinion, based

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:35.350 align:middle line:84%
on a false pretense, which is
that your love is conditional.

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:38.930 align:middle line:90%
And that's just false.

00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>> You're really decoupling
a lot of the activity

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.120 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.453 align:middle line:84%
Like you said, it's productive
for people to be fearful,

00:32:45.453 --> 00:32:46.390 align:middle line:90%
in a way.

00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:47.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>> If they're out
there being successful

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.988 align:middle line:84%
because they're trying to make
up for a lack of self-love

00:32:52.988 --> 00:32:55.030 align:middle line:84%
in their own household
when they were growing up,

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:56.280 align:middle line:90%
that's great for shareholders.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.910 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:32:57.910 --> 00:32:58.840 align:middle line:90%
>> In the short-term.

00:32:58.840 --> 00:32:59.725 align:middle line:90%
>> In the short-term.

00:32:59.725 --> 00:33:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's horrible for
that guy's midlife crisis,

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.120 align:middle line:84%
because he's going
to hit this wall

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.480 align:middle line:84%
and go, oh my god,
I'm not loved.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:05.080 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:06.010 align:middle line:90%
Or just break down.

00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:09.023 align:middle line:84%
Or just tough it out long
enough until he dies, right?

00:33:09.023 --> 00:33:10.690 align:middle line:84%
Or until the brain
start shutting down--

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:14.170 align:middle line:84%
which is dementia, there's
even some studies now showing

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:16.780 align:middle line:84%
it's just because their body
is just like, I can't handle--

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:19.750 align:middle line:84%
I can't reconcile this anymore,
this heart-head situation,

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:22.110 align:middle line:90%
so I'm just going to atrophy.

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:23.170 align:middle line:90%
Too deep.

00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:24.810 align:middle line:90%
Let's pull it back a second.

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:28.120 align:middle line:84%
Four types of emotional trauma
that you sort of identified,

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:30.490 align:middle line:84%
because I like how you
bring an analysis to this.

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:33.342 align:middle line:84%
You're like, we can chunk
emotional trauma down

00:33:33.342 --> 00:33:34.300 align:middle line:90%
into these four things.

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:35.160 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to speak to that.

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.540 align:middle line:84%
How do you sort of categorize
these emotional traumas?

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Because I think people will
connect with one of those four.

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:41.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:50.140 align:middle line:84%
So I think in terms of just a
self-negative inner voice and I

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:52.690 align:middle line:84%
think less in terms
of trauma per se,

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:54.970 align:middle line:90%
because to me that's more of a--

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:56.440 align:middle line:90%
it may be that.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:58.330 align:middle line:84%
But that's more of
kind of a medical term.

00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:01.350 align:middle line:90%


00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:03.350 align:middle line:84%
People mean different
things when they say that.

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:05.200 align:middle line:84%
So for me, there's
this voice that's

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:08.929 align:middle line:84%
just giving you a hard
time, like, all the time.

00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:12.130 align:middle line:90%


00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:17.969 align:middle line:84%
So it's more of a commonsensical
kind of level of it.

00:34:17.969 --> 00:34:22.989 align:middle line:84%
And for me when I
talk about this,

00:34:22.989 --> 00:34:28.030 align:middle line:84%
when the voice comes at you and
starts doing this blistering,

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:31.542 align:middle line:84%
multipronged attack, it's
like the splits in chess,

00:34:31.542 --> 00:34:33.250 align:middle line:84%
where it's like the
bishop is hitting you

00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:36.370 align:middle line:84%
and the queen's coming around
behind you, and just everything

00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:39.520 align:middle line:90%
all at once from all directions.

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:42.489 align:middle line:84%
If you break it down, the
self-negative inner critic

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:47.000 align:middle line:84%
force will typically come
at you across four channels.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And the four are
competence, body, identity,

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:52.380 align:middle line:84%
and relationship is
how I think about them.

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:58.360 align:middle line:84%
Competence is the idea that you
should be better at something

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.090 align:middle line:90%
than you actually are.

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:01.840 align:middle line:84%
So it could be your
grades, how much money

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:08.810 align:middle line:84%
you make, prestige, popularity,
sociability, cooking, skill

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:09.610 align:middle line:90%
as a lover--

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:11.170 align:middle line:90%
any of these things.

00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:15.100 align:middle line:84%
But generally, it's something
that has to do with competence.

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:17.830 align:middle line:90%
You have some power over it.

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:18.700 align:middle line:90%
It is a skill.

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:21.250 align:middle line:84%
It is something you can
work on, theoretically.

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:22.750 align:middle line:90%
So that's the first one.

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:26.020 align:middle line:84%
The second one is body, which
is this feeling that there's

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:29.710 align:middle line:84%
something intrinsically wrong
with your body-- that you're

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:34.390 align:middle line:84%
either too fat or too thin,
too tall or too short,

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:37.570 align:middle line:84%
the wrong body shape, the wrong
body color, a feature is too

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:38.740 align:middle line:90%
big, your nose or your ears.

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:42.232 align:middle line:84%
It could be you're too
hairy or not hairy enough.

00:35:42.232 --> 00:35:43.190 align:middle line:90%
So any of these things.

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:44.940 align:middle line:84%
But basically, this
idea that there's just

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:47.320 align:middle line:84%
something wrong with
my body that, again,

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:50.920 align:middle line:90%
makes me not worthy of love.

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:53.410 align:middle line:84%
The third is identity,
which is the idea there's

00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:56.380 align:middle line:84%
something intrinsically wrong
with basically something

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:59.830 align:middle line:84%
about you as a person that
you're basically not going

00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:00.940 align:middle line:90%
to change.

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:02.330 align:middle line:90%
So it could be your gender.

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:05.320 align:middle line:90%
It could be your ethnicity.

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:08.290 align:middle line:84%
It could be your
religious affiliation.

00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:09.970 align:middle line:84%
It could even be
your personality,

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:12.190 align:middle line:84%
where it's like,
I'm intrinsically

00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:14.890 align:middle line:90%
kind of an introvert.

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:17.080 align:middle line:84%
But I'm a sales guy
or an executive,

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:21.810 align:middle line:84%
so I'm expected to play golf
and do all these things.

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:23.650 align:middle line:84%
So I do them
begrudgingly, but I feel

00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:24.700 align:middle line:84%
like there's something
wrong with me

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:26.325 align:middle line:84%
because I actually
like sitting at home

00:36:26.325 --> 00:36:27.400 align:middle line:90%
and just reading a book.

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:30.040 align:middle line:90%


00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:32.470 align:middle line:84%
The fourth is a little
bit in its own category,

00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:35.190 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I
call relationship.

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
idea that you have

00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:44.770 align:middle line:84%
this core belief in your
mind that I will only

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:50.130 align:middle line:90%
be worthy of love if blank.

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:53.920 align:middle line:84%
I will only be lovable and
worthy of love if blank.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.555 align:middle line:84%
And this blank
conflates beautifully

00:36:56.555 --> 00:36:57.430 align:middle line:90%
with the first three.

00:36:57.430 --> 00:37:00.070 align:middle line:84%
I will only be lovable if I'm
competent-- if I make money,

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:02.710 align:middle line:84%
if I'm rich, if I'm smart,
if I get good grades, if I

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:06.340 align:middle line:84%
score a lot of goals on the
athletic field, if I'm popular.

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:09.100 align:middle line:84%
Or body-- I'll only be
lovable if I'm tall,

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:12.370 align:middle line:84%
if I'm hot, if I'm skinny, if
I've got a full head of hair--

00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:14.470 align:middle line:90%
all these things, right?

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:19.270 align:middle line:84%
Identity-- I'll only be lovable
if I'm not the gender I am,

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:22.040 align:middle line:84%
because boys are more
valuable than girls.

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Siblings talk about
this all the time.

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:26.950 align:middle line:84%
If I'm a different
ethnicity, if I'm

00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:30.620 align:middle line:84%
a different religion, if I'm
a different personality type.

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And so the poison
of this last one--

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:37.330 align:middle line:84%
I will only be
lovable if black--

00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:39.970 align:middle line:84%
is not from what you
put in the blank.

00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:41.650 align:middle line:90%
That's irrelevant.

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:45.000 align:middle line:84%
So for instance,
even if I said, I

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.840 align:middle line:84%
will only be lovable if I
find the cure for cancer,

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:53.658 align:middle line:84%
solve global warming, and save
7 billion people on the planet--

00:37:53.658 --> 00:37:55.950 align:middle line:84%
even if that's what's in the
blank-- because it's like,

00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:57.060 align:middle line:90%
who wouldn't want that?

00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:57.860 align:middle line:90%
Please.

00:37:57.860 --> 00:37:58.690 align:middle line:90%
Please do that.

00:37:58.690 --> 00:37:59.490 align:middle line:90%
Whip you.

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:01.110 align:middle line:90%
Whip you harder.

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:03.900 align:middle line:84%
Even that's poison,
because the poison is not

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:05.730 align:middle line:90%
what you put in the blank.

00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:09.085 align:middle line:90%
The poison is in the "if."

00:38:09.085 --> 00:38:14.100 align:middle line:84%
The "if" is what implies that
before you've done anything--

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:17.160 align:middle line:84%
competence, identity,
anything-- that you as you

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:19.833 align:middle line:84%
are, before we've
turned over any cards

00:38:19.833 --> 00:38:21.750 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what you're
actually going to do

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:24.030 align:middle line:84%
or even what you
want to do, that you

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:28.440 align:middle line:84%
as you are with no additional
bells and whistles, you

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:32.760 align:middle line:84%
as you are are intrinsically
unworthy of love.

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:34.060 align:middle line:90%
And that's bullshit.

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:34.860 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:38.670 align:middle line:90%


00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:43.200 align:middle line:84%
The trick is when,
as a parent yourself,

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:45.930 align:middle line:84%
you know this is
true when you hold

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:50.910 align:middle line:84%
your baby on the day he is born
and you realize, oh my gosh.

00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:53.880 align:middle line:84%
I would give my life for
this slimy little peanut

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.860 align:middle line:90%
that just pooped on me.

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:59.310 align:middle line:84%
I would do anything
for this little peanut.

00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:02.580 align:middle line:90%
And there is no conditionality.

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:05.970 align:middle line:84%
You don't know anything
about this little guy.

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:08.667 align:middle line:84%
And no father or
parent, hopefully,

00:39:08.667 --> 00:39:10.500 align:middle line:84%
says, well, I don't
know if I like this guy.

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if he gets into
Harvard, and then we'll see.

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:15.840 align:middle line:90%
Nobody says that, hopefully.

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:17.740 align:middle line:84%
But if they do,
you know one thing.

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:19.600 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing wrong
with the kid, right?

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.058 align:middle line:84%
There's a deep
wound in the parent.

00:39:21.058 --> 00:39:23.670 align:middle line:90%


00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And so the only reason that
changes as the kid grows up

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:30.600 align:middle line:84%
is because we have to get
them to put on a mask.

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And then the colossal
misunderstanding

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:36.270 align:middle line:84%
of, no, no, no, no, no, your
love is not conditional.

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:38.160 align:middle line:84%
You've got to put on--
we all wear a mask.

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:39.510 align:middle line:90%
Look at stupid Uncle Bob.

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:40.590 align:middle line:90%
He wears his mask too.

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:41.880 align:middle line:90%
Not very well, but.

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.680 align:middle line:90%
You know, all these things.

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:47.640 align:middle line:84%
But love is not on
the table, right?

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:50.440 align:middle line:90%
You don't earn your love.

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:54.490 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing additional you
need to do to earn your love.

00:39:54.490 --> 00:40:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And so what then
happens is that we all--

00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:05.820 align:middle line:84%
so typically when
I give this talk,

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:07.980 align:middle line:90%
after I describe the four--

00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:10.860 align:middle line:84%
competence, body, identity,
and relationship--

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:14.327 align:middle line:84%
I see in the audience the blood
draining from everyone's faces,

00:40:14.327 --> 00:40:16.410 align:middle line:84%
because they're thinking,
oh my gosh, I'm screwed.

00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:18.270 align:middle line:90%
I have all four.

00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And at that point I always
remember to say, OK, hang on.

00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:23.370 align:middle line:90%
Everyone has all four.

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:26.760 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has all four, so
there's nothing wrong with you.

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And the trick is that
the four elements

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:35.680 align:middle line:84%
are blended into a unique
smoothie for each person.

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:38.850 align:middle line:84%
So we all have all
four, but the mix

00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:43.200 align:middle line:84%
of competence, body, identity,
and relationship is different,

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:46.790 align:middle line:84%
and the flavor of
each one is different.

00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:49.405 align:middle line:90%
So your competence wound--

00:40:49.405 --> 00:40:51.030 align:middle line:84%
so first of all, as
men, typically it's

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:54.030 align:middle line:84%
like 80% competence and
everything else is fine.

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:56.550 align:middle line:90%


00:40:56.550 --> 00:41:01.740 align:middle line:84%
But your flavor of competence
may be artistic achievement.

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:03.810 align:middle line:84%
Or somebody else's
flavor competence

00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:05.490 align:middle line:90%
may be just brute force money.

00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:08.070 align:middle line:90%


00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:10.620 align:middle line:84%
That's just the topography
of different people's sort

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:12.930 align:middle line:90%
of makeup.

00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:15.930 align:middle line:84%
But what will happen is
that each person will

00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:21.132 align:middle line:84%
have the same four components,
but the proportions

00:41:21.132 --> 00:41:23.340 align:middle line:84%
will be different, and the
flavors will be different.

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:26.700 align:middle line:84%
So when I sip my smoothie
and I look at everyone else's

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:31.560 align:middle line:84%
smoothie, I feel like
I'm the only dumb bunny

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:35.250 align:middle line:84%
idiot in the room with this
particular inner voice.

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:38.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm the only one, which
makes me feel even more

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:40.017 align:middle line:90%
stupid, because nobody--

00:41:40.017 --> 00:41:41.100 align:middle line:90%
I mean, look at Instagram.

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:43.200 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's having a
great time, right?

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:48.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm the only dumb bunny
who didn't get the memo,

00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:51.690 align:middle line:84%
and I'm the only one
who says this to myself.

00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, in
a manner of speaking

00:41:54.210 --> 00:42:00.160 align:middle line:84%
that's true, because each
person's fingerprint is unique.

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:03.510 align:middle line:84%
But what that
doesn't account for

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:05.760 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that actually,
everyone has a fingerprint.

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:08.610 align:middle line:90%
Everyone does have a smoothie.

00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:10.860 align:middle line:84%
My smoothie doesn't look
like yours, so I don't stress

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:12.318 align:middle line:84%
and obsess about
the things you do.

00:42:12.318 --> 00:42:13.950 align:middle line:84%
I stress about other
stuff that I then

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:17.610 align:middle line:84%
hide, because I have to
put it behind my mask.

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the
things I didn't realize

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:24.720 align:middle line:84%
what happened that's been a
wonderful sort of byproduct

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:29.400 align:middle line:84%
is that even when people just
hear about the four wounds,

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:32.640 align:middle line:84%
they breathe this
huge sigh of relief.

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:34.440 align:middle line:84%
Because it's like
saying, yes, yes, yes,

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:37.810 align:middle line:84%
your elbow does hurt
in its own unique way.

00:42:37.810 --> 00:42:42.628 align:middle line:90%
But everyone has an elbow.

00:42:42.628 --> 00:42:43.920 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing wrong with you.

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:45.680 align:middle line:90%
We'll just get it looked at.

00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:48.990 align:middle line:84%
We'll attend to
it, and it's fine.

00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And people sort of breathe
this sigh of relief where they

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:53.910 align:middle line:84%
realize, even though
my thing feels unique--

00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:57.020 align:middle line:90%
and at a certain level it is--

00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:00.690 align:middle line:84%
the phenomenon is
common to everyone.

00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:03.930 align:middle line:84%
So that instead of feeling
alienated and angry

00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:06.810 align:middle line:84%
and potentially acting out from
that, with this perspective

00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:09.690 align:middle line:84%
you're like, first of
all, there's a reason

00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:10.900 align:middle line:90%
you feel like that.

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is actually
related to the fact

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:13.877 align:middle line:90%
that we all have that.

00:43:13.877 --> 00:43:17.310 align:middle line:84%
So we bring you back in
with this perspective

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:21.210 align:middle line:84%
that makes you feel truthfully
that what you're feeling,

00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:24.360 align:middle line:84%
however painful it
is, is what you share

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:28.670 align:middle line:84%
with the collective sort of mass
of everyone else in humanity,

00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:32.660 align:middle line:84%
where you get back to this
feeling of like, yeah,

00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:34.240 align:middle line:90%
yeah, that's cool.

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:35.040 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's awful.

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:35.840 align:middle line:90%
It's painful.

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:37.660 align:middle line:84%
But it's like, it's
totally normal.

00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:38.460 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:40.280 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's got it.

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.640 align:middle line:90%
It won't seem like it.

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.640 align:middle line:90%
It will seem like you're alone.

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:46.850 align:middle line:90%
And that's normal too.

00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:50.223 align:middle line:84%
So tell me more about
what's going on.

00:43:50.223 --> 00:43:51.390 align:middle line:90%
Let's just get it looked at.

00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:53.980 align:middle line:90%


00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:56.050 align:middle line:84%
>> It is interesting to
come to that realization.

00:43:56.050 --> 00:43:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And I think for a lot of people,
starting to identify that they

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:02.950 align:middle line:84%
may have, let's say, this
idea of an emotional wound--

00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:06.460 align:middle line:84%
or really, what it is that
you speak to is a lack

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:09.070 align:middle line:84%
of self-worth at some level,
like a negative self-voice

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:12.565 align:middle line:84%
or a lack of self-worth, or I'll
only be loved when, et cetera--

00:44:12.565 --> 00:44:14.650 align:middle line:84%
which I think a lot of
people can relate to.

00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:18.670 align:middle line:84%
However, they might only
realize after something happens,

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:21.670 align:middle line:84%
like a trauma or a mid-life or
something that wakes them up--

00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:23.740 align:middle line:84%
or they have something
transformative happen,

00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:24.700 align:middle line:90%
like a child comes in.

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:26.117 align:middle line:84%
They're like, why
am I doing this?

00:44:26.117 --> 00:44:27.010 align:middle line:90%
Why am I doing this?

00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:28.670 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And when you identify and talk
to these ideas of shielding

00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:35.830 align:middle line:84%
and soothing, I think
that's where people

00:44:35.830 --> 00:44:38.630 align:middle line:84%
can start to put themselves
into the picture of like,

00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:39.430 align:middle line:90%
no, I'm fine.

00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:39.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm fine.

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And then you explain
the shielding technique.

00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:43.950 align:middle line:84%
You're like, well, why am I
trying to be so successful?

00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:46.300 align:middle line:84%
Oh, to get my father's love,
because he's an accountant

00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:48.717 align:middle line:84%
and it's only if you've got a
big bank balance that you're

00:44:48.717 --> 00:44:49.870 align:middle line:90%
truly loved.

00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And so you start
to become aware,

00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:55.090 align:middle line:84%
I think, through these concepts
of shielding and soothing

00:44:55.090 --> 00:44:57.480 align:middle line:84%
that you talk to, because
it's like, well, I

00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:59.230 align:middle line:84%
drink a lot when I've
got emotional issues

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:00.313 align:middle line:90%
with my significant other.

00:45:00.313 --> 00:45:02.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe I've got
relationship issues to myself

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:03.580 align:middle line:90%
or my parents did that.

00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:06.470 align:middle line:84%
So these ideas of
shielding and soothing,

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:10.240 align:middle line:84%
can you explain them out a
little bit in that it might

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:12.970 align:middle line:84%
help people connect with what
their core wound might be,

00:45:12.970 --> 00:45:15.280 align:middle line:84%
or the specific flavor
of their smoothie?

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:16.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:19.380 align:middle line:84%
So when you have one
of these smoothies,

00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:21.880 align:middle line:84%
you're sipping it all day long
whether you like to or not.

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:23.770 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the voice is in you.

00:45:23.770 --> 00:45:26.800 align:middle line:84%
You see somebody
drive a nice car by

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:30.940 align:middle line:84%
and you're like, oh my
gosh, I feel like an idiot.

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:33.490 align:middle line:84%
Or you're a mom taking
your kids to school,

00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:37.870 align:middle line:84%
and this other mom brings her
kids and her daughter's hair,

00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:41.380 align:middle line:84%
the hair for her daughters are
all brushed and perfectly fine.

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And you feel like
your daughter's hair

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:46.240 align:middle line:84%
is like a rat's nest,
and the inner voice just

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:48.250 align:middle line:90%
starts to eat you alive.

00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And so when you have
this smoothie, it hurts.

00:45:57.580 --> 00:46:00.240 align:middle line:84%
When you say these things
to yourself constantly

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:03.040 align:middle line:84%
with the upshot,
the sort of so-what,

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:05.020 align:middle line:84%
being, and you're
not worthy of love.

00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:06.490 align:middle line:90%
You're less lovable.

00:46:06.490 --> 00:46:07.340 align:middle line:90%
It hurts.

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And because it
hurts, it's a wound.

00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, when
you have a wound,

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:16.180 align:middle line:84%
there's two very
natural things you do.

00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:21.080 align:middle line:84%
If I'm a, you know, like
Roman gladiator in the arena,

00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:24.820 align:middle line:84%
and we're fighting and
you cut my chest a little,

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:26.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do two things.

00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:29.740 align:middle line:84%
The first thing I'm going to
do is I'm going to shield.

00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:32.200 align:middle line:90%
Don't hit me again.

00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:33.880 align:middle line:90%
It's perfectly reasonable.

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:36.010 align:middle line:84%
If you didn't do
that, I would worry.

00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:37.990 align:middle line:90%
So I expect you to shield.

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing is that
behind the safety of my shield,

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:45.880 align:middle line:84%
I will try to grab lidocaine
or something, some spray

00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:50.410 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, to make the
pain less so I will soothe.

00:46:50.410 --> 00:46:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's perfectly
reasonable too.

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:54.280 align:middle line:84%
It's not just
humans that do this.

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:55.340 align:middle line:90%
Earthworms do this.

00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:56.140 align:middle line:90%
Chickens do it.

00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:59.910 align:middle line:84%
If I poke an earthworm, it will
start to move away from me.

00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:01.600 align:middle line:84%
So there's nothing
wrong with a person

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:04.840 align:middle line:84%
when they soothe or
shield, just like there's

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:07.530 align:middle line:84%
nothing wrong with a person
when they have this four

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:10.810 align:middle line:84%
wound, because they were
told to put on a mask.

00:47:10.810 --> 00:47:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
wrong with that.

00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:13.935 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing wrong
with any of this.

00:47:13.935 --> 00:47:16.630 align:middle line:84%
It's just when it
happens in a certain way,

00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:19.960 align:middle line:84%
it causes more pain
than it requires.

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:24.550 align:middle line:84%
So if you saw a person
soothe and shield,

00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:27.850 align:middle line:84%
my reaction is like
perfectly normal.

00:47:27.850 --> 00:47:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Nothing wrong with I'm
not doing anything wrong.

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:34.300 align:middle line:84%
If you zoom in on
shielding, there

00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:36.940 align:middle line:90%
are a couple of usual suspects.

00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:39.400 align:middle line:90%
The first is money and prestige.

00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:43.272 align:middle line:84%
You can't argue with
success, especially here

00:47:43.272 --> 00:47:44.480 align:middle line:90%
in the Silicon Valley, right?

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:48.010 align:middle line:84%
If I IPO'ed my company
for half a billion dollars

00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:53.800 align:middle line:84%
and now I've got a checkbook
funding all these nonprofits,

00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:55.480 align:middle line:84%
no one is going
to poke my wound.

00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:58.020 align:middle line:90%


00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:02.120 align:middle line:84%
It's this auto drone
century mode shield,

00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:04.090 align:middle line:84%
and no one is going to
poke my wound, as long

00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:06.880 align:middle line:84%
as I know everyone in
the room knows who I am

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.610 align:middle line:84%
and what I've done-- which
is why people with prestige

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:12.850 align:middle line:84%
and money will often
make sure you know that,

00:48:12.850 --> 00:48:15.560 align:middle line:84%
because they're just making
sure that the shield is up.

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:16.810 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, there's
nothing wrong with this.

00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:20.980 align:middle line:90%
So money and prestige is one.

00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:26.710 align:middle line:84%
Perfectionism is another, where
if I'm perfect in every way--

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:32.800 align:middle line:84%
perfect body, perfect spouse,
perfect house, perfect kids,

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:35.870 align:middle line:84%
put together in
exactly the right way,

00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:39.490 align:middle line:84%
doing all the right activities,
the right kind of job,

00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:43.420 align:middle line:84%
the right kind of volunteer,
kids doing the right thing

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:44.245 align:middle line:90%
everything--

00:48:44.245 --> 00:48:46.990 align:middle line:90%


00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:50.620 align:middle line:84%
then that is hopefully
an impenetrable shield

00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:53.737 align:middle line:84%
where no arrow criticism
can get through.

00:48:53.737 --> 00:48:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And the issue, of course,
with perfectionism

00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:59.430 align:middle line:84%
is that it's exhausting,
and it's impossible.

00:48:59.430 --> 00:49:01.420 align:middle line:90%
Third on the list is anger.

00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:04.480 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm angry all
the time and I've

00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:07.990 align:middle line:84%
got a scowl and people
know to walk on eggshells,

00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:11.170 align:middle line:84%
that keeps everyone
at a distance.

00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's functionally
what I want,

00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:15.160 align:middle line:84%
because if you do come
in to swing at me,

00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:17.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm already out of range.

00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:18.980 align:middle line:90%
So that's also very effective.

00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:22.767 align:middle line:84%
But again, the cost is that
estranges my relationships

00:49:22.767 --> 00:49:24.100 align:middle line:90%
and I have no warmth in my life.

00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:26.680 align:middle line:90%


00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:33.060 align:middle line:84%
The last two are invisibility
and people-pleasing.

00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:37.330 align:middle line:84%
So invisibility as a shield is,
if I keep my head down, dress

00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:40.960 align:middle line:84%
very plainly, don't raise
my hand, speak up in class,

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:42.850 align:middle line:84%
don't speak up in
business meetings,

00:49:42.850 --> 00:49:47.260 align:middle line:84%
maybe the bullies will not
notice me and not pull me out

00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:49.450 align:middle line:84%
to shame me or ridicule
me in some way.

00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:52.390 align:middle line:90%


00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And the shield of
people-pleasing is that

00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:59.470 align:middle line:90%
if everyone around me is happy--

00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:02.800 align:middle line:84%
and more importantly,
happy with me--

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:06.922 align:middle line:84%
then perhaps the bullies
will give me a pass today.

00:50:06.922 --> 00:50:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And the problem
with these last two

00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:10.522 align:middle line:84%
is that they're
not actual shields.

00:50:10.522 --> 00:50:11.980 align:middle line:84%
They don't actually
block anything.

00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:13.772 align:middle line:84%
Invisibility, you're
not blocking anything.

00:50:13.772 --> 00:50:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
you're not an iguana.

00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:20.170 align:middle line:90%
So I can see you.

00:50:20.170 --> 00:50:22.660 align:middle line:84%
But you're trying to
sort of evade attention.

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And the problem
with people-pleasing

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:26.000 align:middle line:84%
is that it's not
a shield either.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:26.800 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't block.

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:28.210 align:middle line:90%
It's appeasement.

00:50:28.210 --> 00:50:31.095 align:middle line:84%
So in the classroom,
it's the class clown.

00:50:31.095 --> 00:50:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And in real life,
it's the parent

00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:36.200 align:middle line:84%
that is like serving everybody
in the upper generation,

00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:39.190 align:middle line:84%
the in-laws, everyone
in the lower generation,

00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:41.440 align:middle line:84%
serving spouse,
serving the workplace,

00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:44.813 align:middle line:84%
and there's like
nothing left for me.

00:50:44.813 --> 00:50:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And you do this because you
feel like you have to do this,

00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:49.840 align:middle line:84%
or else you will lose love
and not be worthy of love.

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:52.092 align:middle line:84%
So you'll give
anything for that.

00:50:52.092 --> 00:50:53.800 align:middle line:84%
But again, for me
that's a false premise.

00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And when you realize that,
everything around you

00:50:56.290 --> 00:50:58.480 align:middle line:84%
starts to realign,
because you're like,

00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:00.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to lose love.

00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:07.280 align:middle line:84%
So if I know that, how does
that change my behavior?

00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:11.150 align:middle line:84%
But of course, the issue is when
you start taking off the mask,

00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:14.240 align:middle line:84%
all of reality starts to
move with it, your then

00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:15.040 align:middle line:90%
current reality.

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:17.650 align:middle line:90%


00:51:17.650 --> 00:51:19.720 align:middle line:90%
So that's shielding.

00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:21.910 align:middle line:90%
It's just a menu of options.

00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:23.813 align:middle line:84%
Everyone comes up
with their own mix.

00:51:23.813 --> 00:51:25.480 align:middle line:84%
They use different
things in different--

00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:27.370 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing
wrong with them.

00:51:27.370 --> 00:51:30.340 align:middle line:90%


00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:32.320 align:middle line:84%
If you have a wound--
and we all do--

00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:35.298 align:middle line:90%
you will shield.

00:51:35.298 --> 00:51:37.090 align:middle line:84%
So what I teach is not
an exercise in like,

00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:38.560 align:middle line:84%
how do we get you
to shield less?

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:39.760 align:middle line:90%
It's like, no, no, no.

00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:40.660 align:middle line:90%
Keep that thing up.

00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:42.310 align:middle line:90%
I don't want you to get hit.

00:51:42.310 --> 00:51:46.990 align:middle line:84%
But it's more a question
of just making sure you're

00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:50.020 align:middle line:90%
getting value for money, right?

00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:52.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm laying out all
this blood and treasure

00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:53.730 align:middle line:90%
to keep the shield up.

00:51:53.730 --> 00:51:54.730 align:middle line:90%
I want it to work.

00:51:54.730 --> 00:51:57.640 align:middle line:90%


00:51:57.640 --> 00:52:02.198 align:middle line:84%
Because you paid all this effort
and blood, sweat, and tears

00:52:02.198 --> 00:52:03.490 align:middle line:90%
for the shield, it better work.

00:52:03.490 --> 00:52:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not, switch
it up and come up

00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:06.840 align:middle line:90%
with a different one.

00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:09.880 align:middle line:90%
And soothing is similar.

00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:13.390 align:middle line:84%
The usual suspects are
alcohol and substances,

00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:16.360 align:middle line:84%
just the chemical brute force
of hitting the voice to shut it

00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:18.700 align:middle line:90%
up, making this painless.

00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:21.340 align:middle line:90%


00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:22.940 align:middle line:90%
It's sex and relationships.

00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:27.770 align:middle line:84%
So sex as like the physical act,
just the narcotic act of sex.

00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:29.740 align:middle line:84%
But also relationships,
which is like the surge

00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:32.380 align:middle line:84%
of emotional validation you
get the first two or three

00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:34.490 align:middle line:90%
weeks in any relationship.

00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:37.300 align:middle line:84%
Then after that, you kind of
see each other more clearly

00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:40.072 align:middle line:84%
and you say, ah,
and you run away.

00:52:40.072 --> 00:52:41.530 align:middle line:84%
So jumping from
thing to thing just

00:52:41.530 --> 00:52:45.070 align:middle line:84%
to get that, just to kind
of skim the top frosting

00:52:45.070 --> 00:52:48.170 align:middle line:84%
on the cupcake off and
then kind of move on

00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:49.865 align:middle line:90%
is a form of soothing.

00:52:49.865 --> 00:52:50.740 align:middle line:90%
And it's very common.

00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:53.860 align:middle line:90%
People do it all the time.

00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:55.612 align:middle line:84%
And I know it causes
pain, and people

00:52:55.612 --> 00:52:57.820 align:middle line:84%
don't want to get trapped
in these repetitive cycles.

00:52:57.820 --> 00:52:58.620 align:middle line:90%
And I get that.

00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:00.820 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time
I'm like, you're

00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:05.770 align:middle line:84%
not doing it because
you're an idiot.

00:53:05.770 --> 00:53:07.240 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason
you're doing it.

00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:09.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a very reasonable
reason why you're doing it.

00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And once you know
that, then it's

00:53:11.290 --> 00:53:14.770 align:middle line:84%
like, OK, well, how do I want
to rearrange things so that I'm

00:53:14.770 --> 00:53:17.740 align:middle line:90%
paying less for my pain relief?

00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:20.800 align:middle line:90%


00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:23.350 align:middle line:90%
And then others, the soothing--

00:53:23.350 --> 00:53:28.520 align:middle line:84%
just sort of texting, gaming,
shopping, gossiping, Netflix--

00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:31.120 align:middle line:90%


00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:33.010 align:middle line:90%
in a good way.

00:53:33.010 --> 00:53:37.630 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, for
me then, the question--

00:53:37.630 --> 00:53:39.870 align:middle line:90%
exactly the same as shielding--

00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:43.450 align:middle line:84%
is not, how do we get
you to not soothe.

00:53:43.450 --> 00:53:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Even an earthworm is going
to soothe when you poke it.

00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:50.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's not unreasonable
for you to soothe.

00:53:50.170 --> 00:53:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Again, for me it's just a
question of value for money,

00:53:53.590 --> 00:53:56.500 align:middle line:90%
or value for your outlay--

00:53:56.500 --> 00:54:00.280 align:middle line:84%
which is, am I getting
the pain relief

00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:03.350 align:middle line:84%
I need at the lowest
possible cost?

00:54:03.350 --> 00:54:06.172 align:middle line:84%
So when I give talks at
schools and high schools

00:54:06.172 --> 00:54:07.630 align:middle line:84%
and I start talking
about soothing,

00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:09.088 align:middle line:84%
everyone starts to
roll their eyes.

00:54:09.088 --> 00:54:12.490 align:middle line:84%
It's like, ah, this was really
interesting until he turned out

00:54:12.490 --> 00:54:16.150 align:middle line:84%
to be the guy that's just going
to say don't do drugs, right?

00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And I say, no, no,
that's not my message.

00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:19.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yeah, please
don't do drugs.

00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:21.250 align:middle line:90%
Don't do any of that stuff.

00:54:21.250 --> 00:54:22.330 align:middle line:90%
But that's the other guy.

00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:23.660 align:middle line:90%
That's not me.

00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:25.090 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:54:25.090 --> 00:54:29.890 align:middle line:84%
What I'm here to say
is, you will soothe.

00:54:29.890 --> 00:54:31.870 align:middle line:90%
You will soothe.

00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And the only question
is, how do you

00:54:35.110 --> 00:54:39.280 align:middle line:84%
want to soothe to
get the maximal pain

00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:42.760 align:middle line:90%
relief for the least cost?

00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And I start going through
the list and I'm like--

00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:46.780 align:middle line:84%
so one thing, if
you were coming up

00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:48.520 align:middle line:84%
with a Silicon Valley
high-tech feature

00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:53.050 align:middle line:84%
list for this new
product, the first feature

00:54:53.050 --> 00:54:57.940 align:middle line:84%
is that it would be nice
if your method of shooting

00:54:57.940 --> 00:54:58.970 align:middle line:90%
didn't kill you.

00:54:58.970 --> 00:55:00.320 align:middle line:90%
That would be nice.

00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:01.630 align:middle line:90%
That would be cool.

00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:04.720 align:middle line:84%
The second feature would
be, it would be nice

00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:08.350 align:middle line:84%
if your method of soothing
didn't hurt yourself

00:55:08.350 --> 00:55:09.970 align:middle line:90%
or for other people.

00:55:09.970 --> 00:55:11.180 align:middle line:90%
That would be great.

00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:12.620 align:middle line:90%
That would be great.

00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And so we go through the
list, and everyone just

00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:16.900 align:middle line:84%
comes up with how
they currently soothe

00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:19.110 align:middle line:84%
and then how they
would rearrange things

00:55:19.110 --> 00:55:22.700 align:middle line:90%
to soothe with better value.

00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And one of the liberating things
about realizing shielding,

00:55:28.180 --> 00:55:32.380 align:middle line:84%
but in particular soothing,
is that when you realize this

00:55:32.380 --> 00:55:36.340 align:middle line:84%
entire range of things--
everything from sex, drugs,

00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:41.200 align:middle line:84%
heroin, binge-drinking, all
the way down to like Netflix

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:43.630 align:middle line:90%
and stupid games on your phone--

00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:48.250 align:middle line:84%
once you realize this full
rogue's gallery of shootings

00:55:48.250 --> 00:55:55.890 align:middle line:84%
are all aimed at numbing
a single wound within you,

00:55:55.890 --> 00:55:57.640 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that
many people realize

00:55:57.640 --> 00:56:03.520 align:middle line:84%
is that, holy cow,
if they're all

00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:08.050 align:middle line:84%
aiming at the same
thing, then that

00:56:08.050 --> 00:56:10.510 align:middle line:90%
means they're interchangeable.

00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:12.970 align:middle line:90%
Any soothing will do.

00:56:12.970 --> 00:56:15.145 align:middle line:84%
So I often have people
coming in after like day two

00:56:15.145 --> 00:56:17.110 align:middle line:84%
or day three of the
seven-day healing program,

00:56:17.110 --> 00:56:19.960 align:middle line:84%
and they say, well,
you know, I feel bad.

00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:20.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm still soothing.

00:56:20.770 --> 00:56:22.908 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, it's OK to soothe.

00:56:22.908 --> 00:56:24.200 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah, I stopped drinking.

00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:26.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm not doing weed anymore.

00:56:26.070 --> 00:56:29.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm taking a three-month break
from any more relationships.

00:56:29.610 --> 00:56:31.960 align:middle line:84%
But man, I'm watching
a lot on Netflix.

00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:34.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm like watching "Game of
Thrones" like the third time.

00:56:34.450 --> 00:56:37.960 align:middle line:90%


00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, how
is that not a win?

00:56:42.790 --> 00:56:46.300 align:middle line:90%
How is that not a win?

00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:48.102 align:middle line:90%
You're going to soothe.

00:56:48.102 --> 00:56:50.560 align:middle line:84%
So this whole beating yourself
up-- oh, I'm still soothing.

00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:51.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm a bad person.

00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:52.180 align:middle line:90%
It's like, no, no, no.

00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:53.980 align:middle line:90%
You're going to soothe.

00:56:53.980 --> 00:57:00.750 align:middle line:84%
But you're soothing in
a way which is harmless.

00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And then the puritanical--
well, it's not productive time,

00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:05.140 align:middle line:90%
and it takes a lot of time.

00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:07.920 align:middle line:84%
Do you know how long
"Game of Thrones" is?

00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, well,
if you're laid out

00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:13.363 align:middle line:84%
from a binge of
whatever and you're not

00:57:13.363 --> 00:57:15.030 align:middle line:84%
functional for three
days, you basically

00:57:15.030 --> 00:57:17.760 align:middle line:90%
spent the same amount of time.

00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:19.410 align:middle line:90%
I can argue this all day long.

00:57:19.410 --> 00:57:22.545 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom line is, you
have seen how you soothe.

00:57:22.545 --> 00:57:24.420 align:middle line:84%
You realize they're all
doing the same thing.

00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And you're just shimmying
the dividing line

00:57:28.290 --> 00:57:32.760 align:middle line:84%
of allocation of soothing
method toward things

00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:37.770 align:middle line:84%
that just cost you less in terms
of pain, money, time, blood,

00:57:37.770 --> 00:57:39.870 align:middle line:90%
and treasure.

00:57:39.870 --> 00:57:42.300 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:45.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is an act of
self-love and self-care.

00:57:45.210 --> 00:57:48.000 align:middle line:84%
So I'm like, don't beat
yourself up for it.

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you find that just
the awareness that soothing

00:57:50.790 --> 00:57:56.070 align:middle line:84%
and shielding comes from the
belief that there is a lack

00:57:56.070 --> 00:57:58.200 align:middle line:84%
of love to go around and
that you want to be loved,

00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:00.488 align:middle line:84%
just that alone is
healing unto itself?

00:58:00.488 --> 00:58:02.280 align:middle line:84%
They're like, oh wow,
that's a realization.

00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:05.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, I just don't need to
do that as much anymore.

00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:06.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:58:06.090 --> 00:58:09.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's all kinds of
different profiles of folks

00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:10.230 align:middle line:90%
out there, right?

00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:14.940 align:middle line:84%
But there's definitely
those who will

00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:17.190 align:middle line:84%
hear everything
I've just described

00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:19.860 align:middle line:90%
and they'll be like, thank you.

00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:22.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm done.

00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:25.973 align:middle line:84%
And they just go in, and they
start rearranging things.

00:58:25.973 --> 00:58:27.140 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they quit their job.

00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:29.700 align:middle line:84%
They realize they're
suffering all this indignity

00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:36.000 align:middle line:84%
and deterioration of their
health for this shield.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, I can get this
same thickness and durability

00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:42.730 align:middle line:84%
of shield across the street
for a tenth of the price.

00:58:42.730 --> 00:58:43.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm done.

00:58:43.530 --> 00:58:44.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm gone.

00:58:44.330 --> 00:58:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And they just walk
away with no problem.

00:58:46.410 --> 00:58:48.060 align:middle line:84%
So there are these
beautiful kind

00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:51.900 align:middle line:84%
of realizations of, I guess what
a Wall Street guy would call

00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:56.310 align:middle line:84%
arbitrage opportunities, where
it's like, you're getting

00:58:56.310 --> 00:58:58.642 align:middle line:84%
the same thing,
completely same value

00:58:58.642 --> 00:58:59.850 align:middle line:90%
for like a tenth of the cost.

00:58:59.850 --> 00:59:01.200 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, done.

00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:03.390 align:middle line:90%
Do that deal all day long.

00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:05.600 align:middle line:84%
So that's very
gratifying, because that's

00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:06.600 align:middle line:90%
the simplest part of it.

00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:09.640 align:middle line:90%


00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:18.870 align:middle line:84%
But I think the
satisfaction for me,

00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:22.950 align:middle line:84%
it's not just in giving you
an interesting new framework

00:59:22.950 --> 00:59:26.670 align:middle line:84%
to see things in
a different way.

00:59:26.670 --> 00:59:29.130 align:middle line:84%
The deeper thing
that I'm finding I'm

00:59:29.130 --> 00:59:31.290 align:middle line:90%
always needing to reinforce--

00:59:31.290 --> 00:59:35.170 align:middle line:84%
because I'm pushing against the
mass of a fear-driven culture.

00:59:35.170 --> 00:59:35.970 align:middle line:90%
It is what it is.

00:59:35.970 --> 00:59:37.740 align:middle line:84%
You just play the ball
as it lies, right?

00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:40.110 align:middle line:90%
This is where we are.

00:59:40.110 --> 00:59:46.290 align:middle line:84%
It's this idea that
doing these things is not

00:59:46.290 --> 00:59:48.240 align:middle line:90%
intrinsically bad.

00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:50.190 align:middle line:90%
There's no shame in it.

00:59:50.190 --> 00:59:52.098 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing wrong with you.

00:59:52.098 --> 00:59:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Something I'll often-- they'll
tell me this whole thing

00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:55.807 align:middle line:84%
and how they're a
terrible person.

00:59:55.807 --> 00:59:57.755 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just like,
well, hang on a minute.

00:59:57.755 --> 00:59:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, well,
you're this healing expert,

00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:01.297 align:middle line:84%
and you've got it
all figured out.

01:00:01.297 --> 01:00:03.210 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, that's
definitely not true.

01:00:03.210 --> 01:00:10.800 align:middle line:84%
But secondly, I'm not flying
the same fighter jet you are.

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:15.210 align:middle line:84%
If I were in the same
fighter jet you're flying,

01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:16.630 align:middle line:84%
born into the
family you were born

01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:20.760 align:middle line:84%
in with your identity, body,
everything in this society

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:25.590 align:middle line:84%
you airdropped into, and I
was flying the same fighter

01:00:25.590 --> 01:00:29.520 align:middle line:84%
jet as you with one engine
out and all the shit exploding

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:31.650 align:middle line:84%
all around me, I
would do no better.

01:00:31.650 --> 01:00:34.560 align:middle line:90%


01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.670 align:middle line:90%
I would do no better.

01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:39.560 align:middle line:90%


01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:44.480 align:middle line:84%
What I tell that single mom
that pulled me from meditation

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:47.090 align:middle line:84%
into healing, kicking
and screaming,

01:00:47.090 --> 01:00:50.910 align:middle line:90%
chickenshit coward that I am--

01:00:50.910 --> 01:00:54.060 align:middle line:84%
I was like, if I were
flying your fighter jet,

01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:56.700 align:middle line:90%
I'd be dead by now.

01:00:56.700 --> 01:01:01.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't have the constitution
and endurance that you have.

01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:03.270 align:middle line:90%
I'd be dead.

01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:04.200 align:middle line:90%
You are like a--

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:07.720 align:middle line:84%
I want to, like, steal your
DNA and save it for posterity.

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:08.880 align:middle line:90%
You're unkillable.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:13.590 align:middle line:90%


01:01:13.590 --> 01:01:18.240 align:middle line:84%
So I have huge admiration
for so many of the people

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:19.530 align:middle line:90%
I advise and work with.

01:01:19.530 --> 01:01:22.260 align:middle line:90%


01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:23.460 align:middle line:90%
The image I often give--

01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:26.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't play golf myself, but
it's like they are the golfer.

01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:27.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm the caddy.

01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:28.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm advising.

01:01:28.070 --> 01:01:29.233 align:middle line:90%
This is their round.

01:01:29.233 --> 01:01:31.150 align:middle line:84%
And when they hit one
that splits the fairway,

01:01:31.150 --> 01:01:33.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm just like [WHISTLES].

01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:36.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm as deep in
admiration as anyone--

01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:40.290 align:middle line:84%
probably more, because I know
what the wind conditions are

01:01:40.290 --> 01:01:41.890 align:middle line:90%
and how awful it is.

01:01:41.890 --> 01:01:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And they're still
able to do that.

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And they give themselves
no credit for it.

01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, no, you
need to take a pause.

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:51.600 align:middle line:84%
It's like, that
was unbelievable.

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.520 align:middle line:84%
I could never make
that shot, and I'm

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:56.820 align:middle line:84%
on this golf course
all day long.

01:01:56.820 --> 01:02:05.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's this huge sense of
just joy and wonder when

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:11.940 align:middle line:84%
I see people and they realize
these core deep things,

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:14.633 align:middle line:84%
that there's nothing
wrong with them,

01:02:14.633 --> 01:02:16.800 align:middle line:84%
and the job they're doing
flying what they're flying

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:19.330 align:middle line:90%
is incredible.

01:02:19.330 --> 01:02:20.130 align:middle line:90%
It's world-class.

01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:20.930 align:middle line:90%
It's olympian.

01:02:20.930 --> 01:02:23.063 align:middle line:90%


01:02:23.063 --> 01:02:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And they would
have never imagined

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:25.760 align:middle line:90%
to even think of it that way.

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, but just
look at the facts.

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:29.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm like the little
lawyer in their heads.

01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:31.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm just making the case.

01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:31.990 align:middle line:90%
And I'm the expert.

01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:33.110 align:middle line:90%
I see this all day long.

01:02:33.110 --> 01:02:34.235 align:middle line:90%
I have all the data points.

01:02:34.235 --> 01:02:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'm telling you, I would
not still be aloft in the air

01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:42.960 align:middle line:90%
if I were in your F-16.

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:44.438 align:middle line:90%
And they're like, OK.

01:02:44.438 --> 01:02:46.230 align:middle line:84%
So for all the things
they've gone through,

01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:50.130 align:middle line:84%
they have this pride
of craftsmanship.

01:02:50.130 --> 01:02:52.620 align:middle line:90%
It's just the reality.

01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:54.870 align:middle line:84%
So they're like, OK, instead
of beating themselves up,

01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:55.890 align:middle line:90%
they put all that aside.

01:02:55.890 --> 01:02:57.265 align:middle line:84%
It's like, all
right, well, let's

01:02:57.265 --> 01:02:59.760 align:middle line:84%
pop the hood again and
take a look at this

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:00.810 align:middle line:90%
and see what we can do.

01:03:00.810 --> 01:03:02.610 align:middle line:84%
Maybe nothing more,
and that's fine.

01:03:02.610 --> 01:03:04.200 align:middle line:90%
We'll just drive it as it is.

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:07.175 align:middle line:84%
They relax and they're like,
just take another look.

01:03:07.175 --> 01:03:08.550 align:middle line:84%
Put it back up on
the whiteboard.

01:03:08.550 --> 01:03:10.050 align:middle line:90%
Let's take another look.

01:03:10.050 --> 01:03:10.990 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, great.

01:03:10.990 --> 01:03:11.790 align:middle line:90%
Let's roll.

01:03:11.790 --> 01:03:12.920 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:16.270 align:middle line:84%
>> You're a little bit
like their self-love coach,

01:03:16.270 --> 01:03:17.070 align:middle line:90%
in a way.

01:03:17.070 --> 01:03:18.160 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:19.530 align:middle line:90%
You're doing a great job.

01:03:19.530 --> 01:03:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they haven't heard
that for so long, right?

01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's nice to hear,
because like you say,

01:03:24.810 --> 01:03:28.770 align:middle line:84%
that's that ultimate negative
voice is not good enough.

01:03:28.770 --> 01:03:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And it gets reaffirmed
by the culture

01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:31.170 align:middle line:90%
and reaffirmed by everybody.

01:03:31.170 --> 01:03:33.212 align:middle line:84%
It's like, no, actually,
you're doing a good job.

01:03:33.212 --> 01:03:39.370 align:middle line:84%
>> One thing I want to say about
that is I don't teach anyone

01:03:39.370 --> 01:03:42.430 align:middle line:90%
self-love.

01:03:42.430 --> 01:03:44.620 align:middle line:90%
I don't teach anyone self-love.

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:51.730 align:middle line:84%
I am the defense
attorney to defend

01:03:51.730 --> 01:03:56.620 align:middle line:84%
and advocate the fact
that self-love is already

01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:59.515 align:middle line:90%
in the room.

01:03:59.515 --> 01:04:00.640 align:middle line:90%
You don't need to learn it.

01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:02.530 align:middle line:90%
It's already in you.

01:04:02.530 --> 01:04:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And my proof for
that is very simple.

01:04:05.690 --> 01:04:10.870 align:middle line:84%
It's that if you're suffering
with these wounds and childhood

01:04:10.870 --> 01:04:15.370 align:middle line:84%
traumas and hard day at work
and, oh, my relationships

01:04:15.370 --> 01:04:23.550 align:middle line:84%
are falling apart and you feel
like you're just burning alive,

01:04:23.550 --> 01:04:29.520 align:middle line:84%
the fact that you are like this,
grasping around, looking around

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:36.920 align:middle line:84%
for any kind of relief, that's
Exhibit A. You love yourself.

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:39.760 align:middle line:90%


01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:40.560 align:middle line:90%
You love yourself.

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:43.230 align:middle line:90%


01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:47.453 align:middle line:84%
Because the converse,
the alternative is that--

01:04:47.453 --> 01:04:49.370 align:middle line:84%
because people are like,
I have self-loathing.

01:04:49.370 --> 01:04:50.240 align:middle line:90%
I hate myself.

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.880 align:middle line:90%
It's like, well, actually, no.

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:53.450 align:middle line:84%
The fact you're
even talking to me

01:04:53.450 --> 01:04:56.700 align:middle line:84%
means that you're
looking for a solution.

01:04:56.700 --> 01:05:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And so if I were truly
the villainous archenemy

01:05:03.830 --> 01:05:09.740 align:middle line:84%
and I truly hated you, if
I saw you burning alive

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:12.440 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't lift a finger.

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:16.570 align:middle line:84%
I might step out and get
some popcorn and a soda

01:05:16.570 --> 01:05:23.660 align:middle line:84%
to sit back and enjoy the show,
but I wouldn't do anything.

01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:26.600 align:middle line:84%
I think it was Napoleon who said
the worst thing a general can

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:29.660 align:middle line:84%
do is interrupt their
rival when they're

01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:33.950 align:middle line:84%
in the process of shooting
themselves in the foot.

01:05:33.950 --> 01:05:38.300 align:middle line:84%
When your enemy is screwing
up, don't interfere.

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:41.480 align:middle line:84%
So if I really hated you
and you were burning alive,

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:43.820 align:middle line:90%
I would let you burn.

01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And you don't do
that to yourself.

01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:51.320 align:middle line:84%
The more you burn, the more
despicable things you do--

01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:53.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm guilty, I'm
this monster, I'm

01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:55.770 align:middle line:84%
a piece of shit, blah,
blah, blah, blah--

01:05:55.770 --> 01:05:56.810 align:middle line:90%
you still reach out.

01:05:56.810 --> 01:05:59.240 align:middle line:90%


01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:01.550 align:middle line:84%
There's a style, and
there's no accounting

01:06:01.550 --> 01:06:05.030 align:middle line:84%
for-- you may reach for
things that are bad for you

01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:06.710 align:middle line:90%
and don't really work.

01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:09.555 align:middle line:84%
But you do reach for
something, right?

01:06:09.555 --> 01:06:10.430 align:middle line:90%
And that's self-love.

01:06:10.430 --> 01:06:13.585 align:middle line:84%
And that self-love it's
pretty damn unconditional.

01:06:13.585 --> 01:06:16.655 align:middle line:90%


01:06:16.655 --> 01:06:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And I want to be very
careful when I say this,

01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:22.460 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes people are like,
I'm at the end of my rope.

01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:25.280 align:middle line:90%
I just want to end it all.

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, even that
can at a certain level

01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:34.940 align:middle line:90%
be interpreted as a misguided--

01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:39.650 align:middle line:84%
misguided-- form of
self-love, because you

01:06:39.650 --> 01:06:40.840 align:middle line:90%
want the pain to end.

01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:43.860 align:middle line:90%


01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And that is its own
form of self-love.

01:06:45.570 --> 01:06:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not advocating
that, because it's misguided.

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And I'll explain
why in a minute.

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:54.540 align:middle line:84%
But again, if I'm your enemy
and I'm watching you burn alive,

01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:57.210 align:middle line:84%
my most fervent wish is
for your immortality.

01:06:57.210 --> 01:07:00.400 align:middle line:90%


01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:01.580 align:middle line:90%
I want you to stay alive.

01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:05.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't want you to die, because
I don't want your pain to end.

01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And so when I feel
like I'm burning alive

01:07:07.450 --> 01:07:08.950 align:middle line:84%
and I'm like, well,
maybe one option

01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:11.110 align:middle line:84%
would be to just end
everything, that's

01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:14.080 align:middle line:84%
still a misguided
form of self-love,

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:16.980 align:middle line:84%
because you're still trying
to make the pain go away.

01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:20.210 align:middle line:84%
The only difference is
you've run out of ideas.

01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:22.450 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, as we
all know, if you just

01:07:22.450 --> 01:07:25.120 align:middle line:84%
think about your
own life experience,

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:27.670 align:middle line:84%
if you sit there
long enough in pain,

01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:30.670 align:middle line:84%
you will come up
with more ideas.

01:07:30.670 --> 01:07:32.697 align:middle line:84%
Necessity is the
mother of invention.

01:07:32.697 --> 01:07:34.280 align:middle line:84%
If you just sit there
for long enough,

01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:41.950 align:middle line:84%
the necessity of your pain will
come up with new ways, at least

01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:44.320 align:middle line:90%
new things to try.

01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:48.660 align:middle line:84%
Your creativity will be fired
up, for better or worse.

01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:52.330 align:middle line:90%
So that's why I'm always like--

01:07:52.330 --> 01:07:54.400 align:middle line:84%
you know, that's
never an answer.

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:56.650 align:middle line:84%
Because in my opinion, you
were put here for a reason.

01:07:56.650 --> 01:08:00.310 align:middle line:90%


01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:02.120 align:middle line:84%
Your mission, if you
choose to accept it,

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:07.030 align:middle line:84%
is to find that reason and
fulfill it, if you can.

01:08:07.030 --> 01:08:09.700 align:middle line:90%


01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And if you're gone,
then the game's over.

01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:13.120 align:middle line:90%
And that's no fun.

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:13.960 align:middle line:90%
So just sit.

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:14.793 align:middle line:90%
I know it's painful.

01:08:14.793 --> 01:08:16.420 align:middle line:84%
Just sit and see
what else comes.

01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:18.729 align:middle line:90%
And something always comes.

01:08:18.729 --> 01:08:20.260 align:middle line:90%
Something always comes.

01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:21.819 align:middle line:90%
>> Or someone comes to you.

01:08:21.819 --> 01:08:24.819 align:middle line:90%
>> Or someone.

01:08:24.819 --> 01:08:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>> One concept that I really
resonated with well and I think

01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:30.729 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people understand--
and I think it's similar to this

01:08:30.729 --> 01:08:35.170 align:middle line:84%
mask ideology, or
this mask theory--

01:08:35.170 --> 01:08:39.819 align:middle line:90%
is this locked up board member.

01:08:39.819 --> 01:08:42.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm a huge fan of it, because I
think it's such a practical way

01:08:42.790 --> 01:08:44.350 align:middle line:90%
to dig into the psyche.

01:08:44.350 --> 01:08:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And if I use different
examples, like my parents

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:51.939 align:middle line:90%
might have said or someone--

01:08:51.939 --> 01:08:55.870 align:middle line:84%
like, if you go do this,
if you go get a good job,

01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:58.060 align:middle line:90%
we'll love you.

01:08:58.060 --> 01:09:00.160 align:middle line:84%
I used to play in
punk rock bands.

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:04.779 align:middle line:84%
I love fast, melodic punk, like
Lagwagon, No Use for a Name,

01:09:04.779 --> 01:09:05.939 align:middle line:90%
NOFX, these sort of things.

01:09:05.939 --> 01:09:06.739 align:middle line:90%
Loved it.

01:09:06.739 --> 01:09:09.670 align:middle line:84%
I played with two boys I
connected with really well

01:09:09.670 --> 01:09:10.689 align:middle line:90%
on music.

01:09:10.689 --> 01:09:12.040 align:middle line:90%
We played gigs, recorded albums.

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:14.979 align:middle line:84%
My parents are like, you can't
make money doing that, Ryan.

01:09:14.979 --> 01:09:17.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, punk rock is a
niche within a niche, right?

01:09:17.830 --> 01:09:21.502 align:middle line:84%
And it's also like, yeah, no,
you have to go get a real job.

01:09:21.502 --> 01:09:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that and
get all your qualifications,

01:09:23.710 --> 01:09:25.930 align:middle line:90%
then you're doing a good job.

01:09:25.930 --> 01:09:28.359 align:middle line:90%
AKA, we'll love you.

01:09:28.359 --> 01:09:33.316 align:middle line:84%
Or in the case of
speaking to specificity,

01:09:33.316 --> 01:09:35.649 align:middle line:84%
because it's easy when you
do that, Laurentine, my wife,

01:09:35.649 --> 01:09:38.787 align:middle line:84%
she grew up with this father
who was a banker and a financier

01:09:38.787 --> 01:09:40.120 align:middle line:90%
and living all around the world.

01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:42.223 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, well,
my eldest son--

01:09:42.223 --> 01:09:44.640 align:middle line:84%
it was meant to be a son, but
it was a daughter, you know?

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:46.510 align:middle line:84%
You will go study
law in Switzerland,

01:09:46.510 --> 01:09:49.790 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
upstanding Dutch families do.

01:09:49.790 --> 01:09:52.353 align:middle line:84%
So she was sent to a
law school at a nunnery.

01:09:52.353 --> 01:09:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And it was taught
in German, which

01:09:53.770 --> 01:09:55.450 align:middle line:90%
is like her fourth language.

01:09:55.450 --> 01:09:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, go be a
good girl and do that,

01:09:57.370 --> 01:10:00.040 align:middle line:84%
and then you'll
be worthy of love.

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:03.130 align:middle line:90%
And she's a great artist.

01:10:03.130 --> 01:10:05.320 align:middle line:84%
She wanted to study
psychology or anthropology

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:08.250 align:middle line:84%
and human behavior, things
that we're into now.

01:10:08.250 --> 01:10:10.900 align:middle line:84%
But that board
member got locked up

01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:12.610 align:middle line:84%
for the sake of
pleasing her father.

01:10:12.610 --> 01:10:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And so did my
creative board member.

01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:16.960 align:middle line:84%
Luckily, I took a guitar
with me on my career.

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:18.172 align:middle line:90%
So I kept playing.

01:10:18.172 --> 01:10:20.630 align:middle line:84%
But then you get to this stage
where it's like, actually, I

01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:24.700 align:middle line:84%
want to go get that
guy out of the closet

01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:25.930 align:middle line:90%
and say it's OK to come back.

01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:27.305 align:middle line:84%
And when you come
back, you start

01:10:27.305 --> 01:10:29.860 align:middle line:84%
to just angle that
a little bit more

01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:31.807 align:middle line:84%
slightly towards
your bliss, which

01:10:31.807 --> 01:10:32.890 align:middle line:90%
is an interesting journey.

01:10:32.890 --> 01:10:35.100 align:middle line:90%
So I love that ideology.

01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:38.860 align:middle line:84%
I think it should be a
book in and unto itself.

01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:41.560 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about how we
lock up a board member,

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:43.340 align:middle line:84%
and how that
happens and the cost

01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:47.350 align:middle line:90%
that that can come in our lives.

01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:52.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So the million dollar
question when we talk about

01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:58.660 align:middle line:84%
soothing and shielding is
asked by one in 1,000 people I

01:10:58.660 --> 01:10:59.850 align:middle line:90%
encounter.

01:10:59.850 --> 01:11:00.650 align:middle line:90%
And that's fine.

01:11:00.650 --> 01:11:06.043 align:middle line:84%
It just shows you how not in
the forefront of our minds

01:11:06.043 --> 01:11:06.960 align:middle line:90%
thinking like this is.

01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:10.180 align:middle line:90%


01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:13.000 align:middle line:84%
But every now and
then someone will ask,

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.520 align:middle line:84%
well, it's great to soothe
differently and shield

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:20.230 align:middle line:84%
differently, to optimize how
we're managing the wound,

01:11:20.230 --> 01:11:22.900 align:middle line:84%
like numbing it
with better value

01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:25.130 align:middle line:84%
and shielding it
with better value.

01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:31.290 align:middle line:84%
But is there a way to actually
just heal the wound itself?

01:11:31.290 --> 01:11:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Because if you could
heal the wound,

01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:36.390 align:middle line:84%
and you wouldn't need to
soothe or shield at all.

01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if
that's possible, but is

01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:39.690 align:middle line:90%
that even an option?

01:11:39.690 --> 01:11:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, I want to
talk to you after the talk.

01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:47.220 align:middle line:90%


01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:53.010 align:middle line:84%
I want to take a reading
of your brain to understand

01:11:53.010 --> 01:11:54.840 align:middle line:90%
how that came out.

01:11:54.840 --> 01:12:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And so after we do some
just quick optimization

01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:04.860 align:middle line:84%
of your soothing and
shielding, just so you're good,

01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:09.840 align:middle line:84%
you're stable for like a few
weeks, then we pop the hood

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:12.980 align:middle line:84%
and go into looking
at the actual wound.

01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:15.194 align:middle line:84%
And the way I describe the
wound is the following.

01:12:15.194 --> 01:12:19.370 align:middle line:90%


01:12:19.370 --> 01:12:20.940 align:middle line:84%
The way I think
about it is that--

01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:23.610 align:middle line:84%
and this is an image
from my corporate days--

01:12:23.610 --> 01:12:26.490 align:middle line:84%
we all have like what
is metaphorically

01:12:26.490 --> 01:12:31.380 align:middle line:84%
like a board of directors
within us, where we're the CEO.

01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:35.112 align:middle line:84%
And there are a number of
characters on this board.

01:12:35.112 --> 01:12:36.570 align:middle line:84%
There's a chief of
security to make

01:12:36.570 --> 01:12:38.310 align:middle line:84%
sure you don't get
hit by a bus when

01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:39.900 align:middle line:90%
you walk out on the street.

01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:42.200 align:middle line:90%
There's your creativity.

01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:44.460 align:middle line:84%
There's the one in
charge of making

01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:48.450 align:middle line:84%
sure you get prestige
and are not humiliated.

01:12:48.450 --> 01:12:51.980 align:middle line:90%
Your body is a board member.

01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:55.050 align:middle line:84%
Your muse, if you
think of it that way,

01:12:55.050 --> 01:12:57.000 align:middle line:90%
can be a board member.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And basically, all
the sort of major life

01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:05.830 align:middle line:84%
forces you identify as
such are board members.

01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:09.810 align:middle line:84%
So in the more
nuanced cases, money

01:13:09.810 --> 01:13:13.120 align:middle line:84%
itself can be seen
as a board member.

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:15.600 align:middle line:84%
So if you have money
blocks or fear of money,

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:17.415 align:middle line:84%
it is that board
member being exiled.

01:13:17.415 --> 01:13:20.310 align:middle line:90%


01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And so the way the
wounding happens

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:28.652 align:middle line:84%
then is that when you're
told to put this mask on

01:13:28.652 --> 01:13:30.610 align:middle line:84%
and you're like, shit,
I'm going to lose love--

01:13:30.610 --> 01:13:33.690 align:middle line:84%
I've got a gun to my
head, so I'll put it on--

01:13:33.690 --> 01:13:37.620 align:middle line:84%
there will be parts
of you that stick out,

01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:39.000 align:middle line:90%
because the mask is not organic.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.800 align:middle line:84%
The mask is fashioned by society
for its own machine purposes.

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:45.240 align:middle line:90%
And that's fine.

01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:47.555 align:middle line:84%
But when you put it
on, you'll realize

01:13:47.555 --> 01:13:49.680 align:middle line:84%
that there are certain
parts of you that don't fit,

01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:51.760 align:middle line:90%
that stick out.

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And in many cases, allowing
those parts of you to stick out

01:13:55.050 --> 01:14:00.810 align:middle line:84%
is punished as much as
if you took a mask off,

01:14:00.810 --> 01:14:03.550 align:middle line:84%
because it's ruining my
suspension of disbelief.

01:14:03.550 --> 01:14:04.350 align:middle line:90%
You're a good boy.

01:14:04.350 --> 01:14:08.550 align:middle line:84%
You're an upstanding
Swiss legal expert

01:14:08.550 --> 01:14:12.180 align:middle line:84%
that will help manage
the family, our clients

01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:13.060 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:17.640 align:middle line:90%


01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:21.010 align:middle line:84%
You can perhaps paint
as a hobby on the side.

01:14:21.010 --> 01:14:24.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to hear
anything about it.

01:14:24.150 --> 01:14:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, you cannot let
that bleed over and impinge

01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:30.270 align:middle line:84%
and degrade your
professional persona.

01:14:30.270 --> 01:14:35.400 align:middle line:84%
Very standard reading
of the riot act, right?

01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And comply with all of this
with a bow on top, or else you

01:14:38.250 --> 01:14:40.830 align:middle line:90%
will lose love.

01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:44.361 align:middle line:84%
And so caddle prod is
hit, and we start running.

01:14:44.361 --> 01:14:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And again, that's
just the fighter jet.

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:51.900 align:middle line:84%
If you were in her position,
if I were in her position,

01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:54.690 align:middle line:90%
we would do no better.

01:14:54.690 --> 01:14:57.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, given her path, we
would probably do a lot worse.

01:14:57.110 --> 01:15:01.450 align:middle line:90%


01:15:01.450 --> 01:15:06.990 align:middle line:84%
So the thing is, you get that
cattle prod enough times,

01:15:06.990 --> 01:15:10.260 align:middle line:84%
pretty soon an emergency meeting
of the board of directors

01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:12.350 align:middle line:90%
is called.

01:15:12.350 --> 01:15:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And the chief of security--
in this day and age,

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:18.180 align:middle line:84%
I might even say the chief
of Homeland Security--

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:21.000 align:middle line:84%
makes an announcement
and says, look,

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.670 align:middle line:84%
I know we all have
our roles, and we're

01:15:22.670 --> 01:15:25.650 align:middle line:84%
all life tenured members of
the board and everything.

01:15:25.650 --> 01:15:29.070 align:middle line:84%
But we've got a serious
life-or-death situation

01:15:29.070 --> 01:15:30.480 align:middle line:90%
on our hands.

01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:34.170 align:middle line:84%
If our dad looks at
us like that again,

01:15:34.170 --> 01:15:35.340 align:middle line:90%
there could be real trouble.

01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:39.900 align:middle line:84%
If our mom looks at us with
that look of disappointment,

01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:41.190 align:middle line:90%
there could be trouble.

01:15:41.190 --> 01:15:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And there is a part of our
deep biological chassis

01:15:45.510 --> 01:15:48.690 align:middle line:84%
that knows that if we
are rejected enough

01:15:48.690 --> 01:15:52.830 align:middle line:84%
and we don't comply to it
past of certain extreme,

01:15:52.830 --> 01:15:54.660 align:middle line:90%
we could lose our lives.

01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:57.450 align:middle line:84%
We'll be left on the
hillside to freeze or be

01:15:57.450 --> 01:15:59.620 align:middle line:90%
fed to the wolves or whatever.

01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And a civilized person
maybe will be like, well,

01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:02.498 align:middle line:90%
this is 2019.

01:16:02.498 --> 01:16:03.540 align:middle line:90%
We don't do that anymore.

01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:05.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually, there's 7
billion people on the planet.

01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:08.550 align:middle line:84%
Most of them live without
electricity or running water.

01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:11.170 align:middle line:90%
This still happens all the time.

01:16:11.170 --> 01:16:13.290 align:middle line:90%
This still happens all the time.

01:16:13.290 --> 01:16:17.790 align:middle line:84%
Kids are given up in orphanages,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:16:17.790 --> 01:16:21.060 align:middle line:84%
So it's not unreasonable
that as human beings,

01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:27.450 align:middle line:84%
we come with a safety
code of looking out for,

01:16:27.450 --> 01:16:30.060 align:middle line:84%
especially as a child, signs
that we are being rejected

01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:33.728 align:middle line:84%
and not compliant, signs
that we're being shamed.

01:16:33.728 --> 01:16:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And shame is the feeling that
there's something intrinsically

01:16:36.270 --> 01:16:37.680 align:middle line:90%
wrong with me--

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:39.960 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to guilt,
which is like, oh,

01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:41.460 align:middle line:90%
I spilled coffee on your iPhone.

01:16:41.460 --> 01:16:43.388 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, let me
make it up to you.

01:16:43.388 --> 01:16:45.930 align:middle line:84%
I'll send my guy out to do your
data transfer and everything.

01:16:45.930 --> 01:16:47.970 align:middle line:90%
I'll buy you the next model.

01:16:47.970 --> 01:16:52.890 align:middle line:84%
That's guilt. Transactional
difference, easy to realign.

01:16:52.890 --> 01:16:54.048 align:middle line:90%
Shame is different.

01:16:54.048 --> 01:16:56.340 align:middle line:84%
Shame is where there's a
feeling that there's something

01:16:56.340 --> 01:16:59.910 align:middle line:90%
intrinsically wrong with me.

01:16:59.910 --> 01:17:02.970 align:middle line:84%
There's something the
fuck wrong with me.

01:17:02.970 --> 01:17:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And the iPhone example
would be if you got up

01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:08.097 align:middle line:84%
to get a glass of water,
if you came back, I

01:17:08.097 --> 01:17:09.180 align:middle line:90%
didn't damage your iPhone.

01:17:09.180 --> 01:17:11.013 align:middle line:84%
I was actually scrolling
through your texts.

01:17:11.013 --> 01:17:13.800 align:middle line:90%


01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:16.312 align:middle line:84%
And if we found ourselves
in that situation,

01:17:16.312 --> 01:17:17.770 align:middle line:84%
I would hand the
phone back to you.

01:17:17.770 --> 01:17:19.390 align:middle line:90%
You'd still have your phone.

01:17:19.390 --> 01:17:22.160 align:middle line:84%
No economic or
financial degradation.

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:23.860 align:middle line:90%
There's no imbalance.

01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:27.160 align:middle line:84%
But we are not
OK, because you've

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:31.090 align:middle line:84%
realized there's something
the fuck wrong with me.

01:17:31.090 --> 01:17:32.560 align:middle line:90%
And that's shame.

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:34.570 align:middle line:90%
That's shame.

01:17:34.570 --> 01:17:41.080 align:middle line:84%
So when we look out for
the people around us who

01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:43.060 align:middle line:84%
are protecting us
and feeding us,

01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:46.870 align:middle line:84%
thinking there's
something wrong with us,

01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:50.290 align:middle line:84%
we're constantly looking
out for that threshold.

01:17:50.290 --> 01:17:52.858 align:middle line:84%
If we cross a certain
threshold, we're dead.

01:17:52.858 --> 01:17:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And we have to do
something about it.

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:58.210 align:middle line:84%
Then you call the emergency
meeting of the board members

01:17:58.210 --> 01:18:02.470 align:middle line:84%
and you say, look, we're
young men in this family.

01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Everyone in this family
is bankers and lawyers.

01:18:04.450 --> 01:18:05.800 align:middle line:90%
It's just the way it is.

01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:07.660 align:middle line:84%
You've benefited
from all that sort

01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:11.020 align:middle line:84%
of privilege and economic
resource and education,

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:12.970 align:middle line:90%
so don't complain.

01:18:12.970 --> 01:18:16.190 align:middle line:84%
But if our dad looks
at us like that again,

01:18:16.190 --> 01:18:18.980 align:middle line:84%
there's going to
be serious trouble.

01:18:18.980 --> 01:18:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And we've called you here to
this emergency board meeting,

01:18:22.970 --> 01:18:27.490 align:middle line:84%
because I'm sorry, we're going
to have to declare martial law.

01:18:27.490 --> 01:18:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And you, punk rocker, you
guitar-playing artist, and you,

01:18:31.810 --> 01:18:33.160 align:middle line:90%
long hair--

01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:35.950 align:middle line:90%
definitely, you the long hair--

01:18:35.950 --> 01:18:38.270 align:middle line:84%
you guys are voted
off the island.

01:18:38.270 --> 01:18:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Security, escort them
into the cafeteria.

01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:42.640 align:middle line:84%
Sequester them there
until further notice,

01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:44.590 align:middle line:90%
which is like forever.

01:18:44.590 --> 01:18:47.500 align:middle line:84%
The rest of you, ignore
the banging on the door.

01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:50.650 align:middle line:90%
Carry on with the meeting.

01:18:50.650 --> 01:18:53.160 align:middle line:84%
So when these board members
within you are exiled,

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:54.590 align:middle line:90%
it's done out of love.

01:18:54.590 --> 01:18:56.530 align:middle line:90%
It's not malicious.

01:18:56.530 --> 01:19:01.380 align:middle line:84%
It's done out of love and a
well-meaning but panicked fear.

01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:02.620 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:04.480 align:middle line:90%
And again, there's no mistake.

01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:06.280 align:middle line:84%
If you or I were
flying that F-16,

01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:09.800 align:middle line:90%
we would do the same thing.

01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:14.830 align:middle line:84%
But the cost and the upshot
is that we have this compass,

01:19:14.830 --> 01:19:17.660 align:middle line:90%
and three load stones are out.

01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:22.480 align:middle line:84%
So the compass is decalibrated,
let's say, about 15%

01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:23.280 align:middle line:90%
off of true north.

01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:26.650 align:middle line:90%


01:19:26.650 --> 01:19:30.393 align:middle line:84%
And so with this
decalibrated compass,

01:19:30.393 --> 01:19:31.810 align:middle line:84%
you make all these
same decisions,

01:19:31.810 --> 01:19:32.950 align:middle line:84%
because you've got to
get on with your life.

01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:35.530 align:middle line:84%
Who I'm going to marry, what
kind of job I'm going to take,

01:19:35.530 --> 01:19:37.120 align:middle line:84%
what kind of
external persona I'm

01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:40.030 align:middle line:84%
going to wear and present
to the outside world

01:19:40.030 --> 01:19:41.140 align:middle line:90%
in different situations.

01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:44.680 align:middle line:84%
What situations,
what milieu I'll

01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:46.420 align:middle line:84%
even choose to
insert myself into,

01:19:46.420 --> 01:19:48.730 align:middle line:84%
which require different
kinds of masks.

01:19:48.730 --> 01:19:50.650 align:middle line:84%
You make all these choices
with a compass that

01:19:50.650 --> 01:19:54.310 align:middle line:90%
is decalibrated just about 15%.

01:19:54.310 --> 01:19:58.290 align:middle line:90%
15% is about this much.

01:19:58.290 --> 01:20:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And when you deviate two or
three years out of college,

01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:04.570 align:middle line:90%
that's no big deal.

01:20:04.570 --> 01:20:08.950 align:middle line:84%
You fast forward that
another 15 to 20 years,

01:20:08.950 --> 01:20:11.410 align:middle line:90%
you're way off mark.

01:20:11.410 --> 01:20:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And at around about midlife,
you realize, holy crap.

01:20:16.060 --> 01:20:17.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm way off.

01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And some of us
continue, and some of us

01:20:19.810 --> 01:20:23.830 align:middle line:84%
decide to take off the mask and
take a hard left turn, which

01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:27.520 align:middle line:90%
ends up breaking a lot of shit.

01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:30.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a decision
to be taken lightly.

01:20:30.370 --> 01:20:32.800 align:middle line:84%
Most of us are pushed into
it kicking and screaming.

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:38.140 align:middle line:84%
But then you start making your
way back to the original track.

01:20:38.140 --> 01:20:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And so the question basically
boils down to, to what extent

01:20:48.130 --> 01:20:54.730 align:middle line:84%
can you get a reading on
what board member or board

01:20:54.730 --> 01:20:59.950 align:middle line:84%
members were exiled in
order to keep your mask on?

01:20:59.950 --> 01:21:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And are you able to actually
recover them and bring them

01:21:03.790 --> 01:21:07.670 align:middle line:90%
back into the boat with you?

01:21:07.670 --> 01:21:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And there's a funny thing
with these board members.

01:21:12.090 --> 01:21:14.870 align:middle line:90%
They are life-tenured.

01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And as a board member, even
if you lock me in the closet,

01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:22.190 align:middle line:84%
my card key opens every
door in the building.

01:21:22.190 --> 01:21:24.810 align:middle line:90%


01:21:24.810 --> 01:21:27.190 align:middle line:84%
So when you lock me in
there and I stay in there,

01:21:27.190 --> 01:21:29.640 align:middle line:90%
it's because I'm complicit.

01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:33.050 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm the punk rocker
guitar-playing guy in you

01:21:33.050 --> 01:21:35.600 align:middle line:84%
and I'm like, well, shit,
I'd better stay in here.

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:38.210 align:middle line:90%
Because I love everyone too.

01:21:38.210 --> 01:21:43.923 align:middle line:84%
Everyone loves you within
you, because they do.

01:21:43.923 --> 01:21:44.840 align:middle line:90%
They're a part of you.

01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:48.410 align:middle line:84%
But also, to be
crass, their interests

01:21:48.410 --> 01:21:50.340 align:middle line:84%
are very aligned with
you, because if you die,

01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:51.140 align:middle line:90%
they die too.

01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:55.220 align:middle line:90%


01:21:55.220 --> 01:21:58.500 align:middle line:90%
We're all in line here.

01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And so what will often happen
is that several years, sometimes

01:22:03.530 --> 01:22:05.960 align:middle line:90%
decades will go by.

01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:09.440 align:middle line:84%
The board members who are
sitting in the prison cell

01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:12.172 align:middle line:84%
start to look at each
other and say, hey, Fred.

01:22:12.172 --> 01:22:13.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they're
coming back for us.

01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:17.660 align:middle line:90%


01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:21.140 align:middle line:84%
It's always the softest,
most sensitive ones

01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:25.160 align:middle line:84%
that are the most
gullible, right?

01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And they start to
decide to take action.

01:22:29.090 --> 01:22:33.220 align:middle line:84%
So they do have full access
to all the resources,

01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:36.830 align:middle line:84%
and they have access to
all the levers down there.

01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:41.000 align:middle line:84%
So they can pull
an emergency brake.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.420 align:middle line:84%
I'll just rattle off
hypothetical metaphorical

01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:45.460 align:middle line:90%
things.

01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:47.070 align:middle line:84%
They can get you
fired from your job.

01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:49.940 align:middle line:84%
They can give you panic attacks
before you go into meetings.

01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:55.130 align:middle line:84%
They can make you wander
off with other people

01:22:55.130 --> 01:22:58.490 align:middle line:84%
to break off a relationship
that you don't want to be in.

01:22:58.490 --> 01:23:00.290 align:middle line:90%
They can throw out your back.

01:23:00.290 --> 01:23:01.340 align:middle line:90%
They can give you rashes.

01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:02.960 align:middle line:84%
They can give you
heart palpitations.

01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:06.020 align:middle line:84%
All these kinds of
things, metaphorically,

01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:08.690 align:middle line:84%
can be interpreted
often in hindsight

01:23:08.690 --> 01:23:11.930 align:middle line:90%
as, I wasn't listening.

01:23:11.930 --> 01:23:14.990 align:middle line:84%
I kept stuffing them
down, and they came up

01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:19.820 align:middle line:90%
and pulled the emergency brake.

01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:22.912 align:middle line:84%
And often in hindsight when
they're like, OK, fine.

01:23:22.912 --> 01:23:24.620 align:middle line:84%
I've finally recovered
this board member.

01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:25.453 align:middle line:90%
I've talked to them.

01:23:25.453 --> 01:23:27.440 align:middle line:84%
I've let them have
their day in court.

01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And when they give
their side of the story,

01:23:29.370 --> 01:23:34.400 align:middle line:84%
you realize that they
had a just grievance.

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And they only pulled the
emergency brake very, very

01:23:40.190 --> 01:23:44.570 align:middle line:84%
begrudgingly, because all the
other attempts to email you,

01:23:44.570 --> 01:23:46.100 align:middle line:84%
text you, everything
was blocked.

01:23:46.100 --> 01:23:47.120 align:middle line:90%
You marked them as spam.

01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:47.930 align:middle line:90%
You blocked them.

01:23:47.930 --> 01:23:51.440 align:middle line:90%


01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And they just had to
continue escalating,

01:23:53.630 --> 01:23:56.040 align:middle line:84%
because as far as
they're concerned--

01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:58.100 align:middle line:84%
as far as the entire
board is concerned--

01:23:58.100 --> 01:24:03.170 align:middle line:84%
you all parachuted in
here to find and prosecute

01:24:03.170 --> 01:24:08.030 align:middle line:84%
your meaning and purpose in
your life for your bliss.

01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And whatever wound was given
to you was part of the compass.

01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And now you're following in
the direction of the wound

01:24:14.270 --> 01:24:17.160 align:middle line:84%
instead of letting the wound
guide you, because you're

01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:17.960 align:middle line:90%
stuffing it down.

01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:20.920 align:middle line:90%


01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And so that pain
you feel, that is

01:24:26.210 --> 01:24:31.320 align:middle line:84%
the lost board member stuffed
down, banging on the door.

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you need
to numb it so powerfully

01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:36.950 align:middle line:84%
and with so many
different methods.

01:24:36.950 --> 01:24:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you need to
shield it from being poked,

01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:44.660 align:middle line:84%
because god forbid anybody
see that you're actually

01:24:44.660 --> 01:24:47.090 align:middle line:90%
a musician.

01:24:47.090 --> 01:24:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And you know, you're
working in this,

01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:51.290 align:middle line:90%
whatever, like accounting firm.

01:24:51.290 --> 01:24:54.680 align:middle line:84%
Not to bash on
accounting firms, but.

01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:58.140 align:middle line:84%
You can't let anyone see that,
because if they point that out,

01:24:58.140 --> 01:25:02.240 align:middle line:84%
it just rips, just pulls
the wound right open.

01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:04.370 align:middle line:84%
You don't even want to
look at it yourself.

01:25:04.370 --> 01:25:07.070 align:middle line:90%
Why would you?

01:25:07.070 --> 01:25:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Not just because it's
painful, but because you've

01:25:09.650 --> 01:25:14.600 align:middle line:84%
been told in no uncertain
terms that even looking at it,

01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:18.650 align:middle line:84%
thinking about it, will
make you unworthy of love.

01:25:18.650 --> 01:25:21.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, if that's
what's on the table,

01:25:21.860 --> 01:25:24.620 align:middle line:84%
I will cut my own
arm off if I can.

01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:26.030 align:middle line:90%
But you can't.

01:25:26.030 --> 01:25:28.680 align:middle line:84%
That part of you doesn't
die until you die.

01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:32.060 align:middle line:90%
And even then, who knows?

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:33.770 align:middle line:84%
So these board members
are unkillable.

01:25:33.770 --> 01:25:35.720 align:middle line:84%
If they were killable,
the world would

01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:37.560 align:middle line:90%
be a very different place.

01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:41.420 align:middle line:84%
We would all be, I don't know,
mechanized and completely

01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:43.962 align:middle line:84%
on the path we're
on, and everyone

01:25:43.962 --> 01:25:44.920 align:middle line:90%
would be happy with it.

01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:46.090 align:middle line:90%
There would be no health issues.

01:25:46.090 --> 01:25:47.870 align:middle line:84%
There would be no
environmental disaster.

01:25:47.870 --> 01:25:50.150 align:middle line:90%
There would be nothing.

01:25:50.150 --> 01:25:54.020 align:middle line:84%
We'd all just be parts in
the machine and fine with it.

01:25:54.020 --> 01:25:55.895 align:middle line:84%
>> But that's not
the case, right?

01:25:55.895 --> 01:25:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't think
that's the case.

01:25:57.270 --> 01:26:02.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And so once this illusion
that love is not conditional

01:26:02.690 --> 01:26:06.140 align:middle line:84%
and that it resides within self
and that it's always been from

01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:11.360 align:middle line:84%
others, is that then, either
through that realization,

01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:15.960 align:middle line:84%
is it then in that process
you start to play with these

01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:16.760 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:18.150 align:middle line:90%
Oh my goodness, this is so fun.

01:26:18.150 --> 01:26:20.770 align:middle line:84%
I can actually do more
of what I love to do now.

01:26:20.770 --> 01:26:24.415 align:middle line:84%
Or can actually identifying
a locked up board member--

01:26:24.415 --> 01:26:25.540 align:middle line:90%
like say it was the artist.

01:26:25.540 --> 01:26:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Say you were a creative
artist as a child.

01:26:26.930 --> 01:26:27.730 align:middle line:90%
You loved art.

01:26:27.730 --> 01:26:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Your father said,
don't be stupid.

01:26:29.170 --> 01:26:30.670 align:middle line:84%
You've got to get
a job as a lawyer.

01:26:30.670 --> 01:26:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And then you go do that and
you're like, I'm not happy.

01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:34.948 align:middle line:84%
And then you go, I locked
that board member up

01:26:34.948 --> 01:26:35.990 align:middle line:90%
when I was eight or nine.

01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:38.242 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I was
16 and my dad said,

01:26:38.242 --> 01:26:39.200 align:middle line:90%
don't go to art school.

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:40.250 align:middle line:90%
Go to this.

01:26:40.250 --> 01:26:42.020 align:middle line:84%
What if you just
started painting again?

01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Does that help you retouch
base with that core essence

01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:47.930 align:middle line:90%
of who you are?

01:26:47.930 --> 01:26:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Can that be a healing process,
to just let that liberate?

01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:52.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

01:26:52.250 --> 01:26:53.050 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

01:26:53.050 --> 01:26:55.205 align:middle line:90%
But there are caveats.

01:26:55.205 --> 01:26:59.780 align:middle line:90%


01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:02.150 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, you could
say if it were that simple,

01:27:02.150 --> 01:27:03.830 align:middle line:90%
everyone would just do it.

01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:05.870 align:middle line:90%
Many people do.

01:27:05.870 --> 01:27:13.790 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to remember that
this is a board of directors.

01:27:13.790 --> 01:27:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And they all love you,
and they are all sworn.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.900 align:middle line:90%
They would do anything for you.

01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:23.333 align:middle line:84%
They'll do things that are
monstrous to your own self,

01:27:23.333 --> 01:27:24.500 align:middle line:90%
exiling other board members.

01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:27.167 align:middle line:84%
They will do monstrous things to
other people in the outer world

01:27:27.167 --> 01:27:31.670 align:middle line:84%
to keep you safe and put
you in a thriving position.

01:27:31.670 --> 01:27:37.400 align:middle line:84%
They're very selfish, jealously
guarding and loving you.

01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is all
the board members,

01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:45.020 align:middle line:84%
even the board members who
exiled your lost board member.

01:27:45.020 --> 01:27:47.060 align:middle line:84%
So when you start
painting again--

01:27:47.060 --> 01:27:50.060 align:middle line:84%
or more likely, when you start
thinking about painting again--

01:27:50.060 --> 01:27:52.580 align:middle line:90%


01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:55.747 align:middle line:84%
the bully, protector
side of the board

01:27:55.747 --> 01:27:57.830 align:middle line:84%
will be like, now wait
just a goddamn minute here.

01:27:57.830 --> 01:28:00.770 align:middle line:90%


01:28:00.770 --> 01:28:04.528 align:middle line:84%
Your dad doesn't need to
be around to remind you.

01:28:04.528 --> 01:28:06.570 align:middle line:84%
You've got your dad within
you as a board member.

01:28:06.570 --> 01:28:10.460 align:middle line:90%


01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:13.880 align:middle line:84%
Even when men and
women are in their 70s

01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:19.610 align:middle line:84%
and their parents are long gone
from this world, they're like,

01:28:19.610 --> 01:28:22.820 align:middle line:84%
I can still hear my dad saying
that damn thing he always

01:28:22.820 --> 01:28:27.320 align:middle line:84%
said like it was yesterday,
like it was half an hour ago.

01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's your own
inner board member--

01:28:30.010 --> 01:28:32.900 align:middle line:84%
in that case, your inner
masculine board member--

01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:36.740 align:middle line:84%
scripted and
programmed by your dad.

01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:41.073 align:middle line:84%
So the things that says to
you, a, are not your fault.

01:28:41.073 --> 01:28:42.740 align:middle line:84%
They're technically
not your dad's fault

01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:44.782 align:middle line:84%
either, because he wasn't
born talking like that.

01:28:44.782 --> 01:28:46.120 align:middle line:90%
He learned it from someone.

01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:48.500 align:middle line:84%
You inherit it like you inherit
your eye color, your hair

01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:51.170 align:middle line:84%
color, the foods
you eat at holiday,

01:28:51.170 --> 01:28:53.060 align:middle line:90%
what holidays you actually--

01:28:53.060 --> 01:28:55.730 align:middle line:90%
you inherit all these things.

01:28:55.730 --> 01:28:57.110 align:middle line:90%
And it's no one's fault.

01:28:57.110 --> 01:29:02.810 align:middle line:84%
But you get this thing, and
it is a voice within you,

01:29:02.810 --> 01:29:06.450 align:middle line:90%
and it has authority and power.

01:29:06.450 --> 01:29:13.820 align:middle line:84%
So if you can get the board to
even approve the authorization

01:29:13.820 --> 01:29:17.438 align:middle line:84%
to get yourself some
paints and paint,

01:29:17.438 --> 01:29:18.980 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes people
will think about it

01:29:18.980 --> 01:29:23.090 align:middle line:90%
and agonize over it for months.

01:29:23.090 --> 01:29:24.650 align:middle line:90%
It'll put it out.

01:29:24.650 --> 01:29:26.240 align:middle line:84%
Some emergency at
work will happen,

01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:28.922 align:middle line:84%
and they'll forget everything
for another six weeks.

01:29:28.922 --> 01:29:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll
finally get around

01:29:30.380 --> 01:29:32.380 align:middle line:84%
to some post-it they wrote
to themselves saying,

01:29:32.380 --> 01:29:33.860 align:middle line:84%
maybe I can start
painting again.

01:29:33.860 --> 01:29:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And even then, they'll push
it off three or four times.

01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Finally, they'll go
to the art store,

01:29:39.620 --> 01:29:43.160 align:middle line:84%
like, breaking out in hives
while they're doing it.

01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:46.010 align:middle line:84%
Pick up one canvas
and just one starter,

01:29:46.010 --> 01:29:48.030 align:middle line:90%
eight-color acrylic set.

01:29:48.030 --> 01:29:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And they'll bring it home,
they'll put it there,

01:29:50.030 --> 01:29:53.750 align:middle line:84%
and it will go untouched
for another two months.

01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:54.620 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

01:29:54.620 --> 01:29:56.230 align:middle line:84%
People are like,
what's the big deal?

01:29:56.230 --> 01:29:58.200 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing.

01:29:58.200 --> 01:29:59.905 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is,
it's not nothing.

01:29:59.905 --> 01:30:01.280 align:middle line:84%
You have this
artist board member

01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:03.590 align:middle line:90%
that's like, I just need to--

01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:04.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm turning blue.

01:30:04.550 --> 01:30:07.880 align:middle line:84%
I just need to loosen a little
bit to get a little bit of air.

01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:09.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
threaten the empire.

01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:11.538 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
threaten the status quo.

01:30:11.538 --> 01:30:13.240 align:middle line:90%
I just need a little bit of air.

01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And if not, I will
pull this lever that

01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:20.090 align:middle line:84%
will throw your back out
again so you're lying down

01:30:20.090 --> 01:30:22.400 align:middle line:84%
and I can really
work on you to, like,

01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:24.420 align:middle line:84%
at least get an easel
in your hospital bed.

01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:28.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm making this up, but
it's the physics of it.

01:30:28.250 --> 01:30:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And so there is this constant
back-and-forth debate,

01:30:34.970 --> 01:30:37.340 align:middle line:84%
because it's not just,
oh, rainbows and unicorns,

01:30:37.340 --> 01:30:38.180 align:middle line:90%
let the artist back.

01:30:38.180 --> 01:30:39.630 align:middle line:90%
It's like, let the artist back.

01:30:39.630 --> 01:30:42.240 align:middle line:90%
That's a big deal.

01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:45.500 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason she was
exiled in the first place.

01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:47.690 align:middle line:84%
It's because you have
this hanging sword of,

01:30:47.690 --> 01:30:49.820 align:middle line:90%
you will be unworthy of love.

01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:51.830 align:middle line:84%
You will disappoint
your parents,

01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:54.733 align:middle line:84%
you'll break their hearts, and
you'll be unworthy of love.

01:30:54.733 --> 01:30:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and by the
way, the spouse you

01:30:56.150 --> 01:30:57.920 align:middle line:84%
married on this
pretext of you will

01:30:57.920 --> 01:31:00.312 align:middle line:84%
be this banker or whatever,
she'll leave you too,

01:31:00.312 --> 01:31:01.520 align:middle line:90%
and you'll break your family.

01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:02.790 align:middle line:90%
You'll hurt your children.

01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:04.457 align:middle line:84%
They'll inherit the
wound going forward.

01:31:04.457 --> 01:31:06.770 align:middle line:90%
You'll fuck them up too.

01:31:06.770 --> 01:31:09.710 align:middle line:84%
It's not a trivial thing to
just go out and start painting

01:31:09.710 --> 01:31:12.230 align:middle line:90%
again.

01:31:12.230 --> 01:31:14.330 align:middle line:84%
So when people say, oh,
just follow your passions,

01:31:14.330 --> 01:31:15.830 align:middle line:84%
follow your bliss,
it's no big deal,

01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:17.955 align:middle line:84%
and they wag their fingers
at them, I'm like, dude,

01:31:17.955 --> 01:31:19.430 align:middle line:90%
don't do that.

01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:22.460 align:middle line:84%
It's not trivial to
do this, and it's not

01:31:22.460 --> 01:31:25.290 align:middle line:90%
a decision to be taken lightly.

01:31:25.290 --> 01:31:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, from my
corporate days, when

01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:32.490 align:middle line:84%
you have a conflict
at the board level,

01:31:32.490 --> 01:31:35.960 align:middle line:84%
the worst way to solve it is
through a brute force pissing

01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:41.530 align:middle line:84%
match, because you create
strife within the board.

01:31:41.530 --> 01:31:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And you lose sight of the fact
that we're all shareholders

01:31:44.710 --> 01:31:47.080 align:middle line:90%
in this entity.

01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:50.120 align:middle line:90%
We all want it to succeed.

01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And when we disagree,
it's not good

01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:55.330 align:middle line:90%
or evil or loving or malicious.

01:31:55.330 --> 01:32:00.400 align:middle line:84%
It is all loving and simply
in disagreement on areas where

01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:02.650 align:middle line:90%
reasonable minds will differ.

01:32:02.650 --> 01:32:04.630 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to lose love.

01:32:04.630 --> 01:32:07.390 align:middle line:84%
I also don't want to not express
my true meaning and purpose

01:32:07.390 --> 01:32:09.140 align:middle line:90%
in life.

01:32:09.140 --> 01:32:09.940 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:17.020 align:middle line:84%
So for me, what I am is
a boardroom consultant.

01:32:17.020 --> 01:32:18.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a board member.

01:32:18.970 --> 01:32:20.780 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a vote.

01:32:20.780 --> 01:32:22.420 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a vote.

01:32:22.420 --> 01:32:25.840 align:middle line:84%
But I do come in and
help people start talking

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:30.430 align:middle line:84%
to these parts of
themselves to basically say,

01:32:30.430 --> 01:32:33.250 align:middle line:84%
even if you get to the point
where you just draw the battle

01:32:33.250 --> 01:32:35.770 align:middle line:90%
lines--

01:32:35.770 --> 01:32:36.770 align:middle line:90%
like, we want money.

01:32:36.770 --> 01:32:38.500 align:middle line:90%
We want prestige.

01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:42.010 align:middle line:84%
We want comfort,
material comfort.

01:32:42.010 --> 01:32:45.250 align:middle line:84%
We want the ability
to shut dad up,

01:32:45.250 --> 01:32:47.800 align:middle line:84%
because now he's
asking us for money.

01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:48.670 align:middle line:90%
So that's nice.

01:32:48.670 --> 01:32:50.230 align:middle line:90%
Shuts the old man up, right?

01:32:50.230 --> 01:32:54.330 align:middle line:90%


01:32:54.330 --> 01:32:55.930 align:middle line:84%
But on the artist's
side, it's like, I

01:32:55.930 --> 01:32:59.480 align:middle line:84%
need to express
this, this, and this.

01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And if you are so afraid
of it that you only

01:33:01.870 --> 01:33:04.990 align:middle line:84%
take a fleeting
glance, it just looks

01:33:04.990 --> 01:33:11.050 align:middle line:84%
like the irresistible
force hitting

01:33:11.050 --> 01:33:13.360 align:middle line:90%
against the immovable object.

01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:16.150 align:middle line:84%
At 30,000 feet, that's
what it all looks like.

01:33:16.150 --> 01:33:18.790 align:middle line:84%
But if you give yourself
permission to say, look,

01:33:18.790 --> 01:33:19.750 align:middle line:90%
it's the F-16.

01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:21.710 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's-- it's my thing.

01:33:21.710 --> 01:33:23.230 align:middle line:90%
Let me just look at it.

01:33:23.230 --> 01:33:25.540 align:middle line:90%
It will be uncomfortable.

01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Because when you heal
something, it itches.

01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:30.550 align:middle line:90%
But that's a good sign.

01:33:30.550 --> 01:33:32.200 align:middle line:90%
It will be uncomfortable.

01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:34.420 align:middle line:84%
But when you get in there,
even drawing up the battle

01:33:34.420 --> 01:33:38.680 align:middle line:84%
lines is huge progress,
because then at least you

01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:40.390 align:middle line:84%
know what each
side wants, and you

01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:45.130 align:middle line:84%
can start the negotiation
and potential compromise.

01:33:45.130 --> 01:33:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And I've found
that there's always

01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:49.150 align:middle line:90%
a way to thread the needle.

01:33:49.150 --> 01:33:55.630 align:middle line:84%
I've never found a
case where it was not

01:33:55.630 --> 01:33:58.123 align:middle line:90%
possible to thread the needle.

01:33:58.123 --> 01:33:59.290 align:middle line:90%
And what I mean by that is--

01:33:59.290 --> 01:34:04.910 align:middle line:90%


01:34:04.910 --> 01:34:13.070 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen the dice
throw of the universe end

01:34:13.070 --> 01:34:18.350 align:middle line:84%
up where a person is
born into this world

01:34:18.350 --> 01:34:22.640 align:middle line:84%
and they're given a bliss that
is completely incompatible

01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:25.610 align:middle line:84%
with life, the
practicalities of life.

01:34:25.610 --> 01:34:26.450 align:middle line:90%
I've never seen it.

01:34:26.450 --> 01:34:28.980 align:middle line:90%


01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why the
occurrence and fulfillment

01:34:34.980 --> 01:34:38.820 align:middle line:84%
of bliss is so low in
humanity at this point--

01:34:38.820 --> 01:34:42.120 align:middle line:84%
and it just is what it
is; we are where we are--

01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:46.267 align:middle line:90%
is that we're shamed.

01:34:46.267 --> 01:34:48.600 align:middle line:84%
We're taught that if you look
at this, if you have this,

01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:49.975 align:middle line:84%
there's something
wrong with you.

01:34:49.975 --> 01:34:54.300 align:middle line:84%
There's something wrong-- we
come from seven generations

01:34:54.300 --> 01:34:56.460 align:middle line:90%
of bankers and lawyers.

01:34:56.460 --> 01:35:01.050 align:middle line:84%
Where did you come from,
this guitar-playing musician?

01:35:01.050 --> 01:35:03.640 align:middle line:90%


01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:04.680 align:middle line:90%
Are you even my son?

01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:07.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you look like
me, but I don't know.

01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:10.200 align:middle line:84%
What that's hiding
is there were also

01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:12.000 align:middle line:90%
seven generations of musicians.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:16.215 align:middle line:90%


01:35:16.215 --> 01:35:18.090 align:middle line:84%
We just don't talk about
that, and you're not

01:35:18.090 --> 01:35:19.340 align:middle line:90%
going to talk about it either.

01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:22.080 align:middle line:90%


01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:27.587 align:middle line:84%
So basically, we're taught
that if we have this bliss,

01:35:27.587 --> 01:35:28.920 align:middle line:90%
there's something wrong with us.

01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:29.720 align:middle line:90%
We will lose love.

01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:32.570 align:middle line:84%
There's all this
fear surrounding it,

01:35:32.570 --> 01:35:37.370 align:middle line:84%
so that we don't even look
at the sight of the wound

01:35:37.370 --> 01:35:41.190 align:middle line:84%
or area in question, what was
exiled, what was pushed off.

01:35:41.190 --> 01:35:44.030 align:middle line:90%
And that's 99% of the problem.

01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And the metaphor I always
use is, even a paper cut,

01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:53.880 align:middle line:84%
if you don't attend to it, and
let it get infected and fester,

01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:55.560 align:middle line:90%
even a paper cut can kill you.

01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:58.290 align:middle line:90%


01:35:58.290 --> 01:36:00.120 align:middle line:84%
It's like the
saying, the cover-up

01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:02.080 align:middle line:90%
is worse than the crime.

01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:05.250 align:middle line:84%
If the original thing was just
a paper cut, just look at it.

01:36:05.250 --> 01:36:06.915 align:middle line:90%
It's a little uncomfortable.

01:36:06.915 --> 01:36:08.040 align:middle line:90%
Put the right things on it.

01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:11.190 align:middle line:84%
Give it some air and light, and
it will just heal on its own.

01:36:11.190 --> 01:36:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, oh, I can make
gobs of money and do my bliss.

01:36:14.010 --> 01:36:16.923 align:middle line:90%
Haha, let's just do this.

01:36:16.923 --> 01:36:18.340 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't I think
of this before?

01:36:18.340 --> 01:36:19.620 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK,
bully, sit back down.

01:36:19.620 --> 01:36:20.420 align:middle line:90%
OK, sorry, sorry.

01:36:20.420 --> 01:36:21.700 align:middle line:90%
Let's just keep going.

01:36:21.700 --> 01:36:22.500 align:middle line:90%
Just keep going.

01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:23.300 align:middle line:90%
It's the feast.

01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:25.980 align:middle line:84%
All you can eat,
just keep eating.

01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:27.540 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's a bigger wound.

01:36:27.540 --> 01:36:29.610 align:middle line:84%
But that just needs a
little bit more stitching.

01:36:29.610 --> 01:36:34.980 align:middle line:84%
We have miles of thread,
suture, and needles.

01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:38.550 align:middle line:84%
It's the fear of looking at it
that makes even the smallest

01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:42.840 align:middle line:84%
incompatibilities flare up
into life and bliss and meaning

01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:48.960 align:middle line:84%
and purpose of life,
threatening conflagrations,

01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:49.890 align:middle line:90%
if that makes sense.

01:36:49.890 --> 01:36:52.470 align:middle line:90%


01:36:52.470 --> 01:36:55.733 align:middle line:84%
>> It is something
that we don't look at.

01:36:55.733 --> 01:36:57.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if
you speak to this,

01:36:57.150 --> 01:36:59.170 align:middle line:90%
but I think it is interesting.

01:36:59.170 --> 01:37:03.170 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people have this
sense of lack of self-worth,

01:37:03.170 --> 01:37:07.290 align:middle line:84%
a lack of self-love
from abandonment issues

01:37:07.290 --> 01:37:11.580 align:middle line:84%
or actually being abandoned,
or something significant

01:37:11.580 --> 01:37:13.470 align:middle line:90%
happening to them.

01:37:13.470 --> 01:37:17.550 align:middle line:84%
In that instance, do you
recommend a similar process

01:37:17.550 --> 01:37:20.520 align:middle line:84%
of analysis around it, like
going through and finding out,

01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:21.790 align:middle line:90%
well, that's my core wound.

01:37:21.790 --> 01:37:22.590 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's great.

01:37:22.590 --> 01:37:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And then how can I attend to
that on a needs by needs basis?

01:37:26.550 --> 01:37:28.220 align:middle line:90%
How do you approach that?

01:37:28.220 --> 01:37:29.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:33.130 align:middle line:90%


01:37:33.130 --> 01:37:34.960 align:middle line:84%
So one of the
things I tell people

01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:39.700 align:middle line:84%
is that the nature of what
I do, even in healing,

01:37:39.700 --> 01:37:40.990 align:middle line:90%
is just general advising.

01:37:40.990 --> 01:37:42.150 align:middle line:90%
It's not medical.

01:37:42.150 --> 01:37:44.000 align:middle line:90%
It's not any of that.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And often people will
say, after they've

01:37:47.230 --> 01:37:49.120 align:middle line:84%
done some of these
exercises, they're like,

01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:53.890 align:middle line:84%
I think I understand now
what therapy is meant to do.

01:37:53.890 --> 01:37:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think I want
to go to therapy.

01:37:55.690 --> 01:37:57.670 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, that's awesome.

01:37:57.670 --> 01:37:59.170 align:middle line:90%
Go do that.

01:37:59.170 --> 01:38:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'll give them some pointers
around, it's like speed-dating.

01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:04.960 align:middle line:84%
You need to try a
lot of different ones

01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:06.560 align:middle line:90%
to find the right chemistry.

01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:09.093 align:middle line:84%
So if the first therapist
you meet is like judgey

01:38:09.093 --> 01:38:11.260 align:middle line:84%
and you don't feel comfortable
with them, that's OK.

01:38:11.260 --> 01:38:11.890 align:middle line:90%
Keep going.

01:38:11.890 --> 01:38:12.690 align:middle line:90%
Keep looking.

01:38:12.690 --> 01:38:20.240 align:middle line:90%


01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:22.040 align:middle line:84%
So what I do is just
general advising

01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:25.890 align:middle line:84%
to give a different kind
of perspective on that.

01:38:25.890 --> 01:38:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And in the framework of lost
board members and things

01:38:28.580 --> 01:38:32.810 align:middle line:84%
like that, the way I
tend to think about it

01:38:32.810 --> 01:38:39.800 align:middle line:84%
is that when a traumatic
event happens--

01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:43.910 align:middle line:84%
at any point in life, but
especially in early life--

01:38:43.910 --> 01:38:47.050 align:middle line:90%


01:38:47.050 --> 01:38:51.370 align:middle line:84%
the key thing that is
the wound, to me, that

01:38:51.370 --> 01:38:55.900 align:middle line:84%
is the aspect that
is of most interest

01:38:55.900 --> 01:38:59.590 align:middle line:84%
to me and the advising work that
I do to get you back on track

01:38:59.590 --> 01:39:05.050 align:middle line:84%
to your bliss, is
the narrative that

01:39:05.050 --> 01:39:12.070 align:middle line:84%
emerges around this
thing that happens, where

01:39:12.070 --> 01:39:15.270 align:middle line:84%
any human being of any
age, their natural reaction

01:39:15.270 --> 01:39:17.330 align:middle line:90%
is like, what the hell was that?

01:39:17.330 --> 01:39:18.730 align:middle line:90%
What the hell just happened?

01:39:18.730 --> 01:39:21.250 align:middle line:90%


01:39:21.250 --> 01:39:26.280 align:middle line:84%
So as a child, it could be
an event that you witness.

01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:30.637 align:middle line:84%
It could be a trauma, an assault
that you are the victim of.

01:39:30.637 --> 01:39:32.470 align:middle line:84%
It could be just something
bad that happens.

01:39:32.470 --> 01:39:35.320 align:middle line:84%
You're a villager, and a
hurricane comes and destroys

01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:36.130 align:middle line:90%
the entire village.

01:39:36.130 --> 01:39:40.870 align:middle line:90%


01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:45.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's examples I'm
thinking of where, in one case,

01:39:45.310 --> 01:39:48.070 align:middle line:84%
the traumatic event
for an advisee of mine

01:39:48.070 --> 01:39:50.630 align:middle line:84%
was the fact that
at three years old--

01:39:50.630 --> 01:39:53.200 align:middle line:84%
and he didn't remember any of
this-- but at three years old,

01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:54.880 align:middle line:84%
he had to move
across the Atlantic

01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:57.880 align:middle line:84%
from Britain to
the United States

01:39:57.880 --> 01:39:59.230 align:middle line:90%
and was separated from a parent.

01:39:59.230 --> 01:40:02.020 align:middle line:84%
It was just two careers, and
they were working it out.

01:40:02.020 --> 01:40:05.982 align:middle line:84%
But that for him was
the traumatic event.

01:40:05.982 --> 01:40:07.690 align:middle line:84%
Even though he had no
recollection of it,

01:40:07.690 --> 01:40:09.065 align:middle line:84%
it was the narrative
that grew up

01:40:09.065 --> 01:40:15.230 align:middle line:84%
around this that became
the source of the wound.

01:40:15.230 --> 01:40:17.840 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't remember it.

01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:18.640 align:middle line:90%
It was a narrative.

01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:20.740 align:middle line:84%
But the narrative itself
was just as powerful.

01:40:20.740 --> 01:40:23.620 align:middle line:90%


01:40:23.620 --> 01:40:29.410 align:middle line:84%
Another example is a
man who, when he was 13,

01:40:29.410 --> 01:40:31.930 align:middle line:90%
his mother committed suicide.

01:40:31.930 --> 01:40:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And the day before,
she had asked

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:43.000 align:middle line:84%
him to show him how to use the
gun that she then the next day

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:44.530 align:middle line:90%
used to commit suicide.

01:40:44.530 --> 01:40:48.346 align:middle line:90%


01:40:48.346 --> 01:40:55.900 align:middle line:84%
He was a gun owner, a competent
marksman trained by his father.

01:40:55.900 --> 01:41:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And at 13, he bore
the burden of that.

01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:04.600 align:middle line:84%
All of the sort of power
and energy around that event

01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:08.540 align:middle line:84%
was in the narrative that
grows up around that,

01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:11.372 align:middle line:90%
where it's like, my mom--

01:41:11.372 --> 01:41:13.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can come up
with an infinite number

01:41:13.330 --> 01:41:14.920 align:middle line:90%
of permutations.

01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:18.510 align:middle line:84%
But on one extreme, you
could say, I was just 13.

01:41:18.510 --> 01:41:20.620 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know any better.

01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:24.010 align:middle line:84%
Your mom tells you to show her
how to work the can opener,

01:41:24.010 --> 01:41:26.482 align:middle line:90%
you do it.

01:41:26.482 --> 01:41:28.690 align:middle line:84%
You're a good son, your mom
loves you and everything,

01:41:28.690 --> 01:41:32.640 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to like,
I helped kill my mom.

01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:33.440 align:middle line:90%
That was me.

01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:34.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm a bad person.

01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:35.950 align:middle line:90%
There's something wrong with me.

01:41:35.950 --> 01:41:37.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm too gullible.

01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:40.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm too stupid, and I'm
not looking out for things

01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:43.220 align:middle line:90%
that I need to be aware of.

01:41:43.220 --> 01:41:45.250 align:middle line:90%
And so for me--

01:41:45.250 --> 01:41:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So really, to add to this,
because this is interesting,

01:41:48.370 --> 01:41:50.190 align:middle line:90%
narrative is meaning, right?

01:41:50.190 --> 01:41:51.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:54.618 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're appending a
meaning to a situation,

01:41:54.618 --> 01:41:55.660 align:middle line:90%
whether it's true or not.

01:41:55.660 --> 01:41:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And then we live
our lives by that.

01:41:56.830 --> 01:41:57.630 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

01:41:57.630 --> 01:41:59.450 align:middle line:84%
Can you connect the
meaning/narrative thing

01:41:59.450 --> 01:42:00.250 align:middle line:90%
together?

01:42:00.250 --> 01:42:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, from the perspective
of the board of directors,

01:42:04.370 --> 01:42:05.170 align:middle line:90%
that's your intel.

01:42:05.170 --> 01:42:07.947 align:middle line:90%


01:42:07.947 --> 01:42:09.280 align:middle line:90%
So we're the board of directors.

01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:11.830 align:middle line:84%
We will defend, hell
or high water, you,

01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:16.210 align:middle line:84%
your path in life, your safety,
security, your prestige--

01:42:16.210 --> 01:42:19.900 align:middle line:90%
all of the Maslow kind of--

01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:21.530 align:middle line:90%
survival, security.

01:42:21.530 --> 01:42:22.330 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

01:42:22.330 --> 01:42:24.670 align:middle line:84%
Relationships,
prestige, and some form

01:42:24.670 --> 01:42:26.483 align:middle line:90%
of personal development.

01:42:26.483 --> 01:42:28.900 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take care of
all those basic needs for you,

01:42:28.900 --> 01:42:30.800 align:middle line:90%
no matter what.

01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And now we're
scanning the horizon.

01:42:32.450 --> 01:42:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Oh, this huge
mushroom cloud just

01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:39.130 align:middle line:84%
went off over there in the
form of some traumatic event.

01:42:39.130 --> 01:42:41.260 align:middle line:90%
That impacts us.

01:42:41.260 --> 01:42:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And we need to
understand, we need

01:42:44.050 --> 01:42:48.560 align:middle line:84%
to come up with a narrative
of what the hell happened,

01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:51.020 align:middle line:84%
why it happened, and
what our role was

01:42:51.020 --> 01:42:54.850 align:middle line:84%
in it to make sure we come
up with a contingency plan

01:42:54.850 --> 01:42:58.900 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that shit
never happens again.

01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:01.920 align:middle line:90%
That's the job of the board.

01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Economic recession-- that's
definitely bad for us.

01:43:05.350 --> 01:43:07.463 align:middle line:84%
How do we make sure
we don't contribute

01:43:07.463 --> 01:43:08.380 align:middle line:90%
to the next recession?

01:43:08.380 --> 01:43:09.090 align:middle line:90%
It's absurd.

01:43:09.090 --> 01:43:10.070 align:middle line:90%
You have no control over it.

01:43:10.070 --> 01:43:12.290 align:middle line:84%
But it's like, maybe we'll
consult with the president

01:43:12.290 --> 01:43:14.260 align:middle line:84%
and put our cronies
in Congress and make

01:43:14.260 --> 01:43:16.420 align:middle line:84%
sure they pass the
right laws to make

01:43:16.420 --> 01:43:19.130 align:middle line:90%
sure this never happens again.

01:43:19.130 --> 01:43:26.020 align:middle line:84%
So narrative becomes
the intel by which

01:43:26.020 --> 01:43:29.110 align:middle line:84%
the board runs your
company and navigates

01:43:29.110 --> 01:43:30.900 align:middle line:90%
the path of your life.

01:43:30.900 --> 01:43:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is a human
phenomenon, right?

01:43:32.830 --> 01:43:36.610 align:middle line:90%
So forget about children.

01:43:36.610 --> 01:43:40.920 align:middle line:84%
Grown adults,
members of a tribe--

01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:45.750 align:middle line:84%
a hurricane comes by twice a
year and wipes out the village.

01:43:45.750 --> 01:43:48.760 align:middle line:84%
If you and I are in that
village, how would we react?

01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:49.560 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah, whatever.

01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:51.260 align:middle line:90%
That happens every six months.

01:43:51.260 --> 01:43:52.060 align:middle line:90%
No big deal.

01:43:52.060 --> 01:43:53.352 align:middle line:90%
Let's just rebuild the village.

01:43:53.352 --> 01:43:54.840 align:middle line:90%
Hell no.

01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:58.620 align:middle line:84%
We're like, we have to
come up with a narrative.

01:43:58.620 --> 01:44:00.030 align:middle line:90%
The gods are angry with us.

01:44:00.030 --> 01:44:01.710 align:middle line:90%
We need to sacrifice more.

01:44:01.710 --> 01:44:05.160 align:middle line:84%
The next village's
shaman did a thing on us.

01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:07.800 align:middle line:90%
We gotta go take care of him.

01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:10.610 align:middle line:84%
We must come up
with a narrative,

01:44:10.610 --> 01:44:15.990 align:middle line:84%
because in the absence of that
narrative we have no control.

01:44:15.990 --> 01:44:18.340 align:middle line:84%
If we have no control,
we're unshielded.

01:44:18.340 --> 01:44:21.090 align:middle line:84%
We're unsoothed,
and a lightning bolt

01:44:21.090 --> 01:44:23.090 align:middle line:84%
can hit us at any time--
which is actually true.

01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:24.600 align:middle line:84%
A lightning bolt can
hit you at any time.

01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:26.225 align:middle line:84%
But we come up with
a narrative saying,

01:44:26.225 --> 01:44:29.580 align:middle line:84%
oh, it's more dangerous riding
in your car, so don't worry.

01:44:29.580 --> 01:44:31.500 align:middle line:84%
Even lightning bolt,
which will never happen,

01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:32.958 align:middle line:84%
we have to come up
with a narrative

01:44:32.958 --> 01:44:34.573 align:middle line:90%
to soothe and shield ourselves.

01:44:34.573 --> 01:44:35.490 align:middle line:90%
This is a human thing.

01:44:35.490 --> 01:44:37.290 align:middle line:90%
Similarly then, as a child--

01:44:37.290 --> 01:44:40.260 align:middle line:90%


01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:44.100 align:middle line:84%
as a child, you're
also not stupid.

01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Parents are all the time
like, I don't get how

01:44:46.980 --> 01:44:48.280 align:middle line:90%
my kid understands all this.

01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:49.340 align:middle line:90%
You're explaining this to me.

01:44:49.340 --> 01:44:50.140 align:middle line:90%
I was like, no way.

01:44:50.140 --> 01:44:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And then I tell them, you're
loved unconditionally,

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:54.750 align:middle line:84%
and they understand,
and they brighten up,

01:44:54.750 --> 01:44:56.570 align:middle line:84%
and all these things
just fall away.

01:44:56.570 --> 01:44:57.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't even understand.

01:44:57.570 --> 01:44:59.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, dude, he's your kid.

01:44:59.730 --> 01:45:01.410 align:middle line:90%
Did you go to Princeton or what?

01:45:01.410 --> 01:45:06.780 align:middle line:84%
He is smart like
you, and it's OK.

01:45:06.780 --> 01:45:08.610 align:middle line:84%
So kids are going
to be like this too.

01:45:08.610 --> 01:45:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And when something bad
happens in their life--

01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:15.210 align:middle line:84%
my mom commits suicide, I
get moved across the Atlantic

01:45:15.210 --> 01:45:18.060 align:middle line:90%
against my will--

01:45:18.060 --> 01:45:21.240 align:middle line:84%
they can't just take it
as a random occurrence.

01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:24.060 align:middle line:90%
It's too frightening.

01:45:24.060 --> 01:45:27.120 align:middle line:84%
They have to come
up with a narrative.

01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And in my experience, my kind
of unprofessional observation

01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:34.890 align:middle line:84%
of these things,
what I notice is

01:45:34.890 --> 01:45:36.900 align:middle line:84%
that the narrative
that a child comes up

01:45:36.900 --> 01:45:40.470 align:middle line:84%
with in the absence of
guidance from the elder

01:45:40.470 --> 01:45:44.100 align:middle line:90%
is almost always self-negative.

01:45:44.100 --> 01:45:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And when I've talked actually
to children and I've talked

01:45:47.850 --> 01:45:51.240 align:middle line:84%
to grown-ups and asked them
why they came up with that

01:45:51.240 --> 01:45:53.940 align:middle line:84%
narrative when
they were children,

01:45:53.940 --> 01:46:01.450 align:middle line:84%
what I've pieced together
is that if there is a choice

01:46:01.450 --> 01:46:06.490 align:middle line:84%
between a narrative where I had
no control versus I had some

01:46:06.490 --> 01:46:11.770 align:middle line:84%
control, I will always-- because
I'm smart and I'm capable

01:46:11.770 --> 01:46:15.070 align:middle line:84%
intrinsically, because
I'm not an idiot--

01:46:15.070 --> 01:46:18.010 align:middle line:84%
I will always skew
toward the narrative that

01:46:18.010 --> 01:46:21.340 align:middle line:90%
put more control in my hands.

01:46:21.340 --> 01:46:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I prefer that is
because it gives me something

01:46:24.250 --> 01:46:31.180 align:middle line:84%
to do to make me feel like I'm
preventing the next occurrence.

01:46:31.180 --> 01:46:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's rubbing
my lucky rabbit's foot

01:46:33.250 --> 01:46:36.580 align:middle line:84%
or putting baby powder
on my hockey stick,

01:46:36.580 --> 01:46:38.560 align:middle line:84%
I need something to
do to feel like I'm

01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:40.102 align:middle line:90%
at least doing something.

01:46:40.102 --> 01:46:43.040 align:middle line:90%


01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:46.000 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're like, well, it's
not true, it doesn't matter.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.190 align:middle line:84%
Given the choice between,
yeah, can't do anything.

01:46:48.190 --> 01:46:48.990 align:middle line:90%
Could happen again.

01:46:48.990 --> 01:46:51.358 align:middle line:84%
Any minute, you could be
eating your chocolate pudding

01:46:51.358 --> 01:46:52.400 align:middle line:90%
and it could just happen.

01:46:52.400 --> 01:46:53.260 align:middle line:90%
It's like, fuck, OK.

01:46:53.260 --> 01:46:54.888 align:middle line:84%
That's not the world
I want to live in.

01:46:54.888 --> 01:46:57.430 align:middle line:84%
I want to live in a world where
I can do something to prevent

01:46:57.430 --> 01:46:59.590 align:middle line:90%
these things from happening.

01:46:59.590 --> 01:47:01.120 align:middle line:90%
I will choose that.

01:47:01.120 --> 01:47:03.430 align:middle line:90%
And in these bad instances--

01:47:03.430 --> 01:47:05.590 align:middle line:84%
the kid whose mom
killed themself

01:47:05.590 --> 01:47:08.410 align:middle line:84%
with the gun he showed
her how to use--

01:47:08.410 --> 01:47:10.690 align:middle line:84%
what is the narrative
where he has control,

01:47:10.690 --> 01:47:13.630 align:middle line:84%
where it's like, no, I was just
this helpless kid and my mom

01:47:13.630 --> 01:47:15.645 align:middle line:90%
like--

01:47:15.645 --> 01:47:17.770 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of things my
mom shouldn't have done.

01:47:17.770 --> 01:47:21.130 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things is that
she shouldn't have used me

01:47:21.130 --> 01:47:22.360 align:middle line:90%
as a means to helping her.

01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:25.067 align:middle line:90%


01:47:25.067 --> 01:47:25.900 align:middle line:90%
Putting that on her.

01:47:25.900 --> 01:47:30.493 align:middle line:84%
Or putting it on me, it's
like, if I had paid attention,

01:47:30.493 --> 01:47:32.910 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have shown her and
I would have gone to my dad.

01:47:32.910 --> 01:47:36.310 align:middle line:90%


01:47:36.310 --> 01:47:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why a kid,
in the absence of guidance,

01:47:38.590 --> 01:47:42.010 align:middle line:84%
will pick that is because it
gives his board of directors

01:47:42.010 --> 01:47:45.070 align:middle line:84%
something to do to
prevent the next one.

01:47:45.070 --> 01:47:51.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, the very painful and
damaging byproduct of that

01:47:51.250 --> 01:47:55.720 align:middle line:84%
is that it puts
the blame on him,

01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:59.870 align:middle line:84%
because the price of
control is responsibility.

01:47:59.870 --> 01:48:02.605 align:middle line:84%
So to protect myself, I'm
going to take on the narrative

01:48:02.605 --> 01:48:03.480 align:middle line:90%
where I have control.

01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:08.230 align:middle line:84%
Then it's like, fucking
it was partly my fault.

01:48:08.230 --> 01:48:11.890 align:middle line:90%
And then that is a wound.

01:48:11.890 --> 01:48:17.600 align:middle line:84%
Because if I caused that, then
there's something in my board.

01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:22.780 align:middle line:84%
And in that case, it might be
inattentiveness, incompetence,

01:48:22.780 --> 01:48:28.030 align:middle line:90%
non-vigilance, gullibility.

01:48:28.030 --> 01:48:31.270 align:middle line:84%
Those board members will
all get shunted down

01:48:31.270 --> 01:48:36.000 align:middle line:84%
to the lowest level of
Guantanamo prison, right?

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:40.180 align:middle line:90%
And not unreasonably.

01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And that boy's compass
will be calibrated 15%

01:48:44.650 --> 01:48:47.380 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is, and he'll go
through life until he's like,

01:48:47.380 --> 01:48:52.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm nowhere near where I need
to be and I don't even know why.

01:48:52.300 --> 01:48:55.600 align:middle line:90%


01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:58.195 align:middle line:84%
So for me, even
traumatic events--

01:48:58.195 --> 01:49:02.530 align:middle line:90%


01:49:02.530 --> 01:49:05.500 align:middle line:84%
if there's trauma,
narrative absolutely

01:49:05.500 --> 01:49:09.887 align:middle line:84%
has to rise up around that,
because you can't ignore it.

01:49:09.887 --> 01:49:12.220 align:middle line:84%
This Eiffel Tower emerges out
of the ground next to you.

01:49:12.220 --> 01:49:15.940 align:middle line:84%
You have to talk about it
and explain it somehow.

01:49:15.940 --> 01:49:19.210 align:middle line:84%
But in the absence
of trauma, you

01:49:19.210 --> 01:49:21.480 align:middle line:84%
don't need a trauma to come
up with your narrative.

01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:23.410 align:middle line:90%
It's like, put this mask on.

01:49:23.410 --> 01:49:25.300 align:middle line:90%
No, James, put it back on.

01:49:25.300 --> 01:49:27.290 align:middle line:90%
No, I can see it's off.

01:49:27.290 --> 01:49:28.590 align:middle line:90%
Put it back on.

01:49:28.590 --> 01:49:31.660 align:middle line:90%
Cut your hair.

01:49:31.660 --> 01:49:34.003 align:middle line:84%
And you're trying all--
and it's like, oh, fine.

01:49:34.003 --> 01:49:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And then a narrative
will come up right there.

01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:40.360 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be trauma,
but trauma is definitely

01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:46.120 align:middle line:84%
an exceptional case in my
travels what I've seen.

01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:48.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

01:49:48.340 --> 01:49:51.100 align:middle line:84%
There are a few other things
I want to speak to at the end

01:49:51.100 --> 01:49:56.440 align:middle line:84%
here, which is sort of
really about wrapping up

01:49:56.440 --> 01:49:58.390 align:middle line:84%
vision, mission, next
step, because we've

01:49:58.390 --> 01:50:00.070 align:middle line:90%
covered a lot of time here.

01:50:00.070 --> 01:50:01.600 align:middle line:84%
So I want to be
respectful of that.

01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And you touched on this a
little bit at the start.

01:50:04.870 --> 01:50:06.220 align:middle line:90%
How do we solve this problem?

01:50:06.220 --> 01:50:07.300 align:middle line:90%
I hear these stories.

01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:08.740 align:middle line:90%
I speak with parenting experts.

01:50:08.740 --> 01:50:11.260 align:middle line:84%
I speak with psychologists,
psychiatrists.

01:50:11.260 --> 01:50:13.030 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, oh my goodness.

01:50:13.030 --> 01:50:15.190 align:middle line:84%
We just need to become
conscious parents

01:50:15.190 --> 01:50:18.580 align:middle line:84%
and raise children that don't
have any lack of self-worth.

01:50:18.580 --> 01:50:20.260 align:middle line:84%
But then you can't
always do that,

01:50:20.260 --> 01:50:22.120 align:middle line:84%
because they come up
with their own reasons

01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:23.990 align:middle line:84%
to find a lack of
self-worth, right?

01:50:23.990 --> 01:50:24.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:50:24.790 --> 01:50:27.415 align:middle line:84%
>> But then there's meditation,
which you can quiet the chatter

01:50:27.415 --> 01:50:31.210 align:middle line:84%
and start to tap into that more
internal wellspring of peace,

01:50:31.210 --> 01:50:33.490 align:middle line:84%
love, and energy that
resides within all of us,

01:50:33.490 --> 01:50:35.350 align:middle line:84%
which is more of the
spiritual ideology.

01:50:35.350 --> 01:50:38.652 align:middle line:84%
So speaking to all of
this, in your opinion--

01:50:38.652 --> 01:50:41.110 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not going to ask for
a professional opinion or this

01:50:41.110 --> 01:50:41.260 align:middle line:90%
or that.

01:50:41.260 --> 01:50:42.760 align:middle line:84%
Just in your
experience and opinion,

01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:47.200 align:middle line:84%
how do you think we start
to evolve as a species

01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:49.840 align:middle line:84%
to really go, oh,
actually, I am pure love.

01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:50.740 align:middle line:90%
I am pure light.

01:50:50.740 --> 01:50:52.960 align:middle line:84%
I am divinity, as
is everybody else.

01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And in that knowledge,
we can start

01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:57.580 align:middle line:84%
to be more
compassionate to others

01:50:57.580 --> 01:50:59.680 align:middle line:84%
and help them to not
develop the wounds

01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:01.600 align:middle line:90%
that we've sort of carried?

01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:02.650 align:middle line:90%
Is that a possibility?

01:51:02.650 --> 01:51:03.920 align:middle line:90%
Is that your vision?

01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:05.890 align:middle line:84%
Or is it more of a
bliss-based ideology

01:51:05.890 --> 01:51:08.680 align:middle line:84%
where people move towards
bliss through meditation,

01:51:08.680 --> 01:51:10.850 align:middle line:84%
chanting, whatever it
is, and then they go,

01:51:10.850 --> 01:51:14.080 align:middle line:84%
oh my goodness, I can
be that person now?

01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:16.330 align:middle line:84%
How do you think we get out
of this mess, essentially,

01:51:16.330 --> 01:51:18.550 align:middle line:84%
and sort of
self-evolved to a place

01:51:18.550 --> 01:51:21.750 align:middle line:84%
where we can operate as better
quality humans on this planet?

01:51:21.750 --> 01:51:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm, thank you for that.

01:51:25.370 --> 01:51:32.860 align:middle line:84%
So for me, there's really
only one thing out of which

01:51:32.860 --> 01:51:36.550 align:middle line:90%
bliss itself will emerge.

01:51:36.550 --> 01:51:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And that is that sort of the
deeper and deeper understanding

01:51:52.900 --> 01:51:59.810 align:middle line:84%
that I as a person,
whoever you are--

01:51:59.810 --> 01:52:03.620 align:middle line:84%
it's not even that
I'm worthy of love.

01:52:03.620 --> 01:52:09.020 align:middle line:84%
I am actually loved without
condition, period, full stop.

01:52:09.020 --> 01:52:11.720 align:middle line:90%


01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:15.770 align:middle line:90%
There is no condition.

01:52:15.770 --> 01:52:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's the only switch
that needs to be flipped.

01:52:21.540 --> 01:52:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And the two things
I'll say with that

01:52:25.100 --> 01:52:27.440 align:middle line:84%
are an example of
what that means

01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:30.680 align:middle line:84%
to be loved unconditionally,
and then once you

01:52:30.680 --> 01:52:33.500 align:middle line:84%
have that, how that starts
to change things around you.

01:52:33.500 --> 01:52:37.370 align:middle line:90%


01:52:37.370 --> 01:52:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Many years ago when I was
walking with my daughter after

01:52:40.790 --> 01:52:45.418 align:middle line:84%
dinner, we would have this
habit of doing one-on-one walks

01:52:45.418 --> 01:52:46.960 align:middle line:84%
for like an hour or
two after dinner,

01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:49.542 align:middle line:84%
like three or four
times a week actually--

01:52:49.542 --> 01:52:53.590 align:middle line:90%


01:52:53.590 --> 01:52:56.860 align:middle line:84%
I would ask her these questions,
just to calibrate and see

01:52:56.860 --> 01:52:58.090 align:middle line:90%
where she was at.

01:52:58.090 --> 01:53:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, you get that
I love you without condition,

01:53:04.870 --> 01:53:05.670 align:middle line:90%
right?

01:53:05.670 --> 01:53:06.790 align:middle line:90%
She's like, yeah, dad, yeah.

01:53:06.790 --> 01:53:08.650 align:middle line:84%
Because my kids, they roll
their eyes at this stuff.

01:53:08.650 --> 01:53:09.525 align:middle line:90%
They hear it so much.

01:53:09.525 --> 01:53:11.950 align:middle line:90%


01:53:11.950 --> 01:53:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, so
I mean, you know

01:53:14.680 --> 01:53:19.840 align:middle line:84%
that that means if you get
straight F's on your report

01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:24.580 align:middle line:84%
card, you drop out of school
and you're a street person,

01:53:24.580 --> 01:53:27.775 align:middle line:90%
you don't lose any love.

01:53:27.775 --> 01:53:29.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm worried about your
safety and everything,

01:53:29.650 --> 01:53:31.810 align:middle line:90%
but you don't lose any love.

01:53:31.810 --> 01:53:34.395 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter if you fail.

01:53:34.395 --> 01:53:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And she's like,
yeah, I got that.

01:53:35.770 --> 01:53:36.570 align:middle line:90%
I got that.

01:53:36.570 --> 01:53:38.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm good.

01:53:38.050 --> 01:53:39.760 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, OK.

01:53:39.760 --> 01:53:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, do you get the converse,
where if you get straight A's--

01:53:46.150 --> 01:53:48.280 align:middle line:84%
ace everything, get into
all the best schools,

01:53:48.280 --> 01:53:51.070 align:middle line:90%
and win the Nobel Prize--

01:53:51.070 --> 01:53:52.420 align:middle line:90%
your stock price doesn't go up?

01:53:52.420 --> 01:53:55.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't love you any
more, because your love

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.470 align:middle line:90%
is unconditional.

01:53:56.470 --> 01:54:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And she was like
[MIMICS EXPLOSION]

01:54:01.690 --> 01:54:03.730 align:middle line:90%
So it's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:54:03.730 --> 01:54:10.780 align:middle line:84%
If you don't get into Harvard,
as an example, or Stanford,

01:54:10.780 --> 01:54:13.290 align:middle line:90%
you don't lose any love.

01:54:13.290 --> 01:54:17.100 align:middle line:84%
But if you do get in,
you don't gain any love,

01:54:17.100 --> 01:54:20.760 align:middle line:90%
because love is not conditional.

01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:21.960 align:middle line:90%
It's not a stock price.

01:54:21.960 --> 01:54:22.930 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't go down.

01:54:22.930 --> 01:54:25.320 align:middle line:90%
It also doesn't go up.

01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:28.670 align:middle line:90%
I already would die for you.

01:54:28.670 --> 01:54:31.680 align:middle line:90%
It's maxed without condition.

01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:33.852 align:middle line:90%
Similarly, I'll ask my son.

01:54:33.852 --> 01:54:36.060 align:middle line:84%
I'll ask him every now and
then still just for kicks.

01:54:36.060 --> 01:54:40.150 align:middle line:84%
But when he was younger, we
would be doing all this stuff

01:54:40.150 --> 01:54:40.950 align:middle line:90%
for him.

01:54:40.950 --> 01:54:42.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm basically his butler.

01:54:42.040 --> 01:54:43.420 align:middle line:84%
I'll cook for him
and everything.

01:54:43.420 --> 01:54:44.980 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, how you doing?

01:54:44.980 --> 01:54:45.780 align:middle line:90%
Do you feel loved?

01:54:45.780 --> 01:54:47.155 align:middle line:84%
He's like, oh
yeah, I feel loved.

01:54:47.155 --> 01:54:49.710 align:middle line:84%
He's eating his mac
and cheese or whatever.

01:54:49.710 --> 01:54:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And when he was younger, I would
say, I'm glad you feel loved.

01:54:55.530 --> 01:55:01.020 align:middle line:84%
So do you know what you
need to be doing in order

01:55:01.020 --> 01:55:05.430 align:middle line:90%
to continue having this love?

01:55:05.430 --> 01:55:08.710 align:middle line:90%
And he was like, what?

01:55:08.710 --> 01:55:12.780 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, nothing.

01:55:12.780 --> 01:55:14.930 align:middle line:90%
You don't earn your love.

01:55:14.930 --> 01:55:17.760 align:middle line:90%
You get it.

01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And a big smile cracked
across his face.

01:55:21.540 --> 01:55:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And now of course,
he's a teenager.

01:55:24.180 --> 01:55:26.938 align:middle line:84%
So when I even dare to voice
it, I'm like, do you know?

01:55:26.938 --> 01:55:27.980 align:middle line:90%
He's like, yeah, nothing.

01:55:27.980 --> 01:55:30.600 align:middle line:90%


01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:32.050 align:middle line:90%
Which is really annoying.

01:55:32.050 --> 01:55:37.050 align:middle line:84%
But that's exactly where
you want them to be.

01:55:37.050 --> 01:55:39.930 align:middle line:84%
So when you realize your
love is unconditional--

01:55:39.930 --> 01:55:44.100 align:middle line:84%
and when I teach, there's
like 50 different ways

01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:47.910 align:middle line:84%
of trying to reach in and flip
the switch within any given

01:55:47.910 --> 01:55:53.040 align:middle line:84%
advisee, because there's a lot
of defenses and countervailing

01:55:53.040 --> 01:55:55.380 align:middle line:84%
knowledge and
teaching and scripting

01:55:55.380 --> 01:55:57.360 align:middle line:84%
and conditioning
that's against that.

01:55:57.360 --> 01:56:00.265 align:middle line:84%
But once you can
reach in and kind of

01:56:00.265 --> 01:56:01.890 align:middle line:84%
help the person flip
that switch, where

01:56:01.890 --> 01:56:04.615 align:middle line:90%
they realize the reality--

01:56:04.615 --> 01:56:06.990 align:middle line:84%
or even where they're like,
oh my gosh, I'm out of ideas.

01:56:06.990 --> 01:56:08.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going to hurt myself.

01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:10.660 align:middle line:84%
Even that is out of a
misguided sense of self-love.

01:56:10.660 --> 01:56:14.620 align:middle line:90%


01:56:14.620 --> 01:56:17.950 align:middle line:90%
That's what that feels like.

01:56:17.950 --> 01:56:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And then from that
feeling, the way

01:56:21.670 --> 01:56:27.280 align:middle line:84%
that changes the physics
of your life is that--

01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:30.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a very
fundamental level,

01:56:30.940 --> 01:56:35.290 align:middle line:84%
you're, first of all,
not afraid of anything.

01:56:35.290 --> 01:56:37.690 align:middle line:84%
Because if I quit my job
and I don't make any money,

01:56:37.690 --> 01:56:40.520 align:middle line:84%
it means, well, I'm
making less money,

01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:42.790 align:middle line:84%
so I need to tighten my
belt. For most people,

01:56:42.790 --> 01:56:45.400 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't mean they'll starve.

01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And even if they do
starve, friends, family,

01:56:49.810 --> 01:56:51.640 align:middle line:84%
the government,
whatever-- typically,

01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:55.570 align:middle line:84%
there's a level of money below
which all the shame factors

01:56:55.570 --> 01:56:59.320 align:middle line:84%
and loss of love kick in, which
is way above what you actually

01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:01.620 align:middle line:90%
need to live and survive.

01:57:01.620 --> 01:57:02.500 align:middle line:90%
That delta is fine.

01:57:02.500 --> 01:57:04.310 align:middle line:84%
It's fine to have
that difference there.

01:57:04.310 --> 01:57:12.580 align:middle line:84%
But the key is that
the things you do out

01:57:12.580 --> 01:57:17.090 align:middle line:90%
of a fear of loss of love--

01:57:17.090 --> 01:57:19.250 align:middle line:84%
when you truly flip
the switch to say,

01:57:19.250 --> 01:57:22.810 align:middle line:84%
actually, it's not possible
for me to lose love--

01:57:22.810 --> 01:57:25.610 align:middle line:90%


01:57:25.610 --> 01:57:30.440 align:middle line:84%
all the things you were
doing based on that fear

01:57:30.440 --> 01:57:33.410 align:middle line:90%
instantly fall away.

01:57:33.410 --> 01:57:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And if we go back to
soothing and shielding,

01:57:35.900 --> 01:57:37.520 align:middle line:90%
let's just look at the list--

01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:42.500 align:middle line:84%
money and prestige,
perfectionism, anger,

01:57:42.500 --> 01:57:54.260 align:middle line:84%
invisibility, people-pleasing,
sex and drugs, shopping,

01:57:54.260 --> 01:57:58.610 align:middle line:84%
alcohol, unhealthy sex
and relationships--

01:57:58.610 --> 01:58:01.830 align:middle line:90%
all those things fall away.

01:58:01.830 --> 01:58:03.830 align:middle line:84%
Actually, at a business
school talk I was doing,

01:58:03.830 --> 01:58:08.210 align:middle line:84%
someone circled a number of the
items on soothing and shielding

01:58:08.210 --> 01:58:10.400 align:middle line:84%
and said, what I've
just circled constitutes

01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:15.710 align:middle line:84%
around 85% of US gross
domestic product.

01:58:15.710 --> 01:58:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, yeah,
and I'm OK with that.

01:58:18.350 --> 01:58:19.850 align:middle line:84%
I love the world
without condition.

01:58:19.850 --> 01:58:21.380 align:middle line:90%
I love it as it is.

01:58:21.380 --> 01:58:25.130 align:middle line:90%
I play the ball as it lies.

01:58:25.130 --> 01:58:27.800 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is,
because that's the case--

01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:30.350 align:middle line:90%
the world is driven by fear--

01:58:30.350 --> 01:58:32.723 align:middle line:84%
when you flip the switch
within yourself to realize,

01:58:32.723 --> 01:58:33.890 align:middle line:90%
actually, I can't lose love.

01:58:33.890 --> 01:58:35.932 align:middle line:84%
I can bang my head against
the wall all day long,

01:58:35.932 --> 01:58:38.870 align:middle line:90%
I can't lose love.

01:58:38.870 --> 01:58:42.653 align:middle line:84%
All the things you
were doing fall away,

01:58:42.653 --> 01:58:44.320 align:middle line:84%
because you were doing
that out of fear.

01:58:44.320 --> 01:58:48.190 align:middle line:84%
You realize, 80% of my life,
I'm doing things out of fear.

01:58:48.190 --> 01:58:52.532 align:middle line:84%
All those things fall away, and
then you shift into neutral.

01:58:52.532 --> 01:58:54.490 align:middle line:84%
There's typically a two-
or three-week period--

01:58:54.490 --> 01:58:58.720 align:middle line:84%
for some people longer,
which is delicious--

01:58:58.720 --> 01:59:02.530 align:middle line:84%
where they're sitting
there and they're like,

01:59:02.530 --> 01:59:04.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm not doing anything.

01:59:04.810 --> 01:59:06.630 align:middle line:90%
I've lost all motivation.

01:59:06.630 --> 01:59:11.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm going into work like Neo,
Keanu Reeves in "The Matrix."

01:59:11.700 --> 01:59:14.380 align:middle line:84%
He's, like, fighting
kung fu with one hand

01:59:14.380 --> 01:59:15.880 align:middle line:90%
and still pulling in the money.

01:59:15.880 --> 01:59:17.047 align:middle line:90%
He's still getting promoted.

01:59:17.047 --> 01:59:18.060 align:middle line:90%
Everything's fine.

01:59:18.060 --> 01:59:19.060 align:middle line:90%
He's not driven by fear.

01:59:19.060 --> 01:59:20.260 align:middle line:90%
He's just phoning it in.

01:59:20.260 --> 01:59:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And everyone still
gathers around him,

01:59:22.450 --> 01:59:24.324 align:middle line:84%
because there's this
weird light around him

01:59:24.324 --> 01:59:27.340 align:middle line:84%
now, because he's
impervious to fear.

01:59:27.340 --> 01:59:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And people smell that
and gather around you.

01:59:29.220 --> 01:59:32.260 align:middle line:90%


01:59:32.260 --> 01:59:36.180 align:middle line:84%
But they're like, it's like
I've lost all motivation.

01:59:36.180 --> 01:59:37.594 align:middle line:90%
And I'm just sitting here.

01:59:37.594 --> 01:59:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Everything's fine, and I
kind of don't give a shit.

01:59:40.370 --> 01:59:41.170 align:middle line:90%
Is this OK?

01:59:41.170 --> 01:59:42.090 align:middle line:90%
There's something wrong with me.

01:59:42.090 --> 01:59:43.048 align:middle line:90%
And of course, it's me.

01:59:43.048 --> 01:59:46.130 align:middle line:84%
So I'm like, no, there's
nothing wrong with you.

01:59:46.130 --> 01:59:50.950 align:middle line:84%
But what has happened is
you've lost your fear.

01:59:50.950 --> 01:59:53.860 align:middle line:84%
So all the things you were
doing motivated by the fear

01:59:53.860 --> 01:59:56.500 align:middle line:90%
have stopped dead in the water.

01:59:56.500 --> 02:00:00.340 align:middle line:90%
And voila, you're still alive.

02:00:00.340 --> 02:00:01.960 align:middle line:84%
People who love
you still love you.

02:00:01.960 --> 02:00:02.500 align:middle line:90%
Everything's fine.

02:00:02.500 --> 02:00:03.333 align:middle line:90%
You're not starving.

02:00:03.333 --> 02:00:04.970 align:middle line:84%
No one's come to
your rescue, yet.

02:00:04.970 --> 02:00:07.600 align:middle line:90%


02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And then, as you sit
there for long enough,

02:00:11.770 --> 02:00:15.880 align:middle line:84%
this other muscle will start to
flex that had previously been

02:00:15.880 --> 02:00:20.120 align:middle line:84%
quite atrophied, which is
not the muscle of fear,

02:00:20.120 --> 02:00:24.010 align:middle line:84%
which is very strong, but the
muscle of-- there are many

02:00:24.010 --> 02:00:24.810 align:middle line:90%
words--

02:00:24.810 --> 02:00:28.150 align:middle line:90%
desire, love, bliss, vision.

02:00:28.150 --> 02:00:32.740 align:middle line:90%


02:00:32.740 --> 02:00:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And you realize, it's not
that you have no motivation

02:00:37.600 --> 02:00:39.050 align:middle line:90%
to do anything.

02:00:39.050 --> 02:00:41.622 align:middle line:84%
It's just that all the usual
menu options in society

02:00:41.622 --> 02:00:42.580 align:middle line:90%
are all driven by fear.

02:00:42.580 --> 02:00:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, yeah, but I
don't have any fear, so I'm not

02:00:45.080 --> 02:00:46.600 align:middle line:90%
going to check that box.

02:00:46.600 --> 02:00:48.765 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any fear, I'm
fine with my body image.

02:00:48.765 --> 02:00:52.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to check that box.

02:00:52.270 --> 02:00:53.912 align:middle line:84%
And you leave all
these boxes unchecked

02:00:53.912 --> 02:00:55.870 align:middle line:84%
and you're sitting at
home alone doing nothing,

02:00:55.870 --> 02:00:58.870 align:middle line:90%
and you have gobs of free time.

02:00:58.870 --> 02:01:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And your mind will
naturally work.

02:01:00.310 --> 02:01:05.770 align:middle line:84%
Other board members will be
like, hey, now can we paint?

02:01:05.770 --> 02:01:08.570 align:middle line:90%


02:01:08.570 --> 02:01:14.940 align:middle line:84%
The board is like,
sure, whatever.

02:01:14.940 --> 02:01:15.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

02:01:15.740 --> 02:01:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Do we still have those paints
we bought like three years ago?

02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:19.573 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, let's pull them out.

02:01:19.573 --> 02:01:21.240 align:middle line:84%
And before you know
it, you're painting.

02:01:21.240 --> 02:01:24.070 align:middle line:84%
In other words, nature
abhors a vacuum.

02:01:24.070 --> 02:01:28.270 align:middle line:84%
So when fear is
taken off the table,

02:01:28.270 --> 02:01:29.780 align:middle line:84%
the vacuum doesn't
last very long.

02:01:29.780 --> 02:01:30.925 align:middle line:90%
You can hear the hissing.

02:01:30.925 --> 02:01:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that's coming
in, the only other thing aside

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.100 align:middle line:90%
from fear is love slash desire.

02:01:36.100 --> 02:01:39.910 align:middle line:90%


02:01:39.910 --> 02:01:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And so your radar starts
to lock on things--

02:01:46.030 --> 02:01:50.687 align:middle line:84%
it sounds corny, but you do
out of love, not out of fear.

02:01:50.687 --> 02:01:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And when you do
something out of love,

02:01:52.270 --> 02:01:54.310 align:middle line:84%
you're doing it
for no good reason.

02:01:54.310 --> 02:01:55.810 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make money.

02:01:55.810 --> 02:01:58.240 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't burnish my baseball
card or my reputation.

02:01:58.240 --> 02:02:01.750 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't look good or not
good on Instagram or whatever.

02:02:01.750 --> 02:02:04.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm just doing it because
I'm just this stupid nerd,

02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:08.900 align:middle line:84%
and I like collecting a
certain kind of stamp.

02:02:08.900 --> 02:02:09.700 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

02:02:09.700 --> 02:02:11.402 align:middle line:90%
I don't know, so sue me.

02:02:11.402 --> 02:02:12.610 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why I like this.

02:02:12.610 --> 02:02:14.410 align:middle line:90%
I just like it.

02:02:14.410 --> 02:02:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And you start doing
things for that reason.

02:02:16.750 --> 02:02:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And then those things
then, when you take them

02:02:19.360 --> 02:02:21.970 align:middle line:84%
through the bliss
process of, so these

02:02:21.970 --> 02:02:23.140 align:middle line:90%
are all the things you like.

02:02:23.140 --> 02:02:26.820 align:middle line:90%
Which happen to create value?

02:02:26.820 --> 02:02:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And then of those people
it creates value to,

02:02:31.360 --> 02:02:35.350 align:middle line:84%
who are the ones who feel the
most intrinsic empathy toward?

02:02:35.350 --> 02:02:38.640 align:middle line:90%


02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Then, if you wish--
you don't have to.

02:02:40.370 --> 02:02:41.170 align:middle line:90%
There is no should.

02:02:41.170 --> 02:02:42.253 align:middle line:90%
There's no finger-wagging.

02:02:42.253 --> 02:02:44.020 align:middle line:84%
If you wish, you can
start to craft that

02:02:44.020 --> 02:02:45.760 align:middle line:84%
into actually your
livelihood from there

02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:48.422 align:middle line:90%
forward, if you want.

02:02:48.422 --> 02:02:50.380 align:middle line:84%
Some people, they've
lived in fear for so long,

02:02:50.380 --> 02:02:52.630 align:middle line:84%
they've got a huge bank
account from all the companies

02:02:52.630 --> 02:02:54.280 align:middle line:84%
they've started and
sold or whatever,

02:02:54.280 --> 02:02:56.050 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't matter as much.

02:02:56.050 --> 02:02:59.230 align:middle line:84%
But you still do it not
because you need the money,

02:02:59.230 --> 02:03:02.410 align:middle line:84%
but because money is
also a board member.

02:03:02.410 --> 02:03:03.617 align:middle line:90%
It's a valid life force.

02:03:03.617 --> 02:03:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Everything around
us-- the microphone,

02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:06.690 align:middle line:84%
the camera, you
guys flying here,

02:03:06.690 --> 02:03:08.590 align:middle line:84%
me being here-- it's
all enabled by money.

02:03:08.590 --> 02:03:11.500 align:middle line:90%


02:03:11.500 --> 02:03:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And if you see it only
as a necessary evil,

02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:15.730 align:middle line:84%
you're exiling
that board member.

02:03:15.730 --> 02:03:17.948 align:middle line:90%


02:03:17.948 --> 02:03:19.990 align:middle line:84%
We're not saying go in
the other direction, where

02:03:19.990 --> 02:03:22.930 align:middle line:84%
it is the dictator
running the whole show.

02:03:22.930 --> 02:03:25.600 align:middle line:90%
That's out of fear too.

02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:28.610 align:middle line:84%
But there is a balanced, healthy
place for money on the board.

02:03:28.610 --> 02:03:31.987 align:middle line:84%
And so you'll often end
up doing your bliss,

02:03:31.987 --> 02:03:33.820 align:middle line:84%
and there will be money
involved, because it

02:03:33.820 --> 02:03:36.370 align:middle line:90%
does create value for people.

02:03:36.370 --> 02:03:41.110 align:middle line:90%
And that's OK.

02:03:41.110 --> 02:03:46.820 align:middle line:84%
So the move from
fear to love feels

02:03:46.820 --> 02:03:48.800 align:middle line:84%
like that, where
you do great things

02:03:48.800 --> 02:03:51.290 align:middle line:90%
and you don't get more love.

02:03:51.290 --> 02:03:54.860 align:middle line:84%
So you don't do anything out
of fear anymore, to get love,

02:03:54.860 --> 02:03:55.990 align:middle line:90%
or to avoid losing love.

02:03:55.990 --> 02:03:58.710 align:middle line:84%
The love is just
maxed all the time.

02:03:58.710 --> 02:04:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And then from that, the
love which is maxed--

02:04:01.430 --> 02:04:04.385 align:middle line:84%
which you're actually
acknowledging exists now--

02:04:04.385 --> 02:04:06.010 align:middle line:84%
it starts to have
its own opinion over,

02:04:06.010 --> 02:04:07.710 align:middle line:90%
like, well, let's go do that.

02:04:07.710 --> 02:04:09.668 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, well, that
won't make any money.

02:04:09.668 --> 02:04:11.308 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, but that's OK.

02:04:11.308 --> 02:04:13.100 align:middle line:84%
If we don't make money,
we won't lose love.

02:04:13.100 --> 02:04:14.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah, never mind.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go
back to my cupcake.

02:04:16.380 --> 02:04:18.080 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah, so let's go paint.

02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:19.290 align:middle line:90%
Let's go paint.

02:04:19.290 --> 02:04:21.538 align:middle line:84%
And you paint, and you do
all the stuff mindlessly.

02:04:21.538 --> 02:04:22.580 align:middle line:90%
You don't think about it.

02:04:22.580 --> 02:04:24.550 align:middle line:90%
It just kind of happens.

02:04:24.550 --> 02:04:25.490 align:middle line:90%
You talk about flow.

02:04:25.490 --> 02:04:26.750 align:middle line:90%
Things just flow out of you.

02:04:26.750 --> 02:04:29.540 align:middle line:84%
It was like someone was
doing it through my hands.

02:04:29.540 --> 02:04:35.150 align:middle line:84%
That's love, surrender, and
all of those related things.

02:04:35.150 --> 02:04:36.200 align:middle line:90%
>> That's beautiful.

02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:37.640 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

02:04:37.640 --> 02:04:39.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

02:04:39.680 --> 02:04:40.550 align:middle line:90%
>> I get it.

02:04:40.550 --> 02:04:41.570 align:middle line:90%
I totally get it.

02:04:41.570 --> 02:04:42.980 align:middle line:90%
Switch off the switch.

02:04:42.980 --> 02:04:45.290 align:middle line:90%
And meditation, can that help?

02:04:45.290 --> 02:04:48.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Meditation can help.

02:04:48.890 --> 02:04:52.580 align:middle line:84%
So what I do is, I'm a nerd
of trying to sort of figure

02:04:52.580 --> 02:04:55.040 align:middle line:84%
out, in this global chess
game, how to get in there

02:04:55.040 --> 02:04:56.355 align:middle line:90%
and switch off the switch.

02:04:56.355 --> 02:04:58.730 align:middle line:84%
That's why when I told you I
don't really do interviews--

02:04:58.730 --> 02:05:00.605 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to do an
interview where they're

02:05:00.605 --> 02:05:03.680 align:middle line:84%
going to use what I'm saying to
wag a finger at the audience,

02:05:03.680 --> 02:05:06.500 align:middle line:84%
saying now you need to do
this, because Artie said this.

02:05:06.500 --> 02:05:10.100 align:middle line:84%
I just can't be a part of
that, because my whole point is

02:05:10.100 --> 02:05:13.880 align:middle line:84%
to flip the switch, where
it's like basically--

02:05:13.880 --> 02:05:16.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it sounds
weird to say this.

02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:21.290 align:middle line:84%
My teaching philosophy is you
don't need to do anything.

02:05:21.290 --> 02:05:25.940 align:middle line:84%
You don't owe anybody
a goddamn thing.

02:05:25.940 --> 02:05:28.318 align:middle line:84%
And you're loved
without condition.

02:05:28.318 --> 02:05:31.360 align:middle line:90%


02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:33.070 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I tell my kids--

02:05:33.070 --> 02:05:35.360 align:middle line:90%
I hesitate saying this.

02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:36.160 align:middle line:90%
I'll soften it.

02:05:36.160 --> 02:05:39.430 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd tell my kids
when they were younger was,

02:05:39.430 --> 02:05:44.920 align:middle line:84%
you can go out and commit
crimes all day long--

02:05:44.920 --> 02:05:47.620 align:middle line:84%
horrendous, monstrous
crimes-- and you

02:05:47.620 --> 02:05:53.300 align:middle line:84%
will not lose one
iota of love from me.

02:05:53.300 --> 02:05:56.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, that having been
said, please don't do that.

02:05:56.520 --> 02:05:58.220 align:middle line:90%
Please don't do that.

02:05:58.220 --> 02:06:01.280 align:middle line:84%
But for all these other reasons,
you'll have a crappy life.

02:06:01.280 --> 02:06:02.190 align:middle line:90%
You'll go to jail.

02:06:02.190 --> 02:06:03.360 align:middle line:90%
You'll break my heart.

02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:04.250 align:middle line:90%
You'll be unhappy.

02:06:04.250 --> 02:06:05.292 align:middle line:90%
You'll hurt other people.

02:06:05.292 --> 02:06:07.190 align:middle line:90%
Why would you want to do that?

02:06:07.190 --> 02:06:09.590 align:middle line:84%
So there are a bazillion
reasons why you wouldn't

02:06:09.590 --> 02:06:13.370 align:middle line:90%
do those bad, harmful things.

02:06:13.370 --> 02:06:17.660 align:middle line:84%
But please don't let
one of those reasons

02:06:17.660 --> 02:06:19.720 align:middle line:84%
be that you fear
losing love for me,

02:06:19.720 --> 02:06:21.290 align:middle line:90%
because that's not on the table.

02:06:21.290 --> 02:06:23.760 align:middle line:90%


02:06:23.760 --> 02:06:24.560 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

02:06:24.560 --> 02:06:27.023 align:middle line:90%


02:06:27.023 --> 02:06:28.940 align:middle line:84%
That's why I like the
monstrous serial killer.

02:06:28.940 --> 02:06:31.160 align:middle line:84%
The mother is still like,
please, take me instead.

02:06:31.160 --> 02:06:31.960 align:middle line:90%
He's a good boy.

02:06:31.960 --> 02:06:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, well,
that's unconditional love.

02:06:33.970 --> 02:06:36.160 align:middle line:90%


02:06:36.160 --> 02:06:36.960 align:middle line:90%
You know?

02:06:36.960 --> 02:06:39.710 align:middle line:90%


02:06:39.710 --> 02:06:46.220 align:middle line:90%
And so my way of looking at it--

02:06:46.220 --> 02:06:47.990 align:middle line:84%
and this is
horrifying for people

02:06:47.990 --> 02:06:49.910 align:middle line:84%
who are all about law
and order, because it's

02:06:49.910 --> 02:06:51.170 align:middle line:90%
suppression and control.

02:06:51.170 --> 02:06:52.490 align:middle line:90%
And I get that.

02:06:52.490 --> 02:06:54.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm a fan of law and order.

02:06:54.680 --> 02:07:02.930 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, if you
really flip that switch

02:07:02.930 --> 02:07:06.128 align:middle line:84%
and you know you're
loved without condition,

02:07:06.128 --> 02:07:07.670 align:middle line:84%
then everything else
flows from that.

02:07:07.670 --> 02:07:11.810 align:middle line:90%


02:07:11.810 --> 02:07:15.440 align:middle line:84%
If there is a young
man who feels,

02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:18.830 align:middle line:84%
no matter how weird he
is, no matter what kind

02:07:18.830 --> 02:07:21.230 align:middle line:84%
of weird comics he likes
to read or weird music he

02:07:21.230 --> 02:07:26.270 align:middle line:84%
likes to listen to, that he
is loved without condition--

02:07:26.270 --> 02:07:30.170 align:middle line:84%
without condition, nothing
he does makes him lose love--

02:07:30.170 --> 02:07:36.020 align:middle line:84%
that's a man, I would wager,
who would never pick up a gun,

02:07:36.020 --> 02:07:40.543 align:middle line:84%
unless perhaps it is
to defend the homeland.

02:07:40.543 --> 02:07:41.960 align:middle line:84%
So guns are not
intrinsically bad.

02:07:41.960 --> 02:07:44.780 align:middle line:84%
The military is a sacred
function of society.

02:07:44.780 --> 02:07:47.068 align:middle line:90%


02:07:47.068 --> 02:07:49.610 align:middle line:84%
But when you pick up a gun in
defense of the people you love,

02:07:49.610 --> 02:07:55.730 align:middle line:84%
you're picking up a gun out
of love, not out of fear.

02:07:55.730 --> 02:07:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, I'm just
like, if I can just

02:07:57.950 --> 02:08:02.810 align:middle line:84%
get in and flip that switch
for as many people as possible,

02:08:02.810 --> 02:08:04.460 align:middle line:90%
then--

02:08:04.460 --> 02:08:06.840 align:middle line:84%
first of all, I don't
think I'm doing any harm.

02:08:06.840 --> 02:08:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just this
nerdy, like, let's

02:08:08.750 --> 02:08:12.020 align:middle line:84%
just flip as many switches as
we can and see what happens.

02:08:12.020 --> 02:08:14.270 align:middle line:90%
That's my excitement.

02:08:14.270 --> 02:08:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, what
I teach is the lore

02:08:19.280 --> 02:08:21.270 align:middle line:84%
to get you to start to
think about flipping

02:08:21.270 --> 02:08:23.270 align:middle line:84%
that switch is your meaning
and purpose in life.

02:08:23.270 --> 02:08:25.490 align:middle line:84%
You can't fulfill your
meaning and purpose

02:08:25.490 --> 02:08:27.183 align:middle line:90%
in life out of abject fear.

02:08:27.183 --> 02:08:28.100 align:middle line:90%
You're just too small.

02:08:28.100 --> 02:08:28.970 align:middle line:90%
You're constricted.

02:08:28.970 --> 02:08:31.610 align:middle line:84%
You never opened your
clenched fist of fear,

02:08:31.610 --> 02:08:32.970 align:middle line:90%
so you can never play the piano.

02:08:32.970 --> 02:08:36.890 align:middle line:90%


02:08:36.890 --> 02:08:41.240 align:middle line:84%
With bliss, I get pulled
backwards kicking and screaming

02:08:41.240 --> 02:08:44.510 align:middle line:90%
into healing-related stuff.

02:08:44.510 --> 02:08:47.630 align:middle line:84%
So at an advisory
level, I'm happy to talk

02:08:47.630 --> 02:08:49.910 align:middle line:84%
with people about healing
and help them through that.

02:08:49.910 --> 02:08:51.230 align:middle line:84%
But the minute they're
like, actually,

02:08:51.230 --> 02:08:53.313 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm ready for
therapy, I'm like, right on.

02:08:53.313 --> 02:08:54.120 align:middle line:90%
Do it.

02:08:54.120 --> 02:08:54.920 align:middle line:90%
Do it.

02:08:54.920 --> 02:08:56.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm the air traffic controller.

02:08:56.120 --> 02:08:57.453 align:middle line:90%
Come back whenever you're ready.

02:08:57.453 --> 02:08:59.870 align:middle line:90%
We're not going anywhere.

02:08:59.870 --> 02:09:03.020 align:middle line:84%
For me, I'm working on
getting all my stuff recorded

02:09:03.020 --> 02:09:05.180 align:middle line:84%
so that like the virtual
AR already will still

02:09:05.180 --> 02:09:06.530 align:middle line:90%
be here when I'm dead.

02:09:06.530 --> 02:09:08.480 align:middle line:84%
So if I get hit by a
bus, it's still here.

02:09:08.480 --> 02:09:09.770 align:middle line:90%
Take your time.

02:09:09.770 --> 02:09:10.880 align:middle line:90%
There's no pressure.

02:09:10.880 --> 02:09:12.273 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going anywhere.

02:09:12.273 --> 02:09:15.980 align:middle line:90%


02:09:15.980 --> 02:09:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And then, so all the related
healing stuff, and then

02:09:22.610 --> 02:09:26.480 align:middle line:84%
things like meditation, and
then even helping people

02:09:26.480 --> 02:09:30.500 align:middle line:84%
do things like read their dreams
or recover their lost board

02:09:30.500 --> 02:09:33.140 align:middle line:90%
numbers.

02:09:33.140 --> 02:09:37.130 align:middle line:84%
The key to this healing, for
me, is finding your lost board

02:09:37.130 --> 02:09:38.660 align:middle line:90%
member and recovering it.

02:09:38.660 --> 02:09:41.780 align:middle line:84%
Because the
quintessence within you

02:09:41.780 --> 02:09:48.620 align:middle line:84%
of feeling like a part
of you is not worthy--

02:09:48.620 --> 02:09:51.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's probably
deeper, but let's just

02:09:51.140 --> 02:09:54.710 align:middle line:84%
say the musician in you
who was stuffed down.

02:09:54.710 --> 02:09:56.570 align:middle line:90%
When you finally recover him--

02:09:56.570 --> 02:09:59.780 align:middle line:84%
look, we're not going
to quit our lives

02:09:59.780 --> 02:10:02.360 align:middle line:84%
and go join the circus,
because we're not

02:10:02.360 --> 02:10:04.910 align:middle line:90%
going 100% in your direction.

02:10:04.910 --> 02:10:07.432 align:middle line:84%
But also, we're not going
to go in 100% of the bully's

02:10:07.432 --> 02:10:08.890 align:middle line:84%
direction and just
be an accountant

02:10:08.890 --> 02:10:10.132 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of our lives.

02:10:10.132 --> 02:10:12.590 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to come up
with some kind of compromise

02:10:12.590 --> 02:10:15.200 align:middle line:90%
plan.

02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:18.800 align:middle line:90%
That is stepping away from fear.

02:10:18.800 --> 02:10:22.580 align:middle line:84%
Because if I add a little mix,
maybe increasing over time,

02:10:22.580 --> 02:10:24.910 align:middle line:84%
of musician, I
will not lose love.

02:10:24.910 --> 02:10:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And I slowly get
acclimated to that.

02:10:26.570 --> 02:10:30.808 align:middle line:90%


02:10:30.808 --> 02:10:32.225 align:middle line:84%
For most people,
that board member

02:10:32.225 --> 02:10:35.820 align:middle line:84%
is stuffed down
very, very deeply.

02:10:35.820 --> 02:10:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And it will come up
with all kinds of ways

02:10:38.150 --> 02:10:41.090 align:middle line:90%
to get its message to you--

02:10:41.090 --> 02:10:42.980 align:middle line:84%
pulling the emergency
brake, having

02:10:42.980 --> 02:10:44.870 align:middle line:84%
a big crisis in your
life, getting laid off,

02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:45.828 align:middle line:90%
throwing out your back.

02:10:45.828 --> 02:10:47.990 align:middle line:84%
All these things are
ways of doing it.

02:10:47.990 --> 02:10:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And what I specialize
in as a part

02:10:51.320 --> 02:10:56.030 align:middle line:84%
of helping to flip
the switch is to try

02:10:56.030 --> 02:11:01.340 align:middle line:84%
to give that board member ways
of reaching you without having

02:11:01.340 --> 02:11:03.720 align:middle line:90%
to go to that extreme.

02:11:03.720 --> 02:11:05.690 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm like,
oh, if you just

02:11:05.690 --> 02:11:09.680 align:middle line:84%
wanted me to read the email
that I had marked as spam

02:11:09.680 --> 02:11:12.680 align:middle line:84%
and blocked you and
unfriended you on Facebook,

02:11:12.680 --> 02:11:16.760 align:middle line:84%
and now you're like, I'm lying
in a hospital bed stressing

02:11:16.760 --> 02:11:18.620 align:middle line:84%
about something scary
they saw on an MRI,

02:11:18.620 --> 02:11:21.210 align:middle line:84%
because you're rattling my
cage to get my attention--

02:11:21.210 --> 02:11:22.010 align:middle line:90%
OK, OK.

02:11:22.010 --> 02:11:26.330 align:middle line:84%
So now I acknowledge
you're powerful.

02:11:26.330 --> 02:11:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Can we just take a
moment, and can you just--

02:11:33.300 --> 02:11:34.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm here now.

02:11:34.100 --> 02:11:36.870 align:middle line:84%
Can you just tell me
what you want to tell me?

02:11:36.870 --> 02:11:37.670 align:middle line:90%
And I will sit.

02:11:37.670 --> 02:11:41.570 align:middle line:84%
I will tie myself to
the chair and listen,

02:11:41.570 --> 02:11:44.060 align:middle line:84%
because now I realize,
just hearing it from you

02:11:44.060 --> 02:11:48.000 align:middle line:84%
directly is better than
what happened last month.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:48.800 align:middle line:90%
And I get it now.

02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:50.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm here.

02:11:50.240 --> 02:11:52.020 align:middle line:90%
You have my attention.

02:11:52.020 --> 02:11:55.430 align:middle line:90%
What would you like me to say?

02:11:55.430 --> 02:11:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And there are two
very powerful ways

02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:05.900 align:middle line:84%
that lost board number will come
to you when your guard is down

02:12:05.900 --> 02:12:12.020 align:middle line:84%
and you're more
accidentally receptive.

02:12:12.020 --> 02:12:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And the two are when
you're meditating

02:12:15.350 --> 02:12:17.610 align:middle line:90%
and when you're asleep.

02:12:17.610 --> 02:12:19.100 align:middle line:84%
So meditation,
you'll get visions.

02:12:19.100 --> 02:12:21.665 align:middle line:90%


02:12:21.665 --> 02:12:23.540 align:middle line:84%
That lost board member
will come up and start

02:12:23.540 --> 02:12:26.480 align:middle line:84%
talking at you, a
voice that you usually

02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:28.550 align:middle line:90%
don't allow to yourself.

02:12:28.550 --> 02:12:33.620 align:middle line:84%
When you're in full meditation
and those things within you

02:12:33.620 --> 02:12:37.760 align:middle line:84%
are open, that will be the
moment where the guerrilla

02:12:37.760 --> 02:12:38.870 align:middle line:90%
forces are like, OK, now.

02:12:38.870 --> 02:12:40.360 align:middle line:90%
Go, go, go.

02:12:40.360 --> 02:12:41.160 align:middle line:90%
They run up to you.

02:12:41.160 --> 02:12:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, you're
going to stab me.

02:12:42.960 --> 02:12:45.920 align:middle line:84%
No, they're handing
you an envelope.

02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:48.380 align:middle line:84%
Please don't burn this one
like you did the last 3,000

02:12:48.380 --> 02:12:49.990 align:middle line:90%
we've been trying to send you.

02:12:49.990 --> 02:12:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And then dreams
are the other one.

02:12:51.650 --> 02:12:54.330 align:middle line:84%
Dreams is a whole other
subset we won't get into.

02:12:54.330 --> 02:12:59.570 align:middle line:84%
But I've found that I've
gotten into helping people

02:12:59.570 --> 02:13:00.950 align:middle line:90%
with dreams--

02:13:00.950 --> 02:13:07.610 align:middle line:84%
again, very haltingly,
very begrudgingly.

02:13:07.610 --> 02:13:11.210 align:middle line:84%
But what I've found is that when
people start a healing cycle,

02:13:11.210 --> 02:13:13.910 align:middle line:84%
their dreams will
invariably fire up.

02:13:13.910 --> 02:13:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And even dreams that have
been recurring for 30 years,

02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:17.480 align:middle line:84%
when you start to
remember, oh yeah,

02:13:17.480 --> 02:13:19.850 align:middle line:84%
there's this dream I've had
for 30 years that's recurring.

02:13:19.850 --> 02:13:21.975 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, OK, you just
spent an hour telling me

02:13:21.975 --> 02:13:23.250 align:middle line:90%
you don't dream.

02:13:23.250 --> 02:13:24.050 align:middle line:90%
Which is fine.

02:13:24.050 --> 02:13:24.850 align:middle line:90%
That happens.

02:13:24.850 --> 02:13:27.740 align:middle line:90%


02:13:27.740 --> 02:13:30.990 align:middle line:84%
The most common dream pattern
is someone chasing you,

02:13:30.990 --> 02:13:32.940 align:middle line:84%
a boogie man chasing
you, invading your home,

02:13:32.940 --> 02:13:35.930 align:middle line:90%
breaking into your home.

02:13:35.930 --> 02:13:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And typically, the
way I read that is

02:13:39.650 --> 02:13:43.880 align:middle line:84%
that that is some form of lost
board member running after you,

02:13:43.880 --> 02:13:46.250 align:middle line:90%
trying to get your message.

02:13:46.250 --> 02:13:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's so at the
end of its rope,

02:13:48.530 --> 02:13:50.800 align:middle line:84%
because it's tried
everything else--

02:13:50.800 --> 02:13:53.135 align:middle line:84%
it's tried your girlfriend
breaking up with you.

02:13:53.135 --> 02:13:55.010 align:middle line:84%
It's tried your son
telling you you're a jerk

02:13:55.010 --> 02:13:56.370 align:middle line:90%
and not talking to you.

02:13:56.370 --> 02:13:58.078 align:middle line:84%
Nothing's getting
through, because you're

02:13:58.078 --> 02:14:01.502 align:middle line:84%
like, I have to continue
soothing and shielding.

02:14:01.502 --> 02:14:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Finally, it'll come to you
in this dream where you're

02:14:03.710 --> 02:14:06.110 align:middle line:84%
being chased, because
it has resorted

02:14:06.110 --> 02:14:10.125 align:middle line:84%
to pulling the lever of fear,
because unless you wake up

02:14:10.125 --> 02:14:11.750 align:middle line:84%
at 3:00 in the morning
in a cold sweat,

02:14:11.750 --> 02:14:14.450 align:middle line:90%
you won't remember anything.

02:14:14.450 --> 02:14:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going
to do that to you.

02:14:16.010 --> 02:14:19.112 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, but I'm going
to hit the button,

02:14:19.112 --> 02:14:21.320 align:middle line:84%
wake you up at 3:00 in the
morning in the cold sweat.

02:14:21.320 --> 02:14:22.970 align:middle line:90%
You'll have this dream.

02:14:22.970 --> 02:14:25.312 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is, it doesn't
know that we're in 2019

02:14:25.312 --> 02:14:27.770 align:middle line:84%
and Western civiliz-- it doesn't
know you can't go anywhere

02:14:27.770 --> 02:14:29.720 align:middle line:90%
to get the dream read.

02:14:29.720 --> 02:14:31.670 align:middle line:84%
You go on the internet
for dream directory

02:14:31.670 --> 02:14:34.940 align:middle line:84%
and it says, oh, boogeyman
is some lost fear of yours.

02:14:34.940 --> 02:14:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, what
does even that mean?

02:14:36.620 --> 02:14:39.170 align:middle line:90%


02:14:39.170 --> 02:14:43.590 align:middle line:84%
But it's a very ancient
part of ourselves.

02:14:43.590 --> 02:14:47.527 align:middle line:84%
So when people come to
me, I say, OK, OK, fine.

02:14:47.527 --> 02:14:48.860 align:middle line:90%
Have your dreams been firing up?

02:14:48.860 --> 02:14:50.195 align:middle line:90%
And I know the answer.

02:14:50.195 --> 02:14:55.940 align:middle line:84%
Just give me a few, and I'll
just give you the thumbnail,

02:14:55.940 --> 02:14:59.790 align:middle line:84%
but just enough so that you're
like, OK, this is a real thing.

02:14:59.790 --> 02:15:04.400 align:middle line:84%
I get it, and I'm willing to
go find my lost board member.

02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:07.442 align:middle line:90%
And that typically is enough.

02:15:07.442 --> 02:15:09.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's basically, I'm all
about flipping the switch.

02:15:09.650 --> 02:15:12.900 align:middle line:90%


02:15:12.900 --> 02:15:14.870 align:middle line:84%
The byproduct for
everyone else's benefit

02:15:14.870 --> 02:15:17.960 align:middle line:84%
too is that they end up
on track to their bliss.

02:15:17.960 --> 02:15:21.860 align:middle line:84%
But the whole craft of
getting that switch flipped is

02:15:21.860 --> 02:15:26.120 align:middle line:84%
something that just organically,
these other things have come up

02:15:26.120 --> 02:15:30.110 align:middle line:90%
as the need has arisen.

02:15:30.110 --> 02:15:32.090 align:middle line:90%
So I'm having fun all day long.

02:15:32.090 --> 02:15:38.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm like the guy in
his workshop just

02:15:38.060 --> 02:15:41.270 align:middle line:84%
fussing with all these
different things.

02:15:41.270 --> 02:15:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Thankfully, I have
a lot of people

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:47.060 align:middle line:84%
who come to me for
this kind of thing,

02:15:47.060 --> 02:15:51.450 align:middle line:84%
so I get to ask them
about their experiences.

02:15:51.450 --> 02:15:53.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm in the kitchen and
I'm like, here, try this.

02:15:53.450 --> 02:15:54.380 align:middle line:90%
Is it too spicy?

02:15:54.380 --> 02:15:56.580 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of it?

02:15:56.580 --> 02:15:59.420 align:middle line:90%
So I'm very much in my bliss.

02:15:59.420 --> 02:16:08.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm just a pig in a cool
pond of mud all day long.

02:16:08.180 --> 02:16:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And I get to have
interviews like this.

02:16:10.140 --> 02:16:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>> So great.

02:16:10.940 --> 02:16:12.320 align:middle line:90%
Appreciative of your time.

02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:16.680 align:middle line:84%
It has me thinking of this
term, amor vincit omnia, which

02:16:16.680 --> 02:16:18.800 align:middle line:84%
Laurentine's
grandmother had engraved

02:16:18.800 --> 02:16:20.480 align:middle line:84%
on the inside of
our wedding rings,

02:16:20.480 --> 02:16:22.600 align:middle line:90%
which is like love conquers all.

02:16:22.600 --> 02:16:23.400 align:middle line:90%
So beautiful.

02:16:23.400 --> 02:16:25.750 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, thank you.

02:16:25.750 --> 02:16:29.100 align:middle line:10%
