[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:13.580 align:middle line:90%


00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So my name is
Doctor Sean Stephenson.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And when I was born, the
doctors in the delivery room

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.530 align:middle line:84%
told my parents that I
wouldn't survive my first 24

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.390 align:middle line:90%
hours of life.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And my inside joke is, now,
all those doctors are dead.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.440 align:middle line:84%
37 years later, I'm the
only doctor that remains.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And that goes over really
well everywhere but hospitals.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And I've lived an
incredible journey.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.150 align:middle line:84%
In this container, it's what
people first pay attention to.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.260 align:middle line:84%
But it's my goal that it
quickly disappears for them.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And I know I'm doing my job,
as a human, if I can get people

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:02.720 align:middle line:84%
to see themselves in me and have
the wheelchair just evaporate.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.930 align:middle line:84%
So when people say, oh,
gosh, Sean, I don't even

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.590 align:middle line:90%
see the wheelchair anymore.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.600 align:middle line:90%
I go, good.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing my job.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not ashamed of the way
I look or anything like that.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.290 align:middle line:84%
It's just I believe
that when you

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:25.580 align:middle line:84%
have such identity around what
you can't do, you're miserable.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And my joke is a donut
doesn't go, I'm such a loser.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.350 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing in the center.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.770 align:middle line:90%
No, it's a donut.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.350 align:middle line:84%
There's not supposed to
be anything in the center.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a person
that doesn't consider

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.680 align:middle line:84%
myself disabled, because
that's a term meaning not able.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And I've certainly lived a life
that has been more than able.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.670 align:middle line:84%
I think that this container has
been an interesting journey.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.460 align:middle line:84%
Because my whole
childhood, I was

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.160 align:middle line:84%
riddled with physical
abuse, but not

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.630 align:middle line:84%
by the hands of any other
human, but my genetics.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.610 align:middle line:90%
And I had loving--

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.669 align:middle line:84%
still do-- parents,
an incredible sister,

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.080 align:middle line:90%
and great neighbors, and family.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.100 align:middle line:84%
But my genetics
were quite abusive.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And I was put into
painful scenarios

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:29.790 align:middle line:84%
nearly every few months of
my life, until I was 18.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Something as simple as
sneezing would break ribs.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.970 align:middle line:84%
Putting on a pair of pants too
quickly, I could snap a femur.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.790 align:middle line:84%
There are multiple times
that the physical pain

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.000 align:middle line:84%
was nowhere near as abrasive
as the emotional trauma of what

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.608 align:middle line:90%
it caused me to miss out on.

00:02:50.608 --> 00:02:52.650 align:middle line:84%
Vacations were planned,
and everything was ready.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.280 align:middle line:90%
And we were packed to go.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And as I was being wheeled
out the door by my parents,

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.720 align:middle line:84%
I would cough too hard,
break a bunch of ribs,

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.540 align:middle line:84%
and vacation was
canceled, because I needed

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.710 align:middle line:90%
to stay at home, immobilized.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And so I feel like pain and
emotional upset from that pain

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.630 align:middle line:90%
followed me my entire childhood.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And with that said, I
lived a glorious childhood.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And it all kind of
shifted in October,

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.720 align:middle line:90%
when I was in fourth grade.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
special connection

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.020 align:middle line:90%
that I had to Halloween.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.490 align:middle line:84%
Because in the US, when
you're a young boy or a girl,

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.590 align:middle line:84%
and you're getting
ready for Halloween,

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.057 align:middle line:90%
you're filled with excitement.

00:03:42.057 --> 00:03:44.140 align:middle line:84%
You want to show your
costume off to your friends.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.650 align:middle line:84%
You want to eat
way too much candy

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.530 align:middle line:84%
and go on trick
or treating dates

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.550 align:middle line:90%
with your friends and all this.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And then one morning, on
Halloween, I was in my costume.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm out of my wheelchair,
and I'm on the floor.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.040 align:middle line:90%
And my mom's in the kitchen.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.310 align:middle line:84%
She's making my the lunches
and taking the backpacks

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.550 align:middle line:90%
out to the car.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'm rolling around, and
I'm like, oh, I look so good.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And I can't wait to show this
costume off to my friends.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm rolling around,
I catch my left leg

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.130 align:middle line:90%
on the corner of the door.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.584 align:middle line:84%
And I bent it back, and I
snapped it at the femur.

00:04:20.584 --> 00:04:21.959 align:middle line:84%
And if you've ever
broken a bone,

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.240 align:middle line:84%
you know there's a
bit of a time delay

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.860 align:middle line:84%
between hearing the sound of
the snap and feeling the pain.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And even though it's a
fraction of a second,

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.540 align:middle line:90%
it feels like an eternity.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Because you visualize everything
you're going to miss out on.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.840 align:middle line:84%
You visualize all the nights
of excruciating twitches

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.600 align:middle line:84%
that will wake you up
screaming and blood curdling

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.350 align:middle line:84%
screams, because it feels
like you're being stabbed.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And all that comes
rushing into your brain

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.230 align:middle line:84%
when you've been exposed
to that amount of pain.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.120 align:middle line:84%
So my mom, she comes
running in the room,

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.470 align:middle line:90%
because I started screaming.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And I was screaming both in
pain and in emotional agony.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.710 align:middle line:84%
Because I thought, why do
I have to go through this?

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.330 align:middle line:84%
What did I ever do
to deserve this?

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.640 align:middle line:90%
I was one of the good kids.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.290 align:middle line:90%
I did my homework.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.480 align:middle line:90%
I was nice to my neighbors.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.130 align:middle line:90%
I was polite.

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:22.710 align:middle line:84%
Why was I being
punished for being me?

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.770 align:middle line:90%
And I was furious.

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And my mom, she would normally
play this game with me

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.940 align:middle line:84%
when I would break a bone to
try to transport my mind as far

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.250 align:middle line:90%
away from the pain as possible.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.760 align:middle line:84%
She would say, sweetie,
what was your favorite part

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.090 align:middle line:90%
about our last vacation?

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.810 align:middle line:84%
Except that day, I didn't
want to play any games.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.660 align:middle line:90%
I was furious.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.740 align:middle line:90%
I didn't think it was fair.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And she could see
that anger in my eyes.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.800 align:middle line:84%
So my mom leaned back,
and she formulated,

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.830 align:middle line:84%
I believe, a question that has
really set me up for everything

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.530 align:middle line:90%
wonderful in my life.

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.480 align:middle line:84%
It's why I do what I do
now and have ever since.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:19.360 align:middle line:84%
She looked in my eyes,
and she said, sweetie,

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:25.968 align:middle line:84%
is this going to be a gift
or a burden in your life?

00:06:25.968 --> 00:06:28.697 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I
thought she was crazy.

00:06:28.697 --> 00:06:30.030 align:middle line:90%
You and I have had gifts, right?

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.380 align:middle line:84%
They come on our birthday,
and we open them up

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.850 align:middle line:90%
with joy and excitement.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:42.420 align:middle line:84%
But what happened next, I tell
my scientific, skeptic friends

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:47.010 align:middle line:84%
I can't explain what
happened physically.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:49.350 align:middle line:84%
But it's what I
experienced emotionally.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:54.870 align:middle line:84%
It was like this warm wind
of wisdom filled the room,

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:59.660 align:middle line:84%
and circled around my
body, and just calmed me.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And in fourth grade, such a
young, impressionable age,

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.170 align:middle line:90%
I got clarity on my life.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.690 align:middle line:90%


00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:12.660 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I loved my
life amidst all that pain.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And maybe there was a
bigger, grander purpose

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:20.530 align:middle line:90%
to why I was in this container.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the reason was to teach
the rest of the human race

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:27.556 align:middle line:84%
how to love their lives
amidst their pain.

00:07:27.556 --> 00:07:30.120 align:middle line:90%
And it sent me on a journey.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And knowing the
purpose to your pain

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:35.700 align:middle line:84%
doesn't make the
pain go away, but it

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:40.800 align:middle line:84%
gives you fuel to keep pushing
forward and not want to quit,

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.310 align:middle line:84%
not want to check out,
not want to numb yourself.

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:49.860 align:middle line:84%
Stay in it, be mindful, and
look for the gifts in your life,

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:56.730 align:middle line:84%
because we all have control
over what we make things mean.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Our interpretations are
our greatest freedom.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:02.160 align:middle line:90%
You can lock me in a prison.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.440 align:middle line:84%
You could break every
bone in my body,

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:08.430 align:middle line:84%
but you can't take my ability
to choose what I make something

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:10.720 align:middle line:90%
mean away from me.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
sets me free from,

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.240 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately, the rest of the
human race, who I feel like

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.580 align:middle line:90%
is in prison, mentally.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.900 align:middle line:84%
Because they think things are
being done to them, instead of

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.760 align:middle line:90%
with and for them.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And in that young age of fourth
grade, I looked at my mom.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:33.150 align:middle line:90%
I said, I think I get it.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:35.070 align:middle line:90%
And that propelled me forward.

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.230 align:middle line:84%
It's not that I never had
a bad day beyond that.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:38.280 align:middle line:90%
I certainly did.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.520 align:middle line:84%
I had multiple fractures
beyond that point, surgeries--

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.860 align:middle line:84%
I was laughed at
when I would leave

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:47.720 align:middle line:84%
my house by kids and people
that had never seen somebody

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.550 align:middle line:90%
that looked like me.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.070 align:middle line:84%
I definitely went through
moments of being ostracized.

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:54.330 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't make it easier.

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:58.170 align:middle line:84%
It just made me
not want to quit.

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:01.610 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I do now.

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:04.590 align:middle line:84%
As a world thought
leader, I'm on this planet

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:09.600 align:middle line:84%
to look human beings in the eye
and say, I know it's painful.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.650 align:middle line:84%
I wish it didn't
have to be painful.

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:14.370 align:middle line:90%
You have a choice.

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:17.640 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to see it
as a gift or a burden?

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And when you hold that
space for a human being who

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:24.660 align:middle line:84%
is floundering in pain,
and suffering, and agony--

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.550 align:middle line:84%
you just hold,
lovingly, that space

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:30.900 align:middle line:84%
for them, a certain percentage
of them will wake up.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.810 align:middle line:90%
Not everybody.

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:35.640 align:middle line:84%
I personally believe
that, in this lifetime,

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.100 align:middle line:84%
it's not for
everybody to get it.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.530 align:middle line:90%
I wish it was.

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:42.960 align:middle line:84%
But there will be
some who won't get it.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And I live by a
Coast Guard motto.

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:48.780 align:middle line:90%
The motto of the Coast Guard--

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:52.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's true, but
I have heard it a few times.

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And I love it-- it says,
when the Coast Guard comes

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:59.520 align:middle line:84%
upon a shipwreck, and they
only have so much room

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.610 align:middle line:84%
in the helicopter to save
the people that are drowning,

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:03.790 align:middle line:90%
you know who they save?

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:07.470 align:middle line:90%


00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:08.830 align:middle line:90%
The ones that swim towards them.

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:12.860 align:middle line:90%


00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And not everybody
swims toward us.

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:18.730 align:middle line:84%
A victim runs into
a burning building

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:22.060 align:middle line:90%
screaming help me, help me.

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And I've been doing
this for 22 years

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.310 align:middle line:84%
as a professional speaker, 10
years as an online personality,

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:35.770 align:middle line:84%
16 years as a therapist, and
it still gets me, emotionally.

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Because there are those that,
no matter how hard I try,

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:44.400 align:middle line:90%
they'll never get it.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.340 align:middle line:90%
Because they don't want it.

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And when you spend
all your energy trying

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:51.910 align:middle line:84%
to save those that
won't swim toward you,

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:53.790 align:middle line:90%
you miss all of those that do.

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:56.790 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:01.290 align:middle line:90%


00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:03.770 align:middle line:90%
So I saw a Ted Talk, once.

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:05.840 align:middle line:84%
I wish I could remember
the name of the speaker,

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.280 align:middle line:84%
because I'd love
to give him credit.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.230 align:middle line:90%
But he said it best.

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:16.450 align:middle line:84%
He said, what determines
the gravity of a planet?

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:19.230 align:middle line:90%
It's the size of the planet.

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And what human
beings do is, when

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:24.890 align:middle line:84%
they start taking
on more obligations,

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:30.770 align:middle line:84%
and responsibilities, and power,
and influence, and success,

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:33.110 align:middle line:90%
their planet grows.

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:35.960 align:middle line:84%
When the planet grows,
they get more gravity.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.985 align:middle line:84%
When they get more gravity,
it's harder to move.

00:11:37.985 --> 00:11:39.095 align:middle line:90%
It takes more muscle.

00:11:39.095 --> 00:11:44.720 align:middle line:84%
It takes more effort to do
what you used to do with ease.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And so what most
people do is, instead

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:50.070 align:middle line:84%
of strengthening themselves
and saying I got this.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:51.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to keep going.

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:55.740 align:middle line:84%
They go, what if I could
shrink my planet back down?

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And so that's when
they self sabotage,

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.260 align:middle line:90%
because they screw it up.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.730 align:middle line:84%
They get into that fight with
that person that they love,

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:06.020 align:middle line:84%
or they cheat, or they screw
up that business thing.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.430 align:middle line:84%
It's all, oftentimes,
unconscious.

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:10.940 align:middle line:84%
So the gravity is
decreased, because they

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:13.190 align:middle line:90%
shrunk their planet.

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen this in my own
life with my own choices.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.540 align:middle line:84%
There'll be times when
I'm like, gosh, why am I

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.190 align:middle line:90%
screwing this up, continually?

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And then I do the reflection
or I do the journaling,

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.650 align:middle line:84%
and I realize, oh, because
the gravity was scary.

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And I was more comfortable
with the certainty

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:37.840 align:middle line:84%
of the smaller sized planet
than the larger planet.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And I've shrunk my planet,
and I've expanded my planet

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:42.830 align:middle line:90%
multiple times in my life.

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'm learning
to pay attention

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:51.890 align:middle line:84%
to what I'm doing here
in my day to day choices.

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:56.510 align:middle line:90%
And I am a slow learner.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:13:01.400 align:middle line:84%
People say, how many times do
you have to learn something?

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.310 align:middle line:90%
And I go, until it sticks.

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And one of my other
mentors, Evan Pagan,

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:13.720 align:middle line:84%
said, when does a person
truly learn something?

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.070 align:middle line:84%
The answer is when they've
changed their behavior.

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:20.090 align:middle line:84%
Until a behavior is changed,
you haven't learned anything.

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:21.710 align:middle line:90%
You can know to eat right.

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:22.940 align:middle line:90%
You can know to exercise.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.650 align:middle line:90%
You can know to save money.

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:28.850 align:middle line:84%
You can know to be kind to
people and be a good listener.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.830 align:middle line:84%
But until you actually
start doing those things,

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:34.970 align:middle line:90%
you really haven't learned them.

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm a man,
as I mature, and I'm

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:44.840 align:middle line:84%
hoping that I'm maturing,
depending on the day.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.950 align:middle line:84%
Or if you ask my wife,
it may not be true.

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:50.570 align:middle line:84%
But as I mature on
this planet, I'm

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:55.070 align:middle line:84%
seeing that everyone
is a reflection of me.

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And if there's somebody
or something outside of me

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:01.810 align:middle line:84%
that I hate, that means I
got some more work to do.

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:04.060 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean I have to
agree with every human being

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:07.590 align:middle line:84%
or appreciate all human
beings' behaviors.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:09.360 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.030 align:middle line:84%
But the moment I start
having hatred, or disdain,

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:18.350 align:middle line:84%
or irritation, it's time to
go back to work on myself.

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:20.610 align:middle line:84%
When people see me,
they think, oh, I

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:23.785 align:middle line:84%
would love to have the peace,
and confidence, and happiness

00:14:23.785 --> 00:14:25.540 align:middle line:90%
of Sean Stephenson.

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's just flattering
to hear to my ego.

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:31.780 align:middle line:84%
But the truth of
the matter is they

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:35.650 align:middle line:84%
don't see the work that
goes into being me.

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And if I could just
brag for a second

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:44.140 align:middle line:84%
about behind the scenes of
me, I have a consistent set

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:48.430 align:middle line:84%
of rituals that I have to
enact, or my insecurities

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:50.590 align:middle line:90%
eat me alive.

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:52.130 align:middle line:90%
People don't know this about me.

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.550 align:middle line:84%
But if you got to
know me closely,

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:59.000 align:middle line:84%
you would see in my home
office and in my phone,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.710 align:middle line:90%
I have a series of 16 rituals.

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And if I don't do four
of those rituals a day,

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:08.350 align:middle line:84%
my insecurities
will eat me alive.

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:09.520 align:middle line:90%
I'll doubt myself.

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.320 align:middle line:90%
I will question my capability.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:16.810 align:middle line:84%
But if I do these self care
rituals, you and no army

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:18.790 align:middle line:90%
can make me feel bad.

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And these rituals are so simple,
because I found the insecurity.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:31.300 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the greatest
thieves of a human's value.

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And a couple of years ago,
maybe about seven years ago,

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.310 align:middle line:90%
one of my mentors sat me down.

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:42.030 align:middle line:90%
And he said, why were you born?

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:44.560 align:middle line:90%


00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.010 align:middle line:84%
He just kept asking
over and over.

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:48.093 align:middle line:90%
Why were you born?

00:15:48.093 --> 00:15:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And I kept giving him
superficial answers just

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:50.940 align:middle line:90%
to shut him up.

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:52.020 align:middle line:90%
And he was like, no.

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:53.250 align:middle line:90%
Why were you born?

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And then finally,
I just got calm.

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:59.520 align:middle line:90%
And I got clear.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:03.480 align:middle line:84%
I was born to rid the
world of insecurity.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.880 align:middle line:84%
He said he felt the hairs on
the back of his neck stand up.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:07.680 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yes.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.060 align:middle line:90%
You were.

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:11.808 align:middle line:84%
Because if there is
anybody on this planet that

00:16:11.808 --> 00:16:14.350 align:middle line:84%
could convince the human race
they don't need to be insecure,

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:16.770 align:middle line:90%
it's you.

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And I believe the insecurities
are those moments when we

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:24.890 align:middle line:90%
don't feel like we're enough--

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:28.530 align:middle line:84%
not tall enough, smart enough,
rich enough, pretty enough,

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.860 align:middle line:84%
handsome enough,
confident enough.

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:35.100 align:middle line:84%
We feel like we're
lacking something.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And that feeling of
lack is dangerous,

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.760 align:middle line:84%
because we'll go
out and do things

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:44.250 align:middle line:84%
to try to prove that we're
enough that are often very

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:48.120 align:middle line:84%
destructive and, eventually,
potentially addictive.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And as a human being that's here
to rid the world of insecurity,

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:56.940 align:middle line:84%
I've done a lot of work
on looking into my own.

00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:01.320 align:middle line:84%
So I am the laboratory
for the human race.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:05.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, why am I
feeling this insecure?

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'll go deep
inside, and I'll reverse

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.900 align:middle line:90%
engineer what took place.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.230 align:middle line:90%
What did I just think about?

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.020 align:middle line:90%
Where was I focused?

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And I will reverse engineer
what caused the insecurity,

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.760 align:middle line:90%
and how can I turn it around.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And I got two massive
insights about Insecurity

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.220 align:middle line:90%
for the human race.

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:27.930 align:middle line:84%
One is the cure that I'm
happy to share with you.

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And the other insight that
I had is even more crazy.

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And that is to cure
insecurity, you

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:37.830 align:middle line:84%
have to realize it's
never going away.

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:40.540 align:middle line:90%


00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And once you realize
it's never going away,

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:46.390 align:middle line:84%
then that begs the
question, how do we cure it?

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is
it's self care.

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:51.690 align:middle line:84%
So when we take great
care of ourselves

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:55.840 align:middle line:84%
through mind, body, spiritual
care, through health, wealth,

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.940 align:middle line:84%
and relationship care,
through diet, exercise,

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:04.560 align:middle line:84%
and conscious
absorption of knowledge

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.960 align:middle line:84%
and contributing
back to others--

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.780 align:middle line:84%
when you have that level
of self care in your life,

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:15.955 align:middle line:84%
your insecurities don't
have any control over you.

00:18:15.955 --> 00:18:17.580 align:middle line:84%
They can't keep up
with you when you're

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.990 align:middle line:90%
taking great care of yourself.

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And so these self care
rituals, I respect them.

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And anytime I'm in
a dark place, or I'm

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:33.760 align:middle line:84%
questioning my own worth,
I know it's very simple.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm off my self
care ritual list.

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:38.750 align:middle line:84%
All I've got to do is
get right back to it.

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And I get angry
how simple it is,

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:44.240 align:middle line:84%
and yet how many
times do I forget it.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And so that's one of the
reasons why I'm here--

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:54.010 align:middle line:84%
is to let human beings
know that you are enough.

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And if you're
questioning that, I just

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:57.992 align:middle line:84%
know you're not taking good
enough care of yourself.

00:18:57.992 --> 00:19:01.436 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:01.436 --> 00:19:05.880 align:middle line:90%


00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.770 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you, that statement--

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:08.820 align:middle line:90%
you love it.

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:11.345 align:middle line:84%
Your eyes got bright and
shiny when you said it.

00:19:11.345 --> 00:19:14.760 align:middle line:84%
But do you realize how
many people it upsets?

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:19.140 align:middle line:84%
On YouTube, when I first made
that statement-- first of all,

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:20.003 align:middle line:90%
that video--

00:19:20.003 --> 00:19:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Could you repeat
the statement?

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:22.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:26.710 align:middle line:84%
So the statement you're quoting
is from a Ted Talk that I did,

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:28.830 align:middle line:90%
TedX Talk, in a prison.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And I said never
believe a prediction

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.200 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't empower you.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And so I think we had, at
this time in this video,

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:40.090 align:middle line:84%
about a million and a
half views on that video.

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And if you read the comments,
which I've stopped doing now

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:47.210 align:middle line:84%
in my life-- just
for my own sanity--

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:50.460 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of people that
said this is delusional.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.470 align:middle line:84%
If you don't listen
to the predictions,

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:54.230 align:middle line:90%
bad things can happen to you.

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And if you notice closely,
I didn't say plug your ears.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:04.350 align:middle line:84%
I said that you have to listen
for the ones that empower you.

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:07.920 align:middle line:84%
Because if someone tells you
you're not going to make it,

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.400 align:middle line:84%
and you start to
believe that, what good

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:15.060 align:middle line:90%
is that doing for you?

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:20.040 align:middle line:84%
Realistic people
oftentimes die early.

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.820 align:middle line:90%
Realistic people go broke.

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Realistic people never take
any chances with their heart

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:32.800 align:middle line:84%
and open up themselves
to romantic love.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.630 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to be realistic.

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:37.170 align:middle line:84%
Realistic people listen
to every prediction

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:39.520 align:middle line:90%
they're thrown at them.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why I'm
still on this planet

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:47.310 align:middle line:84%
is because I determine what
labels I put on me, not you.

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And I live and die by my
own choices, mentally.

00:20:54.570 --> 00:21:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And does that mean that somebody
couldn't pass away prematurely

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:01.800 align:middle line:90%
because of a prediction?

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:02.600 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.850 align:middle line:84%
But wouldn't you
want them feeling

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:09.580 align:middle line:84%
that every second moving
forward, there's hope

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:10.620 align:middle line:90%
and that they're moving.

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:13.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm a big believer, and this
may sound more delusional,

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:16.200 align:middle line:84%
that having a dream is more
important than achieving

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.120 align:middle line:90%
a dream.

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.990 align:middle line:84%
Because achievement
is not what keeps

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:26.850 align:middle line:84%
us inspired, because
it's behind us.

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:30.890 align:middle line:90%
Hope is what keeps us inspired.

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:34.910 align:middle line:84%
Heading toward
something is far more

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:40.010 align:middle line:84%
powerful than having
something behind you.

00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:42.260 align:middle line:84%
So when someone
says to me, Sean, I

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.180 align:middle line:84%
think you're delusional
for saying, never

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:46.508 align:middle line:84%
listen to a prediction
that doesn't empower you.

00:21:46.508 --> 00:21:48.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, great,
then I'm delusional.

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:50.302 align:middle line:84%
But I'm a hell of a lot
more happy than you.

00:21:50.302 --> 00:21:53.746 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:53.746 --> 00:21:58.180 align:middle line:90%


00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:00.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, I find that
realistic people

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:02.710 align:middle line:84%
are extremely
boring, predictable,

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:04.665 align:middle line:90%
and oftentimes miserable.

00:22:04.665 --> 00:22:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think the goal is to be
an unrealistic human being.

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
unrealistic, you can create

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:11.800 align:middle line:90%
incredible possibilities.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:17.230 align:middle line:84%
Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk,
the late Steve Jobs,

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:22.420 align:middle line:84%
the late Walt Disney, Mother
Teresa, Mahatma Gandhi,

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:24.460 align:middle line:90%
Martin Luther King--

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.460 align:middle line:84%
all these individuals are
incredibly unrealistic.

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:31.540 align:middle line:84%
Martin Luther King was saying,
one day, we will drink out

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:32.500 align:middle line:90%
of the same fountain.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.630 align:middle line:90%
And it will be no big deal.

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:37.750 align:middle line:84%
That was unrealistic
at the time.

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And so unrealistic
people chart the course

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.283 align:middle line:84%
for the lemmings that
choose to be realistic.

00:22:44.283 --> 00:22:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that
they're lemmings

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:46.658 align:middle line:90%
because they're stupid.

00:22:46.658 --> 00:22:48.920 align:middle line:90%
It's because they're scared.

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:51.120 align:middle line:84%
When you're unrealistic,
you're scared, too.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.670 align:middle line:84%
But at least you have
something to live for.

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:55.060 align:middle line:90%
There's more excitement.

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:58.150 align:middle line:84%
My whole life, I have
been called inspirational.

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:00.390 align:middle line:90%
And it used to make me sick.

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:04.060 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm like, I
don't like that word.

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.050 align:middle line:90%
Call me funny.

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:05.950 align:middle line:90%
Call me smart.

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:08.468 align:middle line:84%
Call me things that I feel
like I'm doing something over.

00:23:08.468 --> 00:23:10.010 align:middle line:84%
Why are you calling
me inspirational,

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:11.510 align:middle line:90%
when I pushed it away?

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:13.255 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
be inspirational.

00:23:13.255 --> 00:23:15.120 align:middle line:90%
Until one day, I heard a quote.

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And it changed everything
for me around that word.

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:23.740 align:middle line:84%
It said, if we're not
inspired, why are we living?

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:26.290 align:middle line:90%


00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:30.172 align:middle line:84%
When we're inspired,
we want to live.

00:23:30.172 --> 00:23:31.130 align:middle line:90%
And then I'm like, wow.

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:34.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm giving people
something that makes

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.820 align:middle line:90%
them want to continue living.

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:39.260 align:middle line:90%
And then I was like, wow.

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.260 align:middle line:84%
When someone says
you're inspirational,

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:42.320 align:middle line:90%
I need to celebrate that.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And I need to embrace them,
and thank them, and be

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:48.230 align:middle line:84%
humble and grounded, and
appreciative of that comment.

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:51.190 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
saying, in one word,

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:53.860 align:middle line:84%
a bigger concept,
which is I want

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:56.240 align:middle line:90%
to live more because of you.

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that my
ego needs to hear that,

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:01.150 align:middle line:84%
but my soul knows that's
what we should all

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:02.370 align:middle line:90%
be doing for each other.

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:04.150 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I'm around
somebody that

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:10.720 align:middle line:84%
is, whether it be a Tony
Robbins figure or any country's

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:14.240 align:middle line:84%
gymnastics, and I'm
watching greatness unfold,

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:18.070 align:middle line:84%
or seeing a beautiful, amazing
singer, painter, actor--

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:20.170 align:middle line:90%
they make me want to live.

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:23.110 align:middle line:84%
Their art, their sport,
their business, their talent

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:24.180 align:middle line:90%
makes me want to live.

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:26.230 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm like,
oh, that's what's

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:28.150 align:middle line:90%
possible as a human being.

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:30.940 align:middle line:90%
What more is inside of me?

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:32.860 align:middle line:90%
So that's how I feel.

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:38.080 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm on this journey
to be even more unrealistic

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:39.873 align:middle line:90%
tomorrow than I was today.

00:24:39.873 --> 00:24:42.711 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:42.711 --> 00:24:47.930 align:middle line:90%


00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:50.160 align:middle line:84%
So fear is an
interpretation in the mind.

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:53.300 align:middle line:90%


00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:56.760 align:middle line:84%
People come up to me after my
speeches, and they're like,

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.370 align:middle line:90%
are you ever afraid on stage?

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:01.880 align:middle line:84%
Because fear of public
speaking is supposedly

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.330 align:middle line:84%
one of the greatest
fears on the planet.

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's the profession
that I've chosen.

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:11.040 align:middle line:84%
So one might say I have more
courage than a lion tamer

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.800 align:middle line:84%
or somebody that
swims with sharks.

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:18.087 align:middle line:84%
Because humans would rather die
sometimes than give a speech.

00:25:18.087 --> 00:25:19.670 align:middle line:84%
But that's because
I feel like they're

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:23.420 align:middle line:84%
interpreting their body's
response in a way that's

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:25.430 align:middle line:90%
not serving them.

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:28.430 align:middle line:84%
Because I get that
rush of adrenaline.

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:29.660 align:middle line:90%
My heart pounds.

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.610 align:middle line:90%
My hands start sweating.

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:35.960 align:middle line:84%
All the things that anybody
else might label those as fear,

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.388 align:middle line:90%
I label them as excitement.

00:25:38.388 --> 00:25:40.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, that doesn't mean I
still don't have moments

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:41.570 align:middle line:90%
where I'm like, oh, gosh.

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:42.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do this.

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:44.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm scared.

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:48.350 align:middle line:84%
But in that moment, I'm
interpreting it as scared.

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And interpretation is the
greatest freedom that we have.

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:56.820 align:middle line:84%
It's the greatest power that
we have in our existence.

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And so I have to
just ask myself,

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:03.770 align:middle line:84%
is the way I'm interpreting
this empowering me?

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:06.070 align:middle line:84%
Because if it's not,
why am I doing it?

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:08.590 align:middle line:84%
I've got to find a way
to empower myself if I

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:10.650 align:middle line:90%
want to keep moving forward.

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:13.950 align:middle line:84%
So I look at how can I
empower myself in this moment.

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:17.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, I know I have
control over one thing--

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:19.200 align:middle line:90%
my interpretations.

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And the second thing
I have control over

00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:24.300 align:middle line:84%
is my response to
the interpretations.

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:26.850 align:middle line:84%
You don't have control over
your spouse, the government,

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:28.890 align:middle line:84%
the weather, but
you have control

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:31.860 align:middle line:84%
over how you interpret
all of those things

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.210 align:middle line:90%
and then how you respond.

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:41.420 align:middle line:84%
So for me, fear is
not a word that I

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.700 align:middle line:90%
use very much in my vocabulary.

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.920 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't use
it much, it doesn't

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:49.430 align:middle line:90%
have much power over me.

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:53.280 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say I'm fearless,
because I certainly

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:57.480 align:middle line:84%
have the biological, anatomical
response that everybody

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.640 align:middle line:90%
else does.

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.920 align:middle line:84%
It's just I quickly
reframe it in a way

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.743 align:middle line:84%
that it kicks me in the
butt to keep moving.

00:27:04.743 --> 00:27:07.581 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:07.581 --> 00:27:12.320 align:middle line:90%


00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.780 align:middle line:84%
Death-- I think
death is really cool.

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Because if you lived
forever, I don't

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:21.340 align:middle line:84%
know if you'd have as much
of an appreciation for life.

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:23.498 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's some
scientists and futurists

00:27:23.498 --> 00:27:25.790 align:middle line:84%
that say we're going to figure
out how to live forever.

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:29.360 align:middle line:84%
But I wonder what that's
going to do to our psyche.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:33.710 align:middle line:84%
What is it going to
do to a human being

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:39.630 align:middle line:84%
if we figure out how to
hack that one element?

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:42.590 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason
why genetics has,

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:46.070 align:middle line:84%
I believe, a start
time and an end time--

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:50.030 align:middle line:84%
so that newer generations
can show up, and newer

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:52.170 align:middle line:90%
adaptations, and new revolution.

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:55.753 align:middle line:84%
And it's only ego
that's afraid of death.

00:27:55.753 --> 00:27:57.920 align:middle line:84%
If you believe at all that
there's something greater

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.950 align:middle line:84%
than your physical
existence, you

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:04.830 align:middle line:84%
should be celebrating
the next adventure.

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:10.250 align:middle line:84%
I've had the fortunate
and unfortunate pleasure

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:13.910 align:middle line:84%
of smelling the grim
reaper's cologne four times--

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:16.910 align:middle line:84%
coming close to death
four times in my life.

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And nothing will
prepare you for it.

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:24.770 align:middle line:90%


00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:29.525 align:middle line:90%
But it's the last secret.

00:28:29.525 --> 00:28:33.270 align:middle line:90%


00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:37.610 align:middle line:84%
It's that last, is
there a Santa Claus?

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:39.790 align:middle line:90%
It's that last wish on a star.

00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:44.050 align:middle line:84%
It's that last story book
to the human existence.

00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:46.390 align:middle line:90%
Where do we go?

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:50.560 align:middle line:90%
What did it matter to be here?

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:54.550 align:middle line:90%
And in that, I bow to death.

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:56.560 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's just because
I've come so close to it

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:57.360 align:middle line:90%
several times.

00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:04.060 align:middle line:90%


00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:08.965 align:middle line:84%
It's an experience
stripped away of fairness.

00:29:08.965 --> 00:29:11.520 align:middle line:90%


00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And I personally think fairness
is an illusion, anyway.

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:18.180 align:middle line:90%


00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:20.250 align:middle line:84%
If you looked at
me, and you said,

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:25.360 align:middle line:84%
it's not fair that you have that
body, Sean, and I have mine.

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.160 align:middle line:90%
I'd say, wow.

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.710 align:middle line:84%
That's quite an assumption
you just made there.

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:31.410 align:middle line:84%
You're acting like
yours is better.

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:35.130 align:middle line:84%
But there are things that my
body can do that yours can't.

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:36.830 align:middle line:84%
I can roll into a
room, and everyone

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:38.720 align:middle line:84%
is going to remember
me, potentially,

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:41.520 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of their lives.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:44.606 align:middle line:84%
Is that a disadvantage
or an advantage?

00:29:44.606 --> 00:29:47.640 align:middle line:84%
It's all in how
you interpret it.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And I look at my container
and my experience in this body

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:57.430 align:middle line:90%
as being filled with advantages.

00:29:57.430 --> 00:30:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And people call me
delusional because of that.

00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:03.570 align:middle line:90%
And again, that's OK.

00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:09.370 align:middle line:84%
Because I can also say
something to somebody,

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:13.770 align:middle line:84%
whether it's up on
stage or one on one,

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:16.050 align:middle line:84%
that hits them in
the gut harder,

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:19.560 align:middle line:84%
because they know it's
coming from my container.

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.260 align:middle line:90%
So it's not just lip service.

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:26.940 align:middle line:84%
When somebody like Tony Robbins,
who I admire, said something,

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:29.370 align:middle line:84%
it's easy to be like,
easy for you to say, Tony.

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:35.430 align:middle line:84%
You're 6 foot 7, and chiseled,
and worth half a billion

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:38.050 align:middle line:90%
dollars or whatever.

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:39.000 align:middle line:90%
Easy for you to say.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.480 align:middle line:84%
But when Sean Stephenson
rolls in the room and says,

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:45.140 align:middle line:90%
hey, I know it was painful.

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:47.625 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry you were hurt
when you were young,

00:30:47.625 --> 00:30:50.310 align:middle line:84%
but we got to move
on now, sweetie.

00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:54.380 align:middle line:84%
You need to stop blaming your
past, and you need to grow up.

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And you need to be there for
the people that need you most.

00:30:57.010 --> 00:30:59.130 align:middle line:84%
You need to let
go of that story.

00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:02.420 align:middle line:84%
You need to start
loving yourself.

00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:05.070 align:middle line:84%
It's harder to
challenge, isn't it?

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:06.390 align:middle line:90%
So that's another advantage.

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:08.865 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:31:08.865 --> 00:31:14.257 align:middle line:90%


00:31:14.257 --> 00:31:15.090 align:middle line:90%
I say, you're right.

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:19.050 align:middle line:84%
How's that working
for you, though?

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:24.810 align:middle line:84%
I prefer the Aikido method
more than the other forms

00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:26.680 align:middle line:90%
that are abrasive.

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:31.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use
your energy with you.

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:34.020 align:middle line:84%
So if you come at me and
say it's not possible,

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:37.110 align:middle line:84%
or I can't do that,
I'd say, you're right.

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:39.780 align:middle line:90%
But how's that working for you?

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And I get them to do the math,
to carry the one, and go,

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:47.370 align:middle line:90%
it's not.

00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And I say, do you think
that, by chance, there

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.380 align:middle line:84%
could be another way
of looking at this?

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:55.610 align:middle line:84%
Do you think, by chance,
somebody else that

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:58.830 align:middle line:84%
might have had a similar
situation changed

00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:02.330 align:middle line:84%
just a few little things
that you could change and had

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:04.590 align:middle line:84%
a monumental shift
in their life?

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:07.620 align:middle line:90%


00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:10.010 align:middle line:84%
The way I try to
handle people that

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:12.740 align:middle line:84%
are coming at me
with their excuses

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:14.970 align:middle line:90%
is not to fight their excuses.

00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:16.830 align:middle line:84%
They've spent most
of their lives

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:19.230 align:middle line:90%
proving their excuses right.

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:21.660 align:middle line:84%
And human beings
are right machines.

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:23.250 align:middle line:84%
So I always say,
just be careful what

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:24.760 align:middle line:90%
you want to be right about.

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:28.000 align:middle line:84%
I want to be right about that
the world is a beautiful place.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.020 align:middle line:84%
I want to be right about that
I'm safe, healthy, and well.

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:34.410 align:middle line:84%
I want to be right about that
money flows effortless to me.

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:37.680 align:middle line:84%
I want to be right that amazing
people want to get to know me,

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:40.690 align:middle line:84%
and I am blessed to be
a part of their lives.

00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:45.510 align:middle line:84%
I want to be right about
amazing, empowered statement.

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, many
of the human race

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:52.830 align:middle line:84%
would rather be right
about their limitations.

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:54.600 align:middle line:84%
They fight for
their limitations.

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.860 align:middle line:90%
No, you don't get it, Sean.

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:58.452 align:middle line:90%
You weren't abused as a child.

00:32:58.452 --> 00:32:59.410 align:middle line:90%
You don't get it, Sean.

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:01.260 align:middle line:84%
You didn't grow up on
my side of the tracks.

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:02.250 align:middle line:90%
You don't get it, Sean.

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:03.500 align:middle line:90%
You don't have my skin color.

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:04.380 align:middle line:90%
You don't get it, Sean.

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:06.360 align:middle line:84%
You've never been
discriminated against because

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:07.830 align:middle line:90%
of this reason or that reason.

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:09.900 align:middle line:90%
And I say, you're right.

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:12.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm not claiming to
be an expert on you.

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not claiming that I
know what you're going through,

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:19.710 align:middle line:84%
but you and I share
something in common.

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:21.536 align:middle line:90%
They say, what?

00:33:21.536 --> 00:33:25.600 align:middle line:90%
I say, have you ever been happy?

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:26.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:28.526 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever been sad?

00:33:28.526 --> 00:33:29.326 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:29.326 --> 00:33:31.740 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever been angry?

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:35.250 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever felt lonely?

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:36.813 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:36.813 --> 00:33:42.540 align:middle line:84%
I said, so what we share
in common is emotion.

00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't been
in your shoes,

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.780 align:middle line:90%
but I've had your emotions.

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to learn with
my help or somebody's help

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:52.960 align:middle line:84%
on how do you control
your emotions,

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.505 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to having your
emotions control you.

00:33:55.505 --> 00:33:58.270 align:middle line:84%
Because your life can
shift dramatically

00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:02.830 align:middle line:84%
in an empowered way if you learn
how to control your emotions

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:07.570 align:middle line:90%
and influence your feelings.

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:12.909 align:middle line:84%
And you can tell a person who
raises their hand and says,

00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:16.110 align:middle line:84%

So easy leads to atrophy means
anything that's of great value

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.679 align:middle line:84%
to you, you probably had
to put a lot of work into.

00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:43.659 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't easy.

00:34:43.659 --> 00:34:46.823 align:middle line:84%

that's not easy.

You have to put in effort.

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:01.935 align:middle line:84%
You have to roll
up your sleeves.

00:35:01.935 --> 00:35:05.040 align:middle line:90%
You have to do the work.

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:08.420 align:middle line:84%
But whatever isn't easy

easy leads to atrophy.

It's easy to just eat the fried,

00:35:56.968 --> 00:35:59.380 align:middle line:90%
I've had a lot of funny things.

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:02.645 align:middle line:84%
>> I want the funniest
joke you can tell me.

00:36:02.645 --> 00:36:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I once was trapped
in an elevator.

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:11.250 align:middle line:84%
You see, I travel
with an elevator stick

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:13.440 align:middle line:90%
that is also a back scratcher.

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And I pushed the button
to open up the doors,

00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:19.470 align:middle line:90%
and I was by myself.

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And I wheeled in, and the
elevator doors closed.

00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And then I found my floor,
and I pressed the button.

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:26.640 align:middle line:90%
And nothing happened.

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.078 align:middle line:90%
So I'm like, that's weird.

00:36:28.078 --> 00:36:29.870 align:middle line:84%
So I just start stabbing
the button wildly,

00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:31.410 align:middle line:90%
and nothing happened.

00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:32.370 align:middle line:90%
So then I realized--

00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:33.955 align:middle line:90%
I do the math in my head--

00:36:33.955 --> 00:36:36.730 align:middle line:84%
oh, on the outside, the buttons
were pressure sensitive.

00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:39.150 align:middle line:84%
But on the inside,
they're heat sensitive.

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And my elevator stick
wasn't hot enough.

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:43.068 align:middle line:90%
So I got angry.

00:36:43.068 --> 00:36:44.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, I can't believe this.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.620 align:middle line:84%
Why are they trapping
people with disability.

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:49.410 align:middle line:84%
So then I'm like, OK,
what would MacGeyver do?

00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, if I could have
a tampon and a pack of chewing

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:53.700 align:middle line:90%
gum, I could make a bomb.

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:55.090 align:middle line:90%
So I just start breathing on it.

00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:56.928 align:middle line:90%
I was like [HEAVY BREATHING].

00:36:56.928 --> 00:36:59.280 align:middle line:90%
And I hit the button.

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.810 align:middle line:90%
What do you think happened?

00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:02.400 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:03.930 align:middle line:84%
So then I stick it
under my armpit.

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to heat
up using my armpit.

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:08.520 align:middle line:90%
And then I hit the button.

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:09.600 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.500 align:middle line:84%
So finally, I sit on
my elevator stick,

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:14.530 align:middle line:84%
and I'm grinding
my elevator stick.

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:17.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, who's your daddy?

00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And I hit the button,
and nothing happens.

00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And I have this
one line that helps

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:25.190 align:middle line:84%

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:26.660 align:middle line:90%
where I'm frustrated.

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:29.515 align:middle line:84%
And that's the question,
what's funny about this?

00:37:29.515 --> 00:37:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And what I realized is that
there was a little security

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:35.800 align:middle line:84%
camera in that elevator looking
at me grinding on this elevator

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:36.600 align:middle line:90%
stick.

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And I was just imagining all
the people in maintenance

00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:41.968 align:middle line:84%
just filming it,
putting it on YouTube,

00:37:41.968 --> 00:37:44.010 align:middle line:84%
thinking it's hilarious,
watching this little man

00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:47.550 align:middle line:84%
in a wheelchair doing nasty
things to his back scratcher.

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:49.440 align:middle line:90%
And that just made me laugh.

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:52.950 align:middle line:84%
So I've been trapped in
lots of stupid scenarios

00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:57.330 align:middle line:84%

And multiple things
have happened to me,

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.650 align:middle line:84%
but I'm always looking for
what's funny about this.

00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:07.170 align:middle line:84%
I pride myself on
a sense of humor.

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:10.200 align:middle line:84%
My wife-- if she says that
another man's better looking

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.390 align:middle line:90%
than me-- but she wouldn't.

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:14.240 align:middle line:90%
But if she did, I wouldn't care.

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:16.590 align:middle line:84%
But if she said another
guy was funnier than me,

00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:18.450 align:middle line:90%
oh, we'd have a problem.

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:20.410 align:middle line:90%
This would really upset me.

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's because
my ego has identified

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.108 align:middle line:90%
with wanting to be funny.

00:38:26.108 --> 00:38:29.036 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:38:29.036 --> 00:38:31.970 align:middle line:90%


00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:36.320 align:middle line:84%
So let's be clear, I
want to give up a lot.

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:38.480 align:middle line:90%
I just don't.

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.520 align:middle line:90%
There's a difference.

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:47.460 align:middle line:84%
I have at times, every
week, want to give up.

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:48.600 align:middle line:90%
But I don't.

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:50.600 align:middle line:84%
I learned from one of my
mentors that passed on,

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:52.610 align:middle line:90%
Charlie Tremendous Jones.

00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:54.020 align:middle line:90%
He said, I'm not going to quit.

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:56.940 align:middle line:90%
But let me want to quit.

00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And I want to quit, sometimes,
several times a day.

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's the denial
of an emotion

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:07.010 align:middle line:84%
that's far more dangerous
than the emotion itself.

00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And so when I let myself
want to quit, I want to quit.

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, OK,
but are you going to?

00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:14.120 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.210 align:middle line:90%
And that's the difference.

00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:19.790 align:middle line:84%
It is I don't make myself feel
wrong and bad for the emotions

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:20.920 align:middle line:90%
that I'm having.

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:24.782 align:middle line:84%
My mom, this amazing
woman who asked me

00:39:24.782 --> 00:39:26.990 align:middle line:84%
if this was going to be a
gift or a burden-- she also

00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:29.380 align:middle line:84%
used to do this thing where
she would go to the kitchen

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:32.510 align:middle line:84%
when I was feeling sorry
for myself, as a kid.

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:34.295 align:middle line:84%
And she would pull
out an egg timer.

00:39:34.295 --> 00:39:37.880 align:middle line:84%
She said, sweetie, you want to
feel sorry for yourself today,

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:38.780 align:middle line:90%
that's fine.

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:40.760 align:middle line:84%
But today, you only
get 15 minutes.

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And she would set an
egg timer for 15 minutes

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:47.480 align:middle line:84%
and put it on the
desk next to me.

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:49.200 align:middle line:90%
Egg timers traumatize me, now.

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.560 align:middle line:90%
But other than that, it worked.

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:53.510 align:middle line:84%
When you allow a human
being, whether it's

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:57.290 align:middle line:84%
a child or an adult, to
feel sorry for themselves

00:39:57.290 --> 00:40:00.920 align:middle line:84%
in a controlled amount of
time, it kind of evaporates.

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:03.330 align:middle line:84%
Because you realize it
doesn't get you anywhere.

00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:04.820 align:middle line:90%
But when you tell somebody no--

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:05.930 align:middle line:90%
you can't be angry.

00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:07.250 align:middle line:90%
You can't be sad.

00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:08.180 align:middle line:90%
You can't be this.

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:09.830 align:middle line:90%
You can't be that--

00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:10.630 align:middle line:90%
it bottles up.

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:12.020 align:middle line:90%
And then it gets worse.

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:17.710 align:middle line:84%
I go into schools sometimes
after school shootings,

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:22.490 align:middle line:84%
and I listen to the kids
talk about the child who

00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:24.980 align:middle line:90%
snapped and did the shooting.

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And I found that was a child
who was made wrong and bad

00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:31.760 align:middle line:90%
for having his feelings.

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:35.390 align:middle line:90%
He needed to bottle them up.

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:40.130 align:middle line:84%
It's not the expressive
child that has access to art,

00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:46.940 align:middle line:84%
and creativity, and voicing
through poetry, and music,

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:48.360 align:middle line:90%
and video.

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:52.320 align:middle line:84%
That's not the child that
shoots up the schools.

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:55.280 align:middle line:84%
It's the one that
feels repressed.

00:40:55.280 --> 00:41:00.050 align:middle line:84%
It's the one that doesn't know
how to experience emotion.

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:03.154 align:middle line:84%
It feels wrong and bad for
having them in the first place.

Which is another way of
suppressing the emotion--

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:13.640 align:middle line:90%
muting the human being.

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:16.246 align:middle line:90%
There is no drug.

00:41:16.246 --> 00:41:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe that
certain pharmaceuticals have

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:23.840 align:middle line:90%
a place in our society.

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:29.240 align:middle line:84%

that quite oftentimes,

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:11.010 align:middle line:84%
is not going to
heal that problem.

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:14.430 align:middle line:84%
It might help balance the
chemistry if it's done right.

00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:17.460 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part, all
it does is it mutes you.

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And when a human
being is muted, you

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.470 align:middle line:90%
strip the color out of them.

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:25.890 align:middle line:84%
You strip the life, and the
creativity, and the flow,

00:42:25.890 --> 00:42:29.130 align:middle line:90%
and the presence out them.

00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:31.020 align:middle line:90%
I've been called ADD.

00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:32.970 align:middle line:84%
I've been called a lot
of different things.

00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just like, that
doesn't empower me.

00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:35.770 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:39.250 align:middle line:90%


00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:42.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't align myself
with a limitation.

00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:45.720 align:middle line:90%
Instead, I'm like, no.

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:50.460 align:middle line:84%
I can have incredible
attention into something

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:52.800 align:middle line:90%
if it lights me up.

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:56.760 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't light me up, I'm
not going to give it attention.

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to feel
bad about that, either.

00:42:59.550 --> 00:43:01.500 align:middle line:84%
I could talk about
the topics that we're

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:06.420 align:middle line:84%
talking about for days and
be fully present with you.

00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:10.320 align:middle line:84%
But If you come at me
with schedules, and P&L's,

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:13.650 align:middle line:84%
and all these different
numbers, oh my goodness.

00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:16.590 align:middle line:90%
I melt down, and I glaze over.

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And I wish I didn't, but
it's what happens to me.

00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And in my company, we say Sean
is good at how many things,

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:26.060 align:middle line:90%
Austin?

00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:26.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Three.

00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:29.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I'm good
at three things.

00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And I used to feel bad
that I wasn't good at more.

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:36.180 align:middle line:84%
But three things-- and
everybody in my company

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:39.090 align:middle line:84%
knows if I do anything
outside of those three things,

00:43:39.090 --> 00:43:41.910 align:middle line:84%
they're going to end
up having to redo it.

00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't think myself
wrong and bad anymore.

00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:47.320 align:middle line:84%
I just say, I'm good
at three things.

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:51.155 align:middle line:84%
So let's get anything off my
plate that's not those three.

00:43:51.155 --> 00:43:54.550 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:58.920 align:middle line:90%


00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:01.920 align:middle line:90%
Only every day.

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:10.500 align:middle line:84%
So when you see me up on
a stage, giving a talk,

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:13.530 align:middle line:84%
you're actually seeing
the product of a talk

00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:18.990 align:middle line:84%
that I've given dozens of times
prior in the shower that day,

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:21.270 align:middle line:90%
the day before, the week before.

00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:23.940 align:middle line:90%


00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:29.660 align:middle line:84%
I spend a lot of time in
that beautiful daydream space

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:31.870 align:middle line:90%
that we call visualization.

00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:34.980 align:middle line:84%
There's a great book called
"Mind Sculpting," that I love.

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:40.280 align:middle line:90%
And it's rehearsal.

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:42.030 align:middle line:84%
Because the mind can't
tell the difference

00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:44.127 align:middle line:90%
between imagination and reality.

00:44:44.127 --> 00:44:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Specifically, mine can't
tell the difference

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:48.980 align:middle line:90%
between imagination and memory.

00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And so if you imagine
something over and over,

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:55.320 align:middle line:84%
your brain goes,
oh, it's a memory.

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:56.140 align:middle line:90%
It's a memory.

00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:57.240 align:middle line:90%
We know how to do this.

00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And they've proven
that if you actually

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.720 align:middle line:84%
visualize going through
a practice of shooting

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:08.340 align:middle line:84%
a basketball over and over,
your muscles will actually

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:12.690 align:middle line:84%
start to believe that it's
doing those free throw shots.

00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And then when you go actually
to start shooting that ball,

00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:18.720 align:middle line:84%
the body reacts
differently than if you

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:21.220 align:middle line:90%
didn't do the mental rehearsal.

00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And so when I get up on
stage, like I did today,

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:28.650 align:middle line:84%
and you hear me say
what I have to say,

00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:30.610 align:middle line:84%
and you see me
connect with you, it's

00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:33.390 align:middle line:84%
because I closed my
eyes earlier that day,

00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:37.030 align:middle line:84%
and the day before, and every
day prior to the speech.

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And I walked through, and
I looked into your eyes

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.070 align:middle line:90%
in that visual rehearsal.

00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:45.450 align:middle line:90%
And I saw you smile.

00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And I watched you write
down notes that I'm sharing.

00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And I see you have this
shift of experience.

00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And I've convinced myself, long
before I get on that stage,

00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:02.980 align:middle line:84%
that not only did you
laugh, but you cried.

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:07.040 align:middle line:90%
And you shift the way you think.

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:09.110 align:middle line:90%
You rethought your life.

00:46:09.110 --> 00:46:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And so when I get
up on stage or I

00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:17.410 align:middle line:84%
do anything that I feel like
I can fly when I'm doing it--

00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:21.810 align:middle line:84%
those things in my top three
that I do in my business--

00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:24.920 align:middle line:84%
it's because I rehearse
them in my mind.

00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:26.660 align:middle line:84%
So when I finally get
into this scenario,

00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:29.300 align:middle line:84%
my mind goes, well,
we know how this ends.

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:30.100 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:31.570 align:middle line:90%
Let's do this.

00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's what gives me
such great advantages.

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:39.490 align:middle line:84%
Visualization is so
a part of my life

00:46:39.490 --> 00:46:43.570 align:middle line:84%
that I don't even think about
it, because I'm like, wait.

00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:47.410 align:middle line:84%
You're telling me other
human beings don't do this?

00:46:47.410 --> 00:46:50.320 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I have to
be almost reminded

00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:55.736 align:middle line:84%
that this is not common place
for the rest of the human race.

00:46:55.736 --> 00:46:58.574 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Wayne Dyer, one of the
greatest influences on my life,

00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:08.210 align:middle line:84%
taught me something
about twilight.

00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:09.840 align:middle line:90%
When I wake up--

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:12.710 align:middle line:84%
I can't say every
day, but most days--

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:15.680 align:middle line:90%
I slowly sit up.

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And my wife likes
to keep sleeping.

00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:19.930 align:middle line:90%
She loves her sleep.

00:47:19.930 --> 00:47:21.530 align:middle line:90%
And I don't disturb Mindy.

00:47:21.530 --> 00:47:24.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm just in my own
space on the bed.

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And I say, in my
mind, thank you.

00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:31.010 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:32.570 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:35.720 align:middle line:90%
And I'm excited for the day.

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And I visualize something
that really gives me

00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:43.840 align:middle line:84%
a lot of energy and
motivation to tackle my day.

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:45.410 align:middle line:84%
You know how people
say, how do you

00:47:45.410 --> 00:47:47.570 align:middle line:84%
get through your day
on those tough days?

00:47:47.570 --> 00:47:50.450 align:middle line:84%
What is your source
of inspiration?

00:47:50.450 --> 00:47:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's because
I have committed

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:57.920 align:middle line:84%
my life to ridding this world
of insecurity in my lifetime.

00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And so when I get
up in the morning,

00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:01.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm not just getting up for me.

00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:03.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm not getting
up for my spouse.

00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:05.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm not just getting up
for my extended family,

00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:07.480 align:middle line:84%
and my friends,
and my customers.

00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:09.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting up for the world.

00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:10.580 align:middle line:90%
Is that cocky?

00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:12.010 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:48:12.010 --> 00:48:13.340 align:middle line:90%
But can I back it?

00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:14.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:17.330 align:middle line:84%
You know the difference
between arrogance and cocky?

00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:19.580 align:middle line:90%
Cocky person can back it up.

00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And I backed up
time and time again

00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:25.340 align:middle line:84%
with how I've lived
my life, that I'm here

00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:29.300 align:middle line:84%
to rid the world of
insecurity by using myself

00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:32.840 align:middle line:84%
as the laboratory and
sharing my findings.

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:36.810 align:middle line:84%

open, I'm like, let's go,

00:48:37.610 --> 00:48:39.170 align:middle line:90%
Let's take this on.

00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm connecting to
the planet when I wake up.

00:48:43.530 --> 00:48:45.540 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot of fuel.

00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And we've been blessed
to have videos go viral.

00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:52.280 align:middle line:84%
This year alone, we reached
about a quarter of a billion

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:55.130 align:middle line:90%
people through videos online.

00:48:55.130 --> 00:49:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that's just the
end result of that morning

00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:04.070 align:middle line:84%
meditation of "I'm getting
up for the human race."

00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:07.760 align:middle line:84%
If anything, I'm kind of annoyed
that I've got six billion,

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:11.710 align:middle line:84%
750 million that don't
know who I am and haven't

00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:13.130 align:middle line:90%
heard my message.

00:49:13.130 --> 00:49:16.110 align:middle line:84%
Because that means I got a
lot more work cut out for me.

00:49:16.110 --> 00:49:17.662 align:middle line:84%
Most people would
be like, oh, wow.

00:49:17.662 --> 00:49:19.620 align:middle line:84%
I'd be happy if a million
people knew who I am.

00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:21.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm like no.

00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:22.760 align:middle line:90%
We need to get the other 6.75.

Oh, it's easy.

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:36.660 align:middle line:84%
It's working on yourself
and giving back to others.

00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:38.220 align:middle line:90%
There's two ways to feel good.

00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:45.240 align:middle line:84%
You can gratify yourself, which
is pleasure now, pay later.

00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And then there's fulfillment,
which is effort now,

00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:49.730 align:middle line:90%
pleasure later.

00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And whenever you are
growing your mind,

00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:56.280 align:middle line:84%
your body, your
spirit, or you're

00:49:56.280 --> 00:50:03.270 align:middle line:84%
giving back to your planet and
others, that's so fulfilling.

00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:04.950 align:middle line:84%
I've been a therapist
for 16 years,

00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:08.100 align:middle line:84%
and I've never had somebody
sit down on my couch

00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:12.460 align:middle line:84%
and say, Sean, every morning,
I do self care rituals.

00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:14.700 align:middle line:90%
I kiss my kids goodbye.

00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:19.860 align:middle line:84%
I then spend five hours in the
homeless shelter feeding them,

00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:23.040 align:middle line:84%
and I knit blankets for
children over in Africa.

00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And gosh, I just
want to kill myself.

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:27.590 align:middle line:90%
I've never had it happen once.

00:50:27.590 --> 00:50:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying it doesn't
exist, but I've never seen it.

00:50:30.570 --> 00:50:33.590 align:middle line:84%
When a human being is growing
their mind, body, and spirit,

00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:38.820 align:middle line:84%
and they're giving back to the
planet and humanity at large,

00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:40.936 align:middle line:90%
it's so darn fulfilling.

00:50:40.936 --> 00:50:41.736 align:middle line:90%
You are refueled.

00:50:41.736 --> 00:50:46.610 align:middle line:90%


00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:55.260 align:middle line:84%
I know that when I have a
parent come up to me and say,

00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:59.800 align:middle line:84%
my child was killed
by a drunk driver.

00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And when I was in my
deepest, darkest despair

00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:07.170 align:middle line:84%
and wanted to kill
myself, your book

00:51:07.170 --> 00:51:10.370 align:middle line:84%
fell off the bookshelf
in my child's room,

00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:14.000 align:middle line:84%
when I was crying over
their items that they owned.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And I read your book,
and it gave me reason

00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:20.780 align:middle line:90%
to want to keep going.

00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:23.290 align:middle line:90%
The fulfillment from that--

00:51:23.290 --> 00:51:28.560 align:middle line:84%
that can never be touched by
the gratification of money, sex,

00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:31.080 align:middle line:90%
or anything external.

00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:37.710 align:middle line:84%
That is a calling
that you can't buy.

00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:41.800 align:middle line:90%
And that gets me out of bed.

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's not always the most
extreme cases like that.

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it's just
getting a message

00:51:48.070 --> 00:51:51.350 align:middle line:84%
from a complete stranger
on Facebook saying,

00:51:51.350 --> 00:51:52.850 align:middle line:90%
I was having a tough day.

00:51:52.850 --> 00:51:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And I watched your
silly dance party video,

00:51:57.380 --> 00:51:59.810 align:middle line:84%
and you turned it
all around for me.

00:51:59.810 --> 00:52:01.880 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:03.950 align:middle line:84%
I take very seriously
and I continue

00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:10.310 align:middle line:84%
to work on how do you absorb
millions of people's comments.

00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And the way you do it
is you realize they're

00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:15.990 align:middle line:90%
all voices in your head.

00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:18.350 align:middle line:84%
So when you get
mean comments, you

00:52:18.350 --> 00:52:20.420 align:middle line:84%
know you got some
more work to do.

00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:24.350 align:middle line:84%
It's a deep thought
that scares us.

00:52:24.350 --> 00:52:26.680 align:middle line:90%
So I have to two tattoos.

00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:28.760 align:middle line:84%
One of them, I share
with my wife, Mindy.

00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's that our love
for each other is infinite

00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:34.850 align:middle line:84%
and that we are so much greater
than our roles and titles.

00:52:34.850 --> 00:52:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And the other one is
C is greater than E.

00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And that means cause
is greater than effect.

00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:44.840 align:middle line:84%
Everything that happens,
I am a cause for,

00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:47.180 align:middle line:90%
because I got out of bed today.

00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And when something
happens, like this year,

00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:52.650 align:middle line:84%
I smashed into the
back of a semi truck

00:52:52.650 --> 00:52:54.710 align:middle line:90%
going 75 miles an hour.

00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:55.890 align:middle line:90%
I almost died.

00:52:55.890 --> 00:53:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And I was a cause for getting
in the vehicle that day.

00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And had my life come to an
end, it wasn't, oh, it's so sad

00:53:04.930 --> 00:53:06.520 align:middle line:90%
that Sean ran into that truck.

00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:09.980 align:middle line:84%
No, Sean got in
the car that day.

00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:12.482 align:middle line:84%
No matter what
happens to you, you

00:53:12.482 --> 00:53:13.940 align:middle line:84%
have to take
ownership for the fact

00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:16.640 align:middle line:84%
that you got out
of bed that day.

00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And when you live at
cause, you own the results

00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:20.450 align:middle line:90%
that are happening to you.

00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:23.900 align:middle line:84%
The biggest, whiny,
victim mentality lives

00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:26.690 align:middle line:90%
at effect, which is, why me?

00:53:26.690 --> 00:53:28.700 align:middle line:84%
What did I ever do
to deserve this?

00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And that mentality of it's not
my fault. It's somebody else,

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:40.070 align:middle line:84%
and I have to blame so
I can be free of this.

00:53:40.070 --> 00:53:41.180 align:middle line:90%
But they're never free.

00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:44.750 align:middle line:84%
When you are blaming
anything outside of yourself,

00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:46.100 align:middle line:90%
you're never free.

00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:49.720 align:middle line:84%
You are a victim to
the external world.

00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And I just choose
not to be that.

00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:58.607 align:middle line:84%
Some things don't make
sense in the moment.

00:53:58.607 --> 00:54:00.440 align:middle line:84%
But I believe, over the
course of our lives,

00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:04.330 align:middle line:90%
we can see the greater picture.

00:54:04.330 --> 00:54:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And whenever something is
unfair or upsetting to me,

00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:11.470 align:middle line:84%
I just know, wait,
I'm too zoomed in.

00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:12.780 align:middle line:90%
I zoom out.

00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:18.141 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to see that this is
not happening to me but for me.

00:54:18.141 --> 00:54:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm wrong, I'd
rather live in that reality.

00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:26.950 align:middle line:84%
Because the opposite is
those realistic cynics

00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:30.790 align:middle line:90%
that are never happy.

00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:33.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm OK with people
being skeptics.

00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:35.530 align:middle line:84%
Skeptic means you
look into things.

00:54:35.530 --> 00:54:37.200 align:middle line:84%
You want to make
sure that it's valid.

00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:38.000 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.400 align:middle line:90%
Be skeptical.

00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:42.938 align:middle line:84%
Cynics look for how
it's not possible.

00:54:42.938 --> 00:54:45.926 align:middle line:90%

00:54:45.926 --> 00:54:52.410 align:middle line:90%


00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:54.637 align:middle line:90%
Love yourself.

00:54:54.637 --> 00:54:56.220 align:middle line:84%
It'll be the hardest
thing you'll ever

00:54:56.220 --> 00:55:02.960 align:middle line:84%
have to do, but the most freeing
thing when you get there.

00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:06.840 align:middle line:84%
It will take every
day to work on.

00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:10.820 align:middle line:84%
But everything else works
when you love yourself.

00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:13.700 align:middle line:90%
Your purpose comes into focus.

00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:16.040 align:middle line:90%
The right people show up.

00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:18.980 align:middle line:90%
Money eventually comes.

00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:20.600 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't
love yourself, then

00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:22.610 align:middle line:84%
if you achieve
everything else that you

00:55:22.610 --> 00:55:25.940 align:middle line:84%
want on your bucket list,
it's never going to be enough.

00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And as cheesy as it may
sound, loving yourself

00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:34.422 align:middle line:84%
is going to have the biggest
impact on the planet, too.

00:55:34.422 --> 00:55:35.630 align:middle line:90%
Because you'll be an example.

00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:38.680 align:middle line:90%
