00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.672 align:middle line:90%


00:00:07.672 --> 00:00:09.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi, it's James here
from Food Matters,

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.990 align:middle line:10%
and I'm here today
with Kristina Karlsson,

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.480 align:middle line:10%
founder of one of the
most beautiful, stylish,

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.820 align:middle line:10%
and simplistic stationery
companies in the world,

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.640 align:middle line:10%
named after her childhood
nickname, Kikki.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.210 align:middle line:84%
It's called kikki.K. It's
grown into a global empire

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.530 align:middle line:90%
and has some incredible wares.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:25.988 align:middle line:84%
And today we're
going to be talking

00:00:25.988 --> 00:00:30.110 align:middle line:84%
about her book and her mission
to inspire people to dream big.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.200 align:middle line:90%
Kristina, how are you?

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.000 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm really well.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.880 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:33.680 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exciting.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.580 align:middle line:90%
So your story started--

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.470 align:middle line:84%
it's easy for people
to look at you and go,

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.840 align:middle line:84%
wow, you're the
successful founder

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.720 align:middle line:84%
of this beautiful
company and so stylish

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.240 align:middle line:84%
and jet setting
around the world.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.710 align:middle line:84%
But your story started in a
very different fashion, right?

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.973 align:middle line:84%
You moved to Australia and were
a bit lost for what to do next.

00:00:51.973 --> 00:00:53.390 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell me
what was happening

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.470 align:middle line:90%
at that stage of your life?

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.160 align:middle line:84%
So I grew up in Sweden, and
then I worked in a ski resort

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.920 align:middle line:84%
in Austria, where I
met my partner, Paul.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And he was from
Australia, so I decided

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.450 align:middle line:90%
to go with him to Australia.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And when I decided to stay
in Australia, I thought,

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.570 align:middle line:84%
if I'm going to stay here,
I have to do something

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.130 align:middle line:90%
that I really love.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And that was not
so easy to find,

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.210 align:middle line:84%
and I was whingeing
and complaining,

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.250 align:middle line:84%
and I just was a
little bit unsettled.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think I was asking
Paul like five times a day,

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.770 align:middle line:84%
what am I going to
do with my life?

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And one morning at
3:00 AM, I woke him up,

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.880 align:middle line:84%
I think for the fifth
time, saying, what am I

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:29.960 align:middle line:90%
going to do with my life?

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And he then very nicely
turned on the light

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.100 align:middle line:84%
and said, why don't we write
down what's important to you?

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.900 align:middle line:90%
And at 3:00 AM--

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.040 align:middle line:90%
I call it my 3:00 AM list--

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.640 align:middle line:84%
I wrote down that I wanted to
drive to work every single day

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.620 align:middle line:84%
and really loving
what I was doing.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.270 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to have a
business on my own,

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.590 align:middle line:84%
but I had no idea what
that was going to be.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.380 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to have a
connection with Sweden.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.970 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to work
with Swedish design

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.470 align:middle line:84%
because that was
one of my passions.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And then I wanted
to make $500 a week.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of was my
first dreams on paper.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And then when I looked
at that-- and it's

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.550 align:middle line:84%
a bit of a longer
story than this,

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.639 align:middle line:84%
but to make it a long story
short, I looked at that paper,

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.480 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, if I'm going to
have my own business one day,

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.310 align:middle line:84%
I have to have
beautiful stationery.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And I was growing up in
Sweden with beautiful design

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.500 align:middle line:84%
around me, and I wanted to have
something that was inspiring,

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.370 align:middle line:84%
but also beautifully
designed and good quality.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.357 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted to be organized.

00:02:24.357 --> 00:02:26.690 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, I'm going to
go out and buy some products.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And I just could
not find anything.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.862 align:middle line:90%
And then I got--

00:02:30.862 --> 00:02:31.820 align:middle line:90%
I didn't get depressed.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:32.610 align:middle line:90%
That's not the right word.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.947 align:middle line:90%
But I was like, this is boring.

00:02:33.947 --> 00:02:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And then I got super
excited, and I thought,

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually going to
start my own business,

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.860 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to open
beautiful Swedish design

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.980 align:middle line:84%
stores specializing
in stationery

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.110 align:middle line:84%
in my favorite cities,
being Paris, London, New

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.890 align:middle line:84%
York, et cetera, Sydney,
Copenhagen, London, whatever.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.860 align:middle line:90%
And I just started.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.200 align:middle line:90%
And kikki.K. was born.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So the name was after
a nickname that you had

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.060 align:middle line:90%
at school, right?

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.990 align:middle line:90%
How did that come about?

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>> I was having dinner with
a friend who was a graphic

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.750 align:middle line:84%
designer, and I liked
K as the letter.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.975 align:middle line:84%
And because I spelled
Kikki with K-I-KK-I,

00:03:11.975 --> 00:03:14.480 align:middle line:84%
it looked really
beautiful graphically.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.520 align:middle line:90%
And my last name was Karlsson.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.550 align:middle line:84%
So I put it on a
little serviette,

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:20.872 align:middle line:90%
and we were having dinner.

00:03:20.872 --> 00:03:22.580 align:middle line:84%
It was like a Tuesday
night or something.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.102 align:middle line:84%
And he had young kids,
and he was saying,

00:03:25.102 --> 00:03:26.310 align:middle line:90%
let's put it on the computer.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.910 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no, not now.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And we did it, and it's
never been changed since.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, it has been changed
a couple of times lately,

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.620 align:middle line:84%
but for a long time,
it was the same.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>> And how old were you when you
sort of came up with this idea

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.990 align:middle line:84%
for kikki.K, and what
has it grown into today?

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>> So I was 22 when
I came to Australia,

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.980 align:middle line:84%
so it took me a couple of years
before I came up with the idea.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And it started
with me asking Paul

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.210 align:middle line:84%
if he would sell his house
to open our first store.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.060 align:middle line:84%
I had this dream to
open around the world,

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.842 align:middle line:84%
and I just didn't
have any money.

00:04:03.842 --> 00:04:05.300 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, we
have to get going.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.480 align:middle line:84%
So Paul sold his house
to open the first store.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And now we have over 100
stores in five countries,

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.653 align:middle line:84%
and we sell to 147 countries
online, which blows

00:04:15.653 --> 00:04:16.820 align:middle line:90%
my mind every time I say it.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's an exciting journey,
and my biggest dream now

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.830 align:middle line:84%
is to inspire 101 million people
to write down three dreams

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.993 align:middle line:90%
and then go and chase them.

00:04:26.993 --> 00:04:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Was there a part
of you that thought,

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.400 align:middle line:84%
there's no way this
is going to happen?

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.990 align:middle line:84%
Or did you just
believe it so much

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.140 align:middle line:84%
that you just pushed
through all obstacles?

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.370 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we all
deal with self-doubt.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.010 align:middle line:84%
So having those
big dreams on paper

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.050 align:middle line:90%
seemed impossible at the time.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.800 align:middle line:84%
But because they were dreams,
I felt like, let's just

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.040 align:middle line:90%
start somewhere.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.690 align:middle line:90%
And there's a quote that I love.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.190 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
be great to start,

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.680 align:middle line:84%
but you actually have
to start to be great.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.540 align:middle line:90%
And I just started.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And because I was so excited
about this big vision

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.930 align:middle line:84%
and this big dream,
I just kept going,

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.120 align:middle line:90%
and I was just so excited.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking to
suppliers about opening stores

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.230 align:middle line:84%
around the world,
but I had no idea

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.522 align:middle line:90%
how to put together a notebook.

00:05:06.522 --> 00:05:09.850 align:middle line:84%
So of course some people
thought I was absolutely mad.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.202 align:middle line:84%
But there's another
really good quote,

00:05:12.202 --> 00:05:13.660 align:middle line:84%
which is, it's
really good that you

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:14.952 align:middle line:90%
don't know what you don't know.

00:05:14.952 --> 00:05:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Because if you knew what
you have to go through,

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.160 align:middle line:84%
all the challenges that
we all have to go through,

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.360 align:middle line:84%
it's good sometimes
not knowing that.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's
four things that really

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.260 align:middle line:90%
got to where we are today.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.450 align:middle line:90%
Number one is passion.

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.900 align:middle line:84%
I really, truly believe that
if you do something you love,

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.510 align:middle line:84%
you are going to get
through all the challenges.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.700 align:middle line:84%
Because regardless
how good our plan is,

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.020 align:middle line:90%
there is always challenges.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.670 align:middle line:84%
In a small business
or in life in general,

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.400 align:middle line:84%
there's not smooth sailing
all the way through life.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.420 align:middle line:84%
So doing something you
love is so, so important.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.960 align:middle line:90%
Number two is vision.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.640 align:middle line:84%
I think having a
clear vision, like I

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.220 align:middle line:84%
had all these amazing
locations mapped out,

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.040 align:middle line:84%
and I put clocks up
in the office walls

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.080 align:middle line:84%
to really make sure that we
were working towards that.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.600 align:middle line:84%
So having a clear vision
was also really important

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.050 align:middle line:84%
in terms of when
tough times hit us,

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.410 align:middle line:84%
which they have throughout the
years, and also for the team

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.432 align:middle line:84%
to know where we're going,
so having that clear vision.

00:06:14.432 --> 00:06:15.640 align:middle line:90%
Number three is don't say no.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.480 align:middle line:90%
Say how.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.330 align:middle line:84%
I think as a small business,
most small businesses,

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.180 align:middle line:84%
with the statistics, it's
they fail really quickly.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And not giving up, I
think, is a key ingredient

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.560 align:middle line:84%
to really succeed
when you start.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.110 align:middle line:84%
So in our office wall,
we have don't say no.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.910 align:middle line:90%
Say how.

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:32.130 align:middle line:90%
There is always a way.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.870 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes you have
to look at your ways

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.230 align:middle line:90%
in a different way.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And then the fourth
one is dreaming.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.398 align:middle line:84%
Because I dream in
my personal life,

00:06:41.398 --> 00:06:42.940 align:middle line:84%
but I also dream
within the business.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.060 align:middle line:84%
Because then it takes all
the restrictions away.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Because if you just look
at what's realistic,

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.030 align:middle line:84%
you probably wouldn't be able
to do what you want to do.

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:57.200 align:middle line:84%
So dreaming is a really big part
of starting a business as well.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>> So part of that dream to
help bring your idea of dreaming

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.850 align:middle line:84%
to other people was to
write a book, right?

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:05.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And in that book, you sort
of break down this process

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:10.420 align:middle line:90%
of setting goals.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:11.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.290 align:middle line:84%
>> And one of the things that
people first confront when they

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.300 align:middle line:84%
set goals is they start
writing them down,

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.430 align:middle line:84%
but then they start
thinking to themselves,

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.680 align:middle line:84%
there's no way I'm going to
be able to do that, right?

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.170 align:middle line:84%
This self-limiting
voice comes in.

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about what's
happening in that process

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.100 align:middle line:84%
and how people can
move through it.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:32.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well, I think if we
are starting by setting goals,

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.030 align:middle line:90%
we often stretch ourselves.

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.560 align:middle line:84%
We might look at
where we are today,

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.590 align:middle line:84%
and we might say, well,
my next step in my career.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.420 align:middle line:84%
Or it might be
that I want to run

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.090 align:middle line:84%
a bit further or a
bit faster or whatever

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.830 align:middle line:84%
it is in terms of
different goals

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.050 align:middle line:84%
and different
aspects of your life.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.150 align:middle line:84%
But I think if you do
that, you limit yourself.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:52.210 align:middle line:84%
Because then you
might have been all

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.640 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden in a role that
might not be your dream role,

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:59.090 align:middle line:84%
and it might be not your
dream life as it is right now.

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:01.030 align:middle line:84%
So I like to not
think about goals.

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:03.220 align:middle line:90%
I like to start with dreaming.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And then I like to ask
myself a few questions.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And that is, what would you
do if you couldn't fail?

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:12.160 align:middle line:84%
If you had all the money,
because often money restricts

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.760 align:middle line:84%
the way that we think that we
can do things because we say,

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.510 align:middle line:84%
I can't do that because
I can't afford it,

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:20.100 align:middle line:84%
or it's not possible because
of my salary or whatever.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.850 align:middle line:84%
So what would you do
if you couldn't fail?

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:25.000 align:middle line:84%
If you had all the money, the
resources, and the knowledge,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.370 align:middle line:84%
and the time, and
the energy and health

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:30.220 align:middle line:84%
to do whatever you
want to do in life?

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Then it often brings
up things that

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:38.120 align:middle line:84%
might be completely different
to where we are right now today.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:43.419 align:middle line:84%
So I think we are very
encouraged by parents, perhaps.

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:46.283 align:middle line:84%
Schools-- you might be super
smart in school and end up

00:08:46.283 --> 00:08:48.700 align:middle line:84%
in the most amazing school,
and then you go to university,

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.690 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden you are
in a role that maybe was

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.610 align:middle line:84%
your parents' dreams or your
teachers' because you were

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:56.410 align:middle line:90%
so talented.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:09:00.760 align:middle line:84%
So I meet a lot of people when
I do my talks and my workshops

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:05.180 align:middle line:84%
about dreaming that actually
are not living their own dream

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:05.980 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.940 align:middle line:84%
They are either influenced
by parents or schools

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:13.620 align:middle line:84%
or social media today
as well, of course.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Talking to that
point a little bit,

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.640 align:middle line:84%
how do you feel the culture sort
of impacts the dreams that we

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.810 align:middle line:84%
set, and/or schooling
or social media?

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:26.850 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of the
times we're setting goals

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:28.590 align:middle line:90%
that are very materialistic.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:34.710 align:middle line:84%
It's like things, accumulating
houses, cars, planes,

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:36.030 align:middle line:90%
whatever it is.

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:37.680 align:middle line:90%
And yet we're not--

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.600 align:middle line:84%
I feel like we're getting
that from society.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.892 align:middle line:90%
We're getting that from social.

00:09:40.892 --> 00:09:45.000 align:middle line:84%
What do you think is influencing
this nature of goal setting?

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think
in today's world,

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:50.242 align:middle line:84%
you can see what everyone
else, what they're doing,

00:09:50.242 --> 00:09:51.450 align:middle line:90%
but also what they're having.

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And if people are
doing well, they

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.680 align:middle line:90%
might be posting about that.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.160 align:middle line:84%
They might not post about how
they worked so hard to get it.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.110 align:middle line:84%
So I think we're
influenced by that.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we all want
to live in the most beautiful

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.230 align:middle line:84%
home, and we all want to
drive the car of our dreams

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:07.380 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.300 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's just a
natural thing that we do,

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.690 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
a lot of people do.

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:17.350 align:middle line:84%
But the way that I do it is
to dream in different areas.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:19.338 align:middle line:84%
So what are your
dreams for your health?

00:10:19.338 --> 00:10:21.130 align:middle line:84%
If you could have
anything for your health,

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:22.070 align:middle line:90%
what would that be?

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:23.820 align:middle line:84%
Would you be the fittest
you've ever been,

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:27.970 align:middle line:84%
or would you start yoga or
meditation or whatever it is?

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And then I also think that we
should dream for our community.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.310 align:middle line:84%
So we might be heartbroken
because you lost someone,

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:38.412 align:middle line:84%
or someone was ill, or you
might have an illness yourself.

00:10:38.412 --> 00:10:39.870 align:middle line:84%
So you might feel
really passionate

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:43.650 align:middle line:84%
about something that
has influenced you.

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:46.680 align:middle line:84%
So I think dreaming in
the community areas,

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.050 align:middle line:84%
dreaming about health,
but then also dreaming

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:51.480 align:middle line:84%
about your career and
your life and your family

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.000 align:middle line:90%
or relationships or friends.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.700 align:middle line:84%
So I think you should
dream in all aspects,

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.290 align:middle line:84%
not just about what you
actually want to buy.

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And most of my dreams
now are fun dreams

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:04.350 align:middle line:84%
of things that I
want to travel to

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.050 align:middle line:84%
and things I want
to do with my family

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:11.100 align:middle line:84%
or friends or people I
want to meet, for example.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:15.100 align:middle line:84%
In my book, I have a
whole 101 people to meet,

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.030 align:middle line:84%
because I just find the most
interesting thing in life

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:20.340 align:middle line:90%
is to meet interesting people.

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.010 align:middle line:84%
So I just add to that all the
time when I read about someone

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:27.180 align:middle line:84%
or see someone interesting
on television or in a book

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:28.020 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:32.940 align:middle line:84%
So I love dreaming because
there is no limits to dreaming.

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.583 align:middle line:90%
>> And let's speak to that.

00:11:34.583 --> 00:11:36.500 align:middle line:84%
I want to speak to
something else in a second.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.920 align:middle line:84%
But can you tell me about
some of your dreams?

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.590 align:middle line:84%
Because I love how
obscure they are,

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:43.453 align:middle line:84%
like riding Icelandic horses
or going or African safari,

00:11:43.453 --> 00:11:45.120 align:middle line:84%
which you did with
your family recently.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.090 align:middle line:84%
So tell me about some
of the experience dreams

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:48.060 align:middle line:90%
that you wrote down.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:48.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.960 align:middle line:84%
So one of my dreams,
which I think

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.170 align:middle line:84%
is very suitable
for this program,

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:56.123 align:middle line:84%
is I want to be a
yoga teacher one day.

00:11:56.123 --> 00:11:58.040 align:middle line:84%
But I don't have time
for that now because you

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.380 align:middle line:84%
have to do a lot of
hours, and I want

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:04.040 align:middle line:84%
to just do yoga when I feel
like it, not because I have to.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:08.180 align:middle line:84%
So I decided that I wanted
to become a yoga teacher when

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:13.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm 60 because my dream
is to live till I'm 120.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.300 align:middle line:84%
So I'm thinking if I start at
60, I have quite a few years

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:17.450 align:middle line:90%
to practice yoga.

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny because
I actually then started

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:25.430 align:middle line:84%
to search for yoga teachers,
and I found one yoga teacher who

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:29.120 align:middle line:84%
is still practicing yoga and
teaching yoga in New York,

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.550 align:middle line:90%
and she is 101.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:34.470 align:middle line:84%
So things like
that is really fun.

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:38.690 align:middle line:84%
Other dreams that I have are
to give a brilliant speech

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:41.730 align:middle line:90%
when my son is turning 50.

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:44.270 align:middle line:84%
So that means that I have to
be really healthy because I

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:45.890 align:middle line:90%
will be a bit older then.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And I want to say something
really funny and good,

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:53.090 align:middle line:84%
so it's another incentive
to really keep healthy.

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:56.960 align:middle line:84%
But then I also want to
build my own dream home.

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:01.070 align:middle line:84%
I want to live like two months
in all my favorite cities

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:05.400 align:middle line:84%
as a local, not just in a hotel
and do all the typical tourist

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.200 align:middle line:90%
stuff.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.440 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to experience different
cultures and meet local people

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.967 align:middle line:90%
and live in a home.

00:13:10.967 --> 00:13:12.050 align:middle line:90%
So there's lots of dreams.

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And every day I
add to my dreams.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:16.710 align:middle line:84%
I think it's so
much fun to dream.

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:17.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:18.770 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:20.900 align:middle line:84%
In your book, there's
the lady from Zimbabwe

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.890 align:middle line:84%
who's become one of
Oprah's favorite people.

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And I found her story so
inspirational, so incredible,

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:32.090 align:middle line:84%
just how even dreaming
big with having access

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:37.160 align:middle line:84%
to no resources, no wealth,
really in a very dire state

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.220 align:middle line:84%
can still open up-- there's
possibilities that can open up

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.390 align:middle line:90%
and that things can happen.

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:44.840 align:middle line:84%
Because I think that she's maybe
created this environment of,

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:45.850 align:middle line:90%
this is a possibility.

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>> But there was a grandmother
or an advisor or somebody

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.050 align:middle line:84%
in her community
that said, wait,

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:54.665 align:middle line:84%
you have to add one more
dream to your dreams.

00:13:54.665 --> 00:13:55.790 align:middle line:90%
It can't just be about you.

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:57.207 align:middle line:84%
It has to be about
your community.

00:13:57.207 --> 00:13:58.782 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:13:58.782 --> 00:14:00.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe tell me a little
bit about that story.

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.360 align:middle line:84%
Because you went and met
with her recently, right?

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:02.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:03.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:05.930 align:middle line:84%
Maybe tell me a little
bit about that story,

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:08.210 align:middle line:84%
how you had one of
your goals to meet her,

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:09.710 align:middle line:90%
and how you did meet her.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And then the aspect
of her making

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:14.340 align:middle line:84%
it bigger than just her
dream of going to university.

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:15.590 align:middle line:90%
It became about the community.

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:17.132 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to hear
that story from you.

00:14:17.132 --> 00:14:18.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:22.940 align:middle line:84%
So when I wrote my book, I kept
thinking about the young people

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:26.980 align:middle line:84%
in my life that could
benefit from the dreaming

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:27.780 align:middle line:90%
that I've done.

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to pass
on what I've learned.

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:33.980 align:middle line:84%
But then I kept thinking
about my book group, who

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:37.710 align:middle line:84%
are in my age or older, and
they all achieved so many

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:38.510 align:middle line:90%
of their dreams.

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking,
I wonder if they

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.820 align:middle line:84%
would love dreaming as
much as these young people

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.170 align:middle line:90%
that I'm trying to encourage.

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:49.340 align:middle line:84%
So I did this exercise, which is
in my book, called 101 dreams.

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, of course, it
has nothing to do with age.

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:54.920 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
how old you are

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:59.330 align:middle line:84%
because you will keep dreaming
until your end of your life.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And one of my
girlfriends, Anna Coren,

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:03.950 align:middle line:90%
she called me the day after.

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:05.450 align:middle line:90%
She was so inspired by dreaming.

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I came across
this amazing woman who

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:12.120 align:middle line:84%
is an African lady, but she
is like a dreamer like you.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.120 align:middle line:84%
So she said, you have to
listen to this podcast.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:18.330 align:middle line:84%
So I did, and that is when
everything came together

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:19.130 align:middle line:90%
for me.

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Because when I was
writing the book,

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:24.080 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to do something
for someone else.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.490 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to support a charity.

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And we support a lot
of things at kikki.K,

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.900 align:middle line:84%
but we haven't
found one that felt

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:32.090 align:middle line:90%
like really aligned with us.

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, this is
perfect because Tererai,

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.210 align:middle line:84%
she has like 12 schools
in Zimbabwe now.

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:39.200 align:middle line:90%
So we have stationery.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.750 align:middle line:84%
So we've just given
stationery to all the schools.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And she is also a dreamer,
and it really connects us.

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:47.570 align:middle line:84%
So I contacted her
and I said, I would

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:49.850 align:middle line:90%
love to support your schools.

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And my dream is to give a
US dollar per book sold.

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.255 align:middle line:84%
And my dream is to sell 1
million books so I can give her

00:15:58.255 --> 00:15:59.570 align:middle line:90%
a million dollars.

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And I think she thought
I was a bit crazy

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:05.270 align:middle line:84%
because, of course, first
sell 1 million books is not

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:06.290 align:middle line:90%
the easiest task.

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:07.130 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:10.850 align:middle line:84%
But that's what I'm
working all the time

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:13.392 align:middle line:84%
to see if I can
achieve that, but also

00:16:13.392 --> 00:16:15.350 align:middle line:84%
being able to support
the stationery and things

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:16.150 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:19.190 align:middle line:84%
So I contacted her, and
when I launched a book,

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:21.380 align:middle line:84%
we did the book
signings together.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:24.390 align:middle line:90%
And she is an amazing woman.

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:26.360 align:middle line:90%
She is my biggest inspiration.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why I share
her story both in my book,

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:31.280 align:middle line:84%
but also on my
podcast, is because she

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.210 align:middle line:90%
had absolutely nothing.

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:36.410 align:middle line:84%
So Tererai, she grew up
in a culture in Zimbabwe

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:40.040 align:middle line:84%
where she was married away
as an 11-year-old girl.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And she had I think
five kids before 18

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:49.730 align:middle line:84%
and abused and lived in a very
challenging culture, where

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:51.050 align:middle line:90%
she didn't have much.

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't get
to go to school.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.430 align:middle line:90%
She couldn't write and read.

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:58.310 align:middle line:84%
So an American woman
came to her village

00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:59.990 align:middle line:90%
and said, what are your dreams?

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And she was like, how can I
possibly dream when for me it's

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.849 align:middle line:90%
about survival?

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And the American woman,
she kept asking her.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And then she said, well, if
I can do anything in my life,

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:15.960 align:middle line:84%
I would love first to get
an education here and then

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:16.760 align:middle line:90%
university.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:22.160 align:middle line:84%
And my biggest dreams would
be to have a PhD in America.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And she actually went
home to her mother,

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.300 align:middle line:84%
and her mother said,
if you're going

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:30.140 align:middle line:84%
to do all that, I think
you should add one more

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:32.810 align:middle line:84%
dream for the betterment
of other people.

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:34.910 align:middle line:90%
So she did add--

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:38.480 align:middle line:84%
her last dream was to come back
to the community, if she could

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.060 align:middle line:84%
achieve all that, come
back to the community

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:44.690 align:middle line:84%
and then help other girls
not going through what

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:46.040 align:middle line:90%
she had to go through.

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:51.110 align:middle line:84%
So to make a very long story
short, she achieved all that--

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:52.250 align:middle line:90%
unbelievable.

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:56.090 align:middle line:90%
And she got her PhD.

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:57.530 align:middle line:90%
Oprah heard about her.

00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:59.390 align:middle line:90%
She got invited for the show.

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:03.470 align:middle line:84%
She got invited to the show, and
she got invited a second time.

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And Oprah gave her $1.5
million to go back and achieve

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.710 align:middle line:84%
her last dream, which
is unbelievable.

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:13.160 align:middle line:90%
And now she has 12 schools.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And what I love about that
story is that she had nothing,

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:22.010 align:middle line:84%
and she had all the
hurdles and challenges

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:24.780 align:middle line:84%
that I think we all
feel that we have.

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:28.490 align:middle line:84%
But at least most
of us have a phone.

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:33.500 align:middle line:84%
Most of us have food, internet,
and somewhere to stay,

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.170 align:middle line:90%
and she didn't have all that.

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I like
sharing her story,

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:42.080 align:middle line:84%
because I think it's
so powerful for people

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.840 align:middle line:84%
to hear that she
achieved all that.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And what she's doing now
is just unbelievable.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:51.140 align:middle line:84%
She just became a statue in
New York, one of the 10 women

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:53.060 align:middle line:84%
who just became
statues in New York.

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And I was there, and I was
just so incredibly proud

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:58.130 align:middle line:84%
because what she
had to go through

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:01.880 align:middle line:84%
and what she is changing
in her community,

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.160 align:middle line:84%
having seen that
myself recently,

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.450 align:middle line:90%
was just unbelievable.

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:07.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:08.480 align:middle line:90%
Well told.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's so cool you're
involved with her and her story

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.860 align:middle line:84%
and kikki.K is
aligned with that.

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And I can't imagine
these schools

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:18.710 align:middle line:84%
having such beautiful stationery
in the middle of nowhere,

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:19.800 align:middle line:90%
just stunning.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:21.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's so nice because they
are so grateful, the kids.

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And we've actually just done a
collaboration together, kikki.K

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:30.550 align:middle line:84%
and Tererai, where we're giving
a percentage of all the sales

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:32.970 align:middle line:84%
in that collection to
support the schools.

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:36.950 align:middle line:84%
So one of her biggest challenges
is to sustain the schools.

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And she wants to
create an income that

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:43.490 align:middle line:84%
is ongoing versus just doing
talks and really relying

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:44.670 align:middle line:90%
on her income.

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:48.270 align:middle line:84%
So this is one thing
that we're doing together

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:50.510 align:middle line:90%
so we can support the schools.

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:52.110 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:52.910 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:55.380 align:middle line:90%


00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:57.700 align:middle line:90%
So we've spoken about purpose.

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:00.350 align:middle line:90%
We've spoken about giving back.

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:03.110 align:middle line:90%
That's a big part of it.

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk a
little bit here now

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.530 align:middle line:84%
about how self-care rituals
can be so important.

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:11.750 align:middle line:84%
Because when we
set all these goals

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:15.070 align:middle line:84%
and we have these sort of ideas
to go out and conquer the world

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:17.830 align:middle line:84%
or achieve all these things,
sometimes we can burn out.

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:20.920 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we don't look after
the most important asset

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.990 align:middle line:84%
of achieving that goal,
which is ourselves.

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:26.620 align:middle line:84%
How do you bring sort of
self-care and even self-love,

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:28.930 align:middle line:84%
I would say, because a lot
of us beat ourselves up

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:30.310 align:middle line:90%
with our own internal voice.

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:32.360 align:middle line:84%
You can't do it, or
you too overweight,

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.840 align:middle line:84%
or you're not pretty enough,
or whatever it might be.

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:37.120 align:middle line:84%
How do we temper those
voices, and how do we

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:41.360 align:middle line:84%
use self-love and self-care
to be able to serve our dreams

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.160 align:middle line:90%
and others?

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:42.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.430 align:middle line:84%
I do think that each individual
will have to find something

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:47.150 align:middle line:90%
that is inspiring to them.

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:48.970 align:middle line:84%
So for me, for example,
I'm a bit of a--

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:53.950 align:middle line:84%
I like my own space, and I like
to start the morning on my own.

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:56.470 align:middle line:84%
So I have something that
I call my holy hour.

00:20:56.470 --> 00:21:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And my ideal morning would
start at 5:00 AM, when

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:05.200 align:middle line:84%
it's still dark or the sun is
coming up and it's just me.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And I always start with writing
three pages, morning pages,

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:12.130 align:middle line:90%
inspired by Julia Cameron.

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And then I always have loads
of ideas out of writing

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:16.820 align:middle line:90%
whatever comes to mind.

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:18.362 align:middle line:84%
And then I have
another journal where

00:21:18.362 --> 00:21:19.450 align:middle line:90%
I capture all those ideas.

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:21.700 align:middle line:84%
Because the first morning
pages I don't actually save,

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.140 align:middle line:90%
but the other one I do.

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And then I always
do some learning,

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:27.790 align:middle line:84%
because that is something
that really inspires me.

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And that keeps me going,
and I always want to share.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:35.118 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of my
values is to learn,

00:21:35.118 --> 00:21:37.160 align:middle line:84%
but then also to share
everything that I learned.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.760 align:middle line:84%
So I do that in the morning,
and then I meditate.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And then between 6:00
and 7:00-- this is ideal.

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:46.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm not perfect in any
way, so this is my ideal.

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And then I exercise
between 6:00 and 7:00.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.620 align:middle line:84%
That could be running,
walking, yoga,

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:53.560 align:middle line:84%
whatever I feel like doing,
just some kind of movement.

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And then by the time
I'm home at 7:00

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.760 align:middle line:84%
and then it's all about
getting the kids to school

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:01.750 align:middle line:84%
or whatever I need
to do, that is really

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:05.230 align:middle line:84%
what gets me to feel that
I really care for myself.

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:07.570 align:middle line:84%
Because whatever that
day then brings me--

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:10.400 align:middle line:84%
it could be important
meetings or urgent meetings,

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.660 align:middle line:84%
or it could be other
people's agenda,

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.715 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I had
that self-care.

00:22:15.715 --> 00:22:17.590 align:middle line:84%
But I think everyone
needs to find their own,

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:19.010 align:middle line:90%
whatever that is for them.

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:21.940 align:middle line:84%
It could be that you go spend
a lot of time in nature.

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:25.060 align:middle line:84%
Or one of, I think, the
most important things

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:27.670 align:middle line:84%
in today's world is
disconnect to reconnect in

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:31.180 align:middle line:84%
terms of turning those phones
off sometimes, or the screens.

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:34.372 align:middle line:84%
Because I think we
are on all the time.

00:22:34.372 --> 00:22:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's
really difficult

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:38.130 align:middle line:84%
to actually care for
yourself if you're always on

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:40.630 align:middle line:84%
and you're always thinking about
what other people are doing

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:43.180 align:middle line:84%
and actually taking some
time to really think about,

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:45.270 align:middle line:84%
if I could do whatever I
wanted to do in my life,

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:46.070 align:middle line:90%
what would that be?

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like that is
the biggest self-care

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:50.310 align:middle line:90%
that you can possibly give you.

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:51.130 align:middle line:90%
>> It's beautiful.

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:51.590 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:52.430 align:middle line:90%
Space, huh?

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:53.230 align:middle line:90%
Really space.

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:54.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Space.

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>> In terms of practical tips,
your inspiration is to inspire

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:00.050 align:middle line:90%
101 million people, right?

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:02.390 align:middle line:84%
To write down just
three goals there.

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:03.920 align:middle line:90%
But you have three dreams.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:06.290 align:middle line:84%
But you have-- there is
one section of your book--

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:08.570 align:middle line:84%
and I've been going on
this, and I'm loving it.

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:10.080 align:middle line:84%
I always love--
but I'm with you.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.050 align:middle line:84%
I love setting
goals because as you

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:15.600 align:middle line:84%
set them and you achieve six out
of your 20, you're like, whoa,

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:16.400 align:middle line:90%
I can do this.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And then it cascades
and you keep going.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Because I think we underestimate
how powerful we really are.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:23.570 align:middle line:90%
But you're very much--

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:25.550 align:middle line:84%
one of your key
practical ideas is

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:27.440 align:middle line:84%
to get people to write
them down and then

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.670 align:middle line:90%
look at them every day.

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:31.910 align:middle line:84%
So what's your practical
advice to somebody

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:33.223 align:middle line:90%
who's just starting out?

00:23:33.223 --> 00:23:34.640 align:middle line:84%
Is it just write
down three goals.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:35.515 align:middle line:90%
Look at it every day?

00:23:35.515 --> 00:23:38.820 align:middle line:90%
Is that where people can start?

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:41.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I think everyone should
start with no restrictions,

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.240 align:middle line:90%
just whatever comes to mind.

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.020 align:middle line:84%
What would you do if
you couldn't fail?

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:47.900 align:middle line:84%
If you had all the money,
the resources, the knowledge,

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.270 align:middle line:84%
and the time, the
energy, and the health

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:53.120 align:middle line:84%
to do whatever you want
to do, what comes to mind?

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And just keep
writing and writing.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.420 align:middle line:90%
It could be small dreams.

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:57.890 align:middle line:90%
It could be big dreams.

00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And really, then,
start capturing.

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And the more you dream,
I feel like that's

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.370 align:middle line:84%
like a practice like
meditation or yoga.

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:06.590 align:middle line:84%
The more you practice,
the better you get.

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:08.900 align:middle line:90%
And just keep adding to them.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:12.890 align:middle line:84%
And then at some stage,
decide which three

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:14.180 align:middle line:90%
you're going to focus on.

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:19.140 align:middle line:84%
These can all be
long-term dreams

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:20.390 align:middle line:90%
or could be short-term dreams.

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:21.432 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't really matter.

00:24:21.432 --> 00:24:24.530 align:middle line:84%
But it's really just about
moving forward and making sure

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:27.620 align:middle line:84%
that you're living a life
that is true to yourself.

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:31.850 align:middle line:84%
I always find it quite sad
to meet people who are not

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:32.977 align:middle line:90%
living their dream life.

00:24:32.977 --> 00:24:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And when I say dream life,
it's not a perfect life

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:37.790 align:middle line:84%
because we know that
the bigger the dreams,

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:42.470 align:middle line:84%
the more challenges we get to
have, which is part of life.

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:44.960 align:middle line:84%
But I always think that
at the end of your life,

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.880 align:middle line:84%
you want to look
back and say, well, I

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.270 align:middle line:84%
did at least a few things that
was really important to me.

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:53.240 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like
life goes so fast,

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.250 align:middle line:84%
then even if we do get
to live a long life,

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:56.600 align:middle line:90%
life is pretty short.

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.120 align:middle line:84%
So I always want to make
sure that I do things

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.240 align:middle line:90%
that I love doing.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And of course, helping
others and dreaming also

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.830 align:middle line:84%
for community and family
and friends, et cetera.

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:08.990 align:middle line:84%
But really do something
that you love.

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:11.960 align:middle line:84%
So starting with just writing
down whatever comes to mind

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.090 align:middle line:90%
is my biggest step.

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:15.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:18.285 align:middle line:84%
A common theme that we've
had in some of our work

00:25:18.285 --> 00:25:19.910 align:middle line:84%
that we've done
previously, and I think

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:22.280 align:middle line:84%
it aligns with a lot
of what you're doing,

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.890 align:middle line:84%
is around purpose,
discovering purpose.

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And people get quite
daunted by that idea.

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:29.330 align:middle line:84%
They're like,
well, I don't know.

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:30.360 align:middle line:90%
What am I here to do?

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.400 align:middle line:90%
What's my purpose?

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:35.240 align:middle line:84%
How do you advise people
on discovering more

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.880 align:middle line:84%
about what their purpose might
be, their mission in life,

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.260 align:middle line:90%
like what they're here to do?

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:41.300 align:middle line:84%
How can people tap
into that more?

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:44.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I really think
that spending some time with

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:47.870 align:middle line:84%
yourself and really ask yourself
what is important to me,

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:49.130 align:middle line:90%
and what are your values.

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:52.650 align:middle line:84%
Like I love Dr. Demartini's
values-based test

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:54.470 align:middle line:90%
that you can do online for free.

00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:55.460 align:middle line:90%
I have that in my book.

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:58.310 align:middle line:84%
But there's a few other ways
of coming up with your values.

00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:02.540 align:middle line:84%
But really making sure
that you find out what

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:03.750 align:middle line:90%
is really important to you.

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:08.660 align:middle line:84%
Because I think sometimes we get
so influenced by other people

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:12.380 align:middle line:84%
that all of a sudden you turn 50
and you have a mid-life crisis

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:15.740 align:middle line:84%
and you realize that I'm
actually not living my purpose

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.870 align:middle line:90%
or what is important to me.

00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And I want to encourage people
to do that before that happens.

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:24.770 align:middle line:84%
Often it is someone
passes away or sickness

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:27.290 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is that
gets you to realize

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:28.190 align:middle line:90%
what is your purpose.

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:31.720 align:middle line:84%
But you can actually do all
that work without having that

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.650 align:middle line:84%
and enjoy the
process a bit more.

00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:36.110 align:middle line:84%
But one of my
mentors, Robin Sharma,

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:40.340 align:middle line:84%
he's told me once, never
waste a good crisis.

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And I've never understood
that, but as I've

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:46.100 align:middle line:84%
gone through a few
challenging times, since then

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:48.350 align:middle line:84%
I always think he was
right because that's

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:50.870 align:middle line:84%
when the growth is, when you
are actually really suffering

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:53.480 align:middle line:84%
or really of
finding it difficult

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:55.190 align:middle line:84%
and going through
the challenges,

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:57.920 align:middle line:84%
whatever that might be
for each individual.

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:00.650 align:middle line:84%
That's when you really are
digging deep and finding

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:01.880 align:middle line:90%
what is important to me.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of
finding your purpose.

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:06.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:08.780 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that comes up, another

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:12.260 align:middle line:84%
question I have around
values, is really

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:14.600 align:middle line:84%
people find that a bit
of an abstract idea.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And I know you
referenced Demartini,

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:17.780 align:middle line:84%
but I'd like to
hear it from you.

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:20.630 align:middle line:84%
I've done some values
alignment work.

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:23.420 align:middle line:84%
I did it with Tony Robbins
at a Date with Destiny.

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:24.980 align:middle line:90%
It was a six-day event.

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:27.770 align:middle line:84%
A big part of it is to
write down or discover

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:29.840 align:middle line:84%
what your previous values
were without you really

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:33.920 align:middle line:84%
knowing about it and what
your ideal values would be.

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And they were things
and words that I'd never

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:41.330 align:middle line:84%
used to describe my life before,
like freedom, or adventure,

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:44.440 align:middle line:84%
or love, or
compassion, or service.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And so could you help
describe for people listening

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:50.020 align:middle line:84%
to this interview what
some of these values

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:52.910 align:middle line:84%
might be so they can start
to identify with them

00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:53.710 align:middle line:90%
a little bit?

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:55.918 align:middle line:84%
So if they're struggling,
what's this idea of values,

00:27:55.918 --> 00:27:58.107 align:middle line:84%
you can share what some
of the words would be

00:27:58.107 --> 00:27:59.440 align:middle line:90%
or what some of your values are.

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.420 align:middle line:84%
>> My biggest value
is actually learning,

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:03.190 align:middle line:90%
like personal development.

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And it took me a long time to
realize that that was actually

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:07.930 align:middle line:90%
one of my biggest learning.

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:10.210 align:middle line:84%
Because I love learning
in so many different ways,

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:13.810 align:middle line:84%
but I don't really love
learning about new cars.

00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:15.910 align:middle line:84%
It was really about
improving my life.

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's what our
purpose of kikki.K

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:22.630 align:middle line:84%
is, to inspire people to live
their best life every day.

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:25.750 align:middle line:84%
So finding values that
are true to yourself,

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:27.580 align:middle line:84%
you really need
to spend some time

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:31.212 align:middle line:84%
to think about if you
could do anything today,

00:28:31.212 --> 00:28:32.920 align:middle line:84%
what would you actually
spend time doing?

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And then really think about,
what would I choose to do?

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:39.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
why Dr. Demartini does

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:43.210 align:middle line:84%
such a great job, because he
doesn't cover just one thing.

00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Because I think he gives
a really good example

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:49.650 align:middle line:84%
that most people who you ask
about their values, if I say

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:51.470 align:middle line:84%
is financial freedom
one of your values,

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:52.960 align:middle line:90%
most people would say yes.

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:55.783 align:middle line:84%
And then you ask, what
are you doing about it?

00:28:55.783 --> 00:28:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And most people will
say, well, I'm not really

00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:01.430 align:middle line:84%
doing anything because it's
not their highest value.

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:04.000 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, for
me, financial freedom

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.210 align:middle line:84%
is not my highest value,
but freedom on my own time

00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:09.380 align:middle line:90%
is really, really high up there.

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.230 align:middle line:84%
So I think you should
spend some time

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:13.640 align:middle line:84%
and really work out what
is important to you.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And if you can have a
whole free day, what would

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:19.690 align:middle line:90%
you spend your time doing?

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And that often gets you a bit
of an idea on what actually

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:26.860 align:middle line:84%
is true, not just what
you say is true, but also

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:29.910 align:middle line:84%
what you actually want
to spend your time doing.

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Well done.

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:31.130 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:33.050 align:middle line:84%
Freedom is one of my
top ones, I discovered.

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And it was very low down
previously in my old values

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.725 align:middle line:90%
that I discovered.

00:29:37.725 --> 00:29:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And then when I sort
of realigned them,

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:40.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, no, freedom.

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And also-- I'm trying to
word this the right way,

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:49.070 align:middle line:84%
but inspiring others, helping
unlock potential in people,

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:54.860 align:middle line:84%
helping unlock possibility
to heal, to connect, to move

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:56.600 align:middle line:90%
through challenges in life.

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And that became what
we did after that.

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:02.270 align:middle line:84%
Food Matters was not yet born
when I did that values work.

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:03.905 align:middle line:84%
And then from the
freedom component,

00:30:03.905 --> 00:30:05.900 align:middle line:84%
getting to make films
and travel the world

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:08.570 align:middle line:84%
and meet interesting people
is ultimate alignment.

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:12.360 align:middle line:84%
So really my work became
my values in a lot of ways.

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.200 align:middle line:90%
It's powerful stuff.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And I really do think that
life is too short not to do

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:20.130 align:middle line:90%
what you love, and every day.

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:22.190 align:middle line:84%
When I did a podcast
yesterday, even that

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:24.900 align:middle line:90%
was out of my comfort zone.

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:26.430 align:middle line:90%
I just love it.

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And talking about things like
this, this is what I love.

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And sharing and
learning is definitely

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:35.510 align:middle line:90%
high up there on my values.

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:38.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Being of service to others
I think is something that gets

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:42.890 align:middle line:84%
grossly under looked when
we start to do goal setting.

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:46.740 align:middle line:84%
But in a lot of the work that
I've done interviewing people,

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:50.060 align:middle line:84%
it's in serving others that
so much fulfillment, so much

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:51.530 align:middle line:90%
happiness comes from that.

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:54.020 align:middle line:84%
You've got the stationary
company, and it's beautiful,

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:56.443 align:middle line:84%
and you make people's
homes look amazing.

00:30:56.443 --> 00:30:57.860 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think
anything lit you

00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:00.560 align:middle line:84%
up as much as giving
those kids that stationery

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:01.850 align:middle line:90%
in those schools.

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:05.060 align:middle line:84%
So can you speak to
how much you think

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:08.360 align:middle line:84%
giving back and having a
greater purpose to your work

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:09.988 align:middle line:90%
and serving others is important?

00:31:09.988 --> 00:31:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Is that something that you think
people should be focusing on

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:13.790 align:middle line:90%
more and more?

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:17.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think everyone
should focus on what they love.

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think if you
do what you love,

00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:22.640 align:middle line:84%
and because of
doing all that you

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:26.720 align:middle line:84%
are able to share your
passions and your purpose

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.698 align:middle line:84%
with other people, and that
means that they are inspired,

00:31:29.698 --> 00:31:30.990 align:middle line:90%
and then they will be inspired.

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:32.720 align:middle line:90%
So it's a lovely ripple effect.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:37.070 align:middle line:90%
But one of my values is sharing.

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Since the day I can
remember, I always love,

00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:42.620 align:middle line:84%
if I'm reading a great
book, I always share it,

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:44.255 align:middle line:84%
and I absolutely
love sharing it.

00:31:44.255 --> 00:31:46.910 align:middle line:84%
So that became part of
the kikki.K purpose.

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And I always encourage
people to share

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:52.430 align:middle line:90%
whatever field they are in.

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Because there is always
someone behind you

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:58.850 align:middle line:84%
in terms of starting out in life
that could do with some help.

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And there is always someone
who is less fortunate than you.

00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:05.277 align:middle line:84%
So whatever you can do
to help, and I always say

00:32:05.277 --> 00:32:06.860 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't have to
be a lot of things.

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:09.770 align:middle line:84%
It could be that you read
to a child that might not

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:12.110 align:middle line:84%
have parents, or it could
be that you, instead

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:15.350 align:middle line:84%
of buying two coffees,
you take that money

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:17.790 align:middle line:84%
and you put that into
something that you care about.

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:19.910 align:middle line:84%
So I think you can
do so many things,

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:21.540 align:middle line:84%
but you need to be
passionate about it.

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:23.720 align:middle line:84%
So if you are passionate
about something

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:27.110 align:middle line:84%
that you have been affected
by, I think support that.

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Because there's so much
to do in the world.

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And I think sometimes we
get a little bit overwhelmed

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:33.608 align:middle line:90%
by wanting to save the world.

00:32:33.608 --> 00:32:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at the
world like, where do you start

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:39.200 align:middle line:90%
and what can I do?

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.170 align:middle line:84%
What can me as an
individual do to this world,

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:45.380 align:middle line:84%
that it feels completely
unrealistic and really

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:46.370 align:middle line:90%
hard to get to.

00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:48.620 align:middle line:84%
But you can start
small, and you can

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:51.110 align:middle line:84%
start where you are and do
something that you love.

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
then inspire others.

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And then that becomes
hopefully a better world.

00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:58.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Well said.

00:32:58.790 --> 00:32:59.870 align:middle line:90%
I concur.

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:02.180 align:middle line:84%
You're a force for good,
Kristina, really good.

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:04.340 align:middle line:84%
I think we've covered some
incredible topics today.

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:06.588 align:middle line:84%
I feel very grateful
for our conversation.

00:33:06.588 --> 00:33:08.630 align:middle line:84%
My last question would
be, is there anything else

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:09.860 align:middle line:90%
you think you wanted to add?

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:11.850 align:middle line:84%
Any quote that you
miss saying, anything

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:14.450 align:middle line:84%
you think from the book that
you think is worth mentioning,

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:19.780 align:middle line:84%
or if there's any last sort of
idea or quote or any finale.

00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:25.230 align:middle line:84%
So I think I want to go back a
little bit on the discomfort.

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:31.010 align:middle line:84%
So I think having big dreams
is sometimes daunting,

00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:35.420 align:middle line:84%
and it's out of your comfort
zone if you dream really big.

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And if you start dreaming
and you have all these dreams

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:41.090 align:middle line:84%
and goals and you put that
into that bucket thinking,

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:44.960 align:middle line:84%
that is so daunting and
it's so uncomfortable

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:48.320 align:middle line:84%
even to think about how I'm
going achieve those dreams.

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And then you go in
your normal life,

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.960 align:middle line:84%
and you just keep
going where you are.

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And you actually think
about that my life could

00:33:57.230 --> 00:34:00.215 align:middle line:90%
be much more whatever that is.

00:34:00.215 --> 00:34:02.090 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean you have
to start big things,

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:04.040 align:middle line:90%
but do what you love.

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And knowing that you potentially
could do more with your life,

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.590 align:middle line:90%
that's also discomfort.

00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And I always think,
which discomfort zone

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:13.255 align:middle line:90%
do you want to be in?

00:34:13.255 --> 00:34:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And I always choose
the one where

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:18.389 align:middle line:84%
I want to make sure that I
do as much as I possibly can.

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:20.953 align:middle line:84%
Because I think that at
the end of your life,

00:34:20.953 --> 00:34:23.120 align:middle line:84%
you want to make sure that
you did whatever you can.

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:24.995 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't know
how many lives we have.

00:34:24.995 --> 00:34:28.699 align:middle line:84%
But assuming this is the
one and only life we have,

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:31.350 align:middle line:84%
I think you want to
make the most of it.

00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes big dreams
could be doing less.

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:39.120 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't have to be
big, crazy goals, starting

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:40.400 align:middle line:90%
a global business or whatever.

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:42.025 align:middle line:84%
It could be that you
actually just want

00:34:42.025 --> 00:34:45.570 align:middle line:84%
to have a Sunday off
and go out in nature.

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:48.860 align:middle line:84%
So I think it will be
discomfort whatever you choose,

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:51.310 align:middle line:90%
so why not go for your dreams?

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:53.602 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for your time.

00:34:53.602 --> 00:34:54.810 align:middle line:90%
It's awesome to speak to you.

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And I love the
continual evolution

00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:00.530 align:middle line:84%
of the kikki.K brand
and your new focus

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:03.740 align:middle line:84%
on goal setting and
inspiring people to dream

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:04.980 align:middle line:90%
and also giving back.

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:06.090 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for what
you do in the world.

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:06.990 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:09.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for having me,
and thank you for all that

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:09.910 align:middle line:90%
you're doing.
