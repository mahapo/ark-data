00:00:00.946 --> 00:00:03.784 align:middle line:10%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:03.784 --> 00:00:07.728 align:middle line:90%


00:00:07.728 --> 00:00:09.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi, it's James here
from "Food Matters."

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.700 align:middle line:10%
And today, I'm speaking
with Dr. Bradley Nelson.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.830 align:middle line:10%
He is an expert in bioenergetic
medicine and energy psychology

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.650 align:middle line:10%
and author of the book
"The Emotion Code."

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.440 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be going deep
into how emotions impact

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.620 align:middle line:84%
your physiology, your
life, and how you can start

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.140 align:middle line:84%
to tap into releasing some
of those emotions that

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.910 align:middle line:90%
could be holding you back.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Bradley, a pleasure
to be speaking with you.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Great to be here.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>> So everybody has a story
when it comes to a catalyst

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.300 align:middle line:84%
or a beginning or an impetus
that sort of set you off

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.500 align:middle line:90%
on this journey.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.330 align:middle line:84%
What was it for you, and can
you tell me about that time?

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, sure.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.182 align:middle line:10%
For me, it really
started at age seven.

00:00:47.182 --> 00:00:48.640 align:middle line:10%
I was really sick
with the measles.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.800 align:middle line:10%
And I had overheard my
parents talking about

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.160 align:middle line:10%
how, the next day, the plan was
I was going into the hospital

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.770 align:middle line:10%
and going into something called
an oxygen tent, which I didn't

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.810 align:middle line:10%
really understand, but the tent
part of it sounded interesting.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:00.610 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.680 align:middle line:90%
But I was too sick to enjoy it.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.203 align:middle line:84%
So everyone else
had gone to bed,

00:01:04.203 --> 00:01:05.620 align:middle line:84%
and my parents
came into the room.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.570 align:middle line:84%
They'd made a bed for
me upstairs on a couch

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.460 align:middle line:84%
so I could be near
their bedroom.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And my mother said to my
father, she said, honey,

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.980 align:middle line:84%
will you kneel down
with me and say a prayer

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.740 align:middle line:84%
so that our boy will
be able to get well?

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.920 align:middle line:90%
So they did.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And my father's offering this
prayer, this heartfelt prayer,

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:23.680 align:middle line:90%
for me.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.178 align:middle line:84%
And knowing my dad,
it was probably

00:01:26.178 --> 00:01:27.970 align:middle line:84%
the first time in my
life that I'd actually

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.670 align:middle line:90%
heard him pray out loud.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle of this,
this remarkable thing happened.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.420 align:middle line:84%
This change started
at the top of my head,

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.680 align:middle line:84%
and it went, whoosh,
through my body.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.410 align:middle line:90%
And I was healed instantly.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, to go from
being really sick one

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.380 align:middle line:84%
moment, in the next moment
to being completely well

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.890 align:middle line:84%
and totally, vibrantly healthy
is so bizarre and so remarkable

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.600 align:middle line:84%
and so unbelievable
and so amazing

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.850 align:middle line:90%
that you don't ever forget it.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And every moment of that is
still just burned into my mind

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.930 align:middle line:90%
like it happened yesterday.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And I held my tongue until
my dad was done praying,

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.250 align:middle line:90%
which didn't take long.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And when he was done,
I said, I'm better.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.160 align:middle line:90%
God healed me.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm better.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
that's fine, honey.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.710 align:middle line:90%
Go back to sleep now.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.560 align:middle line:84%
Tomorrow, you're
going to the hospital.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.710 align:middle line:84%
But that taught me a very
powerful, very profound,

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.140 align:middle line:84%
lesson, and that is that
there is a higher power.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.870 align:middle line:84%
There's another power out
there that we can draw upon.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And then that really
stayed with me.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.070 align:middle line:84%
So fast forward about
another seven years, and I

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.340 align:middle line:84%
ended up having these terrific
pains all of a sudden,

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.810 align:middle line:84%
out of the blue,
that were in my back.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.507 align:middle line:84%
And these pains
were so severe they

00:02:36.507 --> 00:02:38.590 align:middle line:84%
would take my breath away
or sometimes just put me

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.280 align:middle line:90%
on the ground.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And my parents
were very worried.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.850 align:middle line:90%
I was panicked.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:42.850 align:middle line:90%
We went to the hospital.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.340 align:middle line:84%
They ran all these tests, and
they said I had kidney disease.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And it was a serious
situation for me.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.960 align:middle line:90%


00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.710 align:middle line:10%
My kidneys were either
going to get better

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.720 align:middle line:10%
or they weren't, and it
was about a 50/50 thing.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And if they didn't
get better, there

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.762 align:middle line:84%
were no kidney
transplants back then,

00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:01.690 align:middle line:90%
so I was a goner at that point.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.360 align:middle line:84%
But there was nothing that
they had to offer me medically.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And so my parents
decided they would

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.527 align:middle line:84%
take me to see some
alternative healers.

00:03:07.527 --> 00:03:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And so they took me
to see some people who

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.285 align:middle line:84%
worked out on the edge of
town in a trailer house.

00:03:13.285 --> 00:03:15.340 align:middle line:90%


00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.590 align:middle line:84%
They were actually out in
the middle of a wheat field.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.330 align:middle line:90%
It was really interesting--

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.870 align:middle line:84%
an enormous contrast
from where I had been.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.170 align:middle line:90%
And they started working on me.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And in short order, I was
feeling dramatically better.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And within about a
month, I had forgotten

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.410 align:middle line:90%
that I'd ever been sick.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And my parents took me
back to the hospital.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.708 align:middle line:90%
They ran all the tests.

00:03:32.708 --> 00:03:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And as I recall, they
ran the tests twice.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, it's
a spontaneous remission.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Whatever we did
must have helped.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.990 align:middle line:84%
But I knew they hadn't
really done anything.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.455 align:middle line:84%
These other doctors
had helped me.

00:03:40.455 --> 00:03:41.830 align:middle line:84%
So I decided that's
what I wanted

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.350 align:middle line:84%
to do with my life was
go into the healing arts.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.150 align:middle line:90%
And so I did.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.790 align:middle line:84%
I got distracted for a number
of years, going into business

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.770 align:middle line:84%
and going into computer
programming and so on.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.380 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, it
was another answer

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.010 align:middle line:84%
to prayer, a very profound
answer, that brought me back

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.560 align:middle line:90%
to that direction.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.700 align:middle line:84%
So when I got out of
chiropractic school

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.650 align:middle line:84%
and I went into practice,
I decided that God

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.270 align:middle line:90%
had gotten me into this.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And God goes by different
names for different people--

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.040 align:middle line:84%
source energy,
creator, whatever.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.320 align:middle line:84%
But I thought,
that higher power--

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.570 align:middle line:90%
God-- has gotten me into this.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.510 align:middle line:84%
Maybe now I can get
some help because I

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.850 align:middle line:84%
need help with these people
that are coming to me

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.530 align:middle line:90%
that have all these problems.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:24.970 align:middle line:90%
So I developed this habit.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And the habit was that
when someone would come in

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.290 align:middle line:84%
to see me, before I
would go to work on them,

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.460 align:middle line:84%
I would just take a moment and
direct my thoughts to heaven

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.080 align:middle line:84%
and ask God to help
me with this person.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.385 align:middle line:84%
And it was a totally private,
totally personal, habit.

00:04:38.385 --> 00:04:40.010 align:middle line:84%
No one ever knew that
I was doing this.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.950 align:middle line:84%
It was just a momentary
pause, really.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.420 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you, I practiced
for 17 years in a brick

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.670 align:middle line:84%
and mortar practice and for
about two and a half years

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.860 align:middle line:90%
in a distance practice.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.800 align:middle line:84%
During those years,
there were times

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.670 align:middle line:84%
when people would come in to see
me that had conditions going on

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.180 align:middle line:84%
and problems that were
happening for them that I

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.593 align:middle line:90%
didn't know how to address.

00:05:02.593 --> 00:05:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And there were times when I
would offer that silent prayer

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.500 align:middle line:84%
and ask for help when the
information would just

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.680 align:middle line:84%
flood into my body like an
avalanche of understanding

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.210 align:middle line:90%
and data.

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that included
ways of looking at things that I

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.190 align:middle line:84%
had never even considered that
I don't think anybody else

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.210 align:middle line:90%
had considered before, either.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And so I know that that
higher power, whatever

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.360 align:middle line:84%
you want to call
it, is very real

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.340 align:middle line:84%
and is aware of what we're
doing, I believe, all the time.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.820 align:middle line:84%
So that led to
little discoveries.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And gradually, over
time, learning everything

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.530 align:middle line:84%
that I could from every
source that I could

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:45.210 align:middle line:84%
and from ancient texts and
whatever other people were

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.910 align:middle line:84%
doing that seemed to work,
I was able to put together

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.170 align:middle line:84%
this method of working with the
emotional baggage that we call,

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.860 align:middle line:90%
now, the Emotion Code.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And so, I left practice
eventually and wrote this book.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.390 align:middle line:90%
And now it's coming out again.

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:07.500 align:middle line:84%
It's out again now
as a hardcover.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's changing people's
lives all over the world--

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.190 align:middle line:90%
real exciting.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.120 align:middle line:84%
>> So paint the picture a
little bit more for me when this

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.790 align:middle line:84%
kidney disease started
to happen for you.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:18.690 align:middle line:90%
How old were you?

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.525 align:middle line:90%
What was your life like?

00:06:20.525 --> 00:06:21.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm assuming
everything was rosy,

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.230 align:middle line:84%
and then, all of a sudden,
it was just out of nowhere.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And this journey out into
this wheat field again.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I grew up in a
very idyllic home, I think.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.020 align:middle line:84%
My mother and father were
childhood sweethearts,

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.390 align:middle line:84%
and I don't remember
them arguing ever.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:44.007 align:middle line:84%
So it was probably
very unusual, really.

00:06:44.007 --> 00:06:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And so, there was a lot
of love in our home.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And it was really a
wonderful experience

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.060 align:middle line:84%
that I had growing up, unlike
so many people, unfortunately.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.060 align:middle line:84%
But I was 13 years
old when I started

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.370 align:middle line:90%
getting these pains in my back.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And at first, I was
able to ignore them.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:01.050 align:middle line:84%
But then, suddenly, they
reached this just unbelievable

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.430 align:middle line:90%
crescendo.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And when I would get
hit with this pain,

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.040 align:middle line:84%
it would be like I'd been
run through with a sword

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.140 align:middle line:84%
or a telephone
pole or something.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was just
unbearable pain.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And it would come
totally out of the blue.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.730 align:middle line:90%
And it was, frankly, terrifying.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:20.383 align:middle line:84%
And my parents were
very concerned about me.

00:07:20.383 --> 00:07:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, we
went to the hospital,

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.600 align:middle line:84%
and they ran the tests, and
I was diagnosed with kidney

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.500 align:middle line:90%
disease, 50% fatal, they said.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.370 align:middle line:84%
Nothing could really
be done about it.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.130 align:middle line:84%
I was either going
to recover or not.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And so my mother was
very into, and very open

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.320 align:middle line:84%
to, alternative
types of healing.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And so my parents
decided they would

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:47.460 align:middle line:84%
take me to see these
alternative doctors who

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.390 align:middle line:90%
started to work with me.

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And what they did was just
what I needed because it didn't

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:01.410 align:middle line:90%
take long, and I was better.

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:03.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Was it a reiki,
or was it an energy?

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.580 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember exactly
what the protocol was?

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.960 align:middle line:84%
Or was there just, you
went in and it happened?

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.930 align:middle line:90%
Was it a group prayer?

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:11.950 align:middle line:90%
Was it a meditation?

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:15.240 align:middle line:84%
>> They were osteopathic
doctors who--

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.630 align:middle line:84%
back in, I believe it was in
the late '50s or early 1960s,

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:21.570 align:middle line:84%
the osteopathic profession
was kind of engulfed

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:24.220 align:middle line:90%
by the medical profession.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And so, nowadays, most
osteopathic doctors

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.775 align:middle line:84%
are, basically, like medical
doctors here in the US.

00:08:29.775 --> 00:08:31.900 align:middle line:84%
But they decided they didn't
want any part of that,

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.820 align:middle line:90%
and so they stayed out of that.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And so they had
their own practice,

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.610 align:middle line:84%
and they were kind of on
the outside of things.

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:41.340 align:middle line:84%
But I can remember many
times going to their house

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:44.400 align:middle line:84%
and seeing a busload
of people drive away

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.890 align:middle line:84%
that had driven there
from some other state.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:49.500 align:middle line:84%
People would organize
these bus trips to see them

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.270 align:middle line:90%
because they were true healers.

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:55.137 align:middle line:84%
And so they were doing
osteopathic work with me.

00:08:55.137 --> 00:08:56.970 align:middle line:84%
I thought for years
they were chiropractors.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.860 align:middle line:84%
They were realigning
things in my spine,

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.560 align:middle line:84%
realigning bones and things,
and giving me certain potions

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.460 align:middle line:90%
and things to drink.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:03.880 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.120 align:middle line:90%
But they were true healers.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And you went to the
hospital, ran the tests again.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And this word you used--
spontaneous remission--

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.740 align:middle line:84%
did that come up for you in
this particular instance?

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:20.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, as I recall,
how things went,

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:24.030 align:middle line:84%
about a month after
I had been diagnosed,

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:25.340 align:middle line:90%
I was feeling completely fine.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And my parents took
me back to the clinic,

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:28.980 align:middle line:90%
and the tests were run again.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:32.678 align:middle line:84%
And as I recall, they
ran the tests twice.

00:09:32.678 --> 00:09:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And then, I heard
those words-- well,

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:35.670 align:middle line:90%
it's a spontaneous remission.

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.320 align:middle line:84%
Whatever we did
must have helped.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And I was only 13 years
old, but I wasn't stupid.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.340 align:middle line:84%
I knew that what
these people had done

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.120 align:middle line:90%
had been what my body needed.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.120 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you just know
something in your heart.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.620 align:middle line:84%
I knew that what they
had done had helped me

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.720 align:middle line:90%
and was what my body wanted.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.520 align:middle line:84%
So I decided at that
point that that's what

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:57.687 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to do with my life.

00:09:57.687 --> 00:10:01.590 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to go into the healing
arts and do what they did.

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:04.310 align:middle line:84%
>> So studying chiropractic
care makes sense

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:06.530 align:middle line:84%
because it's
affiliated, in a way,

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:10.700 align:middle line:84%
with osteopathic medicine
in that it works with,

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:15.900 align:middle line:84%
sort of, the energetic and the
spinal systems of the body.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.930 align:middle line:84%
How did you move from
chiropractic care

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:19.220 align:middle line:90%
deeper into this emotional?

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.053 align:middle line:90%
Was there something?

00:10:20.053 --> 00:10:23.885 align:middle line:84%
Because chiropractors are, say,
five different types of people.

00:10:23.885 --> 00:10:25.260 align:middle line:84%
There's the real
manual adjusters

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.810 align:middle line:84%
and, on the other
spectrum, there's

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:28.730 align:middle line:90%
the real energy healers.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.880 align:middle line:84%
What took you from more of
a manual adjustment person

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.190 align:middle line:84%
into this, like, there's
something deeper going

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:35.240 align:middle line:90%
on in the body?

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, these two osteopathic
doctors that I saw--

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:43.550 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Ida Harmon and
Dr. Alan Bain--

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:46.440 align:middle line:84%
I can remember lying on
my back on their table,

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.290 align:middle line:84%
looking up at them,
saying, when I grow up,

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.150 align:middle line:90%
I want to do what you do.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And they would say
to me, no, you don't.

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:53.360 align:middle line:90%
They'd say, no, no.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.120 align:middle line:10%
Because if you go
to school, you'll

00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:00.500 align:middle line:10%
get your head so full of fixed
ideas that when you come out,

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.170 align:middle line:10%
you won't be able to
think for yourself.

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:04.670 align:middle line:84%
You won't be an
independent thinker.

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:06.350 align:middle line:90%
You'll be like a zombie.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:08.810 align:middle line:90%
And that really stuck with me.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:12.410 align:middle line:84%
So when I went to school,
I was very much on guard

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:13.980 align:middle line:90%
and very on the defensive.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.670 align:middle line:84%
And when my instructors
would say things like,

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:20.390 align:middle line:84%
this is the best way to
do this certain thing,

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:23.030 align:middle line:84%
my thought would always be,
well, maybe that's true,

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.990 align:middle line:90%
but maybe that isn't.

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:25.830 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there's a better way.

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:27.053 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there's a faster way.

00:11:27.053 --> 00:11:28.220 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there's an easier way.

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.680 align:middle line:90%
So I was always just wide open--

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:34.760 align:middle line:84%
radically open-- to
whatever I could learn.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.940 align:middle line:84%
So when I got into practice,
that stayed with me.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And I was obsessed with
getting my patients well

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.540 align:middle line:84%
because I felt that's why
they were coming to me.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And so anything that I could
find that might help them I

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.040 align:middle line:90%
was open to doing.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.160 align:middle line:10%
And I was open to using new
methods or different methods

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.750 align:middle line:10%
or things that might
be frowned upon

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:56.330 align:middle line:10%
or things that
might be brand new

00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:00.120 align:middle line:10%
or things that maybe no
one else had thought of.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And so, really, I think
that during those years,

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:07.670 align:middle line:84%
the most important piece
of that puzzle, to me,

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:10.970 align:middle line:84%
was this connection that I
was making with each person.

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:13.733 align:middle line:84%
So really, all day long, I was
kind of in a state of prayer.

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:16.400 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm asking for help with
this person and then asking for

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.360 align:middle line:90%
help with the next person.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:22.160 align:middle line:10%
And so I think that that was a
really powerful aspect of this.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And I believe now that I've
been given this mission

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.540 align:middle line:90%
to take this to the world.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:33.020 align:middle line:90%
In fact, let me share something.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.720 align:middle line:84%
I had gotten involved in
computers and computer

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.500 align:middle line:84%
programming and was
really into that.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was about six months away
from going into the MBA program

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:43.190 align:middle line:84%
at Brigham Young
University in Utah.

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:44.570 align:middle line:90%
And we went home.

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:46.100 align:middle line:10%
My wife and I went
home to Montana,

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.800 align:middle line:10%
where my parents were
living, where I'd grown up.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And we were sitting around
with my parents, talking.

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:53.810 align:middle line:90%
And it was Christmas time.

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:55.437 align:middle line:84%
And my father, totally
out of the blue,

00:12:55.437 --> 00:12:57.020 align:middle line:84%
said, are you sure
that you don't want

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.542 align:middle line:90%
to go to chiropractic school?

00:12:58.542 --> 00:13:00.500 align:middle line:84%
It seems like a great
career, and you've always

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:01.312 align:middle line:90%
wanted to do it.

00:13:01.312 --> 00:13:02.270 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no, no, no.

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:03.562 align:middle line:90%
I'm going this other direction.

00:13:03.562 --> 00:13:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, why don't you
think about it one more time.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.220 align:middle line:90%
So I thought, OK.

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.680 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And my wife and I made
up a pro and con list,

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.640 align:middle line:84%
and we still didn't
know what to do.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And now, all of a
sudden, I thought

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:15.770 align:middle line:90%
I had my life figured out.

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And now, all of a sudden, I'm
kind of back to this old dream

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:21.020 align:middle line:90%
of going into the healing arts.

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm right in
the middle of the fence.

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:25.550 align:middle line:84%
So that night, I got on
my knees and I prayed.

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And I asked God
to help me to know

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:33.350 align:middle line:84%
if he had anything to say about
this, I was open to whatever.

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:36.858 align:middle line:84%
And so, that night, I had this
dream, right, three times.

00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:38.150 align:middle line:90%
Well, it wasn't really a dream.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:39.920 align:middle line:84%
I was awake in three
different times

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:44.618 align:middle line:84%
to find my mind full of these
warm, happy thoughts about how

00:13:44.618 --> 00:13:46.160 align:middle line:84%
great it is to be
able to heal people

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.550 align:middle line:84%
naturally and help people
naturally and serve mankind

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:50.360 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.152 align:middle line:84%
And I would think,
well, yeah, that's true,

00:13:52.152 --> 00:13:53.000 align:middle line:90%
but computers and--

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:53.340 align:middle line:90%
[SNORES]

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:54.650 align:middle line:90%
--and I'd fall back asleep.

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:55.730 align:middle line:84%
That happened three
times that night.

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.147 align:middle line:84%
So the next night,
I'm on my knees

00:13:57.147 --> 00:14:02.040 align:middle line:90%
again, being kind of slow.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.190 align:middle line:90%
And I'm asking again--

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:06.420 align:middle line:84%
Father, help me to
know what to do.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:07.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm open.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And I had the same
experience that night.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:15.500 align:middle line:84%
But this time, each time, it
was exponentially more powerful

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:16.925 align:middle line:90%
than the time before.

00:14:16.925 --> 00:14:18.800 align:middle line:84%
So on the third time on
the second night when

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.280 align:middle line:84%
I was awakened, I can't
describe how powerful

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.260 align:middle line:84%
this was, but, I mean,
the thoughts of service

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.660 align:middle line:90%
to mankind and the planet--

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:29.780 align:middle line:84%
all of humanity-- it was
just absolutely overwhelming.

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And right then, I
actually heard a voice

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.300 align:middle line:84%
that spoke to me as clearly as
I'm speaking to you right now.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And it said, this
is a sacred calling.

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:41.160 align:middle line:90%
Those were the words.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.190 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, OK, I get it.

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:45.080 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.570 align:middle line:90%
And so I followed that.

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't really
understand what that meant.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:56.872 align:middle line:84%
But years later, I had
this experience where--

00:14:56.872 --> 00:14:59.330 align:middle line:84%
I think we've all probably
heard at some point in our lives

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.380 align:middle line:84%
that the body is like a
temple, somehow, right?

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:02.180 align:middle line:90%
We've heard that.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.993 align:middle line:84%
I think that's probably in
every religion on the planet.

00:15:04.993 --> 00:15:06.160 align:middle line:90%
And I had heard that before.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.700 align:middle line:84%
But one day, I had
this little routine

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:12.850 align:middle line:84%
that I mentioned, where I
have a patient that comes in.

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:15.100 align:middle line:84%
My patient is lying
face down on this table.

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:17.920 align:middle line:84%
Before I go to work on this
patient, I take a moment,

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.650 align:middle line:84%
and I just connect with the
higher power and ask for help.

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:24.010 align:middle line:84%
So this one particular day,
I have a patient in there,

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:24.850 align:middle line:90%
and I ask for help.

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:28.330 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I have this
incredibly powerful experience,

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:32.050 align:middle line:84%
where it was as if
my eyes suddenly

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:34.930 align:middle line:84%
were open for the first
time in my whole life,

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:40.210 align:middle line:84%
and I saw and understood
with spiritual eyes

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:42.190 align:middle line:84%
that I was standing
in the presence

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:44.350 align:middle line:90%
of this sacred temple--

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:46.550 align:middle line:90%
the temple of the body.

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And it was absolutely just
an incredible experience.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And I was just instantly
filled with the deepest sense

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.810 align:middle line:84%
of reverence and awe-- to
be standing in the presence

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:58.690 align:middle line:84%
of this sacred
edifice, the body--

00:15:58.690 --> 00:15:59.980 align:middle line:90%
the body temple.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:03.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, this only lasted for,
probably, four or five seconds,

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:07.630 align:middle line:84%
and then that window
sort of closed.

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:12.190 align:middle line:84%
But it's stayed with
me all this time.

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And so it gave me a
different understanding

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:21.330 align:middle line:84%
of what that sacred
calling, what that meant.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:23.080 align:middle line:84%
Because when we're
working with the body--

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.940 align:middle line:84%
in any way, any
kind of capacity--

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.890 align:middle line:84%
when we're helping
people to feel better--

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:29.290 align:middle line:84%
if we're a medical doctor
and we're sewing people up

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:30.960 align:middle line:84%
or if we're a
chiropractor, we're

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.460 align:middle line:84%
realigning things, or if you're
releasing emotional baggage,

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:34.570 align:middle line:90%
whatever it is--

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:36.028 align:middle line:84%
what you're doing
is a sacred thing

00:16:36.028 --> 00:16:38.143 align:middle line:84%
because the body
itself is sacred.

00:16:38.143 --> 00:16:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is an understanding
that the ancients

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:43.690 align:middle line:90%
had that we've lost--

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:45.570 align:middle line:90%
for the most part.

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:46.370 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think that ancient
language and ancient religions

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:55.010 align:middle line:84%
talk about this idea of God
resides within you, as you.

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And when you say
that to me, we've

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:58.668 align:middle line:84%
externalized God
in so many ways.

00:16:58.668 --> 00:17:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And when you put it like this,
it really brings it back to we

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:02.920 align:middle line:90%
are all cut from the same cloth.

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.800 align:middle line:84%
We are all part of
this divine matrix.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:10.560 align:middle line:84%
Your work has ended up sort
of zeroing in on emotions--

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:14.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, writing "Emotion Code"
and having that speciality.

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:18.130 align:middle line:84%
What was it that made
you really go deep

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:20.109 align:middle line:90%
into that particular ideology?

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:22.630 align:middle line:84%
Because you could have gone
into how toxins affect the body

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:25.329 align:middle line:84%
or how electromagnetic
fields affect the body,

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:26.829 align:middle line:84%
but you focused
on-- well, in a way,

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:28.660 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic fields--
but how emotions

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.360 align:middle line:90%
are related to the body.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.430 align:middle line:84%
What happened there,
and what are emotions,

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:35.590 align:middle line:84%
and how do they get
stored in the body?

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:37.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, how it came
about, really, for me,

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:42.640 align:middle line:84%
was I was trying to balance
the organs and the glands

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.410 align:middle line:90%
in my patients' bodies.

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And I found that sometimes
I could balance their organs

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:52.150 align:middle line:84%
and glands because the organs
and the glands, for the most

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:54.730 align:middle line:84%
part, are connected to
certain muscles in the body.

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:57.700 align:middle line:84%
People were coming to see
me with pain, typically,

00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:59.110 align:middle line:90%
in various parts of the body.

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And I found that
muscle imbalance was

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:05.980 align:middle line:84%
a big reason for that, but
that was secondary to the organ

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:07.990 align:middle line:90%
or gland imbalance.

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And I found that, sometimes,
I could balance these organs

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.660 align:middle line:84%
and glands, and
sometimes I couldn't.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:15.693 align:middle line:84%
But then, there was
a serendipitous thing

00:18:15.693 --> 00:18:17.110 align:middle line:84%
that happened to
me that helped me

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:21.250 align:middle line:84%
to realize that
emotional baggage was

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:22.402 align:middle line:90%
a piece of the puzzle.

00:18:22.402 --> 00:18:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And I knew about
emotional baggage,

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:27.580 align:middle line:84%
but I never realized that
emotional baggage could

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:29.620 align:middle line:84%
be a big underlying
cause of imbalance

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:32.060 align:middle line:90%
in the organs and the glands.

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a process that
I think many people are

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.160 align:middle line:90%
undergoing all over the world.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.670 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like the old
story of the blind men who

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:46.090 align:middle line:84%
were sent to discover
what an elephant was.

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:48.555 align:middle line:84%
And depending on where
the blind man was,

00:18:48.555 --> 00:18:50.680 align:middle line:84%
he would tell a different
story when he came back--

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.820 align:middle line:84%
oh, it's like a big snake
if he's at the nose,

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:55.540 align:middle line:84%
oh, it's like a big paintbrush
if he's at the tail.

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:57.160 align:middle line:84%
We're all kind of
gradually uncovering

00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:01.900 align:middle line:84%
this edifice of this incredible
body that we live in.

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And we're starting to understand
how the body works and so on.

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:08.890 align:middle line:90%
Well, the body itself is energy.

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And so if you magnify
your hand a million times

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.433 align:middle line:84%
or more, eventually, you're
face to face with an atom.

00:19:13.433 --> 00:19:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And you realize if
you look in the atom,

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:16.780 align:middle line:84%
there's really nothing in
there-- just empty space,

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:19.780 align:middle line:84%
right, and some infinitesimally
tiny energies that are zipping

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.220 align:middle line:90%
around at the speed of light.

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:22.360 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we are.

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you're
experiencing emotions,

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:27.130 align:middle line:84%
you see, what we believe
is that every emotion has

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:28.780 align:middle line:90%
its own specific frequency.

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And if you're feeling
an emotion of anger,

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:32.420 align:middle line:84%
for example, that's a
different frequency,

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.697 align:middle line:84%
or a different vibration,
than an emotion of sadness,

00:19:34.697 --> 00:19:36.280 align:middle line:84%
and that's different
from frustration.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.660 align:middle line:90%
They're all different.

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:40.120 align:middle line:84%
But if you're feeling an
emotion that's powerful enough,

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.910 align:middle line:84%
your whole being can
take on this vibration.

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And in those circumstances,
what can happen

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:49.960 align:middle line:84%
is the energy of that emotion
can become just too much

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.170 align:middle line:90%
for the body to take.

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And so some of that
energy remains behind.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.900 align:middle line:84%
There's a process that
we go through when

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:58.390 align:middle line:90%
we experience emotions.

00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:00.070 align:middle line:90%
The emotion is generated.

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, the
emotions in the body

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:05.250 align:middle line:84%
are generated by the organs
and some of the glands.

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:06.980 align:middle line:10%
And so, in other
words, what's generated

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:10.700 align:middle line:10%
is the emotional frequency that
we perceive as the emotion.

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And so, energetically,
that's how we look at it.

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:16.040 align:middle line:90%
Well, that happens.

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:19.190 align:middle line:84%
The emotion is generated,
we feel the emotion,

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:21.170 align:middle line:84%
we acknowledge it,
and then we allow

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:22.560 align:middle line:90%
it to dissipate and move on.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's the process that
we are supposed to go through.

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:28.280 align:middle line:84%
If that process is
interrupted somewhere,

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.890 align:middle line:84%
if we either bury that
emotion and we don't allow

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:34.610 align:middle line:84%
it to surface or if that emotion
is just so big that we can't

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:37.490 align:middle line:84%
really deal with it, then
the energy of that emotion

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:39.210 align:middle line:90%
remains in the body.

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And so, then what happens is it
may manifest many, many years

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:48.130 align:middle line:84%
down the road as all kinds
of different problems.

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:51.290 align:middle line:84%
The operative word that
we use is "discomfort."

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:53.330 align:middle line:84%
If you have some
kind of discomfort,

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:55.490 align:middle line:84%
that's probably
emotionally based.

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:59.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, discomfort can be physical
or mental or emotional.

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:00.620 align:middle line:90%
Let me share a story with you.

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:03.320 align:middle line:84%
There was a man that came
in to see me many years ago.

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And his back pain
was really severe.

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:07.970 align:middle line:84%
It was a nine on a
zero to 10 scale.

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And 10 is call the
emergency, right?

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:13.513 align:middle line:84%
And it had been
going on for a while.

00:21:13.513 --> 00:21:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And I tested him and found
he had a trapped emotion.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.360 align:middle line:90%
The emotion was anger.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.952 align:middle line:84%
And using the
Emotion Code, I was

00:21:18.952 --> 00:21:21.410 align:middle line:84%
able to figure out that had
occurred about 20 years before.

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:22.827 align:middle line:84%
And he remembered
exactly what had

00:21:22.827 --> 00:21:25.727 align:middle line:84%
gone on-- some really difficult,
traumatic things at work.

00:21:25.727 --> 00:21:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And so I released the emotion,
which just takes a few seconds.

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And instantly, the pain
went from a nine to a zero.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, he kept bending over
and exclaiming he couldn't

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:36.320 align:middle line:90%
believe it was like a miracle.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.722 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was grateful
that it worked so well.

00:21:38.722 --> 00:21:40.930 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting thing
is, a couple days later, he

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:41.730 align:middle line:90%
came back into me.

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you know,
my back is still fine.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.057 align:middle line:84%
He said, I still
can't believe it.

00:21:45.057 --> 00:21:46.610 align:middle line:84%
But he said, I had
another problem

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:48.652 align:middle line:84%
when I came in here that
I didn't tell you about.

00:21:48.652 --> 00:21:50.520 align:middle line:84%
He said, for as long
as I can remember,

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.598 align:middle line:84%
I've basically
been a rageaholic.

00:21:52.598 --> 00:21:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'm always
yelling at my wife and my kids.

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:57.920 align:middle line:84%
I've gotta watch the
road rage, and I've

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.720 align:middle line:84%
been to anger management
several times.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.520 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't really helped me.

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.390 align:middle line:84%
But he said, since you released
that emotion of anger from me,

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:05.190 align:middle line:90%
I feel different.

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:06.455 align:middle line:90%
I feel like a new person.

00:22:06.455 --> 00:22:07.580 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel angry anymore.

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:09.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm not on edge anymore.

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:10.640 align:middle line:90%
How did that work?

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.377 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, I said,
well, I don't know.

00:22:13.377 --> 00:22:14.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.000 align:middle line:84%
But what we believe,
you see, is when

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.440 align:middle line:84%
you have a trapped
emotion, you've

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.845 align:middle line:84%
got this ball of
emotional energy

00:22:20.845 --> 00:22:22.220 align:middle line:84%
from about the
size of a baseball

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:24.440 align:middle line:90%
to about the size of a softball.

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And these will lodge in
different places in the body.

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes where
they lodge has

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.010 align:middle line:84%
a metaphysical significance,
and sometimes they

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:33.350 align:middle line:84%
will lodge in areas where
there's some previous injury

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:34.370 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And what they will do is they
will distort the normal energy

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:38.820 align:middle line:90%
field of the body.

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:41.563 align:middle line:84%
So when you distort the normal
energy field of the body,

00:22:41.563 --> 00:22:42.980 align:middle line:84%
you're distorting
the body itself.

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Because that's all the body
is is an energy field, right?

00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And so, eventually,
you distort that field

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:49.910 align:middle line:84%
long enough, you're interfering
with the chemical reactions

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:52.250 align:middle line:84%
in that tissue, you're
interfering with the blood

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:54.860 align:middle line:84%
flow, maybe the lymph
flow, to some degree,

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:56.570 align:middle line:84%
certainly the flow
of acupuncture energy

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:58.200 align:middle line:90%
in that area.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And so when we release
that emotional energy,

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:04.400 align:middle line:84%
suddenly, things change,
and discomfort can go away.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, in this guy's
case-- think about this--

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:10.220 align:middle line:84%
he had this ball of
anger in his back.

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:14.660 align:middle line:84%
After 20 years, it was
causing him excruciating pain.

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.550 align:middle line:84%
But there was something
else going on.

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:20.720 align:middle line:84%
That emotion, that anger, it's
a frequency, it's a vibration.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.450 align:middle line:84%
So his body was feeling
that emotion 24 hours a day,

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:25.410 align:middle line:90%
seven days a week.

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:27.410 align:middle line:84%
So when a situation would
come along in his life

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:29.030 align:middle line:84%
where he might tend to
feel the emotion of anger,

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:30.920 align:middle line:84%
he would slide right
into that resonance

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.380 align:middle line:84%
much more easily,
much more readily,

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:34.380 align:middle line:90%
than he otherwise would.

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:34.790 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Because, literally,
part of his body

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:39.480 align:middle line:84%
was feeling that
emotion constantly.

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And so getting rid of it
made an immediate change

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:44.960 align:middle line:84%
not only physically but also
mentally and emotionally.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:50.210 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about it, we
all have emotional baggage.

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And getting rid of that baggage
is a tremendously powerful key

00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:57.370 align:middle line:84%
to becoming who
you're supposed to be,

00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:01.770 align:middle line:84%
to getting back to the you
that you are intended to be.

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
exciting to me.

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:05.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing-- beautiful.

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that we're
ripe for this information

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:12.295 align:middle line:84%
now because we're
becoming more aware--

00:24:12.295 --> 00:24:13.670 align:middle line:84%
in the circles,
probably, that we

00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:15.650 align:middle line:84%
operate in,
especially-- that there

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:18.500 align:middle line:84%
is an attention that
needs to be paid

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.950 align:middle line:84%
to the emotional sensitivity
of the human frame.

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And yet, culturally, we
still have this conditioning

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:27.170 align:middle line:84%
that teaches us to
suppress emotions,

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:31.060 align:middle line:84%
to hold things back, especially
in the masculine side

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:34.010 align:middle line:90%
of humanity.

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about how
we've been taught

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:37.363 align:middle line:84%
to suppress emotions,
and also, maybe,

00:24:37.363 --> 00:24:38.780 align:middle line:84%
talk to me a little
bit about what

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:42.740 align:middle line:84%
are the main types of
energetic blockages

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:45.275 align:middle line:84%
that you see presented in
your work and your practice

00:24:45.275 --> 00:24:46.400 align:middle line:90%
and everything you've done?

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Like, what would be common
feelings or emotions

00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:51.680 align:middle line:84%
or symptoms that people
might be experiencing

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.670 align:middle line:84%
that, listening to
this, they might think,

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:55.000 align:middle line:90%
I need to work on that?

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:59.150 align:middle line:90%
Well, yes, it's true.

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:01.700 align:middle line:84%
As men, especially
in the West, we're

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.940 align:middle line:90%
taught to suppress our emotions.

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:06.830 align:middle line:90%
Boys don't cry.

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:08.240 align:middle line:90%
Men, especially, don't cry.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.720 align:middle line:90%


00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:15.410 align:middle line:84%
We're taught that emotions,
and showing emotion,

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:17.610 align:middle line:90%
is a sign of weakness.

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And so we tend to
suppress those emotions.

00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And as a result,
women are much more

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:25.850 align:middle line:84%
likely to seek help for
emotional difficulties,

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:28.530 align:middle line:90%
while men are much less likely.

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And so, as a result,
men tend to have

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:36.750 align:middle line:84%
more problems, more diseases
and so on in certain categories.

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:39.860 align:middle line:84%
What I have seen, personally,
with emotional baggage

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:45.800 align:middle line:84%
is that they seem to be the
biggest single underlying cause

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:49.850 align:middle line:84%
of depression and anxiety
and phobias and panic attacks

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:55.310 align:middle line:84%
and PTSD and eating disorders
and self-sabotage of all kinds.

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And they also are the
biggest underlying cause

00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:03.740 align:middle line:84%
of the physical pain
that people experience--

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:07.190 align:middle line:84%
neck pain, migraine, headaches,
low back pain, knee pain--

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:09.140 align:middle line:90%
but other problems, too.

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:14.390 align:middle line:84%
People seek medical help for
many other kinds of conditions.

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And in my experience
over the last 30 years,

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:19.260 align:middle line:84%
every single one of
those conditions--

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:22.340 align:middle line:84%
things like infertility and
asthma, digestive disorders,

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:25.100 align:middle line:90%
and even cancer--

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:28.370 align:middle line:84%
all of those diseases,
in my experience,

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:32.310 align:middle line:84%
always have an underlying
emotional component.

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And my hope and my dream is
that as more time goes on,

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.490 align:middle line:84%
eventually, Western medicine
will recognize this.

00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:41.990 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going
to be inevitable.

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:43.940 align:middle line:84%
We just recently
finished a study where

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:46.840 align:middle line:84%
we found that we
got a, I believe,

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:54.110 align:middle line:84%
a 36% decrease in PTSD symptoms
and about a 35% decrease

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:58.940 align:middle line:84%
in depression symptoms within
about a three-week span

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:02.690 align:middle line:84%
of using the Emotion Code
and, specifically, releasing

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:05.360 align:middle line:84%
the emotions that
cluster around the heart

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:09.188 align:middle line:84%
that we refer to
as a heart wall.

00:27:09.188 --> 00:27:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Through HeartMath, we're
learning that the heart can

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:16.280 align:middle line:84%
emit an energy that we can sort
of communicate in this unspoken

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:18.230 align:middle line:90%
language of energetics.

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that, in the
work that I'm involved with

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:24.800 align:middle line:84%
and the hundreds of people I've
interviewed over the last 10

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:29.090 align:middle line:84%
years, that this
self-doubt, lack

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:33.720 align:middle line:84%
of self-love, lack of
self-worth, is a big problem.

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And as people get
older, they start

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:42.650 align:middle line:84%
to sort of enter a process of
clearing out energies, clearing

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:45.440 align:middle line:84%
out all energetic baggage,
as you talk about,

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:46.723 align:middle line:90%
or emotional baggage.

00:27:46.723 --> 00:27:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
find that it's

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:49.840 align:middle line:90%
related to their childhood.

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.280 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they had a
traumatic childhood,

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:57.350 align:middle line:84%
or they were neglected,
or they were abused.

00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And then, later on in life, they
have these emotions come out.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.250 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're
approaching midlife

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:02.833 align:middle line:84%
and are like, what's
going on with me?

00:28:02.833 --> 00:28:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And they go, well, maybe
it's related to back then.

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:09.320 align:middle line:84%
Do you find that certain
childhood traumas or childhood

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:13.220 align:middle line:84%
experiences can cause
emotional baggage

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:15.380 align:middle line:84%
to be stored in
the body and result

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:18.350 align:middle line:84%
in this negative self-talk
and negative self-love?

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:20.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yes, absolutely.

00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:23.660 align:middle line:84%
The experiences that we
go through as a child

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:26.660 align:middle line:84%
can definitely have
tremendous impact.

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:28.850 align:middle line:84%
Because, of course, we
look at, for example,

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:32.800 align:middle line:90%
our parents as gods, right?

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And when we're
abused by our parents

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:36.532 align:middle line:84%
or we're talked down
to by our parents

00:28:36.532 --> 00:28:38.240 align:middle line:84%
or we're told we're
never going to amount

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.628 align:middle line:84%
to anything by our
parents, it's very likely

00:28:40.628 --> 00:28:42.170 align:middle line:84%
that that's going
to get incorporated

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:43.940 align:middle line:90%
in a very powerful way.

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:48.230 align:middle line:84%
It's so important for us to
be careful with the words

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:51.830 align:middle line:84%
that we say,
especially to children.

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:54.650 align:middle line:84%
Because they're just open
books and just sponges.

00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And so it's so important to
be very aware of what we say.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:02.090 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we might
say something in jest

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:06.440 align:middle line:84%
to a child that can just go
right to the core of that child

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.070 align:middle line:90%
and can really affect them.

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:10.912 align:middle line:84%
So the words that we
say are so important.

00:29:10.912 --> 00:29:12.620 align:middle line:10%
And the emotional
baggage that we pick up

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:16.040 align:middle line:10%
as kids definitely has
huge effects on us,

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:20.480 align:middle line:10%
oftentimes years down the
road, and not only as far as

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:26.390 align:middle line:10%
how we feel about ourselves
and how we interact with others

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:28.730 align:middle line:10%
and how we perceive
the world but also,

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:31.220 align:middle line:10%
again, in physical
symptoms and also

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:32.480 align:middle line:10%
in emotional-mental symptoms.

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:35.660 align:middle line:90%


00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.820 align:middle line:84%
There was a young woman
that came to an event

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.740 align:middle line:90%
once that I was teaching.

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And she came up out
of the audience--

00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:44.300 align:middle line:90%
I asked for a volunteer--

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:45.800 align:middle line:84%
and she came up out
of the audience.

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And I started doing
some testing with her

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:49.940 align:middle line:84%
and asking if she had a trapped
emotion that we could release.

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And the answer
that I got was yes.

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And she was holding out
her outstretched arm,

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:57.200 align:middle line:84%
and I'm asking questions and
then pressing on her arm.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And if it's strong, the
answer's yes, and if it's weak,

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:01.160 align:middle line:90%
the answer is no.

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:04.892 align:middle line:84%
And we found that she had a
trapped emotion of forlorn,

00:30:04.892 --> 00:30:06.350 align:middle line:84%
which is kind of
feeling all alone,

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:08.060 align:middle line:90%
hopeless, desolate, lonely.

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:10.748 align:middle line:84%
It occurred when she was in
the first year of her life.

00:30:10.748 --> 00:30:12.540 align:middle line:84%
So I said, do you know
anything about this?

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And of course, she didn't
have any remembrance of it.

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.520 align:middle line:84%
But I had happened to meet
this young girl and her mother

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:17.930 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning of this event.

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And I looked out
at the audience,

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:21.350 align:middle line:84%
and there's her mother, and
she's as white as a sheet.

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:22.490 align:middle line:84%
She's got her
hands up like this.

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:24.865 align:middle line:84%
And I said, hey, do you have
any idea what this is about?

00:30:24.865 --> 00:30:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And she was very
embarrassed, but she

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:28.670 align:middle line:90%
said she thought maybe she did.

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:30.770 align:middle line:84%
She said that, back
in those years,

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:32.990 align:middle line:90%
she used to use cloth diapers.

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And one day, she accidentally
pinned her daughter

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:37.637 align:middle line:90%
to her diaper.

00:30:37.637 --> 00:30:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't know about
it until she changed her

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.180 align:middle line:90%
the next time.

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And she was horrified to find
out that she'd done this.

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And she had never told her
daughter until that moment.

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:51.330 align:middle line:90%
She put it behind her.

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:53.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, the interesting
thing was, here's

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:56.310 align:middle line:84%
this poor little baby feeling
this emotion of forlorn--

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:59.022 align:middle line:84%
no one's helping me, I'm
crying and crying and crying,

00:30:59.022 --> 00:31:00.980 align:middle line:84%
and I'm in terrible pain,
someone come help me.

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:02.600 align:middle line:90%
And nobody did.

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And so she develops this trapped
emotion of forlorn, right?

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.325 align:middle line:84%
So we released the emotion,
and she went back and sat down.

00:31:08.325 --> 00:31:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't think
anything else about.

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:11.180 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I kind of
forgot about it.

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And about 10 days
later, I get an email

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:14.020 align:middle line:90%
from this young girl's mother.

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And she said,
listen, my daughter's

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:17.960 align:middle line:84%
had this problem with
her hip and her knee.

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.823 align:middle line:84%
It's been getting gradually
worse for a number of years,

00:31:20.823 --> 00:31:22.490 align:middle line:84%
and we've taken her
to different people.

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:23.960 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's been able to
really figure this out.

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.085 align:middle line:84%
But, she said, the moment
you released that emotion

00:31:26.085 --> 00:31:28.310 align:middle line:90%
of forlorn, that has been gone.

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And I waited 10 days
to see if it was real

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:31.700 align:middle line:90%
or if it was going to come back.

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:32.780 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't come back.

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And she said, not only
that, she said my daughter--

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:36.800 align:middle line:84%
it was affecting the way
that she was walking,

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:38.008 align:middle line:90%
and she's walking better now.

00:31:38.008 --> 00:31:40.640 align:middle line:84%
But she said she also feels
this new lightness of being

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.680 align:middle line:90%
that she's never felt before.

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And she's telling
everyone about this.

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:46.410 align:middle line:84%
So you see, the
Emotion Code can tap

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:52.910 align:middle line:84%
into these unconscious
memories that we have,

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:55.490 align:middle line:84%
and it can find those and
find emotional baggage

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:57.860 align:middle line:84%
that you don't know
anything about consciously.

00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:00.980 align:middle line:84%
In fact, sometimes, we
pick up emotional baggage

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:04.857 align:middle line:84%
in the womb from what's going on
with mom or dad or the family.

00:32:04.857 --> 00:32:06.440 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we pick
up emotional baggage

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.320 align:middle line:84%
at the moment of
conception, we find,

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:11.140 align:middle line:84%
that's passed from a parent
that they might have gotten

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:13.690 align:middle line:84%
from a parent that they might
have gotten from a parent

00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:15.982 align:middle line:84%
that, sometimes, these'll go
back for many generations.

00:32:15.982 --> 00:32:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And you can find those
and get rid of those, too.

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>> You're walking us into
the subconscious here.

00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:27.070 align:middle line:84%
There's people that have helped
to pioneer this understanding,

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:28.990 align:middle line:84%
including yourself,
that we are heavily

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:32.030 align:middle line:84%
conditioned during this
early stage of life.

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:35.620 align:middle line:84%
What is your understanding of
the role that the subconscious

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:39.070 align:middle line:84%
plays in this emotional
story, and how would you

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:41.070 align:middle line:90%
explain that to the layperson?

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:43.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if you think about it,
we have this conscious mind,

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:46.540 align:middle line:84%
which is where we spend all
of our waking hours, right?

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:49.300 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious mind
is the other part of us,

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.940 align:middle line:84%
this vastly
intelligent part of us,

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:56.230 align:middle line:84%
that is so smart that it
can take the sandwich you

00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:58.090 align:middle line:84%
had for lunch and can
convert some of that

00:32:58.090 --> 00:33:00.670 align:middle line:84%
over into new cardiac muscle
tissue or new nerve cells.

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:03.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a level of
intelligence beyond our ability

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:07.890 align:middle line:84%
to really comprehend at
this point where we are.

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:12.040 align:middle line:84%
So the conscious mind
is a tiny, tiny part

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:14.290 align:middle line:90%
of your total intelligence.

00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:16.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, they say that a
single cell in the body

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:19.270 align:middle line:84%
is equivalent in complexity
to a full-size aircraft

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:21.790 align:middle line:84%
carrier with thousands
of people working onboard

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:23.768 align:middle line:84%
at their different jobs,
with jets on the ramp,

00:33:23.768 --> 00:33:25.810 align:middle line:84%
with their engines spooled
up, ready to take off.

00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:26.800 align:middle line:90%
That's a single cell.

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And the last estimate was
that the average adult has

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:31.372 align:middle line:90%
about 137 trillion of those.

00:33:31.372 --> 00:33:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you something--
your subconscious mind is

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:36.760 align:middle line:84%
aware of every single one of
those, down to the DNA level,

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:39.150 align:middle line:90%
down to the quantum level.

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And so every face you've ever
seen in a crowd, everything

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:45.760 align:middle line:84%
you've ever eaten or tasted
or touched or smelled,

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:47.980 align:middle line:84%
the whole history of
your health or disease,

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:51.680 align:middle line:84%
it's all in there in
that subconscious mind.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:55.600 align:middle line:84%
So consciously, we are
barely functional, I think.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.940 align:middle line:84%
We like to think of
ourselves as really smart,

00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:59.830 align:middle line:84%
but the subconscious
mind puts us all

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:01.900 align:middle line:84%
to shame because it
is so intelligent.

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:03.580 align:middle line:90%
So what we have learned to do--

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:05.440 align:middle line:84%
and the Emotion Code
and the Body Code,

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.850 align:middle line:90%
all the work that we do--

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:10.060 align:middle line:84%
is based on this
understanding that we

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:12.550 align:middle line:84%
can ask questions
of the subconscious,

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:14.260 align:middle line:90%
and we can get answers.

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:18.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, the problem is, you
see, the conscious mind

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:24.230 align:middle line:84%
and the subconscious mind need
to agree on certain things.

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:27.010 align:middle line:10%
For example, let's say
that you would like

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:30.550 align:middle line:10%
to become wealthy, all right?

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:31.480 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's fine.

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:33.659 align:middle line:84%
Consciously, you want
to become wealthy.

00:34:33.659 --> 00:34:35.409 align:middle line:10%
And so you want to
move in that direction.

00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:37.179 align:middle line:10%
But if your
subconscious mind has

00:34:37.179 --> 00:34:39.070 align:middle line:10%
learned from the things
that have come in

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:42.489 align:middle line:10%
as inputs that it's not
OK for you to be wealthy,

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:44.409 align:middle line:10%
what will happen is
the subconscious mind

00:34:44.409 --> 00:34:49.270 align:middle line:10%
will prevent that, or you may
become wealthy and then lose

00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:51.458 align:middle line:10%
that wealth and have to
regain it over and over.

00:34:51.458 --> 00:34:52.750 align:middle line:90%
And this applies to everything.

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:56.500 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, for example,
that subconsciously--

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:58.000 align:middle line:84%
we actually had
this case once where

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000 align:middle line:84%
there was a woman who was
trying to lose weight.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.480 align:middle line:90%
She was very overweight.

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:04.000 align:middle line:84%
And what had happened
was, we finally

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.360 align:middle line:84%
were able to understand,
was that she had seen

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.085 align:middle line:90%
what happened with her mother.

00:35:09.085 --> 00:35:10.460 align:middle line:84%
Her mother, when
she was a child,

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:13.450 align:middle line:84%
was overweight, went on
a diet, lost the weight,

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:17.080 align:middle line:84%
promptly had an affair
and destroyed the family,

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:18.640 align:middle line:90%
ended up in divorce--

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:19.960 align:middle line:90%
terribly painful.

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:24.040 align:middle line:10%
So here's this child now who's
in her 40s and 50s trying

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:27.640 align:middle line:10%
to lose weight and can't
because the subconscious mind

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:32.217 align:middle line:10%
has this idea that if we lose
weight, we'll have an affair

00:35:32.217 --> 00:35:34.550 align:middle line:10%
and our marriage will end,
and that'll be the end of it.

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And so she was never able to
get to that point, you see.

00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And so that emotional
baggage will run us.

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you something,
the future, I believe,

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:47.320 align:middle line:84%
of human development
and human progress

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:53.170 align:middle line:84%
is to understand that if you
can line up the conscious mind

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:55.120 align:middle line:84%
and what your goals
and desires are

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:59.530 align:middle line:84%
with the subconscious mind,
when you can line those two up--

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:01.950 align:middle line:84%
by getting rid, generally,
of the emotional baggage

00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:03.700 align:middle line:84%
in the subconscious--
when you can line up

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:05.950 align:middle line:84%
the subconscious
with the conscious,

00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:08.230 align:middle line:84%
then things can really
happen for you, you see.

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And so far, we've
really, mainly,

00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:12.220 align:middle line:84%
been working with
the conscious mind.

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:14.690 align:middle line:84%
You think about all the
people who-- all of us,

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:17.290 align:middle line:84%
we've all done this,
we all buy tapes--

00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:18.880 align:middle line:90%
tapes, I'm dating myself--

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:21.100 align:middle line:84%
but we all listen to
things and watch videos,

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:23.110 align:middle line:84%
and we try to progress
and make our life work

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:25.750 align:middle line:84%
as well as we can with
the conscious mind.

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:28.570 align:middle line:84%
But if your conscious mind
is opposed to that, then

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:31.408 align:middle line:84%
no matter what you do,
it's not going to work out.

00:36:31.408 --> 00:36:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you something
else-- if your subconscious

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:40.300 align:middle line:84%
mind is OK with you being
sick or is OK with you having

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:44.500 align:middle line:84%
some kind of a disease or is
OK with you being depressed

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:46.840 align:middle line:84%
and so on, it's going to
be hard for you to get well

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:50.180 align:middle line:84%
until you start getting
rid of that baggage.

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:50.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:52.600 align:middle line:90%
This is huge.

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And we think of the subconscious
mind as the limbic brain,

00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:57.567 align:middle line:90%
right, just back here.

00:36:57.567 --> 00:36:58.900 align:middle line:90%
And this is the conscious brain.

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:01.910 align:middle line:84%
But how you described it to
me is that the subconscious

00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:02.710 align:middle line:90%
is everywhere.

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:04.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:05.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you explain that?

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:09.000 align:middle line:84%
Because we're taught this
sort of theory, right--

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.980 align:middle line:84%
conscious brain,
subconscious brain, or it's

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:13.760 align:middle line:84%
the little almond, or
it's the little this,

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:14.710 align:middle line:90%
or the limbic brain.

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:17.850 align:middle line:84%
But you're giving a
much more expansive idea

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:18.700 align:middle line:90%
of the subconscious.

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:19.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:24.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, I believe that our
entire body is intelligent, OK?

00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:27.360 align:middle line:84%
We have this analog
sort of computer

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:29.460 align:middle line:90%
with our physical brain.

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And we do our best to get
through life using this brain.

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:36.030 align:middle line:84%
But the great
secret, I believe, is

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:38.280 align:middle line:84%
that the seat of the
subconscious mind

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:39.630 align:middle line:90%
is really the heart.

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:41.760 align:middle line:84%
Back in the 1960s,
doctors first started

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.268 align:middle line:90%
doing heart transplants.

00:37:43.268 --> 00:37:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't take long before
people would come back and say

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:48.550 align:middle line:84%
things like, gee, my taste
in music or food or sports

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:49.808 align:middle line:90%
has totally changed.

00:37:49.808 --> 00:37:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Or they'd have memory,
sometimes, of places

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.520 align:middle line:84%
that they'd never in
their lives visited.

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes their handwriting
would have totally changed.

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:57.772 align:middle line:84%
And in every case, when
they were connected

00:37:57.772 --> 00:37:59.460 align:middle line:84%
with the family of
the heart donor,

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.470 align:middle line:84%
they would find out,
oh, my gosh, yes, that's

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:03.137 align:middle line:84%
our son's handwriting
that you have now.

00:38:03.137 --> 00:38:04.173 align:middle line:90%
How bizarre is that?

00:38:04.173 --> 00:38:06.090 align:middle line:84%
Or, yes, our daughter
was a concert violinist.

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:08.895 align:middle line:84%
That must be why those
passages of yours you

00:38:08.895 --> 00:38:10.020 align:middle line:90%
keep playing over and over.

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:11.395 align:middle line:84%
Those were her
favorite passages.

00:38:11.395 --> 00:38:12.460 align:middle line:90%
How strange is that?

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And the memories of the
places that you've been,

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:18.480 align:middle line:84%
yes, our son had been to those
places on his motorcycle trips,

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.920 align:middle line:90%
and now you have those memories.

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:20.850 align:middle line:90%
How bizarre is that?

00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:23.282 align:middle line:84%
Well, you see, the
ancients believed

00:38:23.282 --> 00:38:25.740 align:middle line:84%
that the heart was the seat of
the soul, the source of love

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:29.010 align:middle line:84%
and creativity and romance and,
really, the core of our being.

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And in the West, we've never
really given any of those ideas

00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:33.300 align:middle line:84%
any credence because,
of course, they

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:35.130 align:middle line:84%
didn't have the kind of
equipment that we have now.

00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:36.240 align:middle line:84%
We know the heart
is just to pump.

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:37.230 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:39.480 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, now,
thanks to HeartMath

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.820 align:middle line:84%
and some other people that
are doing this kind of work,

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:46.270 align:middle line:84%
we're finding out that the
heart really is a second brain.

00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, it puts
out this energy field.

00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:51.030 align:middle line:10%
And when you're feeling love or
affection for another person,

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:52.530 align:middle line:10%
your heart rates
will synchronize,

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:55.072 align:middle line:10%
and your heartbeat will become
measurable in their brainwaves

00:38:55.072 --> 00:38:56.220 align:middle line:10%
and so on.

00:38:56.220 --> 00:39:00.750 align:middle line:84%
So there is this
incredible aspect to us

00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:02.580 align:middle line:90%
that we've been unaware of.

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:05.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we have
found is that when

00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:07.710 align:middle line:84%
you feel like your
heart is going to break,

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:10.830 align:middle line:84%
when your heart is
under assault, really,

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:15.360 align:middle line:84%
when you're feeling deeply
hurt or deeply grieved

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:18.468 align:middle line:84%
about something, it becomes
a physical sensation.

00:39:18.468 --> 00:39:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's where that word
heartache comes from, right?

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Most people have felt this
at one time or another.

00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:24.420 align:middle line:84%
You feel like there's an
elephant sitting on your chest

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:26.730 align:middle line:84%
or like you're choking or
like you can't breathe.

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:30.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, when that's going on,
your subconscious mind itself

00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:32.890 align:middle line:90%
is under attack, I believe.

00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And so the subconscious will
put up a wall around that heart

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:38.460 align:middle line:84%
to protect that heart,
that core of your being,

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:40.260 align:middle line:90%
from being broken.

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And that wall is
made from layers

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:45.690 align:middle line:90%
of your emotional baggage--

00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:48.460 align:middle line:84%
your trapped
emotions, literally.

00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:51.235 align:middle line:84%
And so when you have this
kind of wall going on,

00:39:51.235 --> 00:39:52.860 align:middle line:84%
it makes it much more
difficult for you

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:54.450 align:middle line:90%
to connect with other people.

00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:58.200 align:middle line:84%
It makes it more
difficult for you to feel.

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.360 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the brain
that feels, you see.

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:01.570 align:middle line:90%
This brain feels nothing.

00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, here we
are in the 21st century,

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.658 align:middle line:84%
and we're still
thinking that using war

00:40:05.658 --> 00:40:07.200 align:middle line:84%
to settle differences
between nations

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:09.420 align:middle line:90%
is perfectly acceptable, right?

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And you'd think we would
have progressed beyond that.

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:15.450 align:middle line:84%
But it's because people in
power, along with most people,

00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:18.930 align:middle line:84%
are using this brain,
which feels nothing, right?

00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:20.580 align:middle line:90%
This brain is where we feel.

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And so a secret to transforming
this planet, I believe,

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:27.150 align:middle line:84%
is to get rid of
enough of these walls.

00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:30.240 align:middle line:84%
When those walls are taken down,
it's not unusual for people

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:33.030 align:middle line:84%
to fall in love who never,
ever thought they would,

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:34.860 align:middle line:90%
even at advanced ages.

00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:36.900 align:middle line:84%
It's not unusual
for creative ideas

00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:39.305 align:middle line:90%
to start to flow spontaneously.

00:40:39.305 --> 00:40:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you,
the best ideas

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:42.810 align:middle line:84%
you'll ever have will
be the ideas that

00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:46.990 align:middle line:84%
come from this brain,
not this brain, see?

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:49.210 align:middle line:84%
So when people tell you you
should follow your heart,

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:50.010 align:middle line:90%
they're right.

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:50.810 align:middle line:90%
You should.

00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:52.370 align:middle line:84%
But what if you
have a heart wall?

00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:57.120 align:middle line:84%
Because 93% of people have
this wall that they've put up.

00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:58.980 align:middle line:90%
And so it blocks them.

00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:00.970 align:middle line:84%
So getting rid of that
wall is so important.

00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:02.762 align:middle line:84%
And that's, really,
the most important part

00:41:02.762 --> 00:41:03.990 align:middle line:90%
of the Emotion Code.

00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And the instructions
are all in there,

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:07.710 align:middle line:90%
in the book, how to do this.

00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:09.690 align:middle line:84%
But I'll share one story
with you about this.

00:41:09.690 --> 00:41:12.540 align:middle line:84%
There was a woman who
came in to see me.

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:13.418 align:middle line:90%
She had neck pain.

00:41:13.418 --> 00:41:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And she'd been to a
couple of other doctors

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:16.890 align:middle line:84%
that hadn't been
able to help her.

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:19.600 align:middle line:84%
So she came in to see me and,
as I was talking with her,

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:22.340 align:middle line:90%
she told me that she was single.

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:24.407 align:middle line:84%
And she had been
single for eight years.

00:41:24.407 --> 00:41:26.490 align:middle line:84%
She hadn't dated in eight
years, and she was never

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:27.540 align:middle line:90%
going to date again.

00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:30.390 align:middle line:84%
She was going to die single,
and she was dead serious.

00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And I said, gee, why
do you feel this way?

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:36.428 align:middle line:84%
She told me that eight
years before, she

00:41:36.428 --> 00:41:38.220 align:middle line:84%
was really deeply in
love with this guy who

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:40.200 align:middle line:90%
dumped her and broke her heart.

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And that was it--
no more dating.

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:44.460 align:middle line:90%
Well, she was only 38 years old.

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:45.660 align:middle line:90%
She was an attractive woman.

00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:48.060 align:middle line:90%
She was a nurse.

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:50.250 align:middle line:90%
And so I started checking her.

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And I found she had put up
this wall around her heart.

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And there were three
layers of this wall,

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:56.520 align:middle line:84%
and each one of those
layers was an emotion

00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:58.770 align:middle line:84%
that had gotten
stuck in her body

00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:00.623 align:middle line:84%
from the breakup
eight years before.

00:42:00.623 --> 00:42:02.040 align:middle line:84%
So I cleared those
three emotions.

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, when
I got done, not only

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:05.940 align:middle line:90%
was the heart wall gone--

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:08.780 align:middle line:84%
this invisible energy wall
around her heart was gone--

00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:11.090 align:middle line:84%
but also, her neck pain was
suddenly, just completely,

00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:11.960 align:middle line:90%
gone.

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:14.283 align:middle line:84%
And so she left the office
feeling totally fine.

00:42:14.283 --> 00:42:15.950 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see her again
for three months.

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:17.590 align:middle line:90%
And when she came back in--

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:18.920 align:middle line:90%
I'll always remember this--

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:20.840 align:middle line:84%
I looked at her,
and I said, hey,

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.230 align:middle line:90%
I haven't seen you for a while.

00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:23.030 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:25.655 align:middle line:84%
She said, oh, she said, my neck
has been fine since I was here.

00:42:25.655 --> 00:42:27.813 align:middle line:84%
But, she said, you released
that heart wall for me,

00:42:27.813 --> 00:42:28.730 align:middle line:90%
and that really works.

00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:32.720 align:middle line:84%
Because, she said, about
two weeks after I was here,

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:35.660 align:middle line:84%
I found out my
childhood sweetheart has

00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:37.820 align:middle line:84%
been living right around
the corner from me

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:39.962 align:middle line:84%
for almost eight years,
and we're dating,

00:42:39.962 --> 00:42:41.420 align:middle line:84%
and we're in love,
and I think he's

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:43.220 align:middle line:90%
going to ask me to marry him.

00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought,
wow, what a shift.

00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:46.610 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:47.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Unbelievable.

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:50.540 align:middle line:84%
So how can people
develop an awareness

00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:54.650 align:middle line:84%
that they might have something
that's holding them back?

00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:59.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, first of all, I would
say that if you haven't had any

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:01.998 align:middle line:84%
of your emotional
baggage removed,

00:43:01.998 --> 00:43:04.040 align:middle line:84%
then you definitely have
things holding you back.

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:06.590 align:middle line:84%
Because this
phenomenon of trapped

00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:09.740 align:middle line:90%
emotions is really universal.

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:13.190 align:middle line:84%
If you're having any
kind of discomfort,

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:15.277 align:middle line:84%
that's a sign of
emotional baggage.

00:43:15.277 --> 00:43:17.360 align:middle line:84%
If you're having physical
discomfort in some way--

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:20.360 align:middle line:84%
there's something that doesn't
feel right in your body--

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:24.350 align:middle line:84%
99 times out of 100, there
will be some emotional baggage

00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:25.250 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:28.880 align:middle line:84%
If you're feeling some kind of
emotional or mental discomfort

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:32.180 align:middle line:84%
in some way, if your life
isn't working like it should,

00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:35.150 align:middle line:84%
if you keep picking the wrong
kind of person as a mate over

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:37.130 align:middle line:84%
and over and you
can't figure out why,

00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:41.090 align:middle line:84%
if you tend to feel certain
emotions that you don't really

00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:43.610 align:middle line:84%
understand-- you're not sure
where they're coming from--

00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:46.670 align:middle line:84%
if some things
easily trigger you,

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:49.880 align:middle line:84%
and you can become upset
at the drop of a hat,

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:53.780 align:middle line:84%
or you find yourself
crying for no reason,

00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:56.600 align:middle line:84%
or if you are not able to
keep enough money in your bank

00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:00.860 align:middle line:84%
account, or if you just
can't seem to find love,

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:06.140 align:middle line:84%
and you're alone, those are
all signs of emotional baggage.

00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:08.870 align:middle line:84%
I've come to the conclusion
that our emotional baggage

00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:12.290 align:middle line:84%
is the single biggest
common denominator for us

00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:15.590 align:middle line:84%
as human beings, for all the
trouble that we suffer from,

00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:17.390 align:middle line:90%
all the suffering that we have.

00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, one of the
interesting things about this

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:23.450 align:middle line:84%
is you can say the same
thing about animals.

00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:26.240 align:middle line:84%
Because animals also
develop trapped emotions.

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's the biggest
single underlying cause

00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:34.850 align:middle line:84%
of their behavioral and
physical difficulties, as well.

00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Especially our closest
domesticated friends like dogs.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you pick up a pound
dog and you can't pat it,

00:44:40.290 --> 00:44:42.200 align:middle line:84%
it's had some form
of abuse, right?

00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:45.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is probably a little
bit more philosophical, then.

00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:53.720 align:middle line:84%
If our emotions are causing
us so much discomfort,

00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:57.110 align:middle line:84%
causing us to be
sort of walled off

00:44:57.110 --> 00:45:00.770 align:middle line:84%
from achieving our
highest potential,

00:45:00.770 --> 00:45:02.660 align:middle line:84%
is their purpose
to make us suffer?

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:05.360 align:middle line:84%
Like, I believe in
the spiritual ideology

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:07.070 align:middle line:84%
that everything is
unfolding perfectly,

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:09.080 align:middle line:84%
that there is some sort
of perfection seeking

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:11.960 align:middle line:84%
to emerge through any
situation, whether it's

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:16.040 align:middle line:84%
a pain or a disease that's
causing us to adjust, to shift.

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:20.360 align:middle line:84%
What is your belief around
why these emotions are causing

00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:23.570 align:middle line:84%
so much suffering in our
life, and what are they there

00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:25.280 align:middle line:90%
to show us?

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they're there,
really, to teach us.

00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:30.120 align:middle line:84%
When you feel an emotion,
when something happens to you

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:31.820 align:middle line:84%
and you feel an
emotion coming up,

00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:35.040 align:middle line:84%
that's really a message
from your deep subconscious.

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:38.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, that message
that's coming up

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:42.440 align:middle line:84%
is happening not only because
of what's going on in the moment

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:45.890 align:middle line:84%
but it's also coming up
because of past experience.

00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And it may not even be
your past experience.

00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:52.640 align:middle line:84%
It may be the past experience
of an ancestor five or six or 10

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:57.120 align:middle line:84%
generations ago or more because
of what they went through.

00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And so when we experience
this kind of discomfort

00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:03.440 align:middle line:84%
in our lives, it's a
great teacher for us

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:06.740 align:middle line:84%
because it enables us, you
see, to eventually realize

00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:09.470 align:middle line:90%
that the body is talking to us.

00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:11.180 align:middle line:90%
Our bodies talk to us.

00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And the language of the body
is these kinds of things.

00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:18.200 align:middle line:84%
The language of the body
is discomfort in some way.

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:20.450 align:middle line:84%
But it may not
necessarily be physical.

00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:22.160 align:middle line:84%
It could be mental,
emotional, et cetera,

00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:25.280 align:middle line:90%
like we've talked about.

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:28.790 align:middle line:84%
Any time you're having any
kind of a symptom in your life,

00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:32.330 align:middle line:84%
there's usually an emotional
cause that's underlying that,

00:46:32.330 --> 00:46:35.220 align:middle line:84%
and that's how the
body speaks to you.

00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And if the emotion
is big enough,

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:39.350 align:middle line:84%
and if you ignore
it long enough,

00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:42.830 align:middle line:84%
it can become a
life-threatening problem for you

00:46:42.830 --> 00:46:45.020 align:middle line:90%
that you may be diagnosed with.

00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:46.787 align:middle line:84%
And your doctors
won't have any idea

00:46:46.787 --> 00:46:48.620 align:middle line:84%
why you're manifesting
this life-threatening

00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:51.530 align:middle line:84%
disease, and neither
will you, consciously.

00:46:51.530 --> 00:46:54.440 align:middle line:84%
But if you can just tap into
the subconscious mind, you see,

00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:56.630 align:middle line:84%
it has a perfect
understanding of why you're

00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:58.610 align:middle line:90%
manifesting whatever it is.

00:46:58.610 --> 00:47:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And you can ask questions,
and you can get answers,

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:05.330 align:middle line:84%
and most of the time,
things can improve.

00:47:05.330 --> 00:47:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And you learn that lesson,
and then you move on.

00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:12.890 align:middle line:84%
But I totally agree with you
that it's, really, all perfect,

00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:18.470 align:middle line:84%
and we're all moving towards
higher levels, hopefully.

00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And we're growing,
and we're progressing.

00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:23.157 align:middle line:84%
And that's, I think,
what life is about.

00:47:23.157 --> 00:47:23.990 align:middle line:90%
It's about learning.

00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:28.310 align:middle line:84%
It's about learning how to be
happy and have joy in spite

00:47:28.310 --> 00:47:30.410 align:middle line:90%
of what's going on around us.

00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think a key to
that-- just as an aside--

00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:34.130 align:middle line:84%
I think that a key
to that is learning

00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:37.470 align:middle line:84%
to have gratitude no
matter what happens,

00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:38.900 align:middle line:90%
even if things are going wrong.

00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:41.360 align:middle line:84%
If you can learn to
have gratitude and look

00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:43.220 align:middle line:84%
for the good in
that thing, you'll

00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:45.950 align:middle line:84%
probably find that there are
some hidden blessings in there

00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:47.520 align:middle line:90%
that you hadn't thought of.

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And gratitude and joy are
very, very similar vibrations.

00:47:52.310 --> 00:47:53.940 align:middle line:84%
They're very close
to each other.

00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:56.523 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the purpose of
our life, one of the purposes,

00:47:56.523 --> 00:47:58.460 align:middle line:84%
is to learn how to
live in a state of joy.

00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think the key,
really, is gratitude.

00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:04.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:07.820 align:middle line:84%
You're skilled at being
able to help identify

00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:10.330 align:middle line:90%
what these walls might be.

00:48:10.330 --> 00:48:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And when you talk about
identifying emotions,

00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:18.110 align:middle line:84%
I feel like you're
talking about hypnosis

00:48:18.110 --> 00:48:20.270 align:middle line:84%
or being able to speak
to the subconscious

00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:22.370 align:middle line:90%
or being able to do this.

00:48:22.370 --> 00:48:26.810 align:middle line:84%
Can people tap into identifying
their own trapped emotions,

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:28.790 align:middle line:90%
or do they need a facilitator?

00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And what's the process of really
identifying, and then also

00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:34.410 align:middle line:90%
releasing, these emotions?

00:48:34.410 --> 00:48:36.380 align:middle line:84%
I know that you do
different practices.

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:40.070 align:middle line:84%
But how can, if someone's on
their own and they're like,

00:48:40.070 --> 00:48:42.800 align:middle line:84%
well, I think I've got
an emotional issue,

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:45.980 align:middle line:84%
how can they discover
that, and then how can they

00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:47.838 align:middle line:90%
clear that emotion?

00:48:47.838 --> 00:48:49.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the Emotional
Code process is, actually,

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:51.380 align:middle line:90%
really simple.

00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And what I can do
with your viewers

00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:57.320 align:middle line:84%
is I can walk them
through something

00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:59.103 align:middle line:90%
that we call the sway test.

00:48:59.103 --> 00:49:01.520 align:middle line:84%
There are a number of different
methods of getting answers

00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:02.930 align:middle line:90%
from the subconscious mind.

00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:07.220 align:middle line:84%
They all have to do with how
balanced and how strong or weak

00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:08.922 align:middle line:90%
the muscles in the body are.

00:49:08.922 --> 00:49:10.880 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, one of
the methods that we use

00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:12.830 align:middle line:90%
is called the ring-in-ring test.

00:49:12.830 --> 00:49:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And you just make
a ring in a ring.

00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And as you ask
questions, your body

00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:18.980 align:middle line:84%
will tend to stay
stronger for yes,

00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:20.990 align:middle line:84%
and the rings will
tend to stay together,

00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:23.990 align:middle line:84%
or the rings might tend to
break if the answer is no.

00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Because what we have found is
that the subconscious mind has

00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:29.577 align:middle line:90%
an effect on the physical body.

00:49:29.577 --> 00:49:31.910 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious mind has an
effect on the physical body

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:34.430 align:middle line:84%
such that if the
subconscious mind is

00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:37.610 align:middle line:84%
manifesting a no
answer, your body

00:49:37.610 --> 00:49:39.320 align:middle line:90%
will be a little bit weaker.

00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And so you can
pick up that change

00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:43.592 align:middle line:84%
through various methods
of muscle testing.

00:49:43.592 --> 00:49:45.800 align:middle line:84%
But there's another method
that we call the sway test

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:47.100 align:middle line:90%
that I can share.

00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:49.700 align:middle line:90%
So here's how this works.

00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:51.410 align:middle line:84%
It works best if
you're standing.

00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:54.410 align:middle line:84%
So if you just stand
up and close your eyes,

00:49:54.410 --> 00:49:56.690 align:middle line:84%
drop your hands
down to your sides,

00:49:56.690 --> 00:50:01.770 align:middle line:84%
and just try to relax
there for a moment.

00:50:01.770 --> 00:50:03.200 align:middle line:84%
If you think about
something that

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:06.560 align:middle line:84%
is true or positive
or congruent,

00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:09.590 align:middle line:84%
the body will tend to sway
forward after a few seconds.

00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:11.810 align:middle line:84%
If you're thinking about
something that is not true,

00:50:11.810 --> 00:50:14.390 align:middle line:84%
something that's false or
negative or incongruent,

00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:17.580 align:middle line:84%
your body will tend
to sway backwards.

00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is seen
in plants, as well,

00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:22.370 align:middle line:84%
where, for example, if
you a plant in a pot

00:50:22.370 --> 00:50:23.510 align:middle line:84%
and you put it near
a window, it will

00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:25.802 align:middle line:84%
grow towards the light coming
in from the window, which

00:50:25.802 --> 00:50:26.700 align:middle line:90%
it needs.

00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:28.820 align:middle line:84%
But if you put a
plant in a room that

00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:30.543 align:middle line:84%
has uniform lighting
all around, and you

00:50:30.543 --> 00:50:32.210 align:middle line:84%
put a speaker in the
room that's playing

00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:35.090 align:middle line:84%
beautiful, soothing,
classical music and lullabies,

00:50:35.090 --> 00:50:38.493 align:middle line:84%
the plant will grow towards
the speaker playing the music.

00:50:38.493 --> 00:50:39.910 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
if that speaker

00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:44.480 align:middle line:84%
is blaring harsh, grating sounds
and annoying kinds of music,

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:47.120 align:middle line:84%
the plant will grow
away from the speaker.

00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:48.950 align:middle line:90%
And that's like the sway test.

00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:51.050 align:middle line:84%
So as you're standing there
with your eyes closed,

00:50:51.050 --> 00:50:54.500 align:middle line:84%
arms down by your
sides, totally relaxed,

00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:56.000 align:middle line:84%
we'll start with
something negative.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.940 align:middle line:90%
Think about the word "war."

00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:00.650 align:middle line:90%
We hear that word every day.

00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:02.000 align:middle line:90%
It's in the papers all the time.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.340 align:middle line:84%
All of our lives,
we've heard this word.

00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:06.980 align:middle line:84%
But imagine for a
moment that you're

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:10.790 align:middle line:84%
trying to explain to someone
on a human level what

00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:13.360 align:middle line:90%
really goes on in war.

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:14.540 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:17.270 align:middle line:84%
What are young men doing
to other young men?

00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:20.090 align:middle line:84%
What's happening to young men
and young women and families

00:51:20.090 --> 00:51:21.020 align:middle line:90%
and children?

00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:23.570 align:middle line:90%
What's going on in wars?

00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:24.840 align:middle line:90%
Think about that for a moment.

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:27.510 align:middle line:90%
What is really happening?

00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:30.890 align:middle line:84%
If you were involved in a
war, what would that be like?

00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:33.980 align:middle line:84%
What are things that you'd be
expected to do to other people?

00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:36.760 align:middle line:90%
What would that be like?

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:40.197 align:middle line:84%
As you're thinking about that,
the moment your subconscious

00:51:40.197 --> 00:51:42.530 align:middle line:84%
mind makes a connection with
what your conscious mind is

00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:44.510 align:middle line:84%
thinking, at that
moment, your body

00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:46.550 align:middle line:84%
will start to sway
backward, trying

00:51:46.550 --> 00:51:49.100 align:middle line:84%
to move you away from
the sheer negativity

00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:52.580 align:middle line:90%
of that thought of war.

00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:55.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's shift gears and
go to something positive.

00:51:55.820 --> 00:52:01.370 align:middle line:84%
Imagine now that, as you're
standing there, eyes closed,

00:52:01.370 --> 00:52:03.620 align:middle line:84%
hands down by your
sides, totally relaxed,

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:05.420 align:middle line:84%
imagine that a thousand
years have gone by.

00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:07.430 align:middle line:84%
We're a thousand
years in the future.

00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:10.550 align:middle line:84%
You're still alive, but
you're a different person

00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:13.790 align:middle line:84%
than you used to be
because you're capable now

00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:17.600 align:middle line:84%
of giving and receiving
pure, unconditional love.

00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:20.630 align:middle line:84%
Imagine now that you're
bathed in this field

00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:22.350 align:middle line:90%
of unconditional love.

00:52:22.350 --> 00:52:24.260 align:middle line:84%
But not only that,
you've changed

00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:28.880 align:middle line:84%
because you're capable and
full of unconditional love

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:30.922 align:middle line:84%
for all creation,
for every creature,

00:52:30.922 --> 00:52:31.880 align:middle line:90%
for the whole universe.

00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And imagine that the love
that fills your heart

00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:39.470 align:middle line:84%
is so big that your heart
can't even contain that love,

00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:43.040 align:middle line:84%
and that love
expands out from you

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:45.710 align:middle line:84%
and fills the
immensity of space.

00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:47.900 align:middle line:84%
Imagine what it
would be like to be

00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:51.930 align:middle line:84%
a being capable of that
kind of love, on that order.

00:52:51.930 --> 00:52:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, as you're
thinking about that

00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:57.680 align:middle line:84%
and what that would be
like, when your subconscious

00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:00.800 align:middle line:84%
mind connects with what your
conscious mind is thinking,

00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:02.630 align:middle line:84%
your body will start
to sway forward

00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:06.590 align:middle line:84%
because it wants to move
towards that kind of state,

00:53:06.590 --> 00:53:09.110 align:middle line:90%
you see, that state of being.

00:53:09.110 --> 00:53:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of your
watchers, I know,

00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:14.150 align:middle line:84%
are right on their
tiptoes with that.

00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:16.750 align:middle line:90%
Because that's a real thing.

00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it's something
that we're capable of, you see,

00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:19.940 align:middle line:90%
as time goes on.

00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:21.195 align:middle line:90%
Because we're eternal beings.

00:53:21.195 --> 00:53:22.070 align:middle line:90%
We have no beginning.

00:53:22.070 --> 00:53:23.690 align:middle line:90%
I believe we'll have no end.

00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:25.880 align:middle line:84%
This is just a phase
we're passing through

00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:27.800 align:middle line:90%
to learn some things.

00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:30.250 align:middle line:90%
So that's the sway test.

00:53:30.250 --> 00:53:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can also
use the sway test,

00:53:31.850 --> 00:53:32.933 align:middle line:90%
and you can ask questions.

00:53:32.933 --> 00:53:35.420 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example, as
you're standing there,

00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:37.940 align:middle line:84%
totally relaxed, arms down
by your sides, eyes closed,

00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:41.760 align:middle line:84%
you could ask yourself
a question like,

00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:43.908 align:middle line:90%
do I have a trapped emotion?

00:53:43.908 --> 00:53:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And as you think
about that thought--

00:53:45.450 --> 00:53:49.910 align:middle line:84%
do I have a trapped emotion,
do I have a trapped emotion--

00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:54.680 align:middle line:84%
if you do, your body will
start to sway forward for yes.

00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't, your body will
start to sway backward for no.

00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:01.130 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't, it's probably
because you have a heart wall,

00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:03.260 align:middle line:84%
and that's really
blocking things.

00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:06.740 align:middle line:84%
So you can also ask,
do I have a heart wall?

00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And your body will
go forward or back.

00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Getting rid of that
heart wall, I believe,

00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:11.325 align:middle line:84%
is about the most
important thing

00:54:11.325 --> 00:54:13.460 align:middle line:90%
that you can do for yourself.

00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:16.010 align:middle line:84%
It's not unusual at
all for people's lives

00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:20.420 align:middle line:84%
to change in dramatic ways
when that wall is taken down.

00:54:20.420 --> 00:54:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Do we put up heart
walls to protect ourselves?

00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:25.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every emotional
response in our lives

00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:28.800 align:middle line:84%
is a response to save
ourselves, in a way.

00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:32.135 align:middle line:84%
And so we must hold
on to them with vigor.

00:54:32.135 --> 00:54:34.010 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to let go
of them because we're

00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:36.670 align:middle line:84%
scared that, if we
do, we might suffer.

00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:39.890 align:middle line:84%
>> The heart wall, we believe,
is always put up in response

00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:45.510 align:middle line:84%
to the heart being under
attack, or under assault.

00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And so it's there as
a protective mechanism

00:54:50.190 --> 00:54:52.650 align:middle line:84%
in the same way that, if
the bombs are falling,

00:54:52.650 --> 00:54:55.860 align:middle line:84%
you might want to move down into
the bunker for a while until

00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:57.450 align:middle line:90%
the bombs stop falling.

00:54:57.450 --> 00:55:00.150 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is, when
the bombs stop falling,

00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:02.430 align:middle line:84%
when the divorce is over
or the bully moves away

00:55:02.430 --> 00:55:06.120 align:middle line:84%
or you quit that job
and get a better one,

00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:10.620 align:middle line:84%
the problem is that your heart
is still inside this bunker.

00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And so to get the heart
out of the bunker,

00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:16.200 align:middle line:84%
the only way that we know
of is to actually identify

00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:20.280 align:middle line:84%
those emotional layers one
at a time and release those.

00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And so, to continue with what
we were talking about before,

00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:25.620 align:middle line:84%
the process is we have
a chart of emotions.

00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:27.360 align:middle line:84%
There are 60 emotions
on this chart.

00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:30.210 align:middle line:84%
It's divided into two
columns and six rows.

00:55:30.210 --> 00:55:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And so once you're
able, in some way,

00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:35.220 align:middle line:84%
to get yes or no answers
from the subconscious mind

00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:39.430 align:middle line:84%
with the sway test or some other
method, then you simply ask,

00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:40.920 align:middle line:90%
do I have a heart wall?

00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And if the subconscious
mind says yes, then you ask,

00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:46.830 align:middle line:84%
can I release an emotion
from the heart wall now?

00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And we ask this question because
sometimes some people need

00:55:49.710 --> 00:55:51.840 align:middle line:90%
to keep the wall for a while.

00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:53.340 align:middle line:84%
But in my own
experience, I've never

00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:56.790 align:middle line:84%
seen the subconscious mind
want to keep that wall

00:55:56.790 --> 00:55:58.560 align:middle line:90%
for more than about a week.

00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:01.860 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes the
subconscious mind will say,

00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:03.300 align:middle line:90%
no, I need this wall.

00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:06.300 align:middle line:84%
But then, as the
mind weighs things,

00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:08.220 align:middle line:84%
it finally realizes,
you know, I really

00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:10.830 align:middle line:84%
do need to get rid
of this because it's

00:56:10.830 --> 00:56:15.060 align:middle line:84%
interfering with my ability to
really experience life fully.

00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And so, then you can
identify in the same way,

00:56:17.130 --> 00:56:20.100 align:middle line:84%
getting yes and no answers,
you identify the emotion.

00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:21.990 align:middle line:84%
Is this emotion in
column A or column B?

00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:23.265 align:middle line:90%
One of those will be strong.

00:56:23.265 --> 00:56:25.515 align:middle line:84%
And then, is it in one of
the odd rows or an even row?

00:56:25.515 --> 00:56:26.700 align:middle line:90%
And one of those will be strong.

00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And that'll take you to a
cell with five emotions.

00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And then, you just ask,
well, is it pride or shame

00:56:31.230 --> 00:56:33.240 align:middle line:84%
or shock or unworthy
or worthless?

00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:35.640 align:middle line:84%
And one of those will be
strong, unless the emotion is

00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:38.190 align:middle line:84%
inherited, and then
those will probably all

00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:40.590 align:middle line:84%
be weak, which is
the signal that you

00:56:40.590 --> 00:56:44.980 align:middle line:84%
need to go to the
inherited realm

00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:47.300 align:middle line:84%
and that that's
where it came from.

00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:49.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And is it
inherited via lineage,

00:56:49.170 --> 00:56:53.710 align:middle line:84%
or is it inherited via
social incarnation or all

00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:54.510 align:middle line:90%
of the above?

00:56:54.510 --> 00:56:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Because we can understand
with some consistency

00:56:57.930 --> 00:57:01.500 align:middle line:84%
that if there's been a lot
of trauma or pain or struggle

00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:03.743 align:middle line:84%
in the early parts of your
life and your father's

00:57:03.743 --> 00:57:05.910 align:middle line:84%
life or your mother's life
and your father's father,

00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:07.500 align:middle line:90%
then that can make sense.

00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:10.110 align:middle line:84%
But do you also consider
these other esoteric forms

00:57:10.110 --> 00:57:13.620 align:middle line:90%
of imprinting?

00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what we find in our
testing is that we do inherit

00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:23.640 align:middle line:84%
emotional energies
from a parent.

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And those, according
to the testing,

00:57:25.170 --> 00:57:26.550 align:middle line:90%
those come at conception.

00:57:26.550 --> 00:57:30.090 align:middle line:84%
So when we're conceived, those
are passed from Mom or Dad.

00:57:30.090 --> 00:57:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes these can go
back for many generations.

00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And science is now
bearing this out, right.

00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:39.330 align:middle line:90%


00:57:39.330 --> 00:57:42.300 align:middle line:84%
For example, they're finding
that the grandchildren

00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:47.490 align:middle line:84%
of Holocaust survivors have
radically different markers

00:57:47.490 --> 00:57:50.610 align:middle line:84%
for aging and are much
more susceptible to stress.

00:57:50.610 --> 00:57:54.570 align:middle line:84%
Their DNA changes, and
the hormones for aging

00:57:54.570 --> 00:57:58.080 align:middle line:84%
are markedly elevated in the
grandchildren of Holocaust

00:57:58.080 --> 00:57:58.978 align:middle line:90%
survivors.

00:57:58.978 --> 00:58:01.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, medicine is trying to
understand how this happens,

00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:03.030 align:middle line:84%
but in the Emotion Code,
we know how it happens.

00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:04.863 align:middle line:84%
Because the emotional
energy is passed down,

00:58:04.863 --> 00:58:06.480 align:middle line:90%
and it can be released.

00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And that energy, also, we
find, releases not only

00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:12.420 align:middle line:84%
from the living human being
that it's released from--

00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:15.600 align:middle line:84%
or animal, they inherit
sometimes, as well--

00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:19.233 align:middle line:84%
but also, those energies
release from the parent

00:58:19.233 --> 00:58:21.150 align:middle line:84%
and the grandparent and
the great grandparent,

00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:22.980 align:middle line:90%
all the way back.

00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:25.690 align:middle line:90%
And we've seen this happen.

00:58:25.690 --> 00:58:27.720 align:middle line:10%
In fact, I'll share
a story with you,

00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:31.230 align:middle line:10%
and then I'll try to answer
some of the other questions.

00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:32.787 align:middle line:84%
I was at an event
once, and there

00:58:32.787 --> 00:58:34.620 align:middle line:84%
was a woman who came
up out of the audience.

00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:36.360 align:middle line:84%
I asked for a volunteer
who was in pain,

00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:37.440 align:middle line:90%
and this woman came up.

00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:41.400 align:middle line:84%
She limped up from the
audience up onto the stage.

00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:42.420 align:middle line:90%
She had a hip problem.

00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:45.075 align:middle line:84%
And it was a nine on
a zero to 10 scale.

00:58:45.075 --> 00:58:47.040 align:middle line:84%
It had been going
on for about a year.

00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:49.080 align:middle line:84%
She'd seen a couple of
other doctors for it,

00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:50.788 align:middle line:84%
but she hadn't been
able to get any help.

00:58:50.788 --> 00:58:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And it was so bad, she'd
have to literally lift

00:58:53.730 --> 00:58:57.930 align:middle line:84%
her leg with her hands to
get in and out of her car.

00:58:57.930 --> 00:58:59.190 align:middle line:90%
It was really bad.

00:58:59.190 --> 00:59:01.628 align:middle line:84%
So I found an imbalance
and released it,

00:59:01.628 --> 00:59:03.420 align:middle line:84%
and it took her pain
from a nine to a four.

00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:04.962 align:middle line:84%
And then, the next
thing that I found

00:59:04.962 --> 00:59:07.050 align:middle line:84%
was that she had had an
inherited trapped emotion.

00:59:07.050 --> 00:59:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And the inherited
trapped emotion,

00:59:08.370 --> 00:59:09.578 align:middle line:90%
she'd gotten from her father.

00:59:09.578 --> 00:59:11.400 align:middle line:84%
The emotion was
fear, as I recall.

00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:13.237 align:middle line:84%
He'd gotten it from
his father, and he'd

00:59:13.237 --> 00:59:14.320 align:middle line:90%
gotten it from his father.

00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:16.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, the subconscious mind--
this woman's subconscious

00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:18.323 align:middle line:84%
mind-- knew where
this had come from.

00:59:18.323 --> 00:59:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm just asking
questions and getting answers

00:59:20.490 --> 00:59:23.130 align:middle line:84%
from her subconscious--
yes, no, yes, no.

00:59:23.130 --> 00:59:25.443 align:middle line:90%
And it went back 12 generations.

00:59:25.443 --> 00:59:27.360 align:middle line:10%
Now, one of the things
that's funny about this

00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:34.350 align:middle line:10%
is that we have found
that, in these cases,

00:59:34.350 --> 00:59:37.325 align:middle line:10%
those ancestors will
actually appear.

00:59:37.325 --> 00:59:38.700 align:middle line:84%
Every time I've
ever tested this,

00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:40.500 align:middle line:90%
they always seem to show up.

00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:42.750 align:middle line:84%
They don't appear so that
people can see them--

00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:44.080 align:middle line:90%
I've never seen one--

00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:46.830 align:middle line:84%
but they show up so that if I
ask the person on the muscle

00:59:46.830 --> 00:59:50.430 align:middle line:84%
test, are all of these
ancestors here in this room,

00:59:50.430 --> 00:59:51.988 align:middle line:90%
the answer is always yes.

00:59:51.988 --> 00:59:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'll ask, well, are
they out in the audience?

00:59:54.030 --> 00:59:54.840 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:56.320 align:middle line:90%
Are they floating in the air?

00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:57.120 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:59:57.120 --> 00:59:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Are they standing on
the stage with us?

00:59:58.920 --> 01:00:00.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes, every single time.

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:02.640 align:middle line:84%
I've done this all
over the world, right.

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And so, they were there, and
there wasn't anything else

01:00:06.030 --> 01:00:07.225 align:middle line:90%
we needed to know.

01:00:07.225 --> 01:00:08.100 align:middle line:90%
But think about this.

01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:10.080 align:middle line:90%
Why would they show up?

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:11.970 align:middle line:84%
Because, you see,
in quantum physics,

01:00:11.970 --> 01:00:16.520 align:middle line:84%
one energy can be shared in
an infinite number of places.

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:19.520 align:middle line:84%
It can appear in the
same place simultaneously

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:21.040 align:middle line:90%
to an infinite number.

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And so, when a
trapped emotion is

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:25.170 align:middle line:84%
shared, that emotional
energy is not duplicated,

01:00:25.170 --> 01:00:28.080 align:middle line:84%
it's just shared in this strange
quantum physics kind of way.

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:30.030 align:middle line:84%
So all those ancestors
had this energy.

01:00:30.030 --> 01:00:33.000 align:middle line:84%
They were there because it was
about to be removed from them.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And some of them had been
dead for a long time, right?

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:38.520 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I released
that trapped emotion.

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:40.885 align:middle line:84%
And the pain instantly
went to a zero.

01:00:40.885 --> 01:00:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And she's dancing
around on the stage--

01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:43.927 align:middle line:84%
I mean, literally,
dancing around.

01:00:43.927 --> 01:00:45.000 align:middle line:90%
It was gone.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And she went back and
sat down in the audience.

01:00:46.650 --> 01:00:47.733 align:middle line:90%
And I finished my lecture.

01:00:47.733 --> 01:00:50.617 align:middle line:84%
And when I went back to
our booth when I was done,

01:00:50.617 --> 01:00:52.950 align:middle line:84%
about a minute after that, a
woman came up to the booth,

01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:54.242 align:middle line:90%
and here's what she said to me.

01:00:54.242 --> 01:00:57.450 align:middle line:84%
She said, Dr. Nelson, she said,
I want you to know something.

01:00:57.450 --> 01:00:59.760 align:middle line:84%
She said, I am one
of those people

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:02.730 align:middle line:84%
who have that gift to be
able to see these spirits

01:01:02.730 --> 01:01:03.930 align:middle line:90%
that other people don't see.

01:01:03.930 --> 01:01:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And she said, it's kind
of been a blessing,

01:01:05.130 --> 01:01:06.090 align:middle line:90%
and it's kind of been a curse.

01:01:06.090 --> 01:01:07.965 align:middle line:84%
But she said, I wanted
you to know something.

01:01:07.965 --> 01:01:10.680 align:middle line:84%
She said, when you were talking
about those ancestors of hers--

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:12.900 align:middle line:84%
all those grandfathers all
the way back-- she said,

01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:16.410 align:middle line:84%
I wanted you to know that I saw
them all, just like you said.

01:01:16.410 --> 01:01:18.397 align:middle line:84%
They were all there,
just like you described.

01:01:18.397 --> 01:01:19.980 align:middle line:84%
But she said, there
was something else

01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:22.510 align:middle line:84%
going on that I'm not
sure you were aware of.

01:01:22.510 --> 01:01:24.360 align:middle line:84%
She said, what I
saw was, surrounding

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:28.110 align:middle line:84%
the stage were at
least 200 spirits,

01:01:28.110 --> 01:01:29.260 align:middle line:90%
and I knew who they were.

01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:33.690 align:middle line:84%
They were this woman's
unborn descendants,

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:36.480 align:middle line:84%
and they were there
rejoicing that they were not

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:38.310 align:middle line:84%
going to have to
take on this woman's

01:01:38.310 --> 01:01:41.912 align:middle line:90%
crippling emotional baggage.

01:01:41.912 --> 01:01:43.400 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:45.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Whoa.

01:01:45.010 --> 01:01:45.810 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

01:01:45.810 --> 01:01:48.540 align:middle line:90%


01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:55.230 align:middle line:84%
It takes a small journey into
this esoteric pool of knowledge

01:01:55.230 --> 01:01:59.160 align:middle line:84%
to start to understand that when
we delve into the subconscious

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:03.780 align:middle line:84%
through hypnosis, there's this
recollection of soul journeys

01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:05.940 align:middle line:84%
and soul planes and
incarnations which

01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:08.552 align:middle line:90%
is impossible to ignore now.

01:02:08.552 --> 01:02:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And so, I can definitely
see that there's

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:14.040 align:middle line:84%
some incredible work to
be done on this plane.

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it's really interesting.

01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most
profound experiences

01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:22.990 align:middle line:84%
that I had in my
life with healing,

01:02:22.990 --> 01:02:25.330 align:middle line:84%
it was two years after "The
Emotion Code" book came out,

01:02:25.330 --> 01:02:27.480 align:middle line:84%
and I asked my daughter,
Natalie, to work on me.

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And she was in Seattle,
and I was near Las Vegas.

01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:34.022 align:middle line:84%
But this work is
done at a distance.

01:02:34.022 --> 01:02:34.980 align:middle line:90%
So she's working on me.

01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:36.438 align:middle line:84%
We're not on the
phone or anything.

01:02:36.438 --> 01:02:38.410 align:middle line:84%
She finds I have this
inherited trapped emotion

01:02:38.410 --> 01:02:39.210 align:middle line:90%
of hopelessness.

01:02:39.210 --> 01:02:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And when she finds
that, she starts

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:43.650 align:middle line:84%
to feel emotional
herself about this.

01:02:43.650 --> 01:02:47.158 align:middle line:84%
And she finds out,
through testing,

01:02:47.158 --> 01:02:48.450 align:middle line:90%
that I got this from my father.

01:02:48.450 --> 01:02:49.320 align:middle line:90%
He got it from his mother.

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:50.445 align:middle line:90%
She got it from her mother.

01:02:50.445 --> 01:02:55.590 align:middle line:84%
It goes back 22 generations
to, probably, the 1400s.

01:02:55.590 --> 01:02:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
my daughter can

01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:59.940 align:middle line:84%
feel the presence of this
woman, this grandmother,

01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:01.320 align:middle line:90%
that this began with.

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:03.720 align:middle line:84%
She can feel her standing
right next to her,

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:07.710 align:middle line:84%
not in a spooky or a creepy kind
of way but just, she was there.

01:03:07.710 --> 01:03:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And my daughter could feel
this woman's emotions,

01:03:09.810 --> 01:03:10.610 align:middle line:90%
this grandmother.

01:03:10.610 --> 01:03:13.020 align:middle line:84%
She could feel how
desperate she was

01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:16.560 align:middle line:84%
to have this emotional energy
released from her posterity.

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And she could also feel how
overwhelmed with gratitude

01:03:18.810 --> 01:03:21.360 align:middle line:84%
this woman was that
this was being done.

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:23.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, when that was
released, my daughter

01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:26.730 align:middle line:84%
could feel it ripple through
all those generations.

01:03:26.730 --> 01:03:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And I had this
experience where, all

01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:33.430 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden, this background
music of hopelessness that

01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:38.940 align:middle line:84%
had been playing in my life,
every waking moment of my life,

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:39.817 align:middle line:90%
was suddenly gone.

01:03:39.817 --> 01:03:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And I never even knew that
it was there until the moment

01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:43.272 align:middle line:90%
that it was gone.

01:03:43.272 --> 01:03:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And then the silence
was deafening.

01:03:44.730 --> 01:03:49.290 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, my gosh,
I've had that all my life,

01:03:49.290 --> 01:03:51.420 align:middle line:90%
and it was an antique.

01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:52.370 align:middle line:90%
It was ancient.

01:03:52.370 --> 01:03:54.930 align:middle line:84%
It was from that grandmother
all those generations ago.

01:03:54.930 --> 01:03:58.230 align:middle line:84%
So you think about, you see,
we're a product not only

01:03:58.230 --> 01:04:01.500 align:middle line:84%
of our own emotional
baggage from our own life

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:04.260 align:middle line:84%
that we've lived since we were
born or since we were conceived

01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:08.610 align:middle line:84%
but also we have this inherited
energy that we often receive.

01:04:08.610 --> 01:04:09.767 align:middle line:90%
We all have it.

01:04:09.767 --> 01:04:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And you think about, I
mean, some of our ancestors

01:04:11.850 --> 01:04:14.100 align:middle line:84%
went through the pogroms or they
went through all kinds of wars

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:14.640 align:middle line:90%
or who knows.

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:16.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you go back
500 or 600 years,

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:19.600 align:middle line:84%
life was difficult, at
best, for everybody.

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:20.850 align:middle line:90%
So we have that baggage.

01:04:20.850 --> 01:04:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And we also sometimes
come into this world

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:28.410 align:middle line:84%
and are conceived
with other baggage.

01:04:28.410 --> 01:04:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you
what we are finding--

01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:33.330 align:middle line:84%
this is really interesting,
but the subconscious mind knows

01:04:33.330 --> 01:04:34.890 align:middle line:90%
these answers, of course--

01:04:34.890 --> 01:04:36.990 align:middle line:84%
and what we're
finding is it appears

01:04:36.990 --> 01:04:40.140 align:middle line:84%
that every single person who's
walking around on this Earth

01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:45.380 align:middle line:84%
has been here before as a
person without a physical body,

01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:51.250 align:middle line:84%
but as an angel on assignment
to guide and help someone else--

01:04:51.250 --> 01:04:56.200 align:middle line:84%
probably one of their
connections, a family member--

01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:58.000 align:middle line:90%
through this life.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes, when
you're in that state

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:03.310 align:middle line:84%
and you're living,
really, as a guardian

01:05:03.310 --> 01:05:06.640 align:middle line:84%
angel to a person who's
going through mortality,

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:10.390 align:middle line:84%
you might experience emotional
intensity that you may now then

01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:11.620 align:middle line:90%
take with you.

01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And maybe hundreds
of years later,

01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:14.440 align:middle line:90%
you're actually born yourself.

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And then you wonder why
certain things cause

01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:20.710 align:middle line:90%
you to feel certain emotions.

01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:23.670 align:middle line:90%
It's really interesting.

01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:25.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Wowsers.

01:05:25.150 --> 01:05:28.720 align:middle line:84%
Let's move a little bit
more to present day.

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:30.160 align:middle line:90%
We're here.

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:32.500 align:middle line:84%
What other practices
can people do--

01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:35.200 align:middle line:84%
as we come to wrapping up
here-- what other practices can

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:40.690 align:middle line:84%
people do on a regular basis to
be attentive to their emotions,

01:05:40.690 --> 01:05:41.950 align:middle line:90%
to soothe their emotions?

01:05:41.950 --> 01:05:45.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- is it
hot bath, meditation.

01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:47.590 align:middle line:84%
What practices are
there, separate,

01:05:47.590 --> 01:05:49.420 align:middle line:90%
that you recommend to people?

01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:51.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, meditation, of
course, is wonderful.

01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'm always reminded of Wayne
Dyer, who was, at one point,

01:05:55.450 --> 01:05:58.195 align:middle line:84%
told by a guru, you
need to meditate, Wayne.

01:05:58.195 --> 01:06:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yeah, yeah,
tell me something else.

01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:03.830 align:middle line:90%
But meditation is important.

01:06:03.830 --> 01:06:08.080 align:middle line:84%
It's also important to realize
that we choose our emotions,

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:10.360 align:middle line:84%
that our emotions that come
up for us our messengers

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:14.350 align:middle line:84%
from the subconscious but that
we also have the opportunity

01:06:14.350 --> 01:06:16.630 align:middle line:84%
to experience
whatever is coming up

01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:21.130 align:middle line:84%
but then change that
into a different emotion,

01:06:21.130 --> 01:06:22.030 align:middle line:90%
a positive emotion.

01:06:22.030 --> 01:06:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole a whole
palette of positive emotions

01:06:24.790 --> 01:06:26.950 align:middle line:90%
that we can choose from, right?

01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:28.390 align:middle line:90%
So that's important.

01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:31.660 align:middle line:84%
I think that forgiveness
is critically important,

01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:33.670 align:middle line:84%
and we often forget
about forgiveness.

01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:37.480 align:middle line:84%
But I think that you can't
really have peace in your life

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:39.730 align:middle line:84%
if there's someone that
you have not forgiven.

01:06:39.730 --> 01:06:42.580 align:middle line:84%
Because it creates an
energy blockage, you see.

01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And so energy can't
flow if you're

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:45.490 align:middle line:90%
stopping that forgiveness.

01:06:45.490 --> 01:06:48.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, it may be that
you need to forgive

01:06:48.490 --> 01:06:50.380 align:middle line:90%
you-- yourself-- for something.

01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:52.640 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we all do stupid things.

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:54.680 align:middle line:90%
But forgiveness is possible.

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things we've
found is that sometimes people

01:06:57.460 --> 01:07:02.680 align:middle line:84%
who cannot forgive someone who's
really wronged them find that

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:05.550 align:middle line:84%
when they remove the emotional
baggage around the event

01:07:05.550 --> 01:07:09.670 align:middle line:84%
or around the person, they
are able to move to that point

01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:12.920 align:middle line:84%
where they can
forgive and move on.

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's also
important to realize

01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:17.560 align:middle line:90%
that life is a process.

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And there was a great
guru who escapes me now

01:07:22.990 --> 01:07:27.610 align:middle line:84%
who once said that, in my world,
nothing ever goes wrong, right?

01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:29.860 align:middle line:10%
And I think that
it's a great attitude

01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:31.510 align:middle line:10%
to have that
everything is perfect,

01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:34.775 align:middle line:10%
and everything is unfolding
for you as it's supposed to,

01:07:34.775 --> 01:07:37.150 align:middle line:10%
but what are you supposed to
learn from these things that

01:07:37.150 --> 01:07:38.290 align:middle line:10%
are going on?

01:07:38.290 --> 01:07:40.810 align:middle line:84%
I used to tell my
patients who, many of them

01:07:40.810 --> 01:07:43.570 align:middle line:84%
had been told there was no
hope, that their disease was

01:07:43.570 --> 01:07:44.830 align:middle line:90%
forever--

01:07:44.830 --> 01:07:48.545 align:middle line:84%
many of them, if they believed
that, it would be hard

01:07:48.545 --> 01:07:50.420 align:middle line:84%
for them to get well--
but I would tell them,

01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:52.390 align:middle line:84%
look, just because
you've been diagnosed

01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:55.510 align:middle line:84%
with this particular
thing, if you

01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:58.582 align:middle line:84%
have learned what you
need to learn from this

01:07:58.582 --> 01:08:00.040 align:middle line:84%
and if the higher
power is willing,

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:04.010 align:middle line:84%
there's no reason why
you can't get better.

01:08:04.010 --> 01:08:04.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

01:08:04.810 --> 01:08:08.830 align:middle line:84%
One last thing you brought up
very briefly in our discussion

01:08:08.830 --> 01:08:11.800 align:middle line:84%
before we had this interview
was the power of language.

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:13.558 align:middle line:84%
And I've interviewed
a lot of people

01:08:13.558 --> 01:08:14.600 align:middle line:90%
on the power of language.

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And there was one
particular story

01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:18.263 align:middle line:84%
that we came across recently
about a gentleman who

01:08:18.263 --> 01:08:20.319 align:middle line:84%
was in a car accident,
and he nearly died.

01:08:20.319 --> 01:08:24.058 align:middle line:84%
There was his crushed femur, and
it narrowly missed the artery,

01:08:24.058 --> 01:08:26.350 align:middle line:84%
and he would have bled to
death in 55 seconds-- smashed

01:08:26.350 --> 01:08:27.150 align:middle line:90%
his face.

01:08:27.150 --> 01:08:29.470 align:middle line:84%
It was really a
horrific accident.

01:08:29.470 --> 01:08:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And he studied, then,
Buddhism and psychology

01:08:33.370 --> 01:08:36.790 align:middle line:84%
and trying to make peace and
amends with the situation.

01:08:36.790 --> 01:08:40.270 align:middle line:84%
But his story was, I nearly
died in a car accident.

01:08:40.270 --> 01:08:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until
25, 30 years later,

01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:44.750 align:middle line:84%
when he was doing a workshop,
and someone said, well,

01:08:44.750 --> 01:08:47.380 align:middle line:90%
you can't nearly be pregnant.

01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:48.790 align:middle line:90%
You can't nearly have died.

01:08:48.790 --> 01:08:49.720 align:middle line:90%
You didn't die.

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:52.990 align:middle line:84%
So everything you added after
there was a car accident

01:08:52.990 --> 01:08:55.810 align:middle line:84%
was your story, and you

How do people become aware
of how much of a victim

01:09:00.932 --> 01:09:02.890 align:middle line:84%
they may have become
because of their language?

01:09:02.890 --> 01:09:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And how can they use their
language to sort of free

01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:07.750 align:middle line:84%
themselves, I guess,
emotionally from things that

01:09:07.750 --> 01:09:10.060 align:middle line:90%
could be holding them back?

01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:12.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that
it takes practice.

01:09:12.490 --> 01:09:16.060 align:middle line:84%
We are so used to saying
things and expressing things

01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:18.640 align:middle line:84%
in our language that are,
really, often patently

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:20.140 align:middle line:90%
ridiculous.

01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:24.700 align:middle line:84%
For example, a common saying
is, he made me so mad,

01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:32.319 align:middle line:84%
or she made me so upset, or
that just made me so angry.

01:09:32.319 --> 01:09:34.870 align:middle line:84%
It's really silly
because nothing

01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:37.060 align:middle line:90%
has any control over you.

01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:40.840 align:middle line:84%
You have the ultimate
choice, right?

01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:42.404 align:middle line:84%
And you can choose
your emotions.

01:09:42.404 --> 01:09:43.779 align:middle line:84%
Nobody can make
you feel anything

01:09:43.779 --> 01:09:45.290 align:middle line:90%
that you don't choose to feel.

01:09:45.290 --> 01:09:47.430 align:middle line:90%
in other words.

01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'm always brought
back to Victor Frankl

01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:54.880 align:middle line:84%
and the experience that
he had in the Holocaust

01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:58.240 align:middle line:84%
as a psychologist
observing people.

01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And he said that, in
the camps, they all

01:10:02.890 --> 01:10:09.160 align:middle line:84%
remembered that person who would
walk through the hut giving

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:11.540 align:middle line:90%
away their last piece of bread.

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And there weren't very many
of those kinds of people,

01:10:15.390 --> 01:10:17.010 align:middle line:90%
but they remember those people.

01:10:17.010 --> 01:10:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And he said that what
he learned from that

01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:22.060 align:middle line:84%
is that everything
else can be taken away

01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:25.810 align:middle line:84%
from us but one thing,
and that is our ability

01:10:25.810 --> 01:10:30.500 align:middle line:84%
to choose our response
in any given situation.

01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:32.530 align:middle line:84%
So I think meditation
is important.

01:10:32.530 --> 01:10:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Thinking about the things that
we say-- being aware, I think,

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.200 align:middle line:90%
is really the beginning of it.

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:41.170 align:middle line:84%
And language is
incredibly powerful.

01:10:41.170 --> 01:10:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And the things that we say
can limit us in dramatic ways,

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:46.460 align:middle line:84%
or they can help us to
progress in dramatic ways.

01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:50.230 align:middle line:84%
It depends on how
we use the language.

a medicineless society

To me, the Earth
is in labor, trying

01:11:22.150 --> 01:11:25.990 align:middle line:84%
to bring forth a whole
new kind of existence

01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:29.320 align:middle line:84%
where we are living
from our hearts

01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:32.140 align:middle line:84%
and where each person is able
to manifest into the world

01:11:32.140 --> 01:11:35.380 align:middle line:84%
all of their gifts and
all of that perfection,

01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:38.650 align:middle line:84%
that blueprint, that
is within their heart.

01:11:38.650 --> 01:11:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And I know that's
where we're going.

01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:43.630 align:middle line:84%
I know that's where
we're going to get.

01:11:43.630 --> 01:11:45.370 align:middle line:90%
We are going to get there.

01:11:45.370 --> 01:11:48.865 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be a little bit of
a struggle because, of course,

01:11:48.865 --> 01:11:51.395 align:middle line:84%
there are entities, and
there are governments,

01:11:51.395 --> 01:11:52.770 align:middle line:84%
and there are
corporations and so

01:11:52.770 --> 01:11:54.812 align:middle line:84%

that want to maintain

01:11:54.812 --> 01:11:56.980 align:middle line:90%
their control at all costs.

01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:59.980 align:middle line:84%
But I think that
Western medicine,

01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:03.940 align:middle line:84%
with all of its advances, for
where we are as a civilization

01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:07.210 align:middle line:84%
right now, is phenomenally
good at taking

01:12:07.210 --> 01:12:10.720 align:middle line:84%
care of acute
problems, not so good

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:13.340 align:middle line:84%
at taking care of other
kinds of problems.

01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:15.290 align:middle line:84%
But I think that,
as time is going on,

01:12:15.290 --> 01:12:20.140 align:middle line:84%
the awareness, it's inevitable
that the more organized

01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:25.570 align:middle line:84%
Western side of health
care is going to blend,

01:12:25.570 --> 01:12:27.980 align:middle line:84%
and the two are going to,
eventually, blend together.

01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:29.355 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
in the future,

01:12:29.355 --> 01:12:36.160 align:middle line:84%
we will have a world where
people will receive the best

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:38.140 align:middle line:84%
options, that they
will really be getting

01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:39.590 align:middle line:90%
what they really, truly need.

01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:41.170 align:middle line:84%
And there are
places like that now

01:12:41.170 --> 01:12:44.045 align:middle line:84%
in the world where you
can go and, whatever

01:12:44.045 --> 01:12:45.670 align:middle line:84%
it is that you need,
you'll have a team

01:12:45.670 --> 01:12:47.337 align:middle line:84%
of people that will
look at you, and you

01:12:47.337 --> 01:12:50.140 align:middle line:84%
can get what your body
is really desiring.

01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:52.210 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's the future.

01:12:52.210 --> 01:12:54.190 align:middle line:84%
So the future is so
bright, I think we probably

01:12:54.190 --> 01:12:58.772 align:middle line:84%

What would you say
to these people?

01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think the first thing
is to realize that the body

01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:25.520 align:middle line:84%
that you're in is
really a temple.

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:26.440 align:middle line:90%
So take care of it.

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:27.820 align:middle line:90%
Treat it that way.

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:31.690 align:middle line:84%
