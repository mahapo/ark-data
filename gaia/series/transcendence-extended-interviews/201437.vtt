00:00:07.305 --> 00:00:09.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi, it's James here
from "Food Matters,"

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.470 align:middle line:10%
and welcome to this interview
with Douglas Rushkoff.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:13.895 align:middle line:10%
Douglas is a media theorist.

00:00:13.895 --> 00:00:16.760 align:middle line:84%
He has a PhD, and he is
an author and founder

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.490 align:middle line:84%
of the term, the
book, and the podcast

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.070 align:middle line:84%
"Team Human," which
is about helping us

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.790 align:middle line:84%
live in a more authentic life
in a time of great paradox

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.460 align:middle line:84%
when we're more disconnected
than ever before

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.640 align:middle line:84%
and more connected
than ever before.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.620 align:middle line:84%
He does this through
helping us understand

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.560 align:middle line:84%
our colonialist past,
the Victorian era

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.970 align:middle line:84%
and industrial
age and how that's

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.730 align:middle line:84%
fed into the digital
revolution, and what

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.040 align:middle line:84%
we can do to stave off
the anxiety and the lack

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.970 align:middle line:84%
of self-worth that comes
with the modern era.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.750 align:middle line:90%
Douglas, how are you?

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, good to be with you.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's great.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.670 align:middle line:90%
I want to start early on.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think your
interpretation of this period

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.500 align:middle line:90%
is really interesting.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.860 align:middle line:84%
As we colonized
the new world, we

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.900 align:middle line:84%
were happily going
amongst our business,

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.660 align:middle line:84%
but we were observed
in a very different way

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.740 align:middle line:90%
by the indigenous people.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.180 align:middle line:90%
What was happening at that time?

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's interesting.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most of us
know the conquistadors

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.110 align:middle line:84%
and other colonizers
were not nice, right?

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.200 align:middle line:84%
We were going, enslaving people,
and clear-cutting forests,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.540 align:middle line:84%
and really just destroying
nature, destroying people.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.610 align:middle line:90%
We were killing machines.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And I would have thought
that those people would

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.070 align:middle line:84%
have just thought that
we're evil, you know?

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.740 align:middle line:90%
Oh, white people are evil.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.220 align:middle line:90%
But they were such humanists.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.320 align:middle line:84%
They were such lovers
of humans and life

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.870 align:middle line:90%
that they saw us as victims.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.710 align:middle line:84%
They thought that white people
had a disease that they called

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.630 align:middle line:84%
"wetiko," and they
thought it was

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.180 align:middle line:84%
a disease of the spirit that
led us to just destroy things

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.420 align:middle line:84%
unnecessarily, this kind
of dominator mentality,

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.530 align:middle line:90%
this domination of nature.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.630 align:middle line:90%
And I always appreciated that.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm trying to
hold onto that sensibility

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.620 align:middle line:84%
that, no, people are
not intrinsically evil,

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:12.140 align:middle line:84%
that we're in a system,
we're living on a game,

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.020 align:middle line:84%
on a landscape that is
not natural, you know?

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.600 align:middle line:84%
It's like setting up reality
as a game of musical chairs,

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.045 align:middle line:84%
where there's not enough
chairs for everybody.

00:02:23.045 --> 00:02:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And then we think, oh,
well that's the world,

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.380 align:middle line:84%
so we're all competing over
the chairs that there are.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.070 align:middle line:84%
But it's like, no, we could
just put two more chairs there,

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.870 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's sort of
how I understand

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.870 align:middle line:84%
central currency, and
corporatism, and capitalism,

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.960 align:middle line:84%
that we had had
in the late Middle

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.350 align:middle line:84%
Ages, the beginnings of
a peer-to-peer economy,

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.720 align:middle line:84%
and we were using
market moneys that

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.760 align:middle line:90%
expired by the end of the day.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.030 align:middle line:90%
And people were getting wealthy.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And the lords, the
aristocracy saw

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.470 align:middle line:84%
that as the peasants
became the middle class,

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.310 align:middle line:84%
the aristocracy got
relatively poorer.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.200 align:middle line:84%
So they made local
moneys illegal.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.240 align:middle line:84%
They made small
business illegal.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, you had to borrow money
from a central treasury

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.758 align:middle line:84%
and interest, which meant
the economy had to grow.

00:03:10.758 --> 00:03:12.050 align:middle line:90%
You couldn't work for yourself.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.310 align:middle line:84%
You had to work for a chartered
monopoly or corporation,

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.750 align:middle line:84%
sell your time
instead of your value.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.760 align:middle line:84%
So we ended up with this kind
of dehumanized view of people,

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.330 align:middle line:84%
and this economy that
just by its very nature,

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.260 align:middle line:84%
an economy that had to grow
in order to keep working.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.040 align:middle line:84%
So we started taking stuff,
just going to Africa,

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.790 align:middle line:84%
and going to South America,
and just expanding by any means

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.790 align:middle line:90%
necessary.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.590 align:middle line:84%
Really, as I see
it, that's the heart

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.780 align:middle line:84%
of wetiko, of what
this disease is.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:52.640 align:middle line:84%
It's mistaking an operating
system, really, for reality.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And once you do that,
it's really hard

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.340 align:middle line:90%
to see your way out of it.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.698 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you think that
the indigenous people,

00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:02.240 align:middle line:84%
especially the Indian Americans
I think you're talking about,

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.520 align:middle line:84%
had such a positive
viewpoint on it all?

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if anybody saw
that happening, they'd

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.300 align:middle line:84%
be like, what crazy
people, and yet that

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.730 align:middle line:84%
was so compassionate to think
that, oh, they're just unwell.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:13.840 align:middle line:90%
They'll get better one day.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.465 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I don't know
if they thought--

00:04:15.465 --> 00:04:18.519 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they might have
thought it was a fatal disease.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:26.650 align:middle line:84%
I think it's because they look
into the eyes of another human

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.210 align:middle line:84%
being, and they're able to see
that other person as a person,

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.010 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.590 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's weird for us.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.180 align:middle line:84%
We tend-- "we" meaning, I
guess, white, Western Europeans,

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.610 align:middle line:84%
and that whole
civilization, we tend

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.270 align:middle line:84%
to see people who are
different from us as other.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.780 align:middle line:84%
We don't accept their
humanity as a given.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.740 align:middle line:84%
We see them first as an object,
then maybe as an animal,

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.370 align:middle line:84%
and then, if they
really are close

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.100 align:middle line:84%
enough to us and our
values, then, OK,

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.110 align:middle line:90%
that's another person.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the indigenous
people had a heightened ability

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.170 align:middle line:90%
to establish rapport.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.020 align:middle line:84%
That hadn't been
civilized out of them yet.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, making eye contact,
being part of an oral culture,

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.420 align:middle line:84%
rather than a literate
culture or a television

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:29.710 align:middle line:84%
culture means that you engage
with people by making eye

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.380 align:middle line:84%
contact, syncing
up your breathing,

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.660 align:middle line:84%
seeing if their pupils are
getting larger or smaller

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.820 align:middle line:84%
as you talk to them, seeing
if your head is making

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.740 align:middle line:90%
micro motions of agreement.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.400 align:middle line:84%
Then, the oxytocin gets
released in my bloodstream,

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.470 align:middle line:84%
my mirror neurons
start flashing,

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:50.710 align:middle line:84%
and it's a way of moving through
the world, of always optimized

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.600 align:middle line:90%
for connection and rapport--

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.400 align:middle line:90%
who is this?

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.230 align:middle line:90%
How do we connect?

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And if they do that,
even if they're

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.940 align:middle line:84%
looking at a white Western
conquistadors who's

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.052 align:middle line:84%
been told to take his sword
and start killing people,

00:06:04.052 --> 00:06:05.510 align:middle line:84%
they look in the
eyes and they see,

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.180 align:middle line:84%
oh, there's this
human being there

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.060 align:middle line:84%
that's being told to
go kill or to take,

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.250 align:middle line:90%
but wow, they're in pain.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.140 align:middle line:90%
They're suffering.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.045 align:middle line:90%
And how do I reach that person?

00:06:16.045 --> 00:06:17.033 align:middle line:90%
>> It's beautiful.

00:06:17.033 --> 00:06:18.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've certainly
experienced that.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.320 align:middle line:84%
When you go into
indigenous cultures,

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.487 align:middle line:90%
they're much more connected.

00:06:21.487 --> 00:06:23.920 align:middle line:84%
They greet you regardless
of who you are,

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.690 align:middle line:90%
or your title, or your worth.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.150 align:middle line:84%
They're like, wow,
hello, person.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:29.120 align:middle line:90%
Nice to see you.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.920 align:middle line:90%
Nice to see you.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, I'm no
awakened being.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm really not.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.020 align:middle line:84%
But I remember I got
mugged like 10 years ago.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And I looked into the eyes of
the guy that was mugging me,

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.930 align:middle line:90%
and he had this gun.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.250 align:middle line:84%
And I could tell
he was more afraid

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:49.000 align:middle line:84%
than I was because,
well, first, he

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.700 align:middle line:84%
knew he was doing something
just awful and whatever,

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:52.510 align:middle line:90%
but he also--

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.380 align:middle line:84%
he's living in a
greater society, where

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.710 align:middle line:84%
if a cop comes or I
scream in the wrong way,

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.037 align:middle line:90%
his whole life is over.

00:07:01.037 --> 00:07:03.370 align:middle line:84%
He'll just be in jail the
rest of his life or something.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And just to see that, the
humanity of the person who's

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.500 align:middle line:84%
coming after you or who's
threatening your life,

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:18.740 align:middle line:84%
I can see how it's possible
that they were able to do that,

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.180 align:middle line:90%
especially if you're in--

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, compared to
us, indigenous people

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:27.950 align:middle line:84%
are in, like, an altered
state of consciousness.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:29.330 align:middle line:90%
We're in the simulation.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.550 align:middle line:90%
We're so removed from nature.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:37.730 align:middle line:84%
We are in a CG Disney movie
of the world, you know?

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:41.720 align:middle line:84%
We're walking around like
Spock with our smartphones

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.990 align:middle line:84%
like tricorders as if
we're on an alien planet.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:49.590 align:middle line:90%
That's how separate we are.

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:54.050 align:middle line:10%
And I think that when
you're in and of the world,

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.480 align:middle line:10%
when you're enjoying that
sort of home-field advantage

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.150 align:middle line:10%
that you get as a
human being on Earth,

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:05.210 align:middle line:10%
I think you start to see
the other humans more

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.892 align:middle line:10%
gracefully than we might.

00:08:07.892 --> 00:08:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.120 align:middle line:90%
Great observation.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.240 align:middle line:84%
I think where you eventually
end up with a lot of your work

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.160 align:middle line:84%
is about this sort
of new digital era

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.170 align:middle line:90%
and its impact on humanity.

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:18.910 align:middle line:84%
But what I find
interesting is that you

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:21.910 align:middle line:84%
use each of these important
stages of the growth

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:24.670 align:middle line:84%
of the human species or the
domesticated white human

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:29.710 align:middle line:84%
species, let's say, as analyzing
the values and the intention

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:32.179 align:middle line:84%
behind each of those sort
of inflection points.

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:36.039 align:middle line:84%
And so we just looked at
colonialism in a short way.

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:37.750 align:middle line:84%
One of the other
great periods of time

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.929 align:middle line:84%
which impacted us in many
ways was the industrial era.

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And we became addicted
to these ideas of time,

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:47.920 align:middle line:84%
of stamping in, stamping out,
of grades, and that infiltrated

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.950 align:middle line:84%
so many areas of our life, in
particular schooling, which

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:54.580 align:middle line:84%
I think has had a big
impact on who we've become.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:58.900 align:middle line:84%
How do you think that industrial
era impacted the schooling

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:02.590 align:middle line:84%
system, for instance, and how
that sort of grow into sort

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:04.585 align:middle line:90%
of impact us as a culture?

00:09:04.585 --> 00:09:09.370 align:middle line:90%


00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:11.820 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a big subject.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:17.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the hallmark
of industrialism,

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:19.970 align:middle line:84%
really more than the steam
engine or anything else,

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:21.800 align:middle line:90%
is the clock.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And it was it was
Mumford who said--

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:28.220 align:middle line:84%
he wrote this great book
"Technics and Civilization--"

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.920 align:middle line:84%
I think what he was
observing-- the power

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.390 align:middle line:84%
of the clock in
the industrial age

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:35.630 align:middle line:84%
is that before
the industrial age

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:41.240 align:middle line:84%
people would create value
and exchange it, you know?

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.610 align:middle line:84%
I'll make a candle
or make some shoes

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:46.550 align:middle line:84%
and bring it to market and
exchange it with someone else.

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:48.980 align:middle line:84%
When the industrial
age happened,

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:52.550 align:middle line:84%
what it was really about
was disconnecting people

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.410 align:middle line:90%
from the value they created.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:59.270 align:middle line:84%
So instead of me making a pair
of shoes and selling them,

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.240 align:middle line:84%
now it's me going to
work at a factory,

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.610 align:middle line:84%
nailing one nail into
the bottom of a shoe

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:06.620 align:middle line:84%
and handing it over
to the next guy.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And instead of selling my
value, I'm selling my time.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:13.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm working by the hour.

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:16.460 align:middle line:84%
They put the clock up on the
clock tower as if to say, look,

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:17.570 align:middle line:90%
it's all fair.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:18.860 align:middle line:90%
An hour is an hour.

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:20.180 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that just?

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:23.390 align:middle line:84%
But what's intrinsically
unfair is that I'm not

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.100 align:middle line:90%
allowed to create value.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm only allowed
to sell my time.

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And now, 500 years
later, 600 years later,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.850 align:middle line:84%
we see it as, well,
that's employment.

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:32.650 align:middle line:90%
You just get a job.

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:33.450 align:middle line:90%
That's what you do.

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:34.610 align:middle line:90%
You work 40 hours a week.

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:38.630 align:middle line:84%
It's like, no, but
that's sort of know

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:41.750 align:middle line:90%
that "time is money" was born.

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:43.050 align:middle line:90%
Because time was money.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:44.370 align:middle line:90%
It was all about time.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And then the only
metric that tends

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.600 align:middle line:84%
to matter is the efficiency,
how much work can I get out

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.560 align:middle line:90%
of someone in that hour?

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.290 align:middle line:84%
How much value can I
extract in that hour?

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:56.990 align:middle line:84%
So I want to increase
the efficiency.

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.852 align:middle line:84%
And we had what was
called "Taylorism,"

00:10:59.852 --> 00:11:02.060 align:middle line:84%
which was a scientific
management school, where you'd

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:03.653 align:middle line:84%
stand next to workers
with a stopwatch

00:11:03.653 --> 00:11:06.320 align:middle line:84%
and see, how many nails can they
put in the bottom of that shoe?

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And 30 seconds-- well,
get it down to 28.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:09.780 align:middle line:90%
Get it down to 20.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:15.140 align:middle line:84%
So once we start looking
at people as mechanisms

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:19.640 align:middle line:84%
through which we
extract value, then it

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.090 align:middle line:84%
wasn't too long until
our education system

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:25.280 align:middle line:90%
kind of flipped on its head.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Public education was
originally invented as kind

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:31.910 align:middle line:90%
of a mercy or a compensation.

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:34.790 align:middle line:84%
It was so that the coal
miner could come home

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:38.120 align:middle line:84%
after a day of work and
be able to read a novel

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.670 align:middle line:84%
and appreciate it or be
able to read the paper

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:45.140 align:middle line:84%
and then vote effectively
or intelligently.

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.300 align:middle line:84%
It was compensation
for a life of hard work

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:52.220 align:middle line:84%
so you could have the dignity
of having a mind that actually

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:53.180 align:middle line:90%
functioned.

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:54.950 align:middle line:90%
But slowly, over time--

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:58.790 align:middle line:84%
and I guess because of time
and the value of efficiency,

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:04.170 align:middle line:84%
we started to externalize job
training to public education.

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:08.090 align:middle line:84%
So now, we've got the
principles of our high schools

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:09.800 align:middle line:84%
and the presidents
of our colleges

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:15.110 align:middle line:84%
meeting with the CEOs of
corporations to find out,

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:18.030 align:middle line:84%
what do you want our
students to learn?

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:20.810 align:middle line:84%
What do you want them to
know so they can get jobs?

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:22.220 align:middle line:84%
How do you want
us to train them?

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:26.720 align:middle line:84%
So corporations are just
externalizing employee training

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.520 align:middle line:90%
to the schools.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.030 align:middle line:90%
So what is that?

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:32.030 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there's a model.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:35.600 align:middle line:84%
It's the Prussian model of
education, where the school is

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.180 align:middle line:84%
modeled after the
factory, with bells

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:42.230 align:middle line:84%
ringing after each period, and
the teachers like the foremen,

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:45.320 align:middle line:84%
and the students
follow the directions.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:49.900 align:middle line:84%
So if anything, you're doing
the opposite of education.

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:55.430 align:middle line:84%
You're not creating inquisitive,
open, creative, disruptive

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:56.270 align:middle line:90%
minds.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:59.840 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
favor liberal arts.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.000 align:middle line:84%
In a modern age,
this is where we get

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.770 align:middle line:90%
what we keep calling "STEM."

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:07.550 align:middle line:84%
This is science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful, but why do
we want to teach stem?

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:13.700 align:middle line:84%
So they learn how to program,
so they can go and make

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.100 align:middle line:84%
computers for Silicon
Valley and get jobs,

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.860 align:middle line:84%
and keep this
ridiculous thing going.

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:21.470 align:middle line:10%
No, we don't want them to learn
liberal arts and humanities

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:22.560 align:middle line:10%
because then what?

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.220 align:middle line:10%
Then, they're going to start
to question the whole thing.

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:29.480 align:middle line:10%
Critical thinking makes
you look outside the frame

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.970 align:middle line:10%
of corporate capitalism and
say, well, wait a minute.

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:33.740 align:middle line:90%
Where's the meaning in this?

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:35.870 align:middle line:90%
What's the future in this?

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:39.260 align:middle line:84%
What are we externalizing
to nature, to women,

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:40.820 align:middle line:90%
to other people?

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.340 align:middle line:84%
Who's being enslaved in
order to get the rare Earth

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:46.670 align:middle line:84%
metals to make that rechargeable
battery for my friggin'

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:48.240 align:middle line:90%
iPhone or my Tesla?

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.550 align:middle line:84%
These are not
renewable resources.

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:53.060 align:middle line:84%
These are mined,
rare-Earth metals.

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:59.090 align:middle line:84%
So unless you are able
to do critical thinking,

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:02.122 align:middle line:90%
you're not educated at all.

00:14:02.122 --> 00:14:03.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Whoa, that was amazing.

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:06.510 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my goodness.

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.250 align:middle line:90%
I find that fascinating.

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And I really find your
work so interesting

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:13.960 align:middle line:84%
because I feel that
you might be in danger.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.925 align:middle line:84%
You're like the canary
in the coal mine.

00:14:15.925 --> 00:14:16.800 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm not in danger.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.342 align:middle line:84%
Nobody listens, so
it doesn't matter.

00:14:18.342 --> 00:14:20.623 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're going
die and, eventually,

00:14:20.623 --> 00:14:22.290 align:middle line:84%
they're going to go,
that guy was right!

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:23.105 align:middle line:90%
Remember back then?

00:14:23.105 --> 00:14:23.905 align:middle line:90%
That guy?

00:14:23.905 --> 00:14:24.988 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that would be fine.

00:14:24.988 --> 00:14:27.355 align:middle line:90%
The martians will see it.

00:14:27.355 --> 00:14:30.510 align:middle line:84%
Alien anthropologists who
return to the wreckage

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:34.800 align:middle line:84%
of human civilization and find
a paper copy of one of my books.

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.703 align:middle line:90%
>> Uncover it all.

00:14:36.703 --> 00:14:39.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Because they're not going
to be able to analyze the zip

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.320 align:middle line:90%
drives.

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.037 align:middle line:90%
The cloud is going to be lost.

00:14:42.037 --> 00:14:43.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's going
to be gone, right?

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.203 align:middle line:84%
All these billions
of photographs that

00:14:45.203 --> 00:14:47.550 align:middle line:90%
are being taken, just peew!

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:48.800 align:middle line:90%
Gone.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I know they'll come and
say, what are these selfies

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.190 align:middle line:90%
everybody's talking about?

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:55.578 align:middle line:90%
What were they?

00:14:55.578 --> 00:14:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that I
think you point out which I

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.823 align:middle line:84%
find quite interesting is
this idea of cooperation.

00:15:01.823 --> 00:15:03.240 align:middle line:84%
I was going to say
"coopertition."

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.115 align:middle line:90%
That's another thing.

00:15:04.115 --> 00:15:06.970 align:middle line:90%
Cooperation versus competition.

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And we've been sold this whole
idea that we evolved because

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:12.690 align:middle line:84%
of competition, and then in
your analysis, and I agree,

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:14.850 align:middle line:84%
that's not really
altogether that true.

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we've based
our whole societies,

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.930 align:middle line:84%
and our corporations,
and our schooling systems

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:20.250 align:middle line:90%
and everything on this.

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:22.410 align:middle line:84%
What are the dangers
of this ideology?

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:28.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know, we justified
our competitive landscape.

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:35.190 align:middle line:84%
We justified this artificially
scarce market system

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:40.620 align:middle line:84%
with a kind of a bastardized
interpretation of Darwin.

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:45.370 align:middle line:84%
So the California libertarians
will say, oh, well,

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:46.900 align:middle line:90%
it's survival of the fittest.

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And Darwin, and
Hayek, and Adam Smith,

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:53.100 align:middle line:84%
and everybody, they're
all saying that this is--

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:58.470 align:middle line:84%
the nature of reality is species
compete and one succeeds,

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:00.510 align:middle line:84%
and that's why humans
are on the top;

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:03.720 align:middle line:84%
we won; we're the apex
predator; and yay.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.565 align:middle line:90%
And I read Darwin.

00:16:06.565 --> 00:16:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And if you read
Darwin, I mean, there's

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:10.620 align:middle line:84%
a little tiny bit
on competition,

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.080 align:middle line:84%
but for the most part, what
Darwin is marveling at,

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:16.680 align:middle line:84%
page after page, is
cooperation and collaboration

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:18.630 align:middle line:90%
between species.

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Like, look at how these
two creatures will

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:27.900 align:middle line:84%
do a dance for each other to
see who's the strongest so

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.730 align:middle line:90%
that they don't have to fight.

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And he understands that's
because the big one to kill

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.380 align:middle line:84%
the little one, and
the little one's

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.120 align:middle line:84%
going to peck out the
eye of the big one.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's not good
for either of them.

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:40.900 align:middle line:84%
It's like, let's just dance
around, see who's stronger,

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:44.400 align:middle line:84%
OK, you won, you get that
little piece of melon.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go try to
find something else.

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:51.030 align:middle line:84%
Or now, like, we're
learning about trees.

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:53.040 align:middle line:84%
I was taught-- I remember
in middle school--

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.210 align:middle line:90%
I won't name her--

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:55.650 align:middle line:84%
but I remember the
science teacher

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:58.410 align:middle line:84%
who taught me about evolution
and said that the trees are

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:00.360 align:middle line:84%
competing for sunlight
in the forest,

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.790 align:middle line:84%
and the big tree will
get up to the sun first,

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:05.490 align:middle line:84%
and the little tree will be
in the shade and will die.

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And I just read this book
"Secret Life of Trees,"

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.630 align:middle line:84%
and it turns out
it's the opposite--

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:12.119 align:middle line:84%
that the big tree that's
getting the sunlight

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:14.859 align:middle line:84%
shares its nutrients
through the soil--

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:16.740 align:middle line:84%
which is not dirt;
soil's alive--

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:20.849 align:middle line:84%
through a matrix of mycelia,
of mushrooms in the soil,

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:22.200 align:middle line:90%
with the little tree.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.283 align:middle line:84%
And then the little tree
gets all those nutrients.

00:17:24.283 --> 00:17:26.849 align:middle line:84%
Then, in the winter, when the
big tree loses its leaves,

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:29.040 align:middle line:84%
the little tree, which
is usually an evergreen,

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.520 align:middle line:84%
passes nutrients back
through those same mushrooms,

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:36.390 align:middle line:84%
take a service fee, and give the
nutrients back to the big tree.

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:39.480 align:middle line:84%
So the two trees are
not competing for sun.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.920 align:middle line:90%
They're collaborating.

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:44.880 align:middle line:84%
They have diverse
strategies of survival,

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:51.550 align:middle line:84%
which allows the forest,
as a collective organism,

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:53.200 align:middle line:90%
to support itself.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:57.520 align:middle line:84%
So if human beings are
the most advanced species

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.290 align:middle line:84%
on the evolutionary
trail-- which

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:01.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that we
are-- but if we are,

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:07.750 align:middle line:84%
it's just a reflection of the
complexity of collaboration

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:08.870 align:middle line:90%
that we were able to do.

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:10.975 align:middle line:84%
And that's because
we developed speech.

00:18:10.975 --> 00:18:14.770 align:middle line:90%
I mean, developing speech--

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:19.510 align:middle line:84%
the same evolutionary feature
that allows us to speak also

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:21.210 align:middle line:90%
is why we would choke.

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:23.330 align:middle line:84%
You know, crossing the
windpipe over the esophagus

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:24.130 align:middle line:90%
and the trachea--

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:26.950 align:middle line:90%


00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:29.980 align:middle line:84%
the way it's structured-- but
speech was so valuable to us,

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:34.150 align:middle line:84%
we decided it's worth choking
to death or the risk of choking

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.370 align:middle line:84%
to death in order to be able
to speak with each other

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:38.290 align:middle line:90%
and collaborate on those levels.

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And I look at each
medium that we

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:43.600 align:middle line:84%
create is an extension of
that collaborative urge--

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.160 align:middle line:84%
you know, from writing,
and television, and radio,

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.230 align:middle line:90%
and even the internet.

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:50.860 align:middle line:84%
But then, we flip
it on itself, and we

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:52.360 align:middle line:90%
don't use it to collaborate.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.930 align:middle line:84%
We use it to dominate
and to extract.

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:59.890 align:middle line:84%
The internet does not establish
rapport between people.

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:03.550 align:middle line:84%
The internet does the
opposite now intentionally.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:11.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a de-socializing medium
that restricts our creativity

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:18.070 align:middle line:84%
and represses our actual
humanity, our weirdness,

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:21.970 align:middle line:84%
our soul, our
ingenuity is treated

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:26.230 align:middle line:90%
by the digital realm as noise.

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:28.450 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's the signal.

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:30.130 align:middle line:90%
That's what makes us human.

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:33.610 align:middle line:84%
That's what separates
us from some number.

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that we're
not only losing it

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:44.200 align:middle line:84%
but that we disparage
it as that nasty stuff.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.720 align:middle line:90%
That's human intimacy.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:52.510 align:middle line:84%
It's like that kids
will prefer dry porn

00:19:52.510 --> 00:20:00.040 align:middle line:84%
to wet sex is sort of a
symptom of this disconnection

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:00.910 align:middle line:90%
from reality.

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:02.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:03.940 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:08.493 align:middle line:84%
I think when you talk about
social media and this sort

00:20:08.493 --> 00:20:09.910 align:middle line:84%
of-- well, you're
starting to edge

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:12.250 align:middle line:84%
into the internet of
things, essentially,

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:14.030 align:middle line:84%
that we've created
as a way to connect.

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:14.830 align:middle line:90%
Let's connect more.

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:15.570 align:middle line:90%
This is amazing.

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:16.370 align:middle line:90%
Let's connect.

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And one of the side
effects of that is we've

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:19.930 align:middle line:90%
become hyper-connected.

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And we're affected now
micro-interruptions all day--

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Slack, or it's a DM on
Instagram, or it's Messenger,

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.530 align:middle line:90%
or it's WhatsApp or it's this.

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And we're not really
adapted to deal

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:37.065 align:middle line:90%
with that much interruption.

00:20:37.065 --> 00:20:38.440 align:middle line:84%
What are some of
the side effects

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:43.190 align:middle line:84%
of being so heavily
influenced by these constant--

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:46.400 align:middle line:84%
this bombardment of
micro-interruptions

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.200 align:middle line:90%
in our life?

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I mean, when you
live in a state of perpetual

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:57.160 align:middle line:10%
emergency interruption, where
everything is a call waiting

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:04.260 align:middle line:10%
kind of coming in at you,
it elevates your cortisol.

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:09.090 align:middle line:84%
It keeps you in a kind of a
fight-or-flight state of mind

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:10.830 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:14.580 align:middle line:84%
So you can't rest
your eyes on anything.

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:17.370 align:middle line:90%


00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:18.750 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you find no peace.

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:19.890 align:middle line:90%
You find no rapport.

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:21.360 align:middle line:90%
You can't establish connections.

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:24.305 align:middle line:90%
It's like a Skype conversation.

00:21:24.305 --> 00:21:26.430 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting, you have
a conversation on Skype,

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:29.370 align:middle line:84%
and the person on the
other end agrees with you.

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:32.220 align:middle line:84%
But because you can't see
their pupils getting larger,

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:34.290 align:middle line:84%
you can't see
their head nodding,

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:37.020 align:middle line:84%
your body doesn't get
the sense of agreement.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:39.220 align:middle line:90%
Your mirror neurons don't fire.

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:42.060 align:middle line:84%
The oxytocin doesn't
get transmitted.

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And you don't blame the
technology for that.

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:46.380 align:middle line:84%
You haven't evolved
to blame Skype.

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:47.850 align:middle line:90%
You blame the other person.

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:50.100 align:middle line:84%
You say that person's
not trustworthy.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And you trust humans
less because they're not

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:56.520 align:middle line:90%
giving you--

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.940 align:middle line:84%
they're not triggering this
sort of painstakingly evolved

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.280 align:middle line:84%
social mechanisms that
we have, that we've

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:05.370 align:middle line:84%
developed over 600,000
years of evolution

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:09.900 align:middle line:84%
to bond with other people and
do the necessary collaboration

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.360 align:middle line:90%
and social group formation.

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.640 align:middle line:90%
So we get desocialized.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.370 align:middle line:90%
We can't think deeply.

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:20.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Clifford Nass from
Stanford, who's now passed,

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:23.430 align:middle line:84%
but he did all these
experiments with students, even

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:26.490 align:middle line:84%
people who thought that
they were getting more done

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:29.222 align:middle line:84%
while multitasking,
they invariably

00:22:29.222 --> 00:22:30.180 align:middle line:90%
were getting less done.

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:31.680 align:middle line:84%
So they thought
they got more done.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.305 align:middle line:84%
They thought they
had better retention.

00:22:33.305 --> 00:22:35.400 align:middle line:84%
They thought they had
deeper understanding.

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.650 align:middle line:84%
Invariably, when they
were multitasking,

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:39.390 align:middle line:90%
they got less done.

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:41.110 align:middle line:90%
They had less retention.

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:43.020 align:middle line:84%
They had a more
shallow understanding

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:45.930 align:middle line:90%
of what had just happened.

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:47.560 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean?

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:53.550 align:middle line:84%
It means we're getting dumber,
or we're operating less

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:58.740 align:middle line:84%
intelligently with less
thought, with less grounding,

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:01.860 align:middle line:84%
and we're bringing less
of ourselves to bear.

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:05.460 align:middle line:84%
So what happens, the thing
that I get most upset about,

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:08.580 align:middle line:84%
is we end up with this kind
of profound reversal of figure

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:11.980 align:middle line:90%
and ground, of user and used.

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:15.760 align:middle line:84%
You are not the user
of your smartphone.

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.390 align:middle line:84%
Your smartphone is
the user of you.

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:22.740 align:middle line:84%
The apps on the phone are
designed to play the person.

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:24.840 align:middle line:84%
You can go to
Stanford now and study

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:27.270 align:middle line:84%
with BJ Fogg, who
has a lab called

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:29.122 align:middle line:90%
"Captology Lab" at Stanford.

00:23:29.122 --> 00:23:31.080 align:middle line:84%
All the computer scientists
go through his lab.

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And captology is
figuring out, how

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:36.030 align:middle line:84%
do we use technology
to influence,

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:39.520 align:middle line:90%
to design human behavior?

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:43.260 align:middle line:84%
So we take all of the insights
of behavioral finance,

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:46.230 align:middle line:84%
all of the algorithms from
Las Vegas slot machines,

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:48.570 align:middle line:84%
and all of, now, the
learnings from the Internet

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:51.600 align:middle line:84%
of Things and figure
out, how do we embed them

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:55.830 align:middle line:84%
in apps to get people to
do what we want them to do?

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:58.680 align:middle line:84%
So every time you swipe
on your smartphone,

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.810 align:middle line:84%
it's getting smarter
about you, and you

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:02.670 align:middle line:90%
are getting dumber about it.

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And even if you want to find out
what the smartphone is doing,

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:07.290 align:middle line:84%
the mechanisms,
they're protected

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:09.660 align:middle line:84%
in black-box
architectures that have

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:16.020 align:middle line:84%
proprietary, legal encryption
because these are trade secrets

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:18.610 align:middle line:90%
that they won't even let us see.

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:21.360 align:middle line:90%
So your phone is--

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.190 align:middle line:84%
everything you do,
every agreement

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:26.640 align:middle line:84%
you sign when you say,
yes, I agree, I consent,

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:31.950 align:middle line:84%
is for them to mine everything
they can about every action you

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:37.740 align:middle line:84%
take, every breath, every
swipe so that they can not only

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:40.350 align:middle line:84%
predict what you
are likely to do,

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:43.530 align:middle line:84%
but they can
attempt to force you

00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:48.240 align:middle line:84%
to behave true to your
statistical profile.

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.710 align:middle line:90%
That's what Facebook is.

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:51.600 align:middle line:84%
They use data from
your past to put you

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.540 align:middle line:84%
in a statistical
bucket, and then

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:56.400 align:middle line:84%
put stuff in your
news feed that gets

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.110 align:middle line:84%
you to behave true to
your statistical bucket.

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:01.980 align:middle line:84%
So if they know
with 80% accuracy

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:04.950 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to go on
a diet in the next month,

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:07.620 align:middle line:84%
your user feed, your
news feed's going

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:10.320 align:middle line:84%
to start to have articles
in it like, oh, this is what

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.820 align:middle line:90%
happens when you're too fat.

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:13.620 align:middle line:84%
Or, look at a
person's blood stream

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:17.160 align:middle line:84%
when it has you know
bad globules in it,

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:21.330 align:middle line:84%
not just because they want you
to buy specific diet products

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:25.950 align:middle line:84%
but because they want to
get that 80% of people

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:29.100 align:middle line:84%
who are going to go on a
diet in your little group,

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:32.460 align:middle line:84%
they want to get that
80 up to 90 or 95.

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:38.010 align:middle line:84%
So they're just trying to
increase the predictability

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:42.150 align:middle line:84%
of human behavior and
hone off the weird edges

00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:46.350 align:middle line:84%
of anomalous behavior
of unpredictable stuff.

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:48.360 align:middle line:84%
But if you think about
it, if what we're doing

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.510 align:middle line:84%
is taking the most powerful
technologies we have

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:55.380 align:middle line:84%
and using them to try to get
the 20% of people who are going

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:59.627 align:middle line:84%
to do creative weird things
and get that down to 10% or 5%,

00:25:59.627 --> 00:26:01.210 align:middle line:84%
and we're doing that
at a moment where

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:03.790 align:middle line:84%
we need tremendous
amounts of innovation

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:06.220 align:middle line:84%
in order to get ourselves
out of this corner

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:08.410 align:middle line:84%
we've painted ourselves
into with climate

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:10.480 align:middle line:84%
change and social
collapse, that's

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:15.710 align:middle line:84%
a really non-winning strategy
for our human futures.

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:18.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So are you in a in a
"boycott social media"

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:19.540 align:middle line:90%
sort of camp then?

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:20.770 align:middle line:90%
Or where do you sit on this?

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:21.570 align:middle line:90%
I mean it's hard.

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't see a use for
social media, you know?

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:29.020 align:middle line:90%


00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:33.070 align:middle line:84%
You gotta look back at what
is the internet good for

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:34.870 align:middle line:90%
or what could it be good for?

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And what it could be good
for is connecting you

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:43.300 align:middle line:84%
to people who have
something in common with you

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:46.270 align:middle line:90%
that's non-local to you.

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:48.490 align:middle line:84%
So you have some rare
disease, so there's

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:50.320 align:middle line:84%
1,000 people around
the world, they

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.270 align:middle line:90%
can connect on this network.

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:55.150 align:middle line:90%
Or you've got some bizarre--

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:56.740 align:middle line:84%
like, I'm interested
in, you know,

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.270 align:middle line:84%
John Stewart Mills'
understanding

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:01.040 align:middle line:84%
of the steady state
economy, who else is?

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:02.590 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well, there's
some guy in Norway

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:05.530 align:middle line:84%
and some other guy in
Japan, and we can then--

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:10.030 align:middle line:84%
the places I have fun
online are rather--

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:13.240 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say esoteric
but really particular

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.230 align:middle line:90%
bulletin boards.

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
be old-style, HTML,

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:20.650 align:middle line:84%
bulletin-board discussion
groups about weird things, even

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:23.290 align:middle line:84%
if it's crazy antique
cars or whatever you like

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:26.270 align:middle line:90%
or diseases of the pug dog.

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is
that's your thing,

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.800 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
find that, and it's

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.720 align:middle line:90%
a healthy set of connections.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:35.110 align:middle line:84%
But when it's substituting
for all of the real-world

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:37.150 align:middle line:84%
connections that
you have, I mean,

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:41.200 align:middle line:84%
the now stereotypical two girls
walking down the street texting

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.590 align:middle line:84%
each other instead of
talking with each other,

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:46.780 align:middle line:90%
that's where it's just--

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:48.310 align:middle line:90%
that's where it's insane.

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to understand,
of course, that Facebook is not

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:53.320 align:middle line:90%
there--

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.690 align:middle line:84%
these social media
companies are not there

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:59.810 align:middle line:84%
to enhance your connection
with other people.

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:02.560 align:middle line:84%
They are there to
monetize your social graph

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:06.160 align:middle line:84%
and give value to
their shareholders.

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:09.700 align:middle line:84%
So you could argue, well, I'm
a shareholder because I have

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:12.760 align:middle line:84%
a retirement plan
with Facebook in it,

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:17.170 align:middle line:84%
so I'll sacrifice my
children's mental health

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:18.940 align:middle line:84%
so that my Facebook
stock goes up

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:20.380 align:middle line:84%
so I can make
enough money to pay

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:23.178 align:middle line:84%
for a psychiatrist for my
child who's cutting because she

00:28:23.178 --> 00:28:24.220 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have any friends.

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:25.720 align:middle line:90%
It's like, wait a minute.

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.130 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of ass backwards.

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:29.830 align:middle line:90%


00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:34.600 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'm not like saying, don't
go on social media, oh my god.

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:39.390 align:middle line:84%
But understand what it's for
before you use a platform.

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:43.720 align:middle line:84%
Be in touch enough with
your emotional sensibilities

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.970 align:middle line:84%
to think, how does
this platform make

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:48.610 align:middle line:84%
me-- do I feel good when I'm
done with a Facebook session?

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:50.980 align:middle line:84%
Do I feel great and
connected with others?

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:53.350 align:middle line:90%
What's my heart rate after that?

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:55.660 align:middle line:84%
What's my cortisol
levels after that?

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:59.110 align:middle line:84%
Has the messaging I've gotten
been that the world is a place

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:02.000 align:middle line:90%
that I want to connect with?

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Or is it teaching me that the
world's a weird and scary place

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:07.480 align:middle line:90%
that I shouldn't go to?

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.880 align:middle line:90%
So it's pretty basic.

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:13.270 align:middle line:84%
It's why I used to argue
program or be programmed,

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:16.300 align:middle line:84%
which didn't mean become
a programmer necessarily,

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:19.360 align:middle line:84%
but understand what a
platform is programmed

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:25.030 align:middle line:90%
for before you submit to it.

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:29.230 align:middle line:84%
You know when you install
an app on your phone,

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:31.300 align:middle line:84%
you think, how is
that going to affect

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:32.443 align:middle line:90%
the ecosystem of my phone?

00:29:32.443 --> 00:29:33.860 align:middle line:84%
Is it going to use
a lot of power?

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:34.840 align:middle line:90%
Is it GPS?

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:36.490 align:middle line:90%
Is it this?

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:39.100 align:middle line:84%
Think at least as much
about your organism

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:42.410 align:middle line:84%
before you bring an
app into your life,

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:45.010 align:middle line:84%
into your routine,
into what you're doing.

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:46.602 align:middle line:84%
Just oh, the kids
are using WhatsApp.

00:29:46.602 --> 00:29:47.560 align:middle line:90%
They're using Snapchat.

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.268 align:middle line:84%
They're using-- ah,
I gotta throw that on

00:29:49.268 --> 00:29:50.620 align:middle line:90%
and make that part of my life.

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:52.330 align:middle line:90%
You don't.

00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:54.370 align:middle line:90%
You really don't.

00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:56.320 align:middle line:90%
And what are you missing out on?

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.600 align:middle line:84%
What really are
you missing out on?

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.190 align:middle line:90%


00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:05.075 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the opportunity
cost of the real world--

00:30:05.075 --> 00:30:08.030 align:middle line:90%


00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:08.830 align:middle line:90%
it's weird.

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:11.920 align:middle line:90%
I was just watching the--

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.930 align:middle line:84%
watching TV, and I
saw the commercial

00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:18.520 align:middle line:84%
for Disney's new "Lion
King" movie came on.

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And they're calling it like a
live-action movie because it

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:25.930 align:middle line:84%
looks real, but it's like made--
it's like a CG movie, where--

00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:28.490 align:middle line:90%
and you see this perfect--

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:31.720 align:middle line:84%
it looks real, these lions
that look perfectly real

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:34.600 align:middle line:84%
and this giant jungle that
the lions are going around in,

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:36.070 align:middle line:90%
but I know they're not.

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And I look really
carefully on my HD set,

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:41.260 align:middle line:84%
and I could see the
lion is perfect.

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:42.760 align:middle line:84%
A real lion-- when
you look at it

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:45.970 align:middle line:84%
a documentary anyway
or at the zoo,

00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:48.160 align:middle line:84%
they've got wounds
and stuff, and rough

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:51.100 align:middle line:84%
spots, and like callus on
their knees and things.

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:52.960 align:middle line:90%
These lions are perfect.

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
wow, here we are--

00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:57.700 align:middle line:84%
Disney, which is
part of the same kind

00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:00.010 align:middle line:84%
of giant industrial
complex that's

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:04.090 align:middle line:84%
destroying the real jungle
and killing the actual lions

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:07.510 align:middle line:84%
there is creating a
simulacrum, the simulation

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:11.920 align:middle line:84%
of lions in the jungle that
now kids are going to grow up

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:17.710 align:middle line:84%
and, in some ways, to them, that
is preferable to the real one.

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is what those guys
like Adorno, and Benjamin,

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.630 align:middle line:84%
and Baudrillard,
these people that we

00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:27.820 align:middle line:84%
all pooh-poohed in the
'80s and '90s saying,

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:30.730 align:middle line:84%
oh, look at them talking
oh, crazy, postmodernism,

00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:33.340 align:middle line:84%
but they were right
that we were going

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:37.450 align:middle line:84%
to disconnect from reality
and create a simulation

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:39.010 align:middle line:90%
to go in its place.

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And only the generations
that remember reality

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:47.890 align:middle line:84%
will even know that there
was a reality there.

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:49.690 align:middle line:84%
It's funny to
finally be old enough

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:52.240 align:middle line:84%
to say, oh, wow-- and even
the reality that I thought

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:53.650 align:middle line:90%
was real was obviously fake.

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:57.130 align:middle line:84%
I was in a "Brady Bunch"
television reality.

00:31:57.130 --> 00:31:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And the one before that
was some Howdy Doody

00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:01.750 align:middle line:84%
reality of my parents
and so on and so on.

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:03.250 align:middle line:84%
Until the only ones
that really know

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:05.507 align:middle line:84%
what's going on because
back to indigenous people.

00:32:05.507 --> 00:32:07.090 align:middle line:84%
The only ones who
know what's going on

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:10.780 align:middle line:84%
are people who are
connected to reality.

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And that shouldn't be
so scary, you know?

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:21.730 align:middle line:84%
I think maybe one of the
cures for climate change

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:25.280 align:middle line:84%
will be for people not to see
the real world as the enemy,

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:26.080 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:28.500 align:middle line:90%
As the thing to escape from.

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:32.320 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of the
saddest moment in my work

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:35.205 align:middle line:84%
was when I finally got
to meet the billionaires,

00:32:35.205 --> 00:32:37.330 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted to know
where to put their bunkers.

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:38.997 align:middle line:84%
That's what they
wanted to know from me,

00:32:38.997 --> 00:32:41.260 align:middle line:84%
how to maintain control
of their security force

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:42.850 align:middle line:90%
after their money is worthless.

00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:44.980 align:middle line:84%
So here are the
wealthiest people

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:49.270 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, the winners
of the digital economy,

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:55.180 align:middle line:84%
who are spending their time and
energy trying to figure out,

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:58.180 align:middle line:84%
how do I insulate myself
from the reality I've created

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:00.490 align:middle line:90%
by earning money in this way?

00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:04.330 align:middle line:84%
They've got such high
levels of anxiety

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:05.830 align:middle line:84%
because they
understand what they've

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:09.760 align:middle line:84%
done but see themselves as
powerless to turn around

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:14.530 align:middle line:84%
and just engage with
us like human beings.

00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:18.790 align:middle line:84%
They really, they want to
escape and leave the rest of us

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:21.910 align:middle line:84%
behind because they think
that's the only way for them

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:23.562 align:middle line:90%
to survive.

00:33:23.562 --> 00:33:27.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's hope things
change before that happens.

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:30.800 align:middle line:84%
>> They're not going to get
off the planet, you know?

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:35.990 align:middle line:84%
SpaceX and whatever Bezos's
one is, they're not going to--

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:39.530 align:middle line:84%
we tried to make a biosphere
in Arizona on Earth,

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:41.360 align:middle line:90%
and that didn't even work.

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.430 align:middle line:84%
So no, we're not going
to, anytime soon,

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:48.016 align:middle line:84%
be able to make a biosphere
on Mars that functions.

00:33:48.016 --> 00:33:50.648 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that
I would like to just touch

00:33:50.648 --> 00:33:53.190 align:middle line:84%
on a little bit deeper is-- you
talked about it when you just

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:57.150 align:middle line:84%
mentioned about how this father
wants to keep his Facebook

00:33:57.150 --> 00:33:59.970 align:middle line:84%
stock and let his child use
Facebook even though they might

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:01.803 align:middle line:84%
be cutting and harming
themselves, you know,

00:34:01.803 --> 00:34:04.260 align:middle line:84%
social media in this,
like, addicted culture that

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:09.719 align:middle line:84%
we've become a part of is
tending for us to hinge

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:13.650 align:middle line:84%
our self-worth on the
internet on social media.

00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, what do
you think the cost of this

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:18.719 align:middle line:84%
is, first of all,
I mean in terms

00:34:18.719 --> 00:34:20.550 align:middle line:84%
of us externalizing
our self-worth

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:23.280 align:middle line:84%
on what other people, random
people might think of us

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.929 align:middle line:90%
or how many likes we get?

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:27.719 align:middle line:84%
And additionally, if you
could add sort of flavor

00:34:27.719 --> 00:34:31.590 align:middle line:84%
to this conversation in terms
of how much more connected

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:34.860 align:middle line:84%
we are than ever before and
yet we're so disconnected

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:41.085 align:middle line:84%
and how that results in
worsening health outcomes even.

00:34:41.085 --> 00:34:52.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in some ways, social
media likes are just a new form

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:56.150 align:middle line:90%
of dollars in your bank account.

00:34:56.150 --> 00:35:00.390 align:middle line:90%


00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Until recently,
whatever it may be,

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:05.550 align:middle line:84%
you had to be, when
I was a kid, 30 or 40

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:07.410 align:middle line:84%
years old before you're
actually thinking

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:11.640 align:middle line:84%
about your self-worth in
terms of the size of my salary

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.320 align:middle line:90%
or my bank account.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.240 align:middle line:90%
Those were like parent concerns.

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:16.720 align:middle line:90%
I was like, whatever, who cares?

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm out playing baseball.

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:23.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, 11, 12, 13-year-olds
who have social media

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:26.320 align:middle line:84%
accounts, they have that
number-- how many people liked

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:28.880 align:middle line:84%
this post, how many
friends do I have on there.

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:40.690 align:middle line:84%
So now, there is a data-driven
currency for their self-worth.

00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:43.630 align:middle line:84%
This is a story that goes
back to the beginning

00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:44.650 align:middle line:90%
of quantification.

00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:50.080 align:middle line:84%
When did we start to see to
measure things as quantities?

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.990 align:middle line:84%
When did sort of that
scientific world view

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:55.390 align:middle line:84%
that everything has a
number, we can figure out

00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:58.360 align:middle line:84%
a metric for every aspect
of nature-- and anything

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:01.210 align:middle line:84%
that we can't figure out
a number for is evil,

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:04.072 align:middle line:90%
or is female, or is scary.

00:36:04.072 --> 00:36:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And there's no
number-- well, we'll

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:10.560 align:middle line:84%
figure out the number eventually
and get it on our spreadsheet.

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.510 align:middle line:84%
Kids who are raised
with social media likes

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:15.760 align:middle line:90%
are already quantized.

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:20.290 align:middle line:84%
They're already quantifying
their understanding

00:36:20.290 --> 00:36:21.400 align:middle line:90%
of themselves.

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:25.660 align:middle line:84%
So the problem with
it is, to me, it's

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:27.340 align:middle line:90%
almost less about the--

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:29.980 align:middle line:84%
that it's specifically
social media

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:36.180 align:middle line:84%
but that their
sense of self worth

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:40.890 align:middle line:84%
is external to them
rather than experiential--

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:44.490 align:middle line:84%
that it's something telling
me how much I'm worth.

00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:48.210 align:middle line:90%
And it's not even human.

00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:52.350 align:middle line:84%
At least if you're getting
your sense of self worth

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:56.610 align:middle line:84%
through the way other people
are interacting with you,

00:36:56.610 --> 00:36:58.780 align:middle line:84%
like, are they
smiling at me or not?

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:00.450 align:middle line:90%
At least there's mimesis.

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:04.350 align:middle line:84%
At least there's something
kind of communal about it.

00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:11.610 align:middle line:84%
When it's a number or when
someone else's positivity is

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:15.900 align:middle line:84%
being expressed to
me through a number

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:22.050 align:middle line:84%
rather than through a pat on the
back, or a nod, or some love,

00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:25.380 align:middle line:84%
then it's not actually
feeding my organism.

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:31.770 align:middle line:84%
It's feeding some
accountant inside myself.

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:39.215 align:middle line:84%
And that's just banging
on one nerve, one--

00:37:39.215 --> 00:37:41.910 align:middle line:84%
that might be
wetiko right there.

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:43.110 align:middle line:90%
That's the disease.

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:52.578 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of the cancer
is this quantified self.

00:37:52.578 --> 00:37:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And then we've got all these
other tools, these Fitbits

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:57.078 align:middle line:84%
and all these things to keep
counting and telling you

00:37:57.078 --> 00:38:03.260 align:middle line:84%
all that feedback and numbers,
but it's dangerous, I guess,

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:12.070 align:middle line:84%
because we lose the ability
to be fed organically

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:13.090 align:middle line:90%
from other humans.

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:17.620 align:middle line:84%
We lose the ability to recognize
when someone is with us,

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:18.790 align:middle line:90%
is on our side.

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:24.100 align:middle line:84%
We all end up with a kind of an
induced Asperger's of a sort,

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:31.720 align:middle line:84%
where we can't read social cues
and we don't give social cues.

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:34.960 align:middle line:84%
I've been teaching
for five years now.

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And each semester on
the first day of class,

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:40.750 align:middle line:84%
in college, I get notes
from the students.

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:42.520 align:middle line:84%
I get more and more
every semester.

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:45.070 align:middle line:84%
It's a note from the
student's doctor saying,

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:49.030 align:middle line:84%
"Please excuse Johnny from
class presentations and class

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:52.390 align:middle line:84%
participation," and it's
because Johnny has some kind

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:56.640 align:middle line:84%
of a social disorder
that doesn't--

00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:59.020 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not teasing Johnny here.

00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:00.220 align:middle line:90%
I feel bad for Johnny.

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:04.750 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think that this
is all organic, this increase.

00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:10.170 align:middle line:84%
I think that this is an
induced social disability.

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:12.670 align:middle line:84%
No, I'm not going to make Johnny
speak in class because he's

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:15.670 align:middle line:84%
got that fear of
doing it, but what

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:18.680 align:middle line:84%
was happening from
kindergarten to 12th grade?

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:21.340 align:middle line:84%
Johnny, they gave him an
iPad, and he could check up

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:24.380 align:middle line:84%
all the things because even
what Johnny learned in school,

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:30.340 align:middle line:84%
it was all assessed by
the acquisition of data

00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:36.010 align:middle line:84%
rather than the acquisition
of skills, of engagement,

00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:42.370 align:middle line:84%
the activation of inquiry
of the creative path

00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:45.490 align:middle line:84%
because you know they
made Johnny predictable.

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:47.950 align:middle line:90%
They made Johnny compliant.

00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:49.840 align:middle line:90%
They put Johnny on a graph.

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And now, Johnny has
a social disability.

00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>> It's more common
than ever before.

00:39:57.090 --> 00:39:59.660 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>> And how are we going to
get ourselves out of that?

00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:03.520 align:middle line:90%
Just when the world needs--

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:05.060 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a huge
question, right?

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:06.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have to
retool education

00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:08.085 align:middle line:84%
if we're going to
do that, right?

00:40:08.085 --> 00:40:12.428 align:middle line:84%
Which is, like, focus
on arts connection or--

00:40:12.428 --> 00:40:14.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think about-- when
you're talking about this,

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.210 align:middle line:84%
as I mentioned
earlier, I live as part

00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:20.480 align:middle line:84%
of an indigenous culture
of Melanesian people,

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:23.033 align:middle line:84%
and they communicate so
deeply with their eyes.

00:40:23.033 --> 00:40:24.950 align:middle line:84%
Like, you stop and let
someone cross the road,

00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:26.680 align:middle line:84%
and they look at you
and they're like--

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.347 align:middle line:84%
they know, and they
connect, and they're

00:40:28.347 --> 00:40:30.740 align:middle line:84%
so adept at being
able to communicate

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:33.020 align:middle line:84%
with their entire
body and their smile.

00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:34.802 align:middle line:84%
And then you meet
people in New York City

00:40:34.802 --> 00:40:36.260 align:middle line:84%
and you're like,
whoa, these people

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:37.520 align:middle line:90%
aren't even seeing anybody.

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:39.920 align:middle line:84%
They're just walking
around like this, right?

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.260 align:middle line:90%
It's like, wait, I'm here.

00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:41.550 align:middle line:90%
Hello!

00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:41.840 align:middle line:90%
Hello!

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:43.252 align:middle line:90%
>> I've been playing a game--

00:40:43.252 --> 00:40:44.460 align:middle line:90%
because I live near New York.

00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:46.110 align:middle line:84%
I walk around in
New York City a lot,

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:48.140 align:middle line:84%
and I play this game
where I look around

00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:52.520 align:middle line:84%
for someone else who's not in
the thing and make eye contact.

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's like we're part of
this conspiracy of like--

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:57.890 align:middle line:90%
it's like a body snatcher thing.

00:40:57.890 --> 00:40:59.420 align:middle line:90%
Like, oh, there's another one.

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:00.548 align:middle line:90%
I remember it back from--

00:41:00.548 --> 00:41:02.090 align:middle line:84%
when I started doing
that originally,

00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:03.710 align:middle line:90%
it was back in the rave days.

00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:05.060 align:middle line:90%
Remember rave?

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And you'd go to a rave-- this
is back in San Francisco.

00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:09.107 align:middle line:84%
You'd go to a rave,
and the next--

00:41:09.107 --> 00:41:10.940 align:middle line:84%
well, you'd get out at
4:00 in the morning--

00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:13.315 align:middle line:84%
but you'd go to work, and the
next day you'd walk around,

00:41:13.315 --> 00:41:15.470 align:middle line:84%
and you'd see someone
and you don't even

00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:18.080 align:middle line:84%
recognize them
specifically from the rave,

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:20.600 align:middle line:84%
but you can tell
they'd been there.

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:23.887 align:middle line:84%
And you have this knowing
smile, oh, you were there.

00:41:23.887 --> 00:41:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way I
kind of walk around now

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:28.303 align:middle line:84%
is when I find someone who's not
in the device it's, like, oh,

00:41:28.303 --> 00:41:29.930 align:middle line:90%
yeah, aren't these people crazy?

00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:31.160 align:middle line:90%
I love you, too.

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:33.120 align:middle line:84%
See you some other
time, you know?

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:35.120 align:middle line:84%
It's like, maybe we were
together in a past life

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.220 align:middle line:90%
or in a future one.

00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:38.000 align:middle line:90%
It's like, this is crazy.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny because I use
the word "conspiracy" a lot

00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:42.950 align:middle line:84%
now because it literally--
conspiracy means

00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:45.600 align:middle line:90%
"breathe together--" conspire.

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:47.450 align:middle line:90%
So I really love that idea of--

00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:50.960 align:middle line:84%
the idea that breathing together
with someone else in this world

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:52.550 align:middle line:90%
is conspiracy.

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:53.390 align:middle line:90%
That's a conspiracy.

00:41:53.390 --> 00:42:01.540 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone is so onboard
the status quo digital reality.

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:04.190 align:middle line:84%
>> It's funny when I think
about conspiracy, I think about,

00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:07.830 align:middle line:84%
this is people conspiring
against the status quo, right?

00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:10.080 align:middle line:84%
You're saying people breathing
together and connecting

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:12.240 align:middle line:84%
are actually conspiring
against the status quo.

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.040 align:middle line:90%
It makes sense.

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:15.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean-- but you don't
think of it in that way.

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Practically speaking,
you talk a lot

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.250 align:middle line:84%
about this idea of
Team Human, right?

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:20.130 align:middle line:90%
And I love it.

00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:22.310 align:middle line:90%
I think it's great.

00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:23.840 align:middle line:90%
What does Team Human mean?

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:26.630 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean to
be a part of this idea?

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And how can people
sort of enact it

00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:32.150 align:middle line:84%
in this sort of evolving
digital landscape.

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I mean Team Human,
it kind of started as a joke

00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:39.860 align:middle line:84%
because I was on a panel with a
singularity guy who was arguing

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:42.440 align:middle line:84%
that human beings should
pass the evolutionary torch

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:45.200 align:middle line:84%
to our digital successors,
and we should fade

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:47.990 align:middle line:84%
in the background and accept
our inevitable extinction,

00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:50.450 align:middle line:84%
and I was like,
no, humans matter,

00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:51.745 align:middle line:90%
we should have a human future.

00:42:51.745 --> 00:42:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh,
Rushkoff, you're

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.160 align:middle line:84%
just saying that
'cause you're a human.

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I said,
fine, I'm on team human.

00:42:57.890 --> 00:42:59.810 align:middle line:84%
But the more I said
it, I realized, well,

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:03.140 align:middle line:84%
you know, I kind of believe
that, that being human

00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:05.990 align:middle line:90%
is a team sport.

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:07.790 align:middle line:90%
No one can do this alone.

00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:11.420 align:middle line:84%
That being human is this is
this collective activity.

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And once you
understand it that way,

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:15.590 align:middle line:84%
then you know your
agenda is to become

00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:18.710 align:middle line:84%
part of this great
human race, this thing.

00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:20.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everybody's
on team human.

00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And it makes it hard
to have human enemies.

00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:26.508 align:middle line:90%
There is no enemy.

00:43:26.508 --> 00:43:28.800 align:middle line:84%
It puts you in that same
state as the indigenous people

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:32.000 align:middle line:84%
is that, oh, all these
people are on team human.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:32.840 align:middle line:90%
They're just sick.

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:34.260 align:middle line:90%
They're just confused.

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:36.110 align:middle line:90%
Hey, you're on the team.

00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:41.870 align:middle line:84%
So even whoever, the racist
and the hater, they're on--

00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:44.670 align:middle line:84%
they don't know it, but
they can be on team human.

00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:48.890 align:middle line:84%
They just have to
rekindle their humanness.

00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:51.780 align:middle line:84%
So that's all that really
being on team human.

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:52.580 align:middle line:90%
It's funny.

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:55.970 align:middle line:84%
I get emails from people
saying, how do I join?

00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:57.200 align:middle line:90%
Where do I sign up?

00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, if you're
part of the human race,

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:01.340 align:middle line:90%
you're on the team.

00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:04.580 align:middle line:84%
It's almost a
facetious construct of,

00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:05.840 align:middle line:90%
are you on team human?

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:10.597 align:middle line:84%
It's like, if you can't
even be on team human, ugh.

00:44:10.597 --> 00:44:12.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I get environmentalists
saying, why do you

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:13.847 align:middle line:90%
care about the humans? suck.

00:44:13.847 --> 00:44:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Stop we're the ones that
destroy the planet and all.

00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:19.325 align:middle line:84%
We are, but we're
part of nature, too.

00:44:19.325 --> 00:44:23.360 align:middle line:90%


00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:25.430 align:middle line:84%
It's OK to be nice
to other people,

00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:28.150 align:middle line:84%
to recognize the
humanity in them.

00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And I keep telling
people, if you

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:33.800 align:middle line:84%
can't see the humanity
in the racist guy,

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:36.350 align:middle line:84%
even wearing that
Make America Great--

00:44:36.350 --> 00:44:38.630 align:middle line:84%
white again hat or
whatever that is,

00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:41.360 align:middle line:84%
if you can't see the human
being under that hat,

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:42.860 align:middle line:84%
then how do you
expect him to see

00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:46.760 align:middle line:84%
the human being in the
dark-skinned immigrant who's

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:48.350 align:middle line:90%
come into his country?

00:44:48.350 --> 00:44:51.530 align:middle line:90%
You can't see others as other.

00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:54.090 align:middle line:84%
That's why the other
big slogan of team human

00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:56.730 align:middle line:84%
is, "find the others,"
which I got originally

00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:59.130 align:middle line:84%
from Timothy Leary when
he was talking about what

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:01.230 align:middle line:84%
to do after you've had
the psychedelic experience

00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:03.130 align:middle line:84%
and see that the world
is all connected.

00:45:03.130 --> 00:45:04.718 align:middle line:90%
Find the others.

00:45:04.718 --> 00:45:06.010 align:middle line:90%
And I'm meaning the same thing.

00:45:06.010 --> 00:45:08.640 align:middle line:84%
Find the others
but find the other.

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:10.950 align:middle line:84%
Find the people that you
think are other from you

00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:15.030 align:middle line:84%
and find the human in them
and connect with them.

00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:16.000 align:middle line:90%
That's the task.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.380 align:middle line:84%
It's not just to find the
cool, weird pot smokers

00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:21.740 align:middle line:90%
that you want to hang out.

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:22.560 align:middle line:90%
Find the weirds.

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:27.154 align:middle line:90%
Find the ones who are lost.

00:45:27.154 --> 00:45:29.480 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel like when
you talk like this,

00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:33.070 align:middle line:84%
you're starting to sound
like a Vedic Brahman priest--

00:45:33.070 --> 00:45:35.960 align:middle line:84%
see oneness in
everybody, you know?

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:37.975 align:middle line:84%
Acknowledge the good
in all of humankind.

00:45:37.975 --> 00:45:39.105 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's beautiful.

00:45:39.105 --> 00:45:40.480 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a
spiritual message.

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:42.313 align:middle line:84%
And people get that
awakening when they also

00:45:42.313 --> 00:45:43.900 align:middle line:90%
take psychedelics, right?

00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that the
plants are maybe here

00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:48.443 align:middle line:90%
to give us this insight?

00:45:48.443 --> 00:45:50.860 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a renaissance
happening in plant medicine,

00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:51.760 align:middle line:90%
first of all.

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:54.340 align:middle line:84%
Look at cannabis,
look at psychedelics

00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:57.000 align:middle line:84%
being decriminalized in certain
areas in Denver recently.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, and microdosing
of psilocybin mushrooms.

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:01.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly, and Michael
Pollan's bringing to prominence,

00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:03.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean Andrew Weil, who I was a
huge fan of in his early days,

00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:06.610 align:middle line:84%
he got ostracized by the medical
community when he first started

00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:08.380 align:middle line:90%
delving into that, right?

00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And now, it's all
the rage again,

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:12.560 align:middle line:90%
so he's back on happy territory.

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:17.410 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that plant medicine
is making a renaissance just

00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:19.000 align:middle line:84%
at the right time
so that we can all

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.576 align:middle line:84%
awake into the oneness
that resides within us?

00:46:22.576 --> 00:46:23.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:26.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
necessary, you know?

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:31.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think any
medicine is fine,

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.030 align:middle line:84%
especially if you're
sick, you know?

00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And I do think that we're
all on drugs all the time,

00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:45.350 align:middle line:84%
whether you're on caffeine,
or glucose, or Facebook,

00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:47.030 align:middle line:90%
or anything, you know?

00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:49.910 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting
to look in a society

00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:58.810 align:middle line:84%
at which plants and foods
have been made illegal

00:46:58.810 --> 00:47:02.290 align:middle line:90%
and which ones are promoted.

00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:04.930 align:middle line:84%
So are you in a culture
that has caffeine, nicotine,

00:47:04.930 --> 00:47:06.050 align:middle line:90%
and alcohol?

00:47:06.050 --> 00:47:11.560 align:middle line:84%
Are you in a culture that's
having plant proteins

00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:15.650 align:middle line:84%
and mushrooms as
part of your life?

00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:16.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm so sure.

00:47:16.450 --> 00:47:19.760 align:middle line:90%


00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:24.860 align:middle line:84%
I don't like advocating
for psychedelics

00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:30.490 align:middle line:84%
because I don't think that
they're for everybody.

00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:32.420 align:middle line:90%
They're scary for some people.

00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
anything's necessary,

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:43.390 align:middle line:84%
but they're useful
tool if done properly.

00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:47.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the thing that
amazed me was, you know,

00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:50.647 align:middle line:84%
I had psychedelic experiences,
and they were very positively

00:47:50.647 --> 00:47:53.230 align:middle line:84%
transformative for me, and I got
to the point where I thought,

00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:56.580 align:middle line:84%
oh my gosh, anybody
takes one of these things

00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:58.770 align:middle line:84%
and they'll have
those experiences.

00:47:58.770 --> 00:48:01.320 align:middle line:84%
But there's people who take
psychedelics that are still

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:03.690 align:middle line:90%
total assholes, you know?

00:48:03.690 --> 00:48:07.800 align:middle line:84%
Or they'll think that they're
god, or subjugate others,

00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:11.130 align:middle line:84%
or they'll be part of
some evil Silicon Valley

00:48:11.130 --> 00:48:14.070 align:middle line:84%
corporation all year and go
to Burning Man for five days

00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:17.340 align:middle line:84%
and do psychedelics,
and go back, and still

00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:21.680 align:middle line:84%
make Palantir,
and spy on people,

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:22.995 align:middle line:90%
and do all the worst shit.

00:48:22.995 --> 00:48:26.430 align:middle line:90%


00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:29.720 align:middle line:90%
So I wonder.

00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:36.440 align:middle line:84%
But sure, they're fine, and
I'm sure somebody, particularly

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:39.770 align:middle line:84%
people who are depressed or
addicted to certain things,

00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:47.810 align:middle line:84%
if they can have a well-mentored
psychedelic session

00:48:47.810 --> 00:48:50.390 align:middle line:84%
and get over their depression,
which happens for thousands

00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:53.150 align:middle line:84%
of people or all the stuff
Michael Pollan writes about,

00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:54.470 align:middle line:90%
too, then sure.

00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:59.330 align:middle line:84%
It should be part of
the tools that we humans

00:48:59.330 --> 00:49:02.870 align:middle line:84%
have available to ourselves
to correct course.

00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:05.360 align:middle line:84%
But I wouldn't say, oh,
therefore in eighth grade,

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:08.525 align:middle line:84%
everyone should be given
their psilocybin trip.

00:49:08.525 --> 00:49:09.650 align:middle line:90%
>> True.

00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:13.850 align:middle line:84%
One of the big things we
talk about in "Food Matters,"

00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:17.660 align:middle line:84%
in the Gaia community-- and
this is about how we can do,

00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:22.520 align:middle line:84%
in essence, self-work to become
more conscious, more connected,

00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:26.210 align:middle line:84%
such as meditation or
enhancing our capability

00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:28.340 align:middle line:90%
to improve our intuition.

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that some
of these maybe considered

00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:34.940 align:middle line:84%
more esoteric practices
have their part

00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:37.940 align:middle line:84%
in becoming more human and
becoming more connected

00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:41.430 align:middle line:84%
so that we can find the
others, so to speak?

00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I mean,
for many people,

00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:49.040 align:middle line:84%
it's a kind of a
tourism, you know?

00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:50.310 align:middle line:90%
And it's fine.

00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:52.700 align:middle line:84%
That's one of Anthony
Bourdain-like--

00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:56.990 align:middle line:84%
if you can sit and
eat with people,

00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:58.850 align:middle line:84%
eat the weird stuff
that other people eat,

00:49:58.850 --> 00:50:01.730 align:middle line:84%
then you're going to connect
with them on this intimate way.

00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And there's all this indigenous
wisdom that we should retrieve,

00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:20.350 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know that we
should fool ourselves.

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:23.110 align:middle line:84%
I almost don't want to want
to bastardized these things

00:50:23.110 --> 00:50:24.810 align:middle line:84%
or think that we
understand them.

00:50:24.810 --> 00:50:27.790 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh, I'm going to spend
three years with the Maori.

00:50:27.790 --> 00:50:29.500 align:middle line:90%
And now, hey, I'm Maori!

00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:32.320 align:middle line:84%
It's like, dude, spend
3,000 years with the Maori,

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:35.035 align:middle line:90%
and then maybe come and talk.

00:50:35.035 --> 00:50:44.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's more a matter of how
do we enable the contributions

00:50:44.110 --> 00:50:47.800 align:middle line:90%
of these other civilizations?

00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:50.620 align:middle line:84%
How do we allow them
to manifest, not how

00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:53.320 align:middle line:90%
do we manifest what they are?

00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:56.040 align:middle line:90%


00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking that
that last book I wrote

00:50:58.570 --> 00:50:59.710 align:middle line:90%
might be my last one.

00:50:59.710 --> 00:51:05.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking it's time for
us to shut up, you know?

00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:09.610 align:middle line:90%
They're quiet and hear--

00:51:09.610 --> 00:51:11.080 align:middle line:90%
they hear the other voices.

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:17.670 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, I mean, the Maori or
the indigenous peoples of India

00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:20.680 align:middle line:84%
know more about crop
rotation and soil maintenance

00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:23.290 align:middle line:90%
than Monsanto does.

00:51:23.290 --> 00:51:25.780 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, let's
start incorporating

00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:32.880 align:middle line:84%
their methodologies
while we can to--

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:34.840 align:middle line:90%
their understandings of things.

00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:37.360 align:middle line:84%
But going to have to
do it by the numbers

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:39.580 align:middle line:84%
for a good long
while because we're

00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:43.300 align:middle line:84%
not going to have
it in our bones.

00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:46.120 align:middle line:84%
But we can say, oh, OK,
these kinds of plants

00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:49.120 align:middle line:84%
work well together, and
we'll nourish the soil

00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:50.470 align:middle line:90%
and provide food.

00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:53.950 align:middle line:84%
Just do it by rote for
5 or 10 generations

00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:56.350 align:middle line:84%
until we understand
what's really

00:51:56.350 --> 00:52:00.310 align:middle line:84%
going on here because it's
not like they set out--

00:52:00.310 --> 00:52:02.500 align:middle line:84%
they didn't come
about that wisdom

00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:07.420 align:middle line:84%
in sort of the scientific
discipline methodology

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:10.300 align:middle line:90%
that we use.

00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:12.310 align:middle line:84%
They came to that
wisdom because they

00:52:12.310 --> 00:52:18.430 align:middle line:84%
see the space between the
lines that we've drawn.

00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:21.910 align:middle line:84%
We understand the ocean as
latitude and longitude lines.

00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:24.970 align:middle line:84%
That was really useful for
circumnavigation of the globe,

00:52:24.970 --> 00:52:27.740 align:middle line:84%
but we don't
understand the waves.

00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:29.770 align:middle line:90%
We can't do pattern recognition.

00:52:29.770 --> 00:52:36.196 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reality that
we need to foreground now.

00:52:36.196 --> 00:52:37.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:42.100 align:middle line:84%
I personally am a cup
sort of half-full guy.

00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:45.910 align:middle line:84%
I see that we have
created a seething mess

00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:50.290 align:middle line:84%
with this current digital
future that we've rushed into

00:52:50.290 --> 00:52:53.940 align:middle line:84%
and dove into, and
it's accelerating

00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:55.750 align:middle line:90%
at a dizzying speed.

00:52:55.750 --> 00:53:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And my hope is that we can use
these structures of capitalism

00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:03.730 align:middle line:84%
and the digital future
to sort of shift

00:53:03.730 --> 00:53:06.790 align:middle line:84%
to more potentially
conscious-based businesses,

00:53:06.790 --> 00:53:09.780 align:middle line:84%
or more purpose-driven
organizations,

00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:13.990 align:middle line:84%
or, as you sometimes jokingly
call, "humane technology,"

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:16.090 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:53:16.090 --> 00:53:19.150 align:middle line:84%
As we wrap towards the final
part of this interview here,

00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:21.220 align:middle line:84%
this question and maybe
a final jazz on this

00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:23.165 align:middle line:84%
is, how do you
think we can solve

00:53:23.165 --> 00:53:25.540 align:middle line:84%
some of these problems using
the structures that we have?

00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:27.970 align:middle line:84%
Do you think we can
solve these big issues

00:53:27.970 --> 00:53:29.665 align:middle line:84%
that we have using
technology, and how

00:53:29.665 --> 00:53:30.790 align:middle line:90%
do you think it's possible?

00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:33.940 align:middle line:90%


00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, technology can be a
part of our solutions as long

00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:42.880 align:middle line:84%
as we don't try to
techno-solutionize everything.

00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:45.280 align:middle line:84%
As long as we don't think
that everything in reality

00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:49.180 align:middle line:84%
is a data point that
can be somehow processed

00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:51.100 align:middle line:90%
through silicon.

00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:53.230 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:54.410 align:middle line:90%
It can be part of it.

00:53:54.410 --> 00:53:57.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the sort of solutions
I'm looking at mostly

00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:04.030 align:middle line:84%
are kind of economic, looking
at how do we develop more

00:54:04.030 --> 00:54:06.860 align:middle line:90%
regenerative economic models?

00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:11.980 align:middle line:84%
How do we implement local
currencies and alternative

00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:13.510 align:middle line:90%
currencies?

00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:18.190 align:middle line:84%
How do we start looking
at resources as commons

00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:21.730 align:middle line:84%
rather than as commodities
and understand how

00:54:21.730 --> 00:54:28.280 align:middle line:90%
to steward a resource together.

00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:35.820 align:middle line:84%
So I think that there are some
simple, good, actionable steps

00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:39.870 align:middle line:84%
that we can take towards
relocalizing our economies,

00:54:39.870 --> 00:54:44.850 align:middle line:84%
accumulating less, learning
how to respect and take

00:54:44.850 --> 00:54:47.310 align:middle line:84%
care of elders so that
people don't feel the need

00:54:47.310 --> 00:54:51.102 align:middle line:84%
to create a giant war chest
before they retire so they can

00:54:51.102 --> 00:54:52.560 align:middle line:84%
live off it the
rest of their lives

00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:55.270 align:middle line:84%
because no one's going
to take care of them.

00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:58.050 align:middle line:84%
So there are sort of
simple ways that we

00:54:58.050 --> 00:55:07.830 align:middle line:84%
can unwind some of this
anxious scarcity-based hoarding

00:55:07.830 --> 00:55:10.790 align:middle line:90%
that we're all doing.

00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:14.300 align:middle line:84%
In theory, that's what I'm
talking about these days

00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:19.730 align:middle line:84%
is giving people some of these
simple steps on understanding

00:55:19.730 --> 00:55:23.630 align:middle line:84%
how to create kind
of bounded economies,

00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:27.020 align:middle line:84%
where instead of trying
to earn $10 once,

00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:30.380 align:middle line:84%
you try to figure out how
do I earn $1 10 times that's

00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:33.380 align:middle line:90%
moving through this community?

00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:35.490 align:middle line:90%
And that's not impossible.

00:55:35.490 --> 00:55:40.390 align:middle line:10%
And those have huge
system-wide effects.

00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:43.160 align:middle line:84%
>> So you believe the future
or the way to solve problems is

00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:45.620 align:middle line:90%
local then, essentially?

00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:48.350 align:middle line:84%
And we've gone
upwards in our scale

00:55:48.350 --> 00:55:52.010 align:middle line:84%
from local, to province,
to nation state.

00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying we need to
almost deconstruct the nation

00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:57.200 align:middle line:84%
state, like this idea that the
astronauts when they went up,

00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:58.100 align:middle line:90%
they were like--

00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:02.007 align:middle line:84%
what was it called, that theory
that Scherbakov talked about?

00:56:02.007 --> 00:56:04.340 align:middle line:84%
When they went up, they were
like, oh, actually, there's

00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:05.923 align:middle line:84%
no such thing as
nation states, right?

00:56:05.923 --> 00:56:07.070 align:middle line:90%
That's just a facade.

00:56:07.070 --> 00:56:07.880 align:middle line:90%
It's a fake idea.

00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:10.070 align:middle line:84%
So you think deconstructing
these national lines

00:56:10.070 --> 00:56:12.672 align:middle line:84%
and these boundaries
is a way to solve this?

00:56:12.672 --> 00:56:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>> It's what's happening now.

00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:17.180 align:middle line:84%
That's why they're building
walls on border lines.

00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:22.220 align:middle line:10%
It's because the
boundaries have dissolved.

00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:24.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we all know this
because we studied history.

00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:27.110 align:middle line:84%
There were city-states,
and the city-states

00:56:27.110 --> 00:56:29.685 align:middle line:84%
gave way to nation states,
which are abstractions.

00:56:29.685 --> 00:56:31.560 align:middle line:84%
It's like, no, you're
not a Venetian anymore.

00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:32.780 align:middle line:90%
Now, you're an Italian.

00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:33.830 align:middle line:90%
It's like, what's that?

00:56:33.830 --> 00:56:34.310 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry.

00:56:34.310 --> 00:56:35.300 align:middle line:90%
It's what you are.

00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
lines around it.

00:56:36.770 --> 00:56:38.750 align:middle line:10%
So it was these
abstractions that were

00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:41.860 align:middle line:10%
created in order to really--

00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:44.930 align:middle line:10%
well, to empower
nobles over people

00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:49.550 align:middle line:10%
and to create larger-scale
colonial economies.

00:56:49.550 --> 00:56:53.150 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think
it's a matter of--

00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:55.130 align:middle line:84%
if you try to dissolve
nation-state boundaries,

00:56:55.130 --> 00:56:56.330 align:middle line:84%
people are going
to come after you.

00:56:56.330 --> 00:56:57.620 align:middle line:90%
They're going to get scared.

00:56:57.620 --> 00:56:59.390 align:middle line:84%
So instead, what
I'm asking people

00:56:59.390 --> 00:57:02.900 align:middle line:84%
to do is kind of just
reify your local reality.

00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Have 80% of what you do and care
about come from where you are.

00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And then kind of the primacy of
the nation state will go down.

00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:15.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, yes, you can still
have international trade.

00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:16.685 align:middle line:90%
You can still get your iPhone.

00:57:16.685 --> 00:57:18.560 align:middle line:84%
You can still do all
that if you really want.

00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:20.900 align:middle line:84%
But let that be kind
of 20% of the economy

00:57:20.900 --> 00:57:24.240 align:middle line:90%
rather than 90% of it.

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't do that
consciously, it's going

00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:29.420 align:middle line:90%
to do it for us, you know?

00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:33.290 align:middle line:84%
Between climate change, economic
collapse, and trade wars,

00:57:33.290 --> 00:57:34.900 align:middle line:84%
and God knows what,
you're not going

00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:36.830 align:middle line:84%
to be getting those
things anyway,

00:57:36.830 --> 00:57:42.710 align:middle line:84%
so start to learn how
to live at human scale.

00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:45.380 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not a
terrible limitation.

00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:46.620 align:middle line:90%
This is your body.

00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:49.130 align:middle line:90%
This is your scale.

00:57:49.130 --> 00:57:53.480 align:middle line:84%
So if you live at that
scale, you end up,

00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:56.180 align:middle line:90%
I think, so much happier.

00:57:56.180 --> 00:57:58.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yeah, so we're going
to have to look at that

00:57:58.940 --> 00:58:00.740 align:middle line:84%
and say, well what are
people entitled to?

00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:04.010 align:middle line:84%
All right, everyone in the world
is entitled to two big plane

00:58:04.010 --> 00:58:05.610 align:middle line:90%
trips.

00:58:05.610 --> 00:58:08.090 align:middle line:84%
So you get one trip after
high school before college.

00:58:08.090 --> 00:58:09.480 align:middle line:90%
You go, where do you want to go?

00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:10.280 align:middle line:90%
Everyone signs up.

00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And then, you get one more
maybe when you retire.

00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:13.932 align:middle line:90%
You get to take another trip.

00:58:13.932 --> 00:58:15.890 align:middle line:84%
But no, we're not going
to get-- everyone's not

00:58:15.890 --> 00:58:18.348 align:middle line:84%
going to get to fly around the
world and do all this stuff.

00:58:18.348 --> 00:58:21.410 align:middle line:84%
It's just not
happening, certainly

00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:25.050 align:middle line:84%
electric planes are not coming
anytime soon to allow that.

00:58:25.050 --> 00:58:29.150 align:middle line:84%
But we got to look
at it not as denial

00:58:29.150 --> 00:58:34.610 align:middle line:84%
of your global-scale citizenship
but as an enhancement

00:58:34.610 --> 00:58:36.410 align:middle line:90%
of your local reality.

00:58:36.410 --> 00:58:37.740 align:middle line:90%
What are you going to get?

00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:39.980 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get
friends, and football games,

00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:46.400 align:middle line:84%
and sex, and beautiful people,
and sweet fruit, and all

00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:50.240 align:middle line:84%
this other stuff that you're
going to like more than Netflix

00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:51.560 align:middle line:90%
even.

00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:52.490 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:54.240 align:middle line:84%
Douglas, thank you so
much for your time--

00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:55.255 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, thank you.

00:58:55.255 --> 00:58:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>> --for being a
luminary on this topic.

00:58:57.090 --> 00:59:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that this can
permeate and resonate

00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:02.640 align:middle line:84%
with people and
they might become--

00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:05.610 align:middle line:84%
I think, in practicality,
more local, more connected,

00:59:05.610 --> 00:59:08.250 align:middle line:84%
and that that might help change
the direction of humanity.

00:59:08.250 --> 00:59:09.125 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for your time.

00:59:09.125 --> 00:59:10.710 align:middle line:90%
>> I hope so, too.

00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:14.660 align:middle line:10%
