00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi, it's James here
from Food Matters.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And welcome to this interview
with Nicholas Ortner.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Nick is a close friend who I've
known for over 10 years now.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And he is an established voice
in a tapping and emotional

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.140 align:middle line:84%
freedom technique
movement, which

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.930 align:middle line:84%
is about helping
you uncover and help

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.120 align:middle line:84%
to release trapped
energies and emotions that

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.990 align:middle line:84%
could be holding you back
from healing, from minimizing

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.290 align:middle line:84%
pain, or even achieving
more success in your life.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.380 align:middle line:84%
He's the founder of The Tapping
Solution, a best selling

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.710 align:middle line:84%
author, a filmmaker, and host
of the Annual Tapping World

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.540 align:middle line:84%
Summit, which is an
incredible event.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And today, we're going to be
talking to him about tapping

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.700 align:middle line:84%
and how it works in
the body and also,

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.310 align:middle line:84%
how you can use it to
minimize stress and improve

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.620 align:middle line:90%
the quality of your life.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.560 align:middle line:90%
Nick.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.810 align:middle line:90%
>> James, good to be with you.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Like you said, it's been
a long time a decade

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.280 align:middle line:84%
of doing this work to
change people's lives,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.180 align:middle line:84%
which is, I think, the common
element with what we share

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.610 align:middle line:84%
with each other is,
just this dedication

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.770 align:middle line:84%
for knowing that there's
information out there

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.100 align:middle line:90%
that can change people's lives.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.610 align:middle line:84%
Early on, when we were on our
Food Matters journey and then,

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.110 align:middle line:84%
you know, a similar
time 2007, 2008,

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.560 align:middle line:84%
and then you were beginning
with the tapping film.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.710 align:middle line:84%
You know, we saw this passion
to want to get information

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.000 align:middle line:90%
about nutrition to people.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.625 align:middle line:84%
And you had this
passion to want to get

00:01:24.625 --> 00:01:26.130 align:middle line:84%
emotional healing
to people, which

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.380 align:middle line:90%
I think was ahead of the time.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.660 align:middle line:90%
Like now, it's really topical.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.670 align:middle line:84%
What was the inspiration
for you at that time?

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.712 align:middle line:84%
Was there a personal
catalyst that really led you

00:01:33.712 --> 00:01:35.330 align:middle line:90%
into this period?

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, great question.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.080 align:middle line:84%
So I started using
tapping personally right

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.630 align:middle line:90%
around 2002, 2003.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'd found it online, like
we find things these days.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.530 align:middle line:84%
I had learned about EFT from
Gary Craig, the founder of EFT,

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.200 align:middle line:84%
Carol Look, Patricia
Carrington, these voices that

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.550 align:middle line:90%
were teaching it online.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.110 align:middle line:90%
And I started using it.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And at first it's like,
wait, what are we doing?

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.430 align:middle line:84%
We are tapping on end points
of meridians of our body.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's supposed to
make us feel better?

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.140 align:middle line:84%
I laughed but I kept seeing
one story after another

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.180 align:middle line:84%
after another of people
saying this worked,

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.520 align:middle line:84%
this helped my pain, this
helped me lose weight,

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.690 align:middle line:84%
this helped me change
my limiting beliefs.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And when you read enough
things online-- this

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.300 align:middle line:84%
is the beauty of the work we
do and the communities that

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.910 align:middle line:84%
come together online that
says, well, this works.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.380 align:middle line:84%
I had an experience
and it worked.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.770 align:middle line:90%
So I tried it.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And I remember one of
my first experiences,

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.890 align:middle line:84%
it's like, you're looking
at the computer and, OK,

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.068 align:middle line:84%
so tapping on the
side of the hand.

00:02:30.068 --> 00:02:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'd woken up
with some neck pain.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.430 align:middle line:84%
So you know how you sleep
wrong and you wrestle

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.680 align:middle line:84%
a bear in your dreams and
you wake up like, oh my god,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.658 align:middle line:90%
what did I do?

00:02:37.658 --> 00:02:39.200 align:middle line:84%
So I just crick in
my neck and I kept

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.810 align:middle line:84%
hearing that tapping was
really good for neck pain.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.900 align:middle line:84%
So I said, all right, let's
give it a shot for pain, period.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:45.755 align:middle line:90%
I did the tapping.

00:02:45.755 --> 00:02:46.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm going through it.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.640 align:middle line:84%
Felt a little silly
trying to figure it out.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.010 align:middle line:84%
Next thing I knew, the
pain just released.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.740 align:middle line:84%
5, 10 minutes of
tapping and it was gone.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Now what was so exciting
to me about that moment--

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.840 align:middle line:84%
and especially now, I
mean, then I was happy

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.798 align:middle line:90%
that there was no pain.

00:03:00.798 --> 00:03:03.770 align:middle line:84%
But looking back on it,
what I was excited about

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.610 align:middle line:84%
was, most of us walk around
with a set of beliefs

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:08.632 align:middle line:90%
about the world, right?

00:03:08.632 --> 00:03:10.340 align:middle line:84%
We have a set of
beliefs about nutrition.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.680 align:middle line:84%
We learned that this food is
good for us or bad for us.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Or in the beginning,
we don't even

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.120 align:middle line:90%
know that food matters, right?

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.860 align:middle line:90%
No pun intended, right?

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.760 align:middle line:84%
So we walk around
with these beliefs.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And I had this belief that
if you have neck pain, maybe

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.720 align:middle line:90%
you pop an aspirin or a Tylenol.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.180 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you suffer for
a couple of days.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.830 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you stretch it out.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.540 align:middle line:84%
This is just what was going to
happen because I hurt my neck.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And I did this
weird tapping thing.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
that pain released.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And it got me thinking, where
are the other places in my life

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.980 align:middle line:90%
where I have mistaken beliefs?

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Where are the
places where I have

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.580 align:middle line:84%
a belief about my
financial success,

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.110 align:middle line:84%
I have a belief about
what's possible for my life,

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.500 align:middle line:84%
I have a belief about
my relationships.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.410 align:middle line:84%
I have things that I'm
holding onto from the past

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.670 align:middle line:84%
that I believe, that's just the
way it's going to be, right?

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, this happened to me
when I was 15 years old.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.090 align:middle line:90%
And I'm still angry about it.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.200 align:middle line:90%
And that's just the way life is.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.590 align:middle line:90%
So I have to hold onto it.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And that little break through,
as I started doing more tapping

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.900 align:middle line:84%
and building on it, I started
looking around at my life

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.920 align:middle line:84%
and going, does my life right
now have to be the way it is?

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.790 align:middle line:84%
Which to me, if you look at
personal development, anything,

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.980 align:middle line:90%
that's the crux of it all.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.040 align:middle line:84%
We're all looking around
going, does my life

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.740 align:middle line:84%
have to be the way
it is right now?

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And then we get this little
glimmer, this little insight

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.870 align:middle line:90%
that is like, wait a second.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.010 align:middle line:84%
I can make different decisions
about my food and feel better?

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.620 align:middle line:84%
I can do this weird
tapping thing and release

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.300 align:middle line:90%
decades of trauma?

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.990 align:middle line:84%
I can, underneath it
all, take the power back.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And that is what got me
so excited about tapping.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.530 align:middle line:84%
So I started using it
with friends and family.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.540 align:middle line:84%
The running joke
at the time was,

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.753 align:middle line:84%
don't say anything
is wrong around Nick.

00:04:57.753 --> 00:04:59.920 align:middle line:84%
Because if you came to me,
James, and you were like,

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.410 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm so anxious,
I'm so angry, I'd say,

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.810 align:middle line:84%
hey, you got to try this
weird tapping thing.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.490 align:middle line:90%
And we would do it together.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.070 align:middle line:90%
And you would say, oh, wow.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm not anxious.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:10.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm not angry.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.760 align:middle line:90%
The pain is gone.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.100 align:middle line:84%
I remember one of my
early experiences,

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.020 align:middle line:90%
I was driving to a Yankees game.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.130 align:middle line:90%
So I live in Connecticut.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.400 align:middle line:90%
The Yankees are in New York.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.130 align:middle line:84%
It's about an hour
and a half drive.

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm going with my friend Pete.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.710 align:middle line:84%
He had hurt his shoulder playing
football in the backyard.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.735 align:middle line:84%
So he is complaining
and we're driving.

00:05:28.735 --> 00:05:29.860 align:middle line:90%
He's like, oh, my shoulder.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.650 align:middle line:84%
This is just
bothering me so much.

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.330 align:middle line:84%
Don't say anything
is wrong around Nick,

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:35.530 align:middle line:84%
because he's going
to make you tap.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.270 align:middle line:84%
So we're in the car
and I'm taking him

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.978 align:middle line:84%
through the points
when we're in traffic.

00:05:38.978 --> 00:05:40.040 align:middle line:90%
And he's doing it.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.170 align:middle line:84%
He thinks it's silly,
but he is indulging me.

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough,
the pain is gone.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.260 align:middle line:84%
It was experience after
experience after experience

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.160 align:middle line:84%
where people said, this
issue that I had is gone,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.510 align:middle line:84%
pain, anxiety, anger, all these
things that I saw results on.

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.260 align:middle line:84%
So with that passion,
with that inspiration,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.480 align:middle line:84%
I decided to make a
film about tapping.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.745 align:middle line:84%
Now I think we were
in similar boats.

00:06:04.745 --> 00:06:07.120 align:middle line:84%
People always say, oh, were
you in film school, did you--

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.920 align:middle line:90%
no, no, no.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.070 align:middle line:84%
I had no filmmaking
experience, no equipment.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.190 align:middle line:84%
I put $40,000 worth of
equipment on my credit card

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:15.300 align:middle line:90%
and credit lines.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.090 align:middle line:84%
I enlisted my younger sister,
Jessica, my best friend,

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.700 align:middle line:84%
Nick Polizzi, who is
also in this series.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.340 align:middle line:84%
And we set off to
make this film.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.310 align:middle line:84%
I remember so clearly
opening up these boxes

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.160 align:middle line:84%
in my 600-square foot
apartment and we're going,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.540 align:middle line:90%
is this a light?

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.640 align:middle line:90%
I think this is a light stand.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.310 align:middle line:84%
But the passion was there
to share this journey.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And in 2007 through 2008, we
spent a year making this film,

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.410 align:middle line:84%
basically interviewing
experts from around the world,

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.420 align:middle line:84%
using the technique,
showing them,

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.800 align:middle line:84%
having them answer the
questions about that technique.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.770 align:middle line:84%
And then we had 10
participants come together

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.520 align:middle line:84%
to actually prove it, to
show, hey, this thing works

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.610 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to show
you before, during,

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:56.610 align:middle line:90%
and after footage of it.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.120 align:middle line:84%
So that was the genesis
of the last decade.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:06:59.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.500 align:middle line:90%
That's an awesome story.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I mean,
Nicholas Polizzi's

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.330 align:middle line:84%
shared with us a little
bit of his reflections

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.100 align:middle line:84%
of that moment in time as well,
just this passion to share.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.820 align:middle line:84%
But having to find a way to make
it happen, I think, is awesome.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And I want to get
more into what is EFT?

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:16.410 align:middle line:90%
What is tapping?

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Because you're throwing
around these acronyms.

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:19.590 align:middle line:84%
People might not
know what it means.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.560 align:middle line:84%
But before we do, you started
to set something up before.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.030 align:middle line:90%
It was around belief systems.

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:27.540 align:middle line:84%
We have beliefs about
our life and the world.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.070 align:middle line:90%
And they could be true.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.150 align:middle line:90%
They could be false.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.540 align:middle line:84%
They could be holding us
back from healing or success.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.610 align:middle line:84%
How does our
culture condition us

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.620 align:middle line:90%
to believe in certain things?

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And why do you think we have
such a travesty of limiting

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.280 align:middle line:84%
beliefs clouding so
many people's lives,

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.830 align:middle line:84%
and even people might not
know that they have them?

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:48.160 align:middle line:90%
How have we got to this point?

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's break down
these concepts of belief.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.720 align:middle line:84%
So we throw the words
around, limiting beliefs

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.230 align:middle line:84%
within this community, within
self help, development.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:59.370 align:middle line:90%
Here's the thing.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.745 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows that they have
limiting beliefs just walking

00:08:01.745 --> 00:08:02.545 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:08:02.545 --> 00:08:03.490 align:middle line:90%
It takes exploration.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.700 align:middle line:84%
You have to stop and
you have to go, OK,

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.380 align:middle line:84%
what do I believe to be
true about the world?

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:11.620 align:middle line:84%
The majority of the population
believes that their beliefs

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:12.420 align:middle line:90%
are true, right?

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:13.740 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of the logical--

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:16.680 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't believe it if I
didn't think it was true.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.002 align:middle line:90%
So step one is to--

00:08:18.002 --> 00:08:20.460 align:middle line:84%
and just the fact that we're
having this conversation, just

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:23.980 align:middle line:84%
the fact that people watching
are starting to think,

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.300 align:middle line:84%
are there things that I
think on a daily basis that

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.280 align:middle line:90%
may not be true?

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.360 align:middle line:90%
What could these be?

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.810 align:middle line:90%
Beliefs about ourselves.

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:33.210 align:middle line:90%
So you'll hear things.

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:37.110 align:middle line:84%
A common one is something
like, I am a procrastinator.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:38.640 align:middle line:90%
So you're watching at home.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.080 align:middle line:90%
Are you a procrastinator?

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Probably 70% to 80%
of the population

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.170 align:middle line:84%
if not more will say, yes,
I am a procrastinator.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:47.440 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.970 align:middle line:84%
It means that they've had
situations in their lives

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:53.070 align:middle line:84%
where they put off
doing something.

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:54.540 align:middle line:84%
Then they heard
from other people

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:57.210 align:middle line:84%
or they maybe saw other
people doing things.

00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:00.120 align:middle line:84%
They compared themselves
to those other people.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.210 align:middle line:84%
They decided, well, since
that person on social media

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:06.030 align:middle line:84%
seems to get all this done or
write books or do this or do

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:09.270 align:middle line:84%
that and I am struggling
to write this book

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:12.960 align:middle line:84%
or do this thing, that must
mean I am a procrastinator.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.330 align:middle line:84%
Now some of these things
happen when we're 10 years old.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Some of them happened
a year ago, right?

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:19.920 align:middle line:84%
Most of are younger
belief systems.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.290 align:middle line:84%
So now you decide,
I'm a procrastinator.

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:23.800 align:middle line:90%
And why does that matter?

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.130 align:middle line:84%
It matters because when
we have these beliefs,

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:29.010 align:middle line:84%
we reinforce them
with our actions.

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:29.970 align:middle line:90%
We give up so easily.

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:31.650 align:middle line:84%
We go, well, I'm
a procrastinator.

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:35.490 align:middle line:84%
We beat ourselves up, talk
about negative emotions,

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:38.670 align:middle line:84%
feeling I'm less than, I'm
not good enough, right?

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:41.070 align:middle line:84%
So we stack them on
top of each other.

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:43.230 align:middle line:84%
They reinforce themselves
as we keep thinking them

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:44.347 align:middle line:90%
over and over again.

00:09:44.347 --> 00:09:45.180 align:middle line:90%
And then guess what?

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.800 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you procrastinate
because this

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.070 align:middle line:90%
is who you believe you are.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:52.620 align:middle line:84%
Another example that a lot
of people resonate with,

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:56.233 align:middle line:84%
some people will say, fear
of public speaking, right?

00:09:56.233 --> 00:09:57.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm not scared of
public speaking.

00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:59.270 align:middle line:90%
We're doing it right now.

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.240 align:middle line:84%
If I went up on stage, there
could be 10,000 people.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.220 align:middle line:90%
I am comfortable with them.

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm not scared of tomatoes
being thrown at me.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:12.390 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing dangerous
in that situation to me.

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.075 align:middle line:84%
For whatever belief
systems happen,

00:10:14.075 --> 00:10:15.450 align:middle line:84%
for whatever
happened growing up,

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:16.958 align:middle line:84%
for the positive
experiences that I

00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.500 align:middle line:84%
had doing something like this
and going, hey, that was great.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.667 align:middle line:90%
Nobody threw tomatoes at me.

00:10:20.667 --> 00:10:22.500 align:middle line:90%
I guess it's not dangerous.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:26.220 align:middle line:84%
Now we think about Susie
who, in fifth grade,

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.740 align:middle line:84%
got up in front of the
class and had to read.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:32.743 align:middle line:84%
And Susie's reading out loud
and she stumbles on a word.

00:10:32.743 --> 00:10:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And the whole class
laughs 'cause,

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.230 align:middle line:84%
hey, they're fifth graders and
Susie said that word funny.

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And the teacher
giggles a little bit.

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And think about that
moment because it's

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:43.980 align:middle line:84%
these moments in
our lives, sometimes

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:47.302 align:middle line:84%
big-- and we'll talk about big
trauma, but oftentimes small.

00:10:47.302 --> 00:10:49.260 align:middle line:84%
It's these moments in
our lives that define us.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:53.100 align:middle line:84%
So Susie goes, well, that is
not a comfortable situation

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.630 align:middle line:84%
to have all my
friends laugh at me,

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.370 align:middle line:90%
to have the teacher snicker.

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:58.740 align:middle line:84%
My body is now in
this moment feeling

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:02.160 align:middle line:84%
judged, feeling embarrassed,
going into fight or flight

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:07.500 align:middle line:84%
response or going to freeze
response, feeling in danger.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.078 align:middle line:84%
And underneath everything
we're doing we're tapping,

00:11:10.078 --> 00:11:12.120 align:middle line:84%
underneath everything
we're doing with self-help,

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.700 align:middle line:84%
doesn't matter what avenue,
whether you're meditating,

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.320 align:middle line:84%
whatever you're
doing, underneath it

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.680 align:middle line:84%
all, that stress response,
that fight, flight,

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.340 align:middle line:84%
or freeze response, that
part of the brain that goes,

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:26.255 align:middle line:84%
this situation right
here isn't safe.

00:11:26.255 --> 00:11:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And guess what
happens from that?

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Susie is embarrassed
and she decides, well,

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:33.060 align:middle line:90%
that was a horrible experience.

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.467 align:middle line:90%
I'm never doing that again.

00:11:34.467 --> 00:11:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And now let's think
about the reinforcement.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.420 align:middle line:84%
So two years later she's
gotta give a presentation

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:40.590 align:middle line:90%
in front of the class.

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:43.050 align:middle line:84%
Three months before she
knows she has to give it,

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:45.390 align:middle line:84%
she spends three months
sweating, three months being

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:47.730 align:middle line:84%
miserable, three months
going through it in her mind

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:51.500 align:middle line:84%
and going, well, last
time I got laughed at.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And her brain is
pattering again and again,

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:56.100 align:middle line:84%
danger, danger, danger,
danger, danger, danger.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:57.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm not good at this.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a good public speaker.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:00.840 align:middle line:90%
She's overwhelmed.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:01.310 align:middle line:90%
She stressed.

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Even when she's trying to
prepare, she's nervous.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:03.500 align:middle line:90%
So guess what?

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.708 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't do as good of
a job preparing because she

00:12:05.708 --> 00:12:07.220 align:middle line:90%
can't even think straight.

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:10.130 align:middle line:84%
She's being chased by
a lion in that moment.

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Her fight or flight
response is up.

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:14.320 align:middle line:90%
So that fateful day comes.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.240 align:middle line:84%
Poor Susie did not sleep well
the night before or for three

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.290 align:middle line:90%
months before.

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:19.730 align:middle line:84%
She gets up in
front of the class.

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:22.070 align:middle line:84%
Oh my gosh, here it is,
the situation again.

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:24.650 align:middle line:84%
What I faced before, everything
that I've been dreading.

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:25.460 align:middle line:90%
She's sweating.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:26.470 align:middle line:90%
Her palms are sweaty.

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:29.130 align:middle line:90%
Her stomach is rumbling.

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:30.490 align:middle line:90%
She fails again.

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:31.290 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:32.920 align:middle line:90%
Because she's panicked.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:33.720 align:middle line:90%
She's fearful.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.533 align:middle line:90%
She can't express her words.

00:12:36.533 --> 00:12:38.200 align:middle line:84%
When we are in fight
or flight response,

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.440 align:middle line:84%
the blood flows away from our
brain into our arms and legs.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.700 align:middle line:84%
We are literally being
chased by a tiger.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.020 align:middle line:90%
We have the resources to fight.

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.520 align:middle line:84%
She can probably punch
someone pretty hard

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:48.510 align:middle line:90%
or she could freeze.

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:51.330 align:middle line:84%
But she doesn't have
the mental faculty

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:52.608 align:middle line:90%
to give that presentation.

00:12:52.608 --> 00:12:54.150 align:middle line:84%
So now this is
experience number two.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't take much more
than that for Susie to decide,

00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:59.760 align:middle line:90%
she's not a good public speaker.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.430 align:middle line:84%
She's never getting up
in front of anyone again.

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And then she makes life
decision after life decision

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:09.990 align:middle line:84%
after life decision that
reinforces that fear.

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Susie might've been a
great public speaker.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.090 align:middle line:84%
She might have insights and
creativity and wisdom within.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:17.100 align:middle line:84%
She might read and be
inspired and want to talk.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.070 align:middle line:84%
But her brain decided,
this isn't safe,

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:23.250 align:middle line:84%
and kept her in that
box, kept her stuck.

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And this, I mean,
public speaking

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.470 align:middle line:84%
is one that, it's not just
about a stage of 5,000 people.

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:31.050 align:middle line:84%
Look, at work, you've got to
give a presentation to even

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:32.820 align:middle line:90%
your three colleagues.

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Susie is a great
whatever she is,

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:37.110 align:middle line:84%
and she's got to give
a presentation to three

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:39.510 align:middle line:84%
colleagues and she
can't express her ideas,

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:40.980 align:middle line:84%
not because they're
not in there,

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:43.397 align:middle line:84%
not because she doesn't have
that insight and that wisdom,

00:13:43.397 --> 00:13:46.350 align:middle line:84%
that creativity, but
because in that moment,

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:51.390 align:middle line:84%
her body, her brain, her spirit
has decided, it's not safe.

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And that is where I see
so many dreams dashed,

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:59.070 align:middle line:84%
so many opportunities, so
much goodness within people

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:03.270 align:middle line:84%
that gets stuck and gets trapped
from those limiting beliefs.

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:04.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Powerful stuff.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And to think that
this is something

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.580 align:middle line:84%
that we have taught
ourselves to believe,

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.510 align:middle line:84%
whether or not it
is true, right?

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:13.980 align:middle line:84%
This is the big misnomer is
that, it might not actually

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:14.790 align:middle line:90%
be true.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:16.165 align:middle line:84%
>> It might not
actually be true.

00:14:16.165 --> 00:14:18.360 align:middle line:84%
But you have an
experience young enough,

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.100 align:middle line:90%
you set up that conditioning.

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look, if I had a
terrible interview right now

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.810 align:middle line:84%
or this was the first time
you'd done an interview

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:28.050 align:middle line:84%
and you stumbled over the
first three questions,

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:31.140 align:middle line:84%
you might decide, I don't
like doing this, right?

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:32.550 align:middle line:84%
So here's where
tapping comes in.

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:34.830 align:middle line:84%
Here's where whatever
it is that you

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:38.320 align:middle line:84%
can do to look at your
life, to look around and go,

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.480 align:middle line:90%
what is holding me back?

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.152 align:middle line:84%
Because you always
hear like, oh, there's

00:14:42.152 --> 00:14:44.110 align:middle line:84%
greatness within you,
from motivational people.

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:46.960 align:middle line:84%
I truly believe that there's
greatness within everybody.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.220 align:middle line:84%
I believe that there are
faculties that are untapped,

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:51.900 align:middle line:90%
no pun intended.

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:55.390 align:middle line:84%
That are untapped, that
are pushed down by society,

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:57.540 align:middle line:84%
by the people around us,
by the things that we

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:00.580 align:middle line:84%
create for ourselves
by our experiences.

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:01.900 align:middle line:90%
So this is what Susie can do.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And she can do it when
she's in fifth grade.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.100 align:middle line:84%
This is why tapping
is great for kids.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.642 align:middle line:84%
If we can start it
there, we can save

00:15:06.642 --> 00:15:08.630 align:middle line:90%
a lot of suffering for her.

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:10.497 align:middle line:84%
Or she can do it when
she's 50 years old.

00:15:10.497 --> 00:15:12.330 align:middle line:84%
She can go back to that
moment, because when

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:15.030 align:middle line:84%
I ask you about a traumatic
experience or anyone else

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:17.700 align:middle line:84%
at home, a fear that
they have, if I just say,

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:18.780 align:middle line:90%
OK, close your eyes.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.100 align:middle line:90%
Let's think about fear flying.

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.840 align:middle line:84%
We're just talking about
being on planes, right?

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.007 align:middle line:84%
So if I said, if you're
scared of flying and I said,

00:15:24.007 --> 00:15:27.180 align:middle line:84%
close your eyes, think about
being on a plane, that's all

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:30.360 align:middle line:84%
it takes to all of a sudden,
back to those sweaty palms.

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.057 align:middle line:84%
Back to that rumbling
in the stomach.

00:15:32.057 --> 00:15:33.390 align:middle line:90%
What's happening in that moment?

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Why is someone afraid of
flying and someone else isn't?

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:38.220 align:middle line:90%
There's conditioning.

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.480 align:middle line:84%
The brain has said,
this is not safe,

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:44.160 align:middle line:84%
whether it be a control issue
or a bad flight that happened,

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.380 align:middle line:90%
we've conditioned ourselves.

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:47.340 align:middle line:84%
So if you close your
eyes and you go,

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:51.060 align:middle line:84%
OK, let me think about this
fear, we activate the amygdala.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:53.940 align:middle line:84%
The brain starts
running that process.

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.020 align:middle line:90%
And we do this tapping.

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.600 align:middle line:84%
We call it tapping
because we are literally

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.990 align:middle line:84%
physically tapping on these
end points of meridians

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:02.130 align:middle line:90%
of our body.

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And what the latest research
has shown is that when we do so,

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:07.900 align:middle line:84%
we send a calming
signal to the amygdala.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And we tell the body, we tell
the brain that it's safe.

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's that interrupting
of that signal,

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:15.840 align:middle line:84%
it's that calming
signal that then

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.360 align:middle line:90%
begins to rewire in the brain--

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.990 align:middle line:84%
flying is safe, public speaking
is safe, speaking my truth

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:23.560 align:middle line:90%
is safe.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.230 align:middle line:84%
We turn off that
anxious response.

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:27.270 align:middle line:90%
We turn off that anger response.

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:31.210 align:middle line:84%
We are, as I said in the
beginning, back in control.

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:34.422 align:middle line:84%
It's what I hear again and again
from people who do tapping.

00:16:34.422 --> 00:16:36.630 align:middle line:84%
First off, they're confused
because they're like, how

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:38.110 align:middle line:90%
did this work so fast, right?

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:41.070 align:middle line:84%
Like I was anxious and
now I'm not anxious.

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:42.820 align:middle line:90%
Then I hear words like hope.

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I have hope that
I can heal again.

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:46.890 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Because that brain,
that fear shut off.

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And then that native spirit
within began to blossom and go,

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.530 align:middle line:90%
OK, wait, there's hope.

00:16:56.530 --> 00:17:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And there's also hope because
people go, I'm in control.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.130 align:middle line:90%
When we look at society--

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:06.180 align:middle line:84%
and look, I love medical doctors
and I love the institutions

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:09.250 align:middle line:84%
that we have that support
us in really positive ways.

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:12.210 align:middle line:84%
There's amazing people doing
great work in those places.

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:16.349 align:middle line:84%
But in a lot of places, all too
often, what those institutions

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:19.140 align:middle line:84%
do is they take power
away from the individual.

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:21.390 align:middle line:84%
So they go, I have
the answer for you.

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:23.819 align:middle line:90%
You must do this to get this.

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And if people don't
get results from it,

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.980 align:middle line:84%
if they get frustrated, if
they try, if they're not

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:30.750 align:middle line:84%
listened to, if
they're not heard,

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:33.120 align:middle line:90%
all that stress builds up on it.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.910 align:middle line:84%
When we do the tapping,
we take that control back.

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
genesis of self-help.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:41.760 align:middle line:84%
That is step one in whatever
you do to transform your life.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:45.360 align:middle line:84%
If you're making a different
food choice, the power in that

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.920 align:middle line:90%
is going, I have a choice.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:51.710 align:middle line:84%
I can pick to have this food
as opposed to that food.

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And that choice that I
made, made me feel better.

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.980 align:middle line:90%
I got a reward for doing that.

00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:00.895 align:middle line:84%
And from that place, that's
when transformation is possible.

00:18:00.895 --> 00:18:02.520 align:middle line:84%
That's when people
start going, OK, I'm

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.060 align:middle line:84%
going to change this about my
life or that about my life.

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:08.580 align:middle line:84%
I am going to change the
identity of who I am.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:12.540 align:middle line:84%
I am a different person
today than I was 15 years ago

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:13.920 align:middle line:90%
when I started tapping.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Because back then,
as I said earlier

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:18.600 align:middle line:84%
about what people
walk around with,

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.760 align:middle line:84%
I just thought the
world happened to me.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.620 align:middle line:90%
Life happened to me, right?

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:26.370 align:middle line:84%
If you're angry, it's because
someone said something

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:29.440 align:middle line:84%
and you deserve to be angry,
or anger is the right response.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.780 align:middle line:90%
That's what we feel, right?

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:32.625 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's ever angry,
at least initially,

00:18:32.625 --> 00:18:34.500 align:middle line:84%
and they're like, well,
I shouldn't be angry.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.720 align:middle line:90%
Anger is like, they said this.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:37.920 align:middle line:90%
I got attacked in some way.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.060 align:middle line:90%
I got offended.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:41.310 align:middle line:84%
My safety, my emotional
safety, so I'm

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:43.310 align:middle line:90%
going to react in that anger.

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:45.840 align:middle line:84%
When you take that power
back and when you say,

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.170 align:middle line:84%
I can let go of that thing
that happened 10 years ago--

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:51.720 align:middle line:84%
and that's what's crazy
about limiting beliefs,

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.240 align:middle line:84%
our lives, our
body, trauma, we're

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.308 align:middle line:84%
not walking around with what
happened this morning only.

00:18:57.308 --> 00:18:59.850 align:middle line:84%
We're walking around with what
happened yesterday and the day

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:03.090 align:middle line:84%
before and really, in the
decades since that have

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:06.040 align:middle line:90%
made us the people who we are.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:06.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Brilliant.

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk to
that for a little bit.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things you're saying,

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:14.130 align:middle line:84%
Nick, is that emotions
and energies in a way,

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:16.870 align:middle line:90%
get stored as a belief system.

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:20.490 align:middle line:84%
Which is interesting because
I think about emotions

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:22.890 align:middle line:84%
in some respect being
stored biochemically

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:24.570 align:middle line:84%
in the body, which
probably can happen.

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:26.300 align:middle line:90%
And we can speak to that.

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:28.170 align:middle line:84%
But then you're
explaining this in a way

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:30.630 align:middle line:84%
where emotions or
experiences get

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:34.290 align:middle line:84%
stored and created and
anchored as a belief system.

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:36.090 align:middle line:10%
How does this
happen when we think

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:38.070 align:middle line:10%
about things that
are a little bit

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:40.350 align:middle line:10%
more traumatic, like
childhood trauma

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:44.850 align:middle line:10%
or physical abuse or mental
abuse or sexual abuse?

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:49.170 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of the times, we
as adults potentially listening

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:52.682 align:middle line:84%
to this, grow up and
then we hit 40, 30, 50,

00:19:52.682 --> 00:19:53.640 align:middle line:90%
whatever it is for you.

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And we have these crises because
there's these experiences

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.300 align:middle line:84%
that we've had as children
come back to haunt us.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And we have to rediscover
that and we go into it

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:06.240 align:middle line:90%
to begin the healing process.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:10.390 align:middle line:84%
How did these traumas and so
forth take root in the body?

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:11.190 align:middle line:90%
And in what way?

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:13.232 align:middle line:84%
Is there a biochemical
component to this as well?

00:20:13.232 --> 00:20:14.032 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:14.032 --> 00:20:16.680 align:middle line:84%
I think we're starting to
get more answers as to what

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.890 align:middle line:90%
happens exactly, biochemically.

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Yes, these emotions--
like, anxiety

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:24.890 align:middle line:90%
has a biochemical component.

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:28.080 align:middle line:84%
Candace Pert in her work,
"Molecules of Emotion,"

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.690 align:middle line:84%
she clearly showed that
the thoughts that you think

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:32.100 align:middle line:90%
affect your body.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.410 align:middle line:84%
The work that you and I have
been doing the last decade

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:38.700 align:middle line:84%
and that I rediscover
for myself every day,

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:41.970 align:middle line:84%
this whole mind body concept,
it's like, whoa, mind body,

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:42.803 align:middle line:90%
it's so new.

00:20:42.803 --> 00:20:44.220 align:middle line:84%
But it's pretty
ridiculous, if you

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.860 align:middle line:84%
think about it, that we have
cut off ourselves at the head.

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And we're like, OK,
there's the head,

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:52.680 align:middle line:84%
the things that we think about
and then there's the body.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Medical doctors
in the last decade

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.880 align:middle line:90%
are starting to recognize--

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:58.880 align:middle line:84%
they probably recognized
before, but they didn't

00:20:58.880 --> 00:20:59.970 align:middle line:90%
know what to do about it.

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:03.750 align:middle line:84%
Now they're really saying,
look, the stress, the anxiety,

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:07.170 align:middle line:84%
the anger, the overwhelmed,
the traumatic experience

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:10.470 align:middle line:84%
are affecting you, are
affecting us biochemically.

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:14.220 align:middle line:84%
There's a very famous study
called The Adverse Child

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.890 align:middle line:90%
Effects Study, the ACE study.

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Massive number of people looking
at what happened in childhood.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And there's an ACE
score, so you can

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:24.547 align:middle line:84%
go through different
traumatic experiences.

00:21:24.547 --> 00:21:25.380 align:middle line:90%
And you add them up.

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And for the people who have the
highest traumatic experience

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.140 align:middle line:90%
the score, they get one score.

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.223 align:middle line:84%
And if not many things
happened in your childhood,

00:21:31.223 --> 00:21:32.260 align:middle line:90%
you get another score.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.460 align:middle line:84%
Now here's what's crazy about
this study in particular.

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's been
repeated since then.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:44.507 align:middle line:84%
Smoking, cancer, addiction,
all these physical things--

00:21:44.507 --> 00:21:46.215 align:middle line:84%
so physical like cancer
and heart disease

00:21:46.215 --> 00:21:49.260 align:middle line:84%
and addiction, and then
habits like smoking

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:53.170 align:middle line:84%
directly correlated with
adverse childhood experiences.

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:55.710 align:middle line:84%
So you think to
yourself, what is cancer?

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Something happened to
you in childhood and now

00:21:58.020 --> 00:21:59.180 align:middle line:90%
you're more likely--

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:01.260 align:middle line:84%
it's not the only
determinate, but you're

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:04.050 align:middle line:84%
more likely to get cancer
statistically because

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:05.710 align:middle line:90%
of these experiences?

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think what's
happening in the body,

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:10.640 align:middle line:84%
when we think about especially
those tough experiences,

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:14.130 align:middle line:84%
the really tough experiences,
that trauma, that abuse,

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:14.970 align:middle line:90%
that five-year-old--

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:16.387 align:middle line:84%
I've got a
four-year-old daughter.

00:22:16.387 --> 00:22:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And I can't imagine her having
an experience that young that

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:27.700 align:middle line:84%
was violent or scary or
overwhelming or abusive,

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:31.420 align:middle line:84%
because I can see how
receptive she is to the world,

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.850 align:middle line:84%
how open she is to
the experiences,

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:36.670 align:middle line:84%
how every single day,
she's downloading

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:39.670 align:middle line:84%
data about the world and
building her life based

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:40.960 align:middle line:90%
on that.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:46.210 align:middle line:84%
We work really hard to create
a nurturing, positive, safe

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:47.470 align:middle line:90%
environment.

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And when you have these
adverse childhood experiences,

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:52.790 align:middle line:90%
the environment is unsafe.

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:54.040 align:middle line:90%
I think about the word safety.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:59.740 align:middle line:84%
I use it a lot in tapping,
even though I don't feel safe.

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.633 align:middle line:84%
And most people don't
think about that.

00:23:01.633 --> 00:23:03.800 align:middle line:84%
They don't walk around
going, do I feel safe or not?

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.580 align:middle line:84%
But if I ask people, especially
who have been traumatized

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:11.392 align:middle line:84%
in deep ways, do you feel safe
in your body, they answer no.

00:23:11.392 --> 00:23:12.850 align:middle line:84%
When they tune in
they go-- and you

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:14.200 align:middle line:90%
can do it at home right now.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:19.720 align:middle line:84%
You can close your eyes and
go, do I feel safe in my body?

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And what that's going
to open you up to is,

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:26.750 align:middle line:84%
what are the parts of you
that have been running

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:29.510 align:middle line:84%
with that traumatic event,
that have felt anxious,

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:31.580 align:middle line:90%
that have gripped tight?

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:34.130 align:middle line:84%
This is what happens
when trauma is created.

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:36.660 align:middle line:90%
The body goes, ugh.

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And all too often,
it doesn't let go.

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And I tell people, if we think
about that holding on tight,

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:46.180 align:middle line:84%
if I close my fist
right now and I say,

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:49.370 align:middle line:84%
all right, I'm going to
squeeze it for five minutes,

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:52.190 align:middle line:84%
five minutes later, this
is going to start to hurt.

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:53.460 align:middle line:90%
And if I go, you know what?

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:55.168 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to to squeeze
it for two hours,

00:23:55.168 --> 00:23:57.770 align:middle line:84%
now this is getting
uncomfortable.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be really
uncomfortable when I open it.

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:03.230 align:middle line:84%
Now imagine squeezing
like this for a decade.

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:04.130 align:middle line:90%
What would happen?

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:06.213 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I wouldn't be able
to open my hand, right?

00:24:06.213 --> 00:24:07.690 align:middle line:84%
It would probably
get all crippled,

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:11.120 align:middle line:84%
blood flow would be affected,
the growth would be affected.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.920 align:middle line:84%
If this happened
when I was young,

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.470 align:middle line:84%
who knows how the
fingers actually grow?

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:19.143 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they stop growing because
they're stuck in this place.

00:24:19.143 --> 00:24:21.560 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what happens
to us emotionally when we have

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:22.727 align:middle line:90%
these traumatic experiences.

00:24:22.727 --> 00:24:23.960 align:middle line:90%
We're holding on so tight.

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.838 align:middle line:84%
And we're walking around with
this belief about the world

00:24:26.838 --> 00:24:28.130 align:middle line:90%
that, you got to keep gripping.

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:29.310 align:middle line:90%
You got to stay safe.

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:32.125 align:middle line:84%
You can't be open
and vulnerable.

00:24:32.125 --> 00:24:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And that affects the
rest of our lives.

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:37.460 align:middle line:84%
So then you talked about
finding in our 20s, 30s, 40s

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:40.880 align:middle line:84%
whenever it is, finding that
we've been gripping like this,

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:44.360 align:middle line:84%
it's a little uncomfortable at
the beginning to open that up.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:45.320 align:middle line:90%
It can feel unsafe.

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.090 align:middle line:84%
It can be painful
to go, I don't want

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:50.810 align:middle line:84%
to look there, which is
why it's great to have

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:53.570 align:middle line:84%
every tool at your
disposal, tapping,

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:55.480 align:middle line:84%
the right practitioner,
the right therapist,

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:58.670 align:middle line:84%
especially if it's that
deep traumatic stuff, all

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:01.550 align:middle line:84%
these new tools and techniques
to begin to unfold that,

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:05.270 align:middle line:84%
to begin to open up that
hand, to allow the body

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:07.400 align:middle line:90%
to feel that it's safe.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.600 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:13.767 align:middle line:84%
And that process begins with
recognizing that maybe there

00:25:13.767 --> 00:25:16.100 align:middle line:84%
is something that I'm holding
on to that I shouldn't be,

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.990 align:middle line:90%
or that's holding me back.

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:20.760 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk to tapping
specifically for a little bit

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:21.560 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.630 align:middle line:84%
So emotional freedom
technique, tapping,

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:25.860 align:middle line:90%
these get used interchangeably.

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:29.820 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, take me through
what it is, how it works,

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.630 align:middle line:84%
and how we took or
how this methodology

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:34.590 align:middle line:84%
took an ancient idea
and made it modern?

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:35.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:39.920 align:middle line:84%
So tapping as a process
that we know now,

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:43.790 align:middle line:84%
was discovered right around
1980 by a psychologist

00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:45.350 align:middle line:90%
called Roger Callahan.

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And Roger was a
traditional therapist

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:51.140 align:middle line:84%
working with clients
in his home office.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And he had a really
unique experience

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.010 align:middle line:84%
that was sort of like a
Eureka, light bulb moment.

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:57.980 align:middle line:84%
So Roger had a client
by name of Mary.

00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And she had a
severe water phobia.

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:03.130 align:middle line:84%
You know, think about fear
flying and phobias before.

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:04.310 align:middle line:90%
So what happened?

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:08.510 align:middle line:84%
Mary had some sort of experience
that said, water is dangerous.

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:10.160 align:middle line:84%
Now this was an
out and out phobia.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.230 align:middle line:84%
So not just swimming
or the ocean.

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:14.270 align:middle line:84%
It was drinking
water, showers, it

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:18.140 align:middle line:84%
was just like full on
panic attack, sweating.

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:21.260 align:middle line:84%
So imagine walking around
every day with a water phobia.

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.570 align:middle line:84%
It's not the
easiest thing to do.

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And she had been working with
Dr. Callahan for about a year.

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.710 align:middle line:84%
He was doing traditional
therapy methods.

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:31.520 align:middle line:90%
So he would do exposure therapy.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:34.260 align:middle line:90%
Hey, let's look at the pool.

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:36.290 align:middle line:84%
What do you feel
when you look at it?

00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:38.520 align:middle line:84%
Try to relax as you
look at the pool.

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:41.725 align:middle line:84%
Try to desensitize the
body to that experience.

00:26:41.725 --> 00:26:43.350 align:middle line:84%
She found the whole
thing so stressful.

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:45.325 align:middle line:84%
Just looking at the pool,
she'd get migraines.

00:26:45.325 --> 00:26:47.200 align:middle line:84%
It was like, everything
was just not working.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And as any good therapist
or psychologist would feel,

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:52.920 align:middle line:90%
he was frustrated.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.378 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you want
to help people.

00:26:54.378 --> 00:26:55.430 align:middle line:90%
That's why you're there.

00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:58.320 align:middle line:84%
So and he had an
experience where Mary

00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.490 align:middle line:90%
came one day for a session.

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you know,
when I look at the pool,

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:04.300 align:middle line:84%
I just get butterflies
in my stomach.

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And he'd been reading
about the Chinese meridian

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:09.300 align:middle line:84%
system in the body and the fact
that the stomach meridian ends

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:10.680 align:middle line:90%
underneath the eye.

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And that you can tap
to activate meridians.

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.730 align:middle line:84%
So on a whim in that
moment, he said,

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:17.090 align:middle line:90%
try tapping underneath your eye.

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:19.740 align:middle line:84%
So she did so for 30
seconds or a minute

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:23.230 align:middle line:84%
and looked at the water
and the phobia was gone.

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:24.287 align:middle line:90%
She was blown away.

00:27:24.287 --> 00:27:25.370 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he was blown away.

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:27.370 align:middle line:84%
Like, what happened
in that moment?

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:30.880 align:middle line:84%
How could decades of
this fear and anxiety,

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:33.340 align:middle line:84%
something happened
to calm that amygdala

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:36.297 align:middle line:84%
to tell the body that it was
safe, potentially something

00:27:36.297 --> 00:27:38.630 align:middle line:84%
with the meridian system that
we're learning more about,

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:41.540 align:middle line:84%
but we don't have the concrete
data that we need for that.

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:44.170 align:middle line:84%
But something happened
in that moment

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:46.120 align:middle line:90%
that calmed that water phobia.

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And so you can imagine,
he was excited.

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:51.160 align:middle line:84%
He started looking at the
different meridians of the body

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:52.840 align:middle line:84%
and developed a
process called TFT,

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.430 align:middle line:90%
which is thought field therapy.

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:57.940 align:middle line:84%
It's still around today and
practiced by a lot of people.

00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And what TFT does, for different
emotions and different things

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:05.290 align:middle line:84%
you have going on, you have a
different sequence of tapping.

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Gary Craig was one of
Roger Callahan's students.

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And he took the TFT process
and said, this is great.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:15.260 align:middle line:84%
But it's hard to remember, hard
to implement, hard to execute.

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.950 align:middle line:84%
So let's just tap
through all the points,

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:19.900 align:middle line:90%
same points every single time.

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:22.495 align:middle line:84%
Had a couple innovations,
codified the system,

00:28:22.495 --> 00:28:23.870 align:middle line:84%
and then put it
out in the world.

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
learned personally.

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:28.120 align:middle line:84%
That's a version of
what I use today.

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:31.480 align:middle line:84%
EFT is sort of-- if we think
of EFT as a specific technique

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:34.180 align:middle line:84%
and tapping as the
general process.

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:37.400 align:middle line:84%
So like meditation, there's
vipassana meditation

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:38.920 align:middle line:84%
and then there's
general meditation.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.628 align:middle line:84%
And there's guided
meditation and there's

00:28:40.628 --> 00:28:41.712 align:middle line:90%
this, that, and the other.

00:28:41.712 --> 00:28:43.390 align:middle line:84%
So tapping, you'll
find practitioners

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:45.910 align:middle line:84%
doing different forms of it,
different approaches, sometimes

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:46.710 align:middle line:90%
different points.

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:47.890 align:middle line:90%
That's the general thing.

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:50.680 align:middle line:90%
EFT is the specific thing.

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:55.420 align:middle line:84%
For the last-- so now we're
in 2019, which is crazy.

00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:57.190 align:middle line:84%
So since 1980, this
technique's been

00:28:57.190 --> 00:29:00.190 align:middle line:84%
out there growing steadily,
being shared steadily,

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:02.080 align:middle line:84%
being used by
therapists and doctors

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:04.240 align:middle line:84%
and psychologists
when they saw results.

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And more than anything, being
used by individual people who

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:07.930 align:middle line:90%
say, oh, wow.

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:10.297 align:middle line:84%
I can use this to
change my life.

00:29:10.297 --> 00:29:12.130 align:middle line:84%
Which really happened
in the last five years

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:14.110 align:middle line:84%
or so, which I'm
very excited about,

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:16.180 align:middle line:84%
is the research is
starting to come in.

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:19.047 align:middle line:84%
Now it's always like,
why does it take so long?

00:29:19.047 --> 00:29:21.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could talk
about funding and the money

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:22.150 align:middle line:90%
available.

00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:24.850 align:middle line:84%
But like meditation is
the newest hottest thing

00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:25.870 align:middle line:90%
in the last decade.

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:27.958 align:middle line:84%
And it's obviously been
around for a long time.

00:29:27.958 --> 00:29:29.500 align:middle line:84%
So a time and a
place for everything.

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:32.890 align:middle line:84%
But at this point, there's over
100 different research studies

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:36.490 align:middle line:84%
on EFT, more growing every
single day on everything

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:41.577 align:middle line:84%
from anxiety to PTSD,
studies with veterans.

00:29:41.577 --> 00:29:43.660 align:middle line:84%
We at The Tapping Solution
have done a lot of work

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:45.670 align:middle line:84%
with veterans and
supporting that work.

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And there's been research
showing that people coming back

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:50.830 align:middle line:84%
from war, people
affected with PTSD

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:53.830 align:middle line:84%
can do the tapping process,
preferably with a trained

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:58.020 align:middle line:84%
practitioner when it's the more
difficult things, to change

00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:00.760 align:middle line:84%
that PTSD, to turn off
that fight or flight,

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:04.290 align:middle line:84%
and to bring the body back
in a state of balance.

00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think that there
is less research in it

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:10.070 align:middle line:84%
because it's a drug-less
approach, right?

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, look, I mean, we've
made it a commitment to fund

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:16.440 align:middle line:84%
research the last
couple of years.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And we raised the money
through our foundation

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:19.960 align:middle line:90%
for research and donate.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.355 align:middle line:90%
And it's very expensive.

00:30:22.355 --> 00:30:23.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a
drop in the bucket

00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:27.380 align:middle line:84%
when we look at, oh, let's
do this study for $100,000.

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:30.207 align:middle line:84%
That for a drug company or
someone with deep pockets,

00:30:30.207 --> 00:30:31.290 align:middle line:90%
it's like, yeah, $100,000.

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:34.160 align:middle line:90%
They do $5 million studies.

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:37.620 align:middle line:84%
I am convinced that if we
had even just a $10 million

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:40.290 align:middle line:84%
budget, which is
nothing, we could

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:43.440 align:middle line:84%
have extensive research all over
the place and get that quickly.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.820 align:middle line:90%
So it's slow going.

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:46.600 align:middle line:84%
We're slogging, but
we're getting there.

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:49.017 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're going to
start seeing some breakthroughs

00:30:49.017 --> 00:30:53.020 align:middle line:84%
as we have more data to be able
to take it to the next level.

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.603 align:middle line:84%
>> So EFT, you mentioned it, but
you didn't say what it stands

00:30:55.603 --> 00:30:56.403 align:middle line:90%
for.

00:30:56.403 --> 00:30:57.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:59.010 align:middle line:90%
Emotional freedom techniques.

00:30:59.010 --> 00:30:59.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Got it.

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:00.390 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:00.990 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:02.407 align:middle line:84%
I just needed to
hear it from you.

00:31:02.407 --> 00:31:03.870 align:middle line:90%
>> 100%.

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's talk a little
bit about these meridians,

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:09.520 align:middle line:84%
if we can, stay on this
for a little bit longer.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:13.260 align:middle line:84%
So these meridians are different
points in the body, right?

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:17.070 align:middle line:84%
There's a brow meridian that's
under the eye that's here.

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:19.400 align:middle line:90%
And what do they relate to?

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.660 align:middle line:84%
And are these just
all, like, let's

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:24.330 align:middle line:84%
just hit them all, the major
ones so that hopefully we

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:25.870 align:middle line:90%
can stumble across--

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:27.403 align:middle line:90%
>> You've got it.

00:31:27.403 --> 00:31:29.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's some
people who are experts

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:31.710 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not one of them
on, oh, well, this meridian

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:36.340 align:middle line:84%
is tied to the spleen, and this
in Chinese medicine and this,

00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:37.140 align:middle line:90%
that, the other.

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:38.128 align:middle line:90%
I'm a simple guy.

00:31:38.128 --> 00:31:39.420 align:middle line:90%
And this is why I love tapping.

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:41.100 align:middle line:90%
It's like, hit all these points.

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:42.060 align:middle line:90%
There's extra points.

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:44.280 align:middle line:84%
So there's a point on the
back of the hand, which

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.867 align:middle line:84%
is called the nine
gamut point, which

00:31:45.867 --> 00:31:46.950 align:middle line:90%
some people will bring in.

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:48.410 align:middle line:90%
Some people do wrist points.

00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:50.160 align:middle line:84%
So there's things that
you can play around

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.435 align:middle line:90%
with if you feel stuck.

00:31:51.435 --> 00:31:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's where a good
practitioner can say,

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:55.470 align:middle line:84%
hey, let's explore
a little deeper.

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:57.480 align:middle line:84%
But to me, what's so
exciting about tapping

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.700 align:middle line:90%
is that you can just do it.

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:02.460 align:middle line:90%
The basics are so easy to learn.

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:03.750 align:middle line:90%
Teach your kids.

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:06.300 align:middle line:84%
You can show it to a loved
one and have an experience.

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:10.982 align:middle line:84%
And for 99% of the people, just
the basic points are great.

00:32:10.982 --> 00:32:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>> So can you take us
through the points?

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, absolutely.

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:15.210 align:middle line:90%
>> So there's here.

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So we always start
at the side of the hand.

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And why don't I take
you through a process

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:22.530 align:middle line:84%
so we know what we're doing
while we're tapping, yeah?

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:24.840 align:middle line:84%
>> And can we speak while we
go through a process here?

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:25.770 align:middle line:90%
I think it's OK to go here now.

00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:26.570 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:30.000 align:middle line:84%
But let's speak about, why do we
have to bring up the negative?

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:30.910 align:middle line:90%
Come on, Nick.

00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:31.710 align:middle line:90%
Seriously.

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>> It's supposed to be
positive and positive thinking.

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:34.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And then the first
thing, like when I first

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:38.353 align:middle line:84%
learned tapping from you,
it's like, even though I

00:32:38.353 --> 00:32:40.990 align:middle line:84%
feel this horrible experience,
I accept myself completely right

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:41.790 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, but I don't
want to feel the experience.

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:45.570 align:middle line:84%
Why do you make me
bring it up again?

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:47.910 align:middle line:84%
So can you explain why
it's important that people

00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:49.050 align:middle line:90%
have to bring that up?

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And what sort of
language in particular

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:54.480 align:middle line:84%
can people use in order to
create maybe a little mini

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:57.570 align:middle line:84%
script of their own, like in
terms of the semantics of it?

00:32:57.570 --> 00:32:58.620 align:middle line:90%
>> 100%, 100%.

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:01.380 align:middle line:84%
So let's speak to that
negative thing first.

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:02.330 align:middle line:90%
So there's two--

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:03.913 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give
you two sides of it.

00:33:03.913 --> 00:33:06.515 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give you
the brain side and then

00:33:06.515 --> 00:33:07.640 align:middle line:90%
a different little thought.

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.990 align:middle line:84%
So I sat down a couple of years
ago with my dear friend Louise

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:11.790 align:middle line:90%
Hay.

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And many of our viewers
will know that she's

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:15.330 align:middle line:90%
the founder of Hay House.

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:18.810 align:middle line:84%
She sadly passed
away two years ago.

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:20.400 align:middle line:84%
Lived an incredible
life, founded

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.380 align:middle line:84%
this incredible
publishing company

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:24.870 align:middle line:84%
that is still
going strong today,

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:26.190 align:middle line:90%
change lives around the world.

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And she was known and is known
as the queen of affirmations.

00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:33.060 align:middle line:84%
She is about positive thinking,
like saying affirmations,

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:34.050 align:middle line:90%
look in the mirror.

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And we were tapping
together on camera

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:37.650 align:middle line:84%
and I had tapped
with her privately

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:39.150 align:middle line:84%
and she got really
into the process.

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Louise, you've got
to answer this question for me.

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:43.770 align:middle line:90%
I want to hear your answer.

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:44.730 align:middle line:90%
What are we doing?

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:45.530 align:middle line:90%
Well, you just asked me.

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:47.655 align:middle line:84%
What are we doing saying
all these negative things?

00:33:47.655 --> 00:33:48.630 align:middle line:90%
Why are you doing this?

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:50.473 align:middle line:84%
You're the queen
of affirmations.

00:33:50.473 --> 00:33:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And she said something that I
think about almost every day

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:54.140 align:middle line:90%
when we're doing this process.

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:55.410 align:middle line:90%
And it's about our lives.

00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:59.370 align:middle line:84%
She said, honey, if you
want to clean a house,

00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:02.180 align:middle line:90%
you have to see the dirt.

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:06.970 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, wow, so simple.

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:08.520 align:middle line:90%
We're in a room now.

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:10.020 align:middle line:84%
I could take all
the dirt and put it

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:11.687 align:middle line:84%
underneath all the
carpet, which is what

00:34:11.687 --> 00:34:13.719 align:middle line:90%
most people do in their lives.

00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:17.489 align:middle line:84%
Or I could look around and
go, things are dirty, right?

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:19.590 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's uncomfortable,
maybe it's some work,

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:21.750 align:middle line:90%
but it's time to clean it.

00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:25.050 align:middle line:84%
So that is, to me, the
emotional, spiritual component,

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:28.110 align:middle line:84%
the thing that makes sense
to me as why we're doing it.

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:29.610 align:middle line:84%
From the brain
science side of it,

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:32.610 align:middle line:84%
from the practical
standpoint on tapping,

00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:34.380 align:middle line:84%
the reason we do
it-- so I mentioned

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:36.900 align:middle line:90%
fear of flying earlier, right?

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:40.320 align:middle line:84%
The reason that you don't
just say, I'm a happy flier

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:42.308 align:middle line:84%
and I love flying and
do all these things

00:34:42.308 --> 00:34:44.100 align:middle line:84%
when you do the tapping,
there's two parts.

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:47.897 align:middle line:84%
A, the brain is going
to go, no you're not.

00:34:47.897 --> 00:34:48.730 align:middle line:90%
Who are you kidding?

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:49.960 align:middle line:90%
You're a terrible flier.

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.870 align:middle line:84%
So for a lot of people,
speaking the positive

00:34:52.870 --> 00:34:55.663 align:middle line:84%
when it doesn't feel true
is really uncomfortable.

00:34:55.663 --> 00:34:57.580 align:middle line:84%
It can be uncomfortable
to speak the negative.

00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:59.963 align:middle line:84%
But the positive can be
just as uncomfortable.

00:34:59.963 --> 00:35:01.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm happy, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:01.930 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:03.080 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not true.

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.060 align:middle line:90%
I hate flying.

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:07.030 align:middle line:84%
This is the truth of how
I feel, blah, blah, blah.

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:09.220 align:middle line:84%
When we speak the
truth, when we say,

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:13.400 align:middle line:84%
I've got a trip coming up in
two weeks and I'm terrified,

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.200 align:middle line:90%
what's happening?

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:15.760 align:middle line:84%
Our brain is thinking
about that terror.

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.100 align:middle line:84%
First off, it's
happening anyway.

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:18.340 align:middle line:84%
So even if you don't
speak it, you're

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:20.025 align:middle line:84%
just kind of deluding
yourself, right?

00:35:20.025 --> 00:35:21.400 align:middle line:84%
So we bring it up
because we want

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:24.520 align:middle line:84%
to fire that amygdala
at the same time

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:25.850 align:middle line:90%
that we're doing the tapping.

00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:29.040 align:middle line:84%
We want to put ourselves
in that situation.

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And we want to do it
slowly and safely.

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:34.340 align:middle line:84%
So if people at home
are dealing with PTSD,

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:36.340 align:middle line:84%
something traumatic
happened, they were involved

00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:39.263 align:middle line:84%
in an incident that even
just thinking about it

00:35:39.263 --> 00:35:41.680 align:middle line:84%
makes them sweat, well, don't
go do it on your own, right?

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:44.320 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to just dive
into the deep end of a pool.

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.903 align:middle line:84%
What we do with tapping, whether
you do it with a practitioner

00:35:46.903 --> 00:35:49.240 align:middle line:84%
or by yourself is, we
take a couple steps in.

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:52.300 align:middle line:84%
We go, even though I'm
anxious about flying,

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:53.950 align:middle line:84%
and we start thinking
about flying,

00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:55.390 align:middle line:84%
we start thinking
about the trip,

00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:58.840 align:middle line:84%
we start firing that amygdala,
we send that calming signal

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:00.633 align:middle line:90%
by doing the tapping.

00:36:00.633 --> 00:36:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And then what
starts happening is,

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:06.060 align:middle line:84%
after a couple rounds of
doing this negative tapping,

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:08.210 align:middle line:84%
the body calms down,
the brain calms down.

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And you start thinking
positive thoughts naturally.

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:14.090 align:middle line:84%
Then you go, you
know, I actually

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:15.470 align:middle line:90%
am not that bad of a flyer.

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:16.970 align:middle line:90%
I've had some good flights.

00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm feeling better
about the experience.

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:20.990 align:middle line:90%
And I know I'm in control.

00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:22.880 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is that's
going on in our lives,

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.610 align:middle line:84%
we naturally get to
that positive place.

00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what I
believe is inside all of us.

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:30.980 align:middle line:84%
I truly believe that
positive energy, that love,

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:36.300 align:middle line:84%
that gratitude, that generosity,
that kindness is there.

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And if we can let go of all
this negative stuff around it,

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:41.190 align:middle line:90%
it'll come up naturally.

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:44.820 align:middle line:90%
So we start with the negative.

00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:46.176 align:middle line:90%
You ready to have an experience?

00:36:46.176 --> 00:36:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's go.

00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:47.650 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:36:47.650 --> 00:36:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Everyone at home, you want to
start by just picking something

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:51.940 align:middle line:90%
to work on.

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:53.950 align:middle line:84%
So we've talked
about fear of flying.

00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:55.380 align:middle line:90%
We've mentioned anxiety.

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:58.050 align:middle line:84%
So you're anxious about
something that is coming up.

00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:00.030 align:middle line:90%
You can pick that experience.

00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:02.705 align:middle line:84%
You're angry about something
someone said to you three days

00:37:02.705 --> 00:37:04.830 align:middle line:84%
ago and you think about it
and you just, your blood

00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:06.600 align:middle line:90%
starts boiling already.

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.580 align:middle line:90%
You have some pain in your body.

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:09.800 align:middle line:90%
It's great for physical pain.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:10.925 align:middle line:90%
So you tune into your body.

00:37:10.925 --> 00:37:13.320 align:middle line:84%
You go, oh, my shoulder's
tight, there's this tension.

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:15.010 align:middle line:84%
Something that you're
stressed about.

00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:16.427 align:middle line:84%
And we want to try
to be specific.

00:37:16.427 --> 00:37:18.450 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to just
say, my life sucks

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:20.110 align:middle line:90%
and everything's overwhelming.

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:22.030 align:middle line:90%
So you pick one thing.

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And then once you've
identified that one thing,

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:26.740 align:middle line:84%
give it a number on
a scale of 0 to 10.

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.840 align:middle line:84%
So to do the process,
you can close your eyes,

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:30.830 align:middle line:90%
if it's safe to do so.

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:32.570 align:middle line:90%
You can tune into your body.

00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And you go, you
know, I'm anxious

00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:36.650 align:middle line:90%
and I feel it in my chest.

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's about presentation
that I have coming up on Friday.

00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:42.930 align:middle line:90%
And it's a seven.

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:44.972 align:middle line:84%
And when I think about
it, just give it a number.

00:37:44.972 --> 00:37:46.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm uncomfortable.

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:47.260 align:middle line:90%
It's a seven.

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:49.960 align:middle line:84%
So now we have our target,
what we're going to tap on,

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.670 align:middle line:90%
and we have our number.

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:54.143 align:middle line:84%
And then we start by tapping
on the side of the hand,

00:37:54.143 --> 00:37:55.060 align:middle line:90%
the karate chop point.

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:57.220 align:middle line:84%
Whatever hand feels
comfortable for you.

00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And you can tap with
eyes open or closed.

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:01.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use
general language.

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And you can just repeat after
me in your mind or out loud.

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.970 align:middle line:84%
So tapping on the
side of the hand,

00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:15.840 align:middle line:84%
even though I have all
this stress in my body,

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:19.607 align:middle line:84%
I choose to relax
and feel safe now.

00:38:19.607 --> 00:38:21.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do that
two more times, staying

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:23.060 align:middle line:90%
on the side of the hand.

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:28.980 align:middle line:84%
Even though I feel
all this stress,

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:33.460 align:middle line:84%
I choose to relax
and feel safe now.

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:36.190 align:middle line:84%
And one more time, still
on the side of the hand.

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:44.295 align:middle line:84%
Even though I have all
this stress, all is well.

00:38:44.295 --> 00:38:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Now we'll tap
through the points.

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:48.120 align:middle line:84%
The first point is the
eyebrow point right

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:50.143 align:middle line:84%
on the inside of the
eyebrow where the hair ends

00:38:50.143 --> 00:38:51.060 align:middle line:90%
and it meets the nose.

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:53.580 align:middle line:84%
You can tap with two fingers
of one hand, the other hand,

00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:54.400 align:middle line:90%
or both hands.

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:57.060 align:middle line:84%
The meridians run down
both sides of the body.

00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:58.840 align:middle line:90%
And you're just tapping gently.

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.990 align:middle line:84%
I want you to think about
what your thing was.

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:04.320 align:middle line:84%
So if you have pain,
tune into the pain.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:07.710 align:middle line:84%
If you're anxious, think of the
thoughts that make you anxious.

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:10.200 align:middle line:84%
If you're angry,
what did they say?

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:11.490 align:middle line:90%
What did they do?

00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:14.610 align:middle line:84%
Tuning into that
thought pattern.

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And then we move to
the side of the eye.

00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:17.820 align:middle line:90%
It's not at the temple.

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:19.620 align:middle line:84%
Right next to the
eye, on the bone.

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Again, one side or both
sides, tapping gently,

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.680 align:middle line:90%
breathing gently, and tuning in.

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:26.760 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:27.810 align:middle line:90%
What are you angry about?

00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:29.190 align:middle line:90%
What is stressing you out?

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:31.915 align:middle line:90%


00:39:31.915 --> 00:39:33.290 align:middle line:84%
Under the eye,
right on the bone.

00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:36.160 align:middle line:90%


00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:38.902 align:middle line:90%
Think the thoughts again.

00:39:38.902 --> 00:39:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And if you're focusing on the
points and your mind wanders,

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:42.160 align:middle line:90%
that's OK.

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:45.200 align:middle line:84%
Just bring it back to the
thing that you are working on.

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.450 align:middle line:90%
Is there pain in your body?

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:47.250 align:middle line:90%
Are you anxious?

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:48.500 align:middle line:90%
Are you angry?

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:50.770 align:middle line:10%
Are you overwhelmed?

00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:53.030 align:middle line:90%
Now under the nose.

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:55.030 align:middle line:84%
As you think about this
thing you're working on,

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:57.000 align:middle line:84%
see if you can localize
it in your body.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.460 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel anxiety
in your chest

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:03.480 align:middle line:84%
or a rumbling in your stomach
or a tension in your shoulders?

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:07.230 align:middle line:90%
Tuning in, tapping gently.

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Now under the mouth above
the chin, below the lip

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:13.260 align:middle line:84%
in that little crease
there, tapping gently,

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:15.308 align:middle line:90%
thinking the thoughts.

00:40:15.308 --> 00:40:16.350 align:middle line:90%
What are you angry about?

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:17.475 align:middle line:90%
What are you anxious about?

00:40:17.475 --> 00:40:19.108 align:middle line:90%
Give it a voice.

00:40:19.108 --> 00:40:21.150 align:middle line:84%
You can speak it out loud,
if it's safe to do so.

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:24.840 align:middle line:84%
You can say, I'm so angry
about what they said.

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:28.570 align:middle line:90%
Be present to what's in the way.

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:31.600 align:middle line:90%
Be present to this stress.

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:32.560 align:middle line:90%
Three points left.

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:34.060 align:middle line:84%
For the collarbone
point, just right

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:35.935 align:middle line:84%
below the two little
bones of the collarbone.

00:40:35.935 --> 00:40:38.650 align:middle line:84%
You can tap with 10
fingers, both hands,

00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:40.525 align:middle line:84%
focusing on the
issue, tapping gently.

00:40:40.525 --> 00:40:43.540 align:middle line:90%


00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Tuning into the stress,
the anxiety, the anger,

00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:48.400 align:middle line:90%
the overwhelm.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:51.490 align:middle line:84%
Underneath the arm, three inches
underneath the armpit right

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:53.590 align:middle line:90%
around the bra line for women.

00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:56.220 align:middle line:84%
Tapping gently,
thinking the thoughts.

00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And if there's a movie,
play it in your mind.

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:00.780 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:05.220 align:middle line:84%
Last point, top of the head,
tapping gently, tuning in.

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:08.933 align:middle line:90%


00:41:08.933 --> 00:41:10.100 align:middle line:90%
And we'll do one more round.

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:11.308 align:middle line:90%
We'll go back to the eyebrow.

00:41:11.308 --> 00:41:13.820 align:middle line:84%
Repeat after me, in
your mind or out loud,

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:15.635 align:middle line:84%
it's safe to feel
these feelings.

00:41:15.635 --> 00:41:19.450 align:middle line:90%


00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:20.260 align:middle line:90%
Side of the eye.

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:21.650 align:middle line:90%
And it's safe to let them go.

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:25.500 align:middle line:90%


00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:28.590 align:middle line:84%
Under the eye, releasing
all this stress in my body.

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:32.310 align:middle line:90%


00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:34.770 align:middle line:84%
Under the nose, feeling
calm and relaxed.

00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:39.390 align:middle line:90%


00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:41.190 align:middle line:90%
Under the mouth, letting go.

00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:45.240 align:middle line:90%


00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Collarbone, from
every cell in my body.

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:51.230 align:middle line:90%


00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:52.750 align:middle line:90%
Under the arm, right now.

00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:55.860 align:middle line:90%


00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:57.780 align:middle line:90%
Top of the head, right now.

00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:01.050 align:middle line:90%


00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:04.920 align:middle line:84%
You can gently stop tapping
and take a breath in,

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:07.650 align:middle line:90%
and let it go.

00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:09.540 align:middle line:90%
So that was two quick rounds.

00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:10.800 align:middle line:90%
And now we just tune back in.

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.170 align:middle line:84%
So you go, OK, I was
anxious about this.

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:14.880 align:middle line:90%
Let me think about it again.

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:18.360 align:middle line:84%
It was a seven, now it's
a six, a five, or a four.

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And we also pay attention to
what happened in that process.

00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:24.020 align:middle line:84%
The real magic that I see time
and again is when people say,

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:25.770 align:middle line:84%
well, I'm anxious about
this presentation.

00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's their
thing and that's

00:42:26.970 --> 00:42:28.095 align:middle line:90%
what they're focused in on.

00:42:28.095 --> 00:42:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And then you do the tapping
and you go, actually,

00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:31.740 align:middle line:90%
wait a second.

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:33.150 align:middle line:90%
That's not really it.

00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:35.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm worried about this
other thing in my life.

00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:37.050 align:middle line:90%
So we begin to connect the dots.

00:42:37.050 --> 00:42:39.150 align:middle line:90%
That's the exploration process.

00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:41.060 align:middle line:84%
I remember working
with a young woman.

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:45.938 align:middle line:84%
She was in her late 20s, who
was a hard charging lawyer.

00:42:45.938 --> 00:42:46.980 align:middle line:90%
And she was a big runner.

00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:48.240 align:middle line:90%
She loved to run every day.

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And she came down with
terrible sciatica pain.

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:52.830 align:middle line:90%
And she was like, I can't run.

00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:54.470 align:middle line:90%
This is so frustrating.

00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:56.760 align:middle line:84%
Every time I sit down,
this terrible pain.

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.210 align:middle line:90%
So we started working together.

00:42:58.210 --> 00:43:00.455 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you know,
the usual things

00:43:00.455 --> 00:43:01.830 align:middle line:84%
that we explore
with pain relief,

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:03.360 align:middle line:90%
well, when did this start?

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:04.717 align:middle line:90%
Well, it was at this wedding.

00:43:04.717 --> 00:43:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, it was
actually a stressful wedding.

00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:08.640 align:middle line:90%
So we talked about the wedding.

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Was there something that
happened there in that moment?

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.733 align:middle line:90%
And did some tapping.

00:43:13.733 --> 00:43:15.150 align:middle line:84%
She felt better
about the wedding,

00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:16.740 align:middle line:90%
but the pain was still there.

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:17.640 align:middle line:90%
Went round and round.

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'm about 25 minutes
in with her and going,

00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:21.630 align:middle line:90%
I always see results with pain.

00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And then she's going, nope,
still hurts, still hurts, still

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:25.855 align:middle line:90%
hurts, sciatica still hurts.

00:43:25.855 --> 00:43:26.730 align:middle line:90%
So I said, all right.

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:28.320 align:middle line:90%
Let's wipe the slate clean.

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:30.473 align:middle line:90%
I said, forget the pain.

00:43:30.473 --> 00:43:31.890 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about your
life right now.

00:43:31.890 --> 00:43:34.170 align:middle line:84%
What is stressing
you out the most?

00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:35.510 align:middle line:90%
And she said, easy, work.

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:36.310 align:middle line:90%
I hate it.

00:43:36.310 --> 00:43:37.440 align:middle line:90%
I hate everything about it.

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:38.240 align:middle line:90%
I hate this.

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:40.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it didn't take
long, many questions

00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:42.415 align:middle line:84%
before she was just ranting
and raving about work.

00:43:42.415 --> 00:43:43.290 align:middle line:90%
So I said, all right.

00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:44.800 align:middle line:90%
Let's just forget the pain.

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:45.920 align:middle line:90%
Let's tap about work.

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:47.100 align:middle line:90%
Even though I'm so angry.

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:47.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm lost.

00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:48.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm confused.

00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:49.540 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what to do.

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:51.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm overwhelmed.

00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Did five minutes of tapping on
all that work anger and stress.

00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:57.833 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
she goes, pain's gone.

00:43:57.833 --> 00:43:59.250 align:middle line:84%
These are the
things in our lives,

00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:00.570 align:middle line:90%
these are the connections.

00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:03.690 align:middle line:84%
This is the exploration that
we do with tapping to go,

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:05.473 align:middle line:84%
what is really
happening in our lives?

00:44:05.473 --> 00:44:06.390 align:middle line:90%
Because we don't know.

00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:07.610 align:middle line:90%
We think we know.

00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:09.485 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
challenges, that we go,

00:44:09.485 --> 00:44:11.850 align:middle line:84%
well, I have sciatica pain
because I went for a run

00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:13.020 align:middle line:90%
and it just acted up.

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:14.620 align:middle line:90%
And that's just the way it is.

00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:16.420 align:middle line:90%
I have sciatica pain.

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:20.228 align:middle line:84%
And then we explore this work
stress and the pain goes away.

00:44:20.228 --> 00:44:21.270 align:middle line:90%
>> It's interesting, huh?

00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:24.120 align:middle line:84%
The body has an intelligence
beyond what we know.

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think you even
start to discover this

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:29.400 align:middle line:84%
when you learn about emotions
and how they impact the body.

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:33.090 align:middle line:84%
But additionally, when you
think about sexual relationships

00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:35.490 align:middle line:84%
or intimate connection
where people

00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:37.680 align:middle line:84%
can see and have
experiences that

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:39.840 align:middle line:84%
help them to release
energy because it

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:41.350 align:middle line:90%
gets trapped in the body.

00:44:41.350 --> 00:44:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And we're not very body-centric,
body-aware type people

00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:47.280 align:middle line:84%
in our modern
domesticated culture.

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:50.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, touch,
massage, these are not

00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:51.600 align:middle line:84%
things that happen
in the household.

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:53.475 align:middle line:84%
You know, your mom
doesn't massage your palms

00:44:53.475 --> 00:44:56.428 align:middle line:84%
and your feet every evening like
other Indigenous cultures where

00:44:56.428 --> 00:44:58.470 align:middle line:84%
massage and touch is a
big part of their culture.

00:44:58.470 --> 00:45:00.137 align:middle line:84%
So tapping might be
a way to help people

00:45:00.137 --> 00:45:01.830 align:middle line:90%
liberate some of that energy.

00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:04.860 align:middle line:84%
>> No doubt about it, just
that physical-- and you know,

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:05.910 align:middle line:90%
you can tap on yourself.

00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:06.750 align:middle line:90%
And most people do.

00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:08.550 align:middle line:84%
But you can also tap
on another person.

00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:11.008 align:middle line:84%
If you want to do it with your
partner, certainly with kids

00:45:11.008 --> 00:45:14.040 align:middle line:84%
it's great, if
they're game for it.

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:17.732 align:middle line:84%
>> So obviously, you're gifted
at these scripts, I think.

00:45:17.732 --> 00:45:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And even listening to
you in that moment,

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:21.390 align:middle line:84%
there you talk about
the pain, but you also

00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:24.110 align:middle line:84%
open an opportunity for
healing in that language.

00:45:24.110 --> 00:45:25.140 align:middle line:90%
You're like, it's OK.

00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:26.400 align:middle line:90%
I feel safe.

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:28.577 align:middle line:84%
So you're closing the
loop on that story, which

00:45:28.577 --> 00:45:30.660 align:middle line:84%
is helping people develop
potentially a new belief

00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:31.460 align:middle line:90%
system around it.

00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:32.520 align:middle line:90%
>> 100%, absolutely.

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's an opportunity,
especially when

00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:36.870 align:middle line:84%
the body and the brain is
relaxed, when you begin to let

00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:39.570 align:middle line:84%
go of that anxiety,
that anger, that pain.

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:42.700 align:middle line:84%
Then we can begin to open up
the brain for that healing, that

00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:43.500 align:middle line:90%
thought of healing.

00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:44.700 align:middle line:90%
And these are emotions.

00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And we have to
practice these things.

00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:48.750 align:middle line:84%
If we haven't felt
hope in a long time,

00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:50.822 align:middle line:84%
if we haven't felt
happiness or joy--

00:45:50.822 --> 00:45:53.280 align:middle line:84%
one of things that I love doing,
especially as we go deeper

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:56.640 align:middle line:84%
and tapping meditations is
like, practice joy right now.

00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:59.590 align:middle line:84%
What would it feel
like to feel joy?

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And as you do the
tapping, create that joy.

00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:05.580 align:middle line:84%
We think that joy just
happens spontaneously.

00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:07.740 align:middle line:84%
But if it's not an experience
that we've had often,

00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:10.350 align:middle line:84%
if it's not a chemical
pathway that we're used

00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:12.040 align:middle line:90%
to having, we got to practice.

00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:13.490 align:middle line:90%
OK, what would it feel like?

00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:14.700 align:middle line:90%
It seems so silly, right?

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:17.280 align:middle line:84%
It feels like,
this is the basics

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:19.860 align:middle line:84%
but this is the basics of life
that we haven't been taught.

00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:21.880 align:middle line:84%
If you want experienced
joy in your life,

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:24.150 align:middle line:84%
let go of that anger, the
anxiety, the overwhelming,

00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:26.400 align:middle line:84%
and close your eyes and
imagine, what would it

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.487 align:middle line:90%
feel like to be joyful?

00:46:28.487 --> 00:46:30.070 align:middle line:84%
What would it feel
like to be hopeful?

00:46:30.070 --> 00:46:31.910 align:middle line:84%
What would it feel
like to feel love?

00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:34.560 align:middle line:84%
For a lot of people whose
hearts are closed, if I say,

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:38.160 align:middle line:84%
close your eyes and
feel love, they go, no.

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:39.060 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:40.290 align:middle line:90%
My heart is closed.

00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:41.460 align:middle line:90%
I've been hurt.

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:43.360 align:middle line:84%
I have felt so much
pain in my life.

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:44.640 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how to feel this.

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:47.300 align:middle line:84%
But if we first
acknowledge that pain,

00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:50.120 align:middle line:84%
if the body begins to feel
that it's safe, and then I go,

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:53.570 align:middle line:84%
all right, imagine
if you could feel

00:46:53.570 --> 00:46:55.070 align:middle line:90%
love, what would it feel like?

00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And people start going, OK, I
get a little bit, all right?

00:46:58.580 --> 00:46:59.660 align:middle line:90%
And then we start slowly.

00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:00.620 align:middle line:90%
We're like kids.

00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:03.830 align:middle line:84%
We really are emotional
children in a lot of ways.

00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:07.672 align:middle line:84%
I'm still learning every day
about these glorious bodies

00:47:07.672 --> 00:47:09.380 align:middle line:84%
and our brains and
how they work together

00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:11.780 align:middle line:84%
and how to effect
transformation in people.

00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:15.687 align:middle line:84%
I think we're just at the
beginning of a lot of learning.

00:47:15.687 --> 00:47:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And we've got to practice
these things and practice love

00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:19.760 align:middle line:90%
and practice joy.

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:22.490 align:middle line:84%
>> An insight I'm getting
right now is that tapping can

00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:25.280 align:middle line:84%
potentially amplify your
opportunity to improve

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:29.480 align:middle line:84%
the capability of affirmations,
because if you acknowledge

00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:32.755 align:middle line:84%
the pain and the trauma and the
suffering and you tap into that

00:47:32.755 --> 00:47:35.900 align:middle line:84%
and you say, OK, I feel safe
now, OK, I can feel safe now,

00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:38.202 align:middle line:84%
and then what would it
feel like if I felt this?

00:47:38.202 --> 00:47:39.410 align:middle line:90%
That's really an affirmation.

00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:40.940 align:middle line:90%
Like, how can I experience joy?

00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:43.460 align:middle line:84%
But you've allowed your body
to go through that process

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:44.570 align:middle line:90%
of relaxation first.

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:45.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:47.933 align:middle line:84%
Well, relaxation and just
in the tapping process,

00:47:47.933 --> 00:47:49.850 align:middle line:84%
we begin to discover the
different things that

00:47:49.850 --> 00:47:53.670 align:middle line:84%
are going on that we
might not think are there.

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:56.173 align:middle line:84%
So for example, a lot of
people talk about goal setting.

00:47:56.173 --> 00:47:58.340 align:middle line:84%
It's similar to affirmations
in terms of, like, hey,

00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:00.750 align:middle line:90%
OK, positive reaching forward.

00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:04.490 align:middle line:84%
So if someone comes to me and
says, I've got a big goal,

00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:06.200 align:middle line:84%
I want to make a
million dollars,

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:08.838 align:middle line:84%
I want to buy a new house,
I want to write a book--

00:48:08.838 --> 00:48:10.880 align:middle line:84%
so most people think in
the goal setting process,

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:12.925 align:middle line:84%
all right, I'm just
going to set the goal.

00:48:12.925 --> 00:48:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
just look at it.

00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to suffer
my way to it until I get there.

00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:22.790 align:middle line:84%
What I say to do first is, look
at that goal, write it down.

00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:24.367 align:middle line:90%
And then imagine it coming true.

00:48:24.367 --> 00:48:25.950 align:middle line:84%
Because here's what's
going to happen.

00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:28.970 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at the
new house as an example

00:48:28.970 --> 00:48:31.710 align:middle line:84%
or financial success
or writing a book.

00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:34.070 align:middle line:84%
So a person closes
their eyes and goes, OK.

00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:34.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm writing a book.

00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:35.843 align:middle line:90%
That's my goal.

00:48:35.843 --> 00:48:37.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to think about it.

00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:37.400 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:38.373 align:middle line:90%
It's published.

00:48:38.373 --> 00:48:39.290 align:middle line:90%
It's in the bookstore.

00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:40.460 align:middle line:90%
I see it in the bookstore.

00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:43.302 align:middle line:84%
This is all positive
visualization, right?

00:48:43.302 --> 00:48:44.510 align:middle line:90%
We're told to do this, right?

00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:45.760 align:middle line:90%
Visualize it in the bookstore.

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:47.240 align:middle line:90%
OK, it's in the bookstore.

00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:48.040 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:48.870 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel?

00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And you think, well, the
answer should be happy.

00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:51.968 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's published.

00:48:51.968 --> 00:48:54.260 align:middle line:84%
But if you just take a gentle
breath and you look at it

00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:58.530 align:middle line:84%
and you go, what if
people don't like it?

00:48:58.530 --> 00:48:59.520 align:middle line:90%
How about the reviews?

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:00.750 align:middle line:90%
Amazon reviews.

00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:02.070 align:middle line:90%
What if it gets one star?

00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:04.050 align:middle line:90%
What if somebody criticizes it?

00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:07.280 align:middle line:84%
When we think about financial
success and that new house,

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:08.530 align:middle line:90%
OK, go walk in that new house.

00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:09.780 align:middle line:90%
And you go, oh, this is great.

00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:11.220 align:middle line:90%
Look how spacious it is.

00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:12.330 align:middle line:90%
And then I say, all right.

00:49:12.330 --> 00:49:15.600 align:middle line:84%
Now have your mom and dad join
you in that house or your best

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:18.268 align:middle line:84%
friends join you in that
house, and people go, oh,

00:49:18.268 --> 00:49:20.310 align:middle line:84%
they're just going to
think I'm so full of myself

00:49:20.310 --> 00:49:22.270 align:middle line:90%
with this big house.

00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:24.630 align:middle line:84%
So we find the
things around us, we

00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:27.908 align:middle line:84%
find the little holes that
are going to keep us stuck.

00:49:27.908 --> 00:49:28.950 align:middle line:90%
And this is what happens.

00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:31.860 align:middle line:84%
If you are scared of
that Amazon review--

00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:34.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, nobody wants to have
a one star Amazon review.

00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:36.480 align:middle line:84%
But if you're really
terrified of it,

00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:38.778 align:middle line:84%
that's when you become
a procrastinator.

00:49:38.778 --> 00:49:40.320 align:middle line:84%
You're never going
to write that book

00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:43.020 align:middle line:84%
because your body and
your brain is going to go,

00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:46.620 align:middle line:84%
even though I think I want
this goal, it's not safe.

00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:48.990 align:middle line:90%
Back to this word safe, right?

00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Underneath it all, it's
not safe because I'm

00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:52.800 align:middle line:90%
going to get criticized.

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.990 align:middle line:84%
If I open my heart
up to this person

00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:58.600 align:middle line:84%
and this vulnerable
relationship,

00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:00.690 align:middle line:84%
it's not safe because
what if they reject me?

00:50:00.690 --> 00:50:02.820 align:middle line:84%
If I have all this
financial success,

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:05.430 align:middle line:84%
what will my friends
or family think of me?

00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:07.020 align:middle line:84%
So whatever you
want in your life,

00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:09.120 align:middle line:90%
it's such an easy process to do.

00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Think about it, visualize
it, and ask yourself,

00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:14.130 align:middle line:90%
what's the downside of it?

00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:16.140 align:middle line:84%
Give a voice to
those little voices

00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:18.030 align:middle line:90%
that are there all the time.

00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:20.700 align:middle line:84%
We hear terms like
self sabotage.

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:22.350 align:middle line:90%
What is self sabotage?

00:50:22.350 --> 00:50:25.410 align:middle line:84%
Self sabotage is your body,
your brain, your mind,

00:50:25.410 --> 00:50:27.960 align:middle line:84%
your spirit protecting
you, keeping

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:30.480 align:middle line:84%
you safe from something
about that goal, something

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:33.120 align:middle line:84%
about that outcome, something
about that experience

00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:34.620 align:middle line:90%
that it's scared of.

00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:37.620 align:middle line:84%
The way that you open up the
road, the way that goal setting

00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:38.500 align:middle line:90%
becomes--

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:39.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to say
easy, because you still

00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:42.275 align:middle line:84%
gotta put in the work and you
got to have the dedication.

00:50:42.275 --> 00:50:45.630 align:middle line:84%
But the way can be effortless
in terms of like, it's fun.

00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:47.195 align:middle line:84%
Like right now
what you're doing,

00:50:47.195 --> 00:50:48.570 align:middle line:84%
we're here in
Connecticut, you're

00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:51.330 align:middle line:84%
traveling around the country
and the world filming people.

00:50:51.330 --> 00:50:52.190 align:middle line:90%
You're working hard.

00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:53.190 align:middle line:90%
You got up this morning.

00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:55.180 align:middle line:84%
You've flown far,
but it's effortless.

00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:55.980 align:middle line:90%
You're happy.

00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:57.647 align:middle line:84%
Not that you don't
have stumbling blocks

00:50:57.647 --> 00:51:00.000 align:middle line:84%
because you get somewhere
and the electricity goes out.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.022 align:middle line:84%
But underneath it all is
a passion that drives you.

00:51:03.022 --> 00:51:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Because when you knew
you were going to show up

00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:07.530 align:middle line:84%
today, there weren't any
fears that said, well,

00:51:07.530 --> 00:51:09.130 align:middle line:90%
what if I stumble about this?

00:51:09.130 --> 00:51:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Or what if people judge
this transcendence?

00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:18.020 align:middle line:84%
You have done enough work that
is safe to do those things.

00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:19.560 align:middle line:90%
That's what's possible tapping.

00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And what is so sad about
this process of goal setting,

00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:26.840 align:middle line:84%
of the things that we
want in our lives--

00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:28.007 align:middle line:90%
and I see it time and again.

00:51:28.007 --> 00:51:31.690 align:middle line:84%
You see it with, I've worked
privately with famous actors,

00:51:31.690 --> 00:51:35.260 align:middle line:84%
like A, top five
level celebrities,

00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:38.670 align:middle line:84%
sports people, people who are
just at the peak of their game.

00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And I see some people who are
showing up to work terrified.

00:51:42.070 --> 00:51:45.430 align:middle line:84%
They just have so much desire
to do it that they just

00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:47.410 align:middle line:90%
force themselves to do it.

00:51:47.410 --> 00:51:50.035 align:middle line:84%
There's actors that have had
stage fright for 20 years.

00:51:50.035 --> 00:51:51.910 align:middle line:84%
They just, they're great
actors and they just

00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:54.020 align:middle line:90%
force themselves to it.

00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:56.480 align:middle line:84%
What I say is that it's
possible to do it otherwise.

00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:59.990 align:middle line:84%
It's possible to let go of
these pitfalls, of these fears,

00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:01.790 align:middle line:84%
of whatever's happening
so you can actually

00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:03.032 align:middle line:90%
enjoy the experience.

00:52:03.032 --> 00:52:04.490 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
we want, right?

00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:07.550 align:middle line:84%
We're setting these goals
to enjoy the experience.

00:52:07.550 --> 00:52:10.430 align:middle line:84%
We're setting these goals to
have happiness and joy and love

00:52:10.430 --> 00:52:14.580 align:middle line:84%
and connection and compassion
and to feel fully ourselves.

00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:17.420 align:middle line:84%
So when you set these goals
and you bring that into it,

00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:19.320 align:middle line:84%
that's when your
life can change.

00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:21.010 align:middle line:90%
And you enjoy the process.

00:52:21.010 --> 00:52:22.240 align:middle line:90%
>> And you enjoy the process.

00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:24.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look, it's
cliche, right?

00:52:24.410 --> 00:52:25.220 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy the process.

00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And everyone goes, I will, I
will, once I get to the goal.

00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:32.180 align:middle line:84%
But this also paves the way to
actually achieving the goal.

00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:34.790 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're not lined
up, if you're not fully

00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:36.955 align:middle line:84%
in alignment with
what you want to do,

00:52:36.955 --> 00:52:38.330 align:middle line:84%
that's when you'll
procrastinate.

00:52:38.330 --> 00:52:39.470 align:middle line:90%
You'll go on social media.

00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:41.098 align:middle line:84%
You'll find
something else to do.

00:52:41.098 --> 00:52:42.890 align:middle line:84%
Your brain will trick
you into going, well,

00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:45.590 align:middle line:84%
I got to do the laundry first
before I write my book, right?

00:52:45.590 --> 00:52:47.780 align:middle line:84%
I can't write the first
chapter of my book

00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:49.050 align:middle line:90%
until I do the laundry.

00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:49.850 align:middle line:90%
Guess what?

00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:51.590 align:middle line:90%
Laundry is safe.

00:52:51.590 --> 00:52:53.840 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's criticizing you
for doing the laundry.

00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:55.790 align:middle line:84%
It's a task that
needs to be completed.

00:52:55.790 --> 00:52:58.070 align:middle line:90%
Writing a book is not safe.

00:52:58.070 --> 00:53:01.280 align:middle line:84%
Wherever you look in your life,
financial challenges, weight

00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:04.250 align:middle line:84%
loss, you struggle
losing weight and you go,

00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:06.200 align:middle line:84%
well, I keep making
bad decisions.

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:08.510 align:middle line:84%
Underneath it all is
probably stress, just

00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:09.470 align:middle line:90%
general life stress.

00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:11.510 align:middle line:84%
So you go, I'm stressed
and I'm overwhelmed.

00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:13.040 align:middle line:90%
I come home from work.

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:13.880 align:middle line:90%
I need carbs.

00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:14.780 align:middle line:90%
I need sugar.

00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:17.120 align:middle line:84%
I need something
just to calm me down.

00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:18.560 align:middle line:90%
I need that habit.

00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:21.560 align:middle line:84%
Or previous traumatic
experiences, things that go,

00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:23.750 align:middle line:90%
it's not safe to lose weight.

00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:27.815 align:middle line:84%
My younger sister Jessica wrote
a book on weight loss and body

00:53:27.815 --> 00:53:29.690 align:middle line:84%
confidence, a New York
Times bestselling book

00:53:29.690 --> 00:53:32.990 align:middle line:84%
because people knew,
there's something more

00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:35.578 align:middle line:84%
to this weight loss thing
than just the things

00:53:35.578 --> 00:53:36.620 align:middle line:90%
that we put in our mouth.

00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:38.840 align:middle line:84%
They matter, but the
emotional journey

00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:42.320 align:middle line:84%
to make those good decisions,
to let go of those pounds,

00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:45.370 align:middle line:84%
to feel safe in your body, that
can make a huge difference.

00:53:45.370 --> 00:53:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Nick, you've worked
with a lot of people.

00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:50.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, since The Tapping
Solution movie came out

00:53:50.810 --> 00:53:52.610 align:middle line:84%
and you know, right
through to this day

00:53:52.610 --> 00:53:55.850 align:middle line:84%
doing events with Hey House,
after the book came out,

00:53:55.850 --> 00:53:58.743 align:middle line:84%
interviewing people that have
had incredible successes.

00:53:58.743 --> 00:54:00.410 align:middle line:84%
Are there any that
stand out to you that

00:54:00.410 --> 00:54:02.300 align:middle line:90%
just seem almost unbelievable?

00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Like you can't
imagine that tapping

00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:05.780 align:middle line:90%
would have helped so much?

00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:06.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:09.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give you two too
good to be true stories, right?

00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:11.685 align:middle line:84%
Where it's like-- and
they're both on film.

00:54:11.685 --> 00:54:13.310 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm going
to bring those up,

00:54:13.310 --> 00:54:14.660 align:middle line:90%
because they're a film.

00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And the first one is for you,
because it was an Australia.

00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:20.073 align:middle line:84%
So I'm with Hay
House in Australia.

00:54:20.073 --> 00:54:21.740 align:middle line:84%
I'd spoken for about
an hour and a half.

00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:23.570 align:middle line:84%
We'd done some
tapping with people

00:54:23.570 --> 00:54:26.037 align:middle line:90%
and I was taking some questions.

00:54:26.037 --> 00:54:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I was
running out of time.

00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:30.790 align:middle line:84%
I had like five minutes
left before next speaker was

00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:32.540 align:middle line:84%
coming on, who was
Wayne Dyer, so I wasn't

00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:35.600 align:middle line:90%
going to go over my time.

00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And girl raises or
hand and she says,

00:54:37.790 --> 00:54:41.360 align:middle line:90%
my friend here has mutism.

00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:44.150 align:middle line:84%
She hasn't talked in
a couple of months.

00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:45.500 align:middle line:90%
She can't, she can't speak.

00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:47.180 align:middle line:90%
Her voice, like she tries.

00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:49.037 align:middle line:84%
Doctors say that it's
all psychological.

00:54:49.037 --> 00:54:50.120 align:middle line:90%
This, that, and the other.

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:52.130 align:middle line:90%
Can you help her?

00:54:52.130 --> 00:54:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, this girl
hasn't talked in three months?

00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:56.670 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:54:56.670 --> 00:54:58.870 align:middle line:84%
There's an audience of
5,000 people watching.

00:54:58.870 --> 00:55:02.663 align:middle line:84%
And I go, I don't
know, but let's try.

00:55:02.663 --> 00:55:04.330 align:middle line:84%
Especially it's like,
OK, we're tapping.

00:55:04.330 --> 00:55:05.270 align:middle line:90%
You can't talk to her.

00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:06.490 align:middle line:90%
So she comes up.

00:55:06.490 --> 00:55:08.230 align:middle line:90%
Her friend comes up with her.

00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And I start asking,
when did this start?

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:11.440 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's do some tapping.

00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:13.060 align:middle line:90%
Tune into your throat voice.

00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:16.640 align:middle line:84%
I just used my
intuition to try to see

00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:18.300 align:middle line:90%
if we could do something.

00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:21.060 align:middle line:84%
A couple rounds of tapping,
she starts like squeaking out

00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:21.860 align:middle line:90%
a couple of things.

00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:22.520 align:middle line:90%
And she's writing.

00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And I asked her a question
and this, that, and the other.

00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:27.230 align:middle line:90%
Couple more rounds, she speaks.

00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And the audience was like,
you've got to be kidding me.

00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:31.020 align:middle line:90%
I was blown away.

00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:32.330 align:middle line:90%
I still don't get it.

00:55:32.330 --> 00:55:34.170 align:middle line:84%
Something unlocked
in that moment.

00:55:34.170 --> 00:55:36.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it
was emotional trauma.

00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:37.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if her
body was stressed.

00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:38.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if she
was overwhelmed, what

00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:40.748 align:middle line:84%
was happening that she hadn't
spoken in three months.

00:55:40.748 --> 00:55:41.630 align:middle line:90%
But she spoke.

00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And there's video
there to prove it.

00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:49.670 align:middle line:84%
So the other one was a
lady by name of Bobbi.

00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And Bobbi had knee pain
for 20 or 30 years.

00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And we started tapping
on the pain, digging

00:55:58.370 --> 00:56:00.740 align:middle line:84%
deep, as we do in the
process, especially

00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:04.670 align:middle line:84%
when the initial tapping on
the pain didn't help her.

00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:05.480 align:middle line:90%
And I asked her--

00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:06.522 align:middle line:90%
I forget how I got there.

00:56:06.522 --> 00:56:09.403 align:middle line:84%
But we basically started talking
about an experience she had

00:56:09.403 --> 00:56:10.570 align:middle line:90%
when she was five years old.

00:56:10.570 --> 00:56:11.840 align:middle line:90%
It was her birthday.

00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:17.125 align:middle line:84%
And her father said, "I wish
you'd never been born," to her.

00:56:17.125 --> 00:56:18.750 align:middle line:84%
Again, having a
four-year-old daughter,

00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:21.210 align:middle line:84%
I can't imagine the
pain that she was in.

00:56:21.210 --> 00:56:23.100 align:middle line:84%
I can't imagine the
pain and the trauma

00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:25.620 align:middle line:84%
that the father must
have been in to speak

00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:27.090 align:middle line:90%
those kinds of vile words.

00:56:27.090 --> 00:56:29.790 align:middle line:84%
But you can imagine,
it haunted her,

00:56:29.790 --> 00:56:32.260 align:middle line:90%
haunted her for her whole life.

00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:36.810 align:middle line:84%
So we did some tapping with
it, went deep on it, even had--

00:56:36.810 --> 00:56:39.780 align:middle line:84%
this was at a live event,
had the audience engage.

00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:43.770 align:middle line:84%
So it was really sort of a
soulful collection of energy,

00:56:43.770 --> 00:56:45.780 align:middle line:84%
people looking to create
that healing as we're

00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:47.250 align:middle line:90%
doing the tapping.

00:56:47.250 --> 00:56:49.560 align:middle line:84%
She had a great
outcome emotionally,

00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:52.680 align:middle line:84%
just liberating her from the
weight of this experience

00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:53.750 align:middle line:90%
that she had.

00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:55.650 align:middle line:90%
And the knee pain went away.

00:56:55.650 --> 00:56:57.255 align:middle line:84%
That was couple
of years ago now.

00:56:57.255 --> 00:56:58.380 align:middle line:90%
The knee pain's still gone.

00:56:58.380 --> 00:57:00.480 align:middle line:90%
She's lost 100 pounds.

00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Her life has been
transformed from that.

00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And another really cool
thing about that experience,

00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:07.860 align:middle line:84%
which goes to show how
conditioned we are--

00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:09.390 align:middle line:90%
this was a multiday event.

00:57:09.390 --> 00:57:10.630 align:middle line:90%
The knee pain went away.

00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:12.630 align:middle line:84%
The next morning she came
back and the knee pain

00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:13.590 align:middle line:90%
was still gone.

00:57:13.590 --> 00:57:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I got to
just share something.

00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:16.647 align:middle line:90%
So she gets up with the mic.

00:57:16.647 --> 00:57:19.830 align:middle line:84%
She said, I woke up this morning
and as I rolled out of bed

00:57:19.830 --> 00:57:22.170 align:middle line:90%
and went to stand up, I groaned.

00:57:22.170 --> 00:57:24.280 align:middle line:90%
She went, oh.

00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And then she stopped and said,
I don't have any knee pain.

00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:29.870 align:middle line:90%
Why am I groaning?

00:57:29.870 --> 00:57:32.160 align:middle line:90%
And she was just so conditioned.

00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think it speaks
to the conditioning

00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:36.000 align:middle line:90%
that we all have in our lives.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Where are the places
that we're just

00:57:37.530 --> 00:57:40.950 align:middle line:84%
groaning just because that's
what we're used to doing?

00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:43.050 align:middle line:84%
That is that habit
of brushing our teeth

00:57:43.050 --> 00:57:44.400 align:middle line:90%
and going through these actions.

00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:47.450 align:middle line:84%
The knee pain was
gone and she groaned.

00:57:47.450 --> 00:57:49.182 align:middle line:84%
And I think what we
can do with tapping,

00:57:49.182 --> 00:57:51.390 align:middle line:84%
what we can do with all
these tools of transformation

00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:53.883 align:middle line:84%
is look around at
our lives and go,

00:57:53.883 --> 00:57:55.050 align:middle line:90%
does it have to be this way?

00:57:55.050 --> 00:57:56.850 align:middle line:84%
Do I have to have
this knee pain?

00:57:56.850 --> 00:57:58.170 align:middle line:90%
Do I have to groan?

00:57:58.170 --> 00:57:59.490 align:middle line:90%
Do I have to react in this way?

00:57:59.490 --> 00:58:02.640 align:middle line:84%
Can I make different
choices in our lives?

00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:03.810 align:middle line:90%
The answer is yes.

00:58:03.810 --> 00:58:05.403 align:middle line:90%
It's unequivocally yes.

00:58:05.403 --> 00:58:07.320 align:middle line:84%
I think we have tools
that make transformation

00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:09.060 align:middle line:90%
faster than ever before.

00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And as I said
earlier, we're just

00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:14.960 align:middle line:84%
getting started on that
take off to transformation.

00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:15.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:17.350 align:middle line:90%
Very nice.

00:58:17.350 --> 00:58:18.490 align:middle line:90%
You live in Connecticut.

00:58:18.490 --> 00:58:20.130 align:middle line:90%
You live close to Sandy Hook.

00:58:20.130 --> 00:58:20.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Right now we're
10 minutes from--

00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:25.690 align:middle line:84%
as we do this right now,
we're a 10 minute drive

00:58:25.690 --> 00:58:27.580 align:middle line:90%
from Sandy Hook.

00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:30.070 align:middle line:84%
>> And there was a horrible
thing that happened there seven

00:58:30.070 --> 00:58:31.990 align:middle line:90%
years ago.

00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you got
involved after the event.

00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:35.800 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell me--

00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:38.020 align:middle line:84%
can you recap the event
for us, what happened?

00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:40.810 align:middle line:84%
Maybe where you were,
your reaction to it,

00:58:40.810 --> 00:58:43.300 align:middle line:84%
and then how you stepped
in with tapping to help

00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:44.890 align:middle line:84%
and maybe some of
the experiences

00:58:44.890 --> 00:58:45.890 align:middle line:90%
you had in that process?

00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:47.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:58:47.550 --> 00:58:50.560 align:middle line:84%
So most people know
the Sandy Hook school

00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:56.560 align:middle line:84%
shooting, where 20 children
were killed and seven adults.

00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:58.270 align:middle line:84%
Horrible day for
the whole world.

00:58:58.270 --> 00:58:59.800 align:middle line:90%
The world was traumatized.

00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:01.417 align:middle line:90%
The world was shocked.

00:59:01.417 --> 00:59:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, when
it's 10 minutes from you

00:59:03.250 --> 00:59:06.870 align:middle line:84%
in the same town, you go,
how could this happen here?

00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:08.978 align:middle line:84%
That's what every tragedy
at every place goes,

00:59:08.978 --> 00:59:10.020 align:middle line:90%
how could it happen here?

00:59:10.020 --> 00:59:11.640 align:middle line:90%
But you drove up here.

00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:13.430 align:middle line:90%
This is a new town, Sandy Hook.

00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:16.560 align:middle line:90%
It's nice houses, picket fences.

00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:18.180 align:middle line:90%
It just seems unimaginable.

00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:21.300 align:middle line:84%
It's an idyllic
Connecticut town.

00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:25.107 align:middle line:84%
And so I remember that
Friday so clearly.

00:59:25.107 --> 00:59:26.940 align:middle line:84%
It took time for the
information to come in.

00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:30.030 align:middle line:84%
We kept hearing false reports
and this, that, and the other.

00:59:30.030 --> 00:59:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And in the beginning
it was like, oh,

00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:34.990 align:middle line:84%
that seems bad,
but not that bad.

00:59:34.990 --> 00:59:37.820 align:middle line:84%
It looked like something
had happened with one person

00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:39.090 align:middle line:90%
getting killed in an incident.

00:59:39.090 --> 00:59:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And then all the information
comes in, and you go,

00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:42.560 align:middle line:90%
you gotta be kidding me.

00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:47.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can't
imagine the horror of it.

00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:50.750 align:middle line:84%
So looking around,
knowing that tapping

00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:55.770 align:middle line:84%
is a great technique for
trauma, I was compelled to help.

00:59:55.770 --> 00:59:58.800 align:middle line:84%
My brother, Alex and my
sister, Jessica and I

00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:01.260 align:middle line:84%
and the rest of the family
formed The Tapping Solution

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:04.410 align:middle line:84%
Foundation right then
for that specific purpose

01:00:04.410 --> 01:00:05.940 align:middle line:90%
of helping and healing.

01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:08.370 align:middle line:84%
We flew in Dr. Lori
Leyden from California,

01:00:08.370 --> 01:00:11.520 align:middle line:84%
who had a lot of experience
working in Rwanda with genocide

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:15.030 align:middle line:84%
survivors, working on trauma
and tapping with them.

01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:17.640 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I knew a lot,
but I wasn't the expert.

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:20.040 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to bring
in the experts.

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And she ended up
moving to Connecticut,

01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:26.220 align:middle line:84%
spent the next couple of years,
supported by the foundation,

01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:30.910 align:middle line:84%
in town working with people
again and again and again.

01:00:30.910 --> 01:00:32.310 align:middle line:90%
And we collaboratively did that.

01:00:32.310 --> 01:00:34.950 align:middle line:84%
We worked together, ran
workshops, worked with people

01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:36.420 align:middle line:90%
individually.

01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:40.050 align:middle line:84%
Some amazing stories of
healing and transformation.

01:00:40.050 --> 01:00:42.540 align:middle line:84%
Scarlett Lewis, who has
since become a dear friend,

01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:44.790 align:middle line:84%
she lost her son,
Jesse in the shooting.

01:00:44.790 --> 01:00:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And there's these
moments in life

01:00:46.890 --> 01:00:49.800 align:middle line:84%
where, my memory's decent but
it's not like crystal clear.

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:52.320 align:middle line:84%
But there is like these moments
that are just crystal clear.

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And I remember a rainy,
foggy Tuesday night.

01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:58.650 align:middle line:90%
So the shooting was on Friday.

01:00:58.650 --> 01:01:00.930 align:middle line:84%
We had put out a call
to our email list

01:01:00.930 --> 01:01:02.850 align:middle line:84%
raising funds for
this work and also

01:01:02.850 --> 01:01:05.100 align:middle line:84%
letting people know, hey,
if you're in Newtown, if you

01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:08.835 align:middle line:84%
know people who need help,
we're there to support them.

01:01:08.835 --> 01:01:10.710 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, with tragedy,
you think, oh, it's

01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:11.340 align:middle line:90%
so easy to help.

01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:12.882 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually
complicated to help

01:01:12.882 --> 01:01:15.240 align:middle line:84%
because there's so much
energy that comes in,

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:17.460 align:middle line:90%
so many people trying to help.

01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:20.240 align:middle line:84%
But I remember walking
into Scarlett's house.

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:23.760 align:middle line:84%
Scarlett was there, her
other son remaining, son JT

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:26.760 align:middle line:90%
who was 12 or 13 at the time.

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And she was-- traumatized
doesn't describe

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:33.643 align:middle line:90%
the state that she was in.

01:01:33.643 --> 01:01:34.810 align:middle line:90%
She had heard about tapping.

01:01:34.810 --> 01:01:36.560 align:middle line:84%
She happened to have
been on my email list

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:39.250 align:middle line:84%
and had done some Tapping World
Summits but hadn't gone deep.

01:01:39.250 --> 01:01:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And that night, we
tapped together.

01:01:41.710 --> 01:01:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Now people often ask about
these situations like, well,

01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:46.940 align:middle line:90%
this happened on a Friday.

01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:48.420 align:middle line:90%
And what did you do on Tuesday?

01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:50.380 align:middle line:84%
Like, how are you
going to tap this away?

01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:52.570 align:middle line:84%
Because we always think,
oh, tap away the anxiety,

01:01:52.570 --> 01:01:53.980 align:middle line:90%
tap away the anger.

01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:56.080 align:middle line:90%
We didn't tap anything away.

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:58.720 align:middle line:84%
In that moment, I just looked
to bring her some peace

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:01.420 align:middle line:84%
and to bring her body
into a state of calm.

01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And what was interesting
about that experience is,

01:02:04.570 --> 01:02:07.370 align:middle line:84%
we actually tapped on something
else completely different.

01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:11.190 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like on a Tuesday
after her six-year-old son dies

01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:12.940 align:middle line:84%
on Friday, I'm going
to say, let's tap on,

01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:15.108 align:middle line:84%
even though Jesse
died, we tapped

01:02:15.108 --> 01:02:16.900 align:middle line:84%
on anger and frustration,
other things that

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:19.390 align:middle line:84%
were going on in her
life that were then

01:02:19.390 --> 01:02:22.360 align:middle line:84%
feeding into the
stress and the anxiety.

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:24.550 align:middle line:84%
So my job in that
moment was, what

01:02:24.550 --> 01:02:27.310 align:middle line:84%
can I do to just bring
a semblance of peace

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:29.188 align:middle line:90%
to this suffering individual?

01:02:29.188 --> 01:02:30.730 align:middle line:84%
So you know, when
we look at trauma--

01:02:30.730 --> 01:02:33.820 align:middle line:84%
and we've talked about PTSD
and different traumatic

01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:37.030 align:middle line:84%
experiences, I like to
think of it as an empty cup.

01:02:37.030 --> 01:02:38.200 align:middle line:90%
So you've got a water glass.

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And something happens to you
when you're two years old

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:41.890 align:middle line:84%
and you pour a little
bit of water in

01:02:41.890 --> 01:02:43.307 align:middle line:84%
and that's a little
bit of trauma.

01:02:43.307 --> 01:02:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And then five years and 10
years and a horrible experience.

01:02:46.330 --> 01:02:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And eventually,
the cup overflows.

01:02:48.370 --> 01:02:50.620 align:middle line:84%
It's too much for
the body to handle.

01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:53.590 align:middle line:84%
That's why some people can
have one traumatic experience

01:02:53.590 --> 01:02:56.680 align:middle line:84%
and they can change from
it, they can grow from it.

01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:59.087 align:middle line:84%
There's post-traumatic
growth, is a thing.

01:02:59.087 --> 01:03:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And other people, a
soldier comes back

01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:02.740 align:middle line:90%
from war dealing with PTSD.

01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:05.740 align:middle line:84%
His nervous system, his
body, his brain, his spirit

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:07.450 align:middle line:90%
is just completely overwhelmed.

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:09.180 align:middle line:84%
He's just been
pouring water, right?

01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:10.930 align:middle line:84%
So what I did with
Scarlett in that moment

01:03:10.930 --> 01:03:13.120 align:middle line:84%
was, hey, what are the
other places in your life

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:15.370 align:middle line:84%
where there's some
trauma, there's some pain?

01:03:15.370 --> 01:03:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Can we suck up a
little of that water

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:20.980 align:middle line:84%
so then, this is a little
bit easier to handle?

01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:24.580 align:middle line:84%
She's done the tapping since
then continuously, often.

01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:25.510 align:middle line:90%
We've tapped together.

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:29.440 align:middle line:84%
She credits it to giving
her the energy and the drive

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:32.050 align:middle line:84%
to start the Jesse Lewis
Choose Love Foundation, which

01:03:32.050 --> 01:03:34.240 align:middle line:84%
is an amazing
organization that she

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:37.138 align:middle line:84%
started to teach social
emotional learning in schools.

01:03:37.138 --> 01:03:38.680 align:middle line:84%
With the Choose Love
program, there's

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:40.250 align:middle line:90%
a tapping component to it.

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:44.620 align:middle line:84%
So amazing, beautiful things
have come from that pain.

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And to me, especially
when we look at the work

01:03:47.770 --> 01:03:50.890 align:middle line:84%
that Lori did in Rwanda, the
things that have happened here,

01:03:50.890 --> 01:03:54.970 align:middle line:84%
it shows that in the deepest,
darkest, most painful, most

01:03:54.970 --> 01:03:57.400 align:middle line:84%
overwhelming places, we
can bring some light in.

01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we try
to do with tapping.

01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:00.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:01.940 align:middle line:90%
That's really beautiful.

01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:05.360 align:middle line:84%
This story of her, if I could
touch on her a little bit more,

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:07.040 align:middle line:84%
this lady actually
got to the point

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:11.810 align:middle line:84%
of forgiving this guy because
of what he was going through.

01:04:11.810 --> 01:04:13.567 align:middle line:90%
Now it makes my body shiver.

01:04:13.567 --> 01:04:14.900 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I can hardly believe it.

01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:16.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to cry
almost, you know?

01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:19.010 align:middle line:84%
But this is the highest
spiritual path, right?

01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:23.840 align:middle line:84%
The highest spiritual
evolution anyone could get to.

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:25.310 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell me
about how she got

01:04:25.310 --> 01:04:29.050 align:middle line:84%
to that point of being able to
essentially forgive this guy?

01:04:29.050 --> 01:04:31.025 align:middle line:90%
Like, that seems unimaginable.

01:04:31.025 --> 01:04:32.212 align:middle line:90%
>> Seems unimaginable.

01:04:32.212 --> 01:04:33.920 align:middle line:84%
Well look, I think
she did a lot of work.

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:34.100 align:middle line:90%
And.

01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:36.200 align:middle line:84%
She did a lot of tapping
and different tools.

01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:38.870 align:middle line:84%
But for that, there's
a grace involved.

01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And I tell you, I spent
a lot of time around her.

01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:42.545 align:middle line:90%
We've shared stages together.

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:43.670 align:middle line:90%
We've had lunches together.

01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:46.820 align:middle line:90%
We've tapped together.

01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:48.920 align:middle line:90%
I can tell you that it's true.

01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:51.020 align:middle line:84%
Like, it's easy to write
something in a book

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:52.970 align:middle line:84%
or to say something
in a documentary.

01:04:52.970 --> 01:04:55.500 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I forgive this person.

01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:56.520 align:middle line:90%
It's true for her.

01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:01.440 align:middle line:84%
She forgave the man who
murdered her six-year-old son

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:04.560 align:middle line:84%
in cold blood, along
with 19 other children.

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't just
say, I forgive him.

01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:08.540 align:middle line:90%
She did it.

01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And you can just tell,
if you hear her speak,

01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:13.490 align:middle line:84%
if you read her book,
Nurturing Healing Love,

01:05:13.490 --> 01:05:16.480 align:middle line:84%
if you're around
her, you just know.

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:20.240 align:middle line:84%
There's that essence of
forgiveness in a way that

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:22.420 align:middle line:90%
is hard to fathom.

01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:25.060 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you think tapping or
the other methodologies that

01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:27.220 align:middle line:84%
she did got her to the
point of doing that?

01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And do you think this is
an example that if someone

01:05:29.530 --> 01:05:32.290 align:middle line:84%
can go from that,
that you can forgive

01:05:32.290 --> 01:05:35.050 align:middle line:90%
this uncle that abused you or--

01:05:35.050 --> 01:05:38.612 align:middle line:84%
extrapolate out what this
could mean for the world?

01:05:38.612 --> 01:05:39.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, anything's possible.

01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:42.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look, what
she has done is

01:05:42.610 --> 01:05:47.140 align:middle line:84%
so profound and miraculous that
I just like to chalk it up as,

01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:49.450 align:middle line:84%
anything's possible and
we have this within us.

01:05:49.450 --> 01:05:50.890 align:middle line:84%
Tapping has been
one of the tools

01:05:50.890 --> 01:05:52.870 align:middle line:84%
that she's used,
and used it often.

01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:56.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm not willing to say, she
did tapping so she did this--

01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:57.520 align:middle line:90%
able to do this.

01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:01.210 align:middle line:84%
Because what she did is
just beyond comprehension.

01:06:01.210 --> 01:06:02.500 align:middle line:90%
So maybe it's the case.

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:06.280 align:middle line:84%
I just can't, in good
conscience say, oh,

01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:08.515 align:middle line:84%
that's what made
her forgive this.

01:06:08.515 --> 01:06:11.890 align:middle line:84%
There is a divinity, there
is a spirit behind her,

01:06:11.890 --> 01:06:14.410 align:middle line:84%
there's something greater
that she's accessed.

01:06:14.410 --> 01:06:17.080 align:middle line:84%
I think the tapping has
helped her access that.

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:19.390 align:middle line:84%
I think she's done a
lot of work and she's

01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:20.530 align:middle line:90%
been honest with herself.

01:06:20.530 --> 01:06:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And she has also locked
into a bigger mission,

01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:27.670 align:middle line:84%
and that's what's really
exciting about the work

01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:32.660 align:middle line:84%
that she is doing, is that she's
creating meaning behind that.

01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:35.440 align:middle line:84%
So back to Scarlett's house
on that Tuesday night,

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:39.510 align:middle line:84%
she took us around her
house and she showed us

01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:42.023 align:middle line:84%
paintings of Jesse
and pictures of Jesse.

01:06:42.023 --> 01:06:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And she showed us
this chalkboard.

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:45.930 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
this picture online.

01:06:45.930 --> 01:06:48.630 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the
cover of her book.

01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And in six-year-old handwriting
it says, nurturing, misspelled,

01:06:53.050 --> 01:06:55.680 align:middle line:84%
you know, kind of
funky, healing,

01:06:55.680 --> 01:07:00.340 align:middle line:90%
so healing is H-E-L-I-N-G, love.

01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote those words
on the chalkboard the day

01:07:03.370 --> 01:07:05.400 align:middle line:90%
before he died.

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:07.890 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't something
he would do normally.

01:07:07.890 --> 01:07:09.448 align:middle line:90%
It was just there.

01:07:09.448 --> 01:07:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And they're still there and
it's the cover of her book.

01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And he had a couple
other experiences.

01:07:14.050 --> 01:07:16.750 align:middle line:84%
He wrote a little
note to his brother,

01:07:16.750 --> 01:07:22.150 align:middle line:84%
JT, put it in his wallet that
just said, have a lot of fun.

01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:26.240 align:middle line:84%
It's like, yeah, I can't make
any sense of that, right?

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:31.160 align:middle line:84%
So she's used those things to
build this movement, to go,

01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:34.240 align:middle line:84%
as horrible as this was, is
there some meaning behind this?

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:39.890 align:middle line:84%
Can we create something greater
to help others heal from it?

01:07:39.890 --> 01:07:40.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, wow.

01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:43.420 align:middle line:90%
It's unfathomable.

01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>> It's unfathomable,
through and through.

01:07:45.350 --> 01:07:51.470 align:middle line:84%
But it opens us up
to the possibility

01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:53.570 align:middle line:84%
that, like you said,
any healing is possible.

01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:56.240 align:middle line:84%
If she can do it,
that means that it's

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:58.132 align:middle line:90%
within the grasp of all of us.

01:07:58.132 --> 01:07:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And that it's something
we can aspire to.

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:01.820 align:middle line:90%
I aspire to be like her.

01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:05.210 align:middle line:84%
I aspire to be as forgiving as
her in all aspects of my life,

01:08:05.210 --> 01:08:07.070 align:middle line:84%
and to have that
dedication and passion

01:08:07.070 --> 01:08:08.930 align:middle line:90%
and create that meaning.

01:08:08.930 --> 01:08:10.910 align:middle line:84%
So I think she's
someone that we can all

01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:13.993 align:middle line:84%
aspire to, be like, and also
know that transformation

01:08:13.993 --> 01:08:15.410 align:middle line:84%
is possible, that
no matter what's

01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:18.710 align:middle line:84%
happened to you in your
life, the deepest, darkest,

01:08:18.710 --> 01:08:21.490 align:middle line:90%
there's ways to heal from it.

01:08:21.490 --> 01:08:22.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Magic.

01:08:22.670 --> 01:08:24.609 align:middle line:84%
You know, really, to
sort of wrap up here,

01:08:24.609 --> 01:08:26.192 align:middle line:84%
I think we've covered
a lot of ground.

01:08:26.192 --> 01:08:28.519 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
your time and contribution

01:08:28.519 --> 01:08:29.319 align:middle line:90%
to this interview.

01:08:29.319 --> 01:08:32.217 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately,
the world has never

01:08:32.217 --> 01:08:34.300 align:middle line:84%
faced the kind of problems
it's facing now, right?

01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:37.180 align:middle line:90%
We have trauma.

01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:40.960 align:middle line:84%
We have you know people being
born out of post-World War II.

01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:44.540 align:middle line:84%
We have stress
like never before.

01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:47.830 align:middle line:84%
We have this
expectation to succeed

01:08:47.830 --> 01:08:50.439 align:middle line:84%
and to be successful in
either our parents' eyes

01:08:50.439 --> 01:08:52.930 align:middle line:84%
or to prove people wrong
or prove people right.

01:08:52.930 --> 01:08:54.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's coming at
us from every angle.

01:08:54.790 --> 01:08:58.149 align:middle line:84%
And we've never yet,
we've never ever seen

01:08:58.149 --> 01:09:00.850 align:middle line:84%
the amount of, for instance,
psychiatric medications

01:09:00.850 --> 01:09:02.649 align:middle line:90%
being taken each year.

01:09:02.649 --> 01:09:05.042 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a stunning
and dizzying array

01:09:05.042 --> 01:09:07.250 align:middle line:84%
of people that are taking
these types of medications.

01:09:07.250 --> 01:09:09.670 align:middle line:84%
So there's something that's
wrong with our culture

01:09:09.670 --> 01:09:13.779 align:middle line:90%
and society on a large scale.

01:09:13.779 --> 01:09:17.194 align:middle line:84%
This problem, how big is it and
how do you think that tapping--

01:09:17.194 --> 01:09:19.569 align:middle line:84%
and what do you think the
future is for emotional freedom

01:09:19.569 --> 01:09:21.430 align:middle line:84%
technique, for
tapping, for being

01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:23.439 align:middle line:84%
able to use these
simple techniques to be

01:09:23.439 --> 01:09:25.479 align:middle line:84%
able to calm and
ease the pain have

01:09:25.479 --> 01:09:26.785 align:middle line:90%
for the future of humanity?

01:09:26.785 --> 01:09:27.585 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:09:27.585 --> 01:09:29.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, I agree with
your diagnosis.

01:09:29.410 --> 01:09:31.979 align:middle line:90%
And it's a sad one.

01:09:31.979 --> 01:09:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Alongside that,
the positive side

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:35.890 align:middle line:84%
is, because there's
so much happening

01:09:35.890 --> 01:09:39.130 align:middle line:84%
that people are exploring
meditation and tapping

01:09:39.130 --> 01:09:41.500 align:middle line:84%
and exercise and nutrition
in ways that maybe they

01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:42.710 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't 20 years ago.

01:09:42.710 --> 01:09:45.399 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, if we're trying
to be positive about it,

01:09:45.399 --> 01:09:47.560 align:middle line:84%
the angst and the
level of the challenge

01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:49.240 align:middle line:84%
is bringing other
solutions forward.

01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:52.240 align:middle line:84%
So potentially, can we
bring down that angst,

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:54.370 align:middle line:84%
bring up the
solutions, and then get

01:09:54.370 --> 01:09:57.820 align:middle line:84%
to be in a better
place than ever before?

01:09:57.820 --> 01:09:59.500 align:middle line:90%
The world doesn't stop now.

01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:00.500 align:middle line:90%
It's 24/7.

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:02.830 align:middle line:84%
I know it's so
cliche to say, well,

01:10:02.830 --> 01:10:04.952 align:middle line:84%
social media is
a big part of it.

01:10:04.952 --> 01:10:06.910 align:middle line:84%
There's so many good
things about social media.

01:10:06.910 --> 01:10:10.060 align:middle line:84%
We've been able to share our
message in a big way, share

01:10:10.060 --> 01:10:12.010 align:middle line:84%
tapping meditations
and processes

01:10:12.010 --> 01:10:13.225 align:middle line:90%
and you've done the same.

01:10:13.225 --> 01:10:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, so there's
this positive side of it.

01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And then there's just
a lurking underbelly

01:10:18.430 --> 01:10:20.440 align:middle line:90%
that is really nasty.

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And not nasty in terms of the
trolls and political discourse.

01:10:24.130 --> 01:10:26.020 align:middle line:90%
That's a whole other beast.

01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:28.780 align:middle line:84%
But nasty in terms of,
people feeling like they're

01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:31.055 align:middle line:90%
full and complete human beings.

01:10:31.055 --> 01:10:32.680 align:middle line:84%
The challenge with
social media is that

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:34.690 align:middle line:84%
no matter what you're
doing in your life,

01:10:34.690 --> 01:10:36.850 align:middle line:84%
there's someone out there
doing it better, right?

01:10:36.850 --> 01:10:39.850 align:middle line:84%
So there's someone out there
who sells more books than I do.

01:10:39.850 --> 01:10:42.010 align:middle line:84%
Someone out there who
gets more likes than I do.

01:10:42.010 --> 01:10:44.200 align:middle line:84%
Someone out there who's got a
bigger business in this space

01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:45.000 align:middle line:90%
than I do.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.930 align:middle line:84%
Someone out there who has
more followers than I do.

01:10:47.930 --> 01:10:49.690 align:middle line:90%
So if my self worth--

01:10:49.690 --> 01:10:50.660 align:middle line:90%
that's what I do.

01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:52.810 align:middle line:84%
I share this information
and put out products

01:10:52.810 --> 01:10:55.180 align:middle line:84%
and we have an email lists
and we're on social media.

01:10:55.180 --> 01:10:59.020 align:middle line:84%
If my self worth was
dictated on that,

01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:02.400 align:middle line:90%
I'd be failing every single day.

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:05.100 align:middle line:84%
That is happening
over and over again

01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:07.020 align:middle line:90%
for people around the world.

01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's these micro
little experiences

01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:12.997 align:middle line:84%
where you go, well, that
person looks like they're

01:11:12.997 --> 01:11:13.830 align:middle line:90%
having a great time.

01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:16.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we all know that
social media isn't real,

01:11:16.990 --> 01:11:18.240 align:middle line:90%
that the pictures aren't real.

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.220 align:middle line:84%
Now filters and
photos are so amazing,

01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:22.310 align:middle line:84%
which is great for
your kids, right?

01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:24.720 align:middle line:84%
Like I love the pictures
I could take of June

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:26.910 align:middle line:90%
and how great they come out.

01:11:26.910 --> 01:11:29.870 align:middle line:84%
But it makes everything
look beautiful and perfect.

01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:30.803 align:middle line:90%
And even though--

01:11:30.803 --> 01:11:32.970 align:middle line:84%
I think most people watching
know consciously, yeah,

01:11:32.970 --> 01:11:34.320 align:middle line:90%
social media isn't real.

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:35.210 align:middle line:90%
The brain doesn't.

01:11:35.210 --> 01:11:38.932 align:middle line:84%
You're scanning and you're
scrolling and it's perfectly--

01:11:38.932 --> 01:11:40.890 align:middle line:84%
there have been times
that I've been scrolling.

01:11:40.890 --> 01:11:43.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm personally not
a huge social media fan,

01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:46.420 align:middle line:84%
but I'm scrolling on Instagram
and I will throw my phone down.

01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Because I just see that my
brain can't stop doing this.

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:52.380 align:middle line:84%
It's looking for
this extra little hit

01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:56.388 align:middle line:84%
of dopamine, this extra
little interesting thing.

01:11:56.388 --> 01:11:57.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be
doomsday about it.

01:11:57.930 --> 01:12:00.660 align:middle line:84%
I think that people are
starting to recognize

01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:03.270 align:middle line:84%
that doing social media
breaks, the social media

01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:05.670 align:middle line:84%
companies themselves, even
though they're often driven

01:12:05.670 --> 01:12:07.997 align:middle line:84%
by profits, are looking
around and going, well,

01:12:07.997 --> 01:12:09.580 align:middle line:84%
we've got to fix
some of these things.

01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:13.380 align:middle line:84%
Because I think there are caring
people within those companies.

01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And they also recognize, hey,
if everyone closes Instagram

01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:18.307 align:middle line:84%
or Facebook because
it's so detrimental

01:12:18.307 --> 01:12:20.640 align:middle line:84%
to their mental health, they're
going to lose customers.

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:25.290 align:middle line:84%
So hopefully, there's a
balance that we are landing on.

01:12:25.290 --> 01:12:28.590 align:middle line:84%
Just our phones ourselves,
we've never been as connected

01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:30.305 align:middle line:90%
as we are now.

01:12:30.305 --> 01:12:31.680 align:middle line:84%
So that's all the
doomsday stuff.

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:32.680 align:middle line:90%
That's all the pressure.

01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:35.370 align:middle line:84%
That's all the internal
incoming stimulation.

01:12:35.370 --> 01:12:37.830 align:middle line:84%
The upside is, hey,
you get an Instagram ad

01:12:37.830 --> 01:12:40.920 align:middle line:84%
for the new meditation app
or The Tapping Solution app.

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:41.850 align:middle line:90%
And you use it.

01:12:41.850 --> 01:12:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And potentially, you
were on Instagram

01:12:43.530 --> 01:12:44.820 align:middle line:90%
and having a hard time.

01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And you get The Tapping Solution
app because you saw an ad.

01:12:47.490 --> 01:12:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And now you'll heal a
trauma from 20 years ago,

01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:51.810 align:middle line:84%
or you forgive someone
from something they've

01:12:51.810 --> 01:12:54.090 align:middle line:90%
said last week or last month.

01:12:54.090 --> 01:12:57.660 align:middle line:84%
So my hope is that, like I
said, the level of the challenge

01:12:57.660 --> 01:13:00.120 align:middle line:84%
is going to make us rise up
and create a better world.

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:02.740 align:middle line:84%
But it's certainly
tricky out there.

01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:03.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:04.590 align:middle line:90%
So good.

01:13:04.590 --> 01:13:05.580 align:middle line:84%
There was definitely
something that

01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:06.955 align:middle line:84%
came up for me
when I first tried

01:13:06.955 --> 01:13:08.910 align:middle line:90%
is just the skepticism, man.

01:13:08.910 --> 01:13:10.950 align:middle line:90%
Like it's just nuts, right?

01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And Laurentine got way into
tapping during her pregnancy,

01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:15.630 align:middle line:84%
just to get over the
fear of pregnancy.

01:13:15.630 --> 01:13:17.970 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a lot
of trauma that can get

01:13:17.970 --> 01:13:19.260 align:middle line:90%
carried in lineages.

01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:22.015 align:middle line:84%
And she found out later that
her mother and mother's mother

01:13:22.015 --> 01:13:23.640 align:middle line:84%
had gone through
things at birth, which

01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:24.970 align:middle line:90%
made her a little bit fearful.

01:13:24.970 --> 01:13:27.210 align:middle line:84%
So she didn't realize, why
am I a little bit fearful

01:13:27.210 --> 01:13:28.020 align:middle line:90%
of this birth?

01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:28.470 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:29.670 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't-- my body
knows what to do.

01:13:29.670 --> 01:13:30.220 align:middle line:90%
Come on, it's easy.

01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:31.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to die anymore.

01:13:31.050 --> 01:13:32.612 align:middle line:84%
People don't die
anymore, you know?

01:13:32.612 --> 01:13:33.570 align:middle line:90%
But then she would tap.

01:13:33.570 --> 01:13:34.290 align:middle line:90%
She'd just go tap.

01:13:34.290 --> 01:13:35.290 align:middle line:90%
And she was a bit of a renegade.

01:13:35.290 --> 01:13:37.040 align:middle line:84%
She was just tapping
everywhere, you know?

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:38.360 align:middle line:90%
Just yelling out in the park.

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:41.820 align:middle line:84%
But she's someone
that doesn't really--

01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:43.380 align:middle line:84%
she's skeptical for
a second and then

01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:44.340 align:middle line:84%
she just switches on
and goes, hang on.

01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:44.850 align:middle line:90%
Let me look at it.

01:13:44.850 --> 01:13:46.180 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'm not skeptical anymore.

01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:47.932 align:middle line:84%
Most people are skeptical
as all hell when

01:13:47.932 --> 01:13:49.140 align:middle line:90%
they approach tapping, right?

01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:50.410 align:middle line:90%
Because it's weird.

01:13:50.410 --> 01:13:51.210 align:middle line:90%
It's funky.

01:13:51.210 --> 01:13:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And then especially
when you say Chinese

01:13:52.890 --> 01:13:55.230 align:middle line:84%
and then you're like acupuncture
and modern psychology,

01:13:55.230 --> 01:13:58.770 align:middle line:84%
how do you convince
skeptics or how

01:13:58.770 --> 01:14:03.630 align:middle line:84%
would, say, a 73-year-old
suffering anxiety or trauma

01:14:03.630 --> 01:14:07.960 align:middle line:84%
approach tapping because it
seems so unusual, in a way?

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:08.760 align:middle line:90%
>> 100%.

01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:09.560 align:middle line:90%
There's two sides.

01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:12.540 align:middle line:90%
One is, just give it 10 minutes.

01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:13.560 align:middle line:90%
Try it.

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:15.845 align:middle line:84%
Put aside your skepticism
for 10 minutes.

01:14:15.845 --> 01:14:16.720 align:middle line:90%
That's all I ask for.

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:19.660 align:middle line:84%
You can be a skeptic again
after the 10 minutes.

01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:21.510 align:middle line:90%
Try and have an experience.

01:14:21.510 --> 01:14:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And then see if
it works for you.

01:14:23.170 --> 01:14:24.210 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't work for
you, you could just

01:14:24.210 --> 01:14:26.293 align:middle line:84%
say, well, that guy was
crazy and he's full of it.

01:14:26.293 --> 01:14:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And you can move
on with your life.

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:28.640 align:middle line:90%
Do something else.

01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:29.980 align:middle line:90%
So that is one approach.

01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:31.840 align:middle line:84%
The other one is, as
I mentioned earlier,

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:35.080 align:middle line:84%
we've got 100 research studies,
more coming out all the time.

01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:37.740 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you that in
our Tapping Solution app,

01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:41.130 align:middle line:84%
we've completed 700,000
individual sessions.

01:14:41.130 --> 01:14:44.340 align:middle line:84%
So that's 700,000 times, it's
only been out for 10 months

01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:47.590 align:middle line:84%
now, that individual
people have said,

01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:49.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to use this process.

01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:51.960 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot to be said
for just that, that there's

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:54.840 align:middle line:84%
700,000 times we'd go,
this is going to help me.

01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:56.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take
my time and do this.

01:14:56.590 --> 01:14:58.993 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that, we've
got data on all those.

01:14:58.993 --> 01:15:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And we're starting
to crunch the numbers

01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:02.740 align:middle line:84%
and we'll have
studies based on that.

01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:06.780 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you, 150,000
sessions completed on anxiety.

01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:09.730 align:middle line:84%
We have a free anxiety
tapping meditation.

01:15:09.730 --> 01:15:12.718 align:middle line:84%
So 150,000 times,
someone was anxious.

01:15:12.718 --> 01:15:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And when the meditation
starts, we have a 0 to 10

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:16.813 align:middle line:90%
scale like we did before.

01:15:16.813 --> 01:15:17.730 align:middle line:90%
They rate it in there.

01:15:17.730 --> 01:15:20.660 align:middle line:84%
They go, it's an eight, or
it's a seven, it's a six.

01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:23.700 align:middle line:84%
10 minutes of tapping and
then we have a new number.

01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:26.580 align:middle line:84%
These are people from
around the world, literally,

01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:30.310 align:middle line:84%
all ages, all demographics, all
income, showing those numbers.

01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:34.140 align:middle line:84%
150,000 sessions, 49%
decrease, as of today.

01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:37.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure it will go up a point
and down a point, in anxiety,

01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:40.630 align:middle line:90%
over 150,000 sessions.

01:15:40.630 --> 01:15:42.420 align:middle line:84%
So when I look at
that-- and that's

01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:44.490 align:middle line:84%
why I'm excited about
the data going forward.

01:15:44.490 --> 01:15:48.600 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of hard to argue that
150,000 people were full of it

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:51.450 align:middle line:84%
or changed their number
just for the heck of it

01:15:51.450 --> 01:15:53.760 align:middle line:84%
or did it again to
waste their time.

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:55.710 align:middle line:84%
It's tough to get
data like that.

01:15:55.710 --> 01:15:58.340 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, we have
a study of 25 people.

01:15:58.340 --> 01:16:01.153 align:middle line:84%
Oh, 25 people showed that
when they did this at night,

01:16:01.153 --> 01:16:02.070 align:middle line:90%
they got better sleep.

01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:04.020 align:middle line:84%
And people go, whoa,
we should do that.

01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:04.890 align:middle line:90%
It's 25 people.

01:16:04.890 --> 01:16:08.020 align:middle line:84%
This is 150,000
individual sessions.

01:16:08.020 --> 01:16:10.690 align:middle line:84%
These are data sets that
we've never had before.

01:16:10.690 --> 01:16:14.910 align:middle line:84%
So if you're a
skeptic, 49% anxiety

01:16:14.910 --> 01:16:16.200 align:middle line:90%
reduction in 10 minutes.

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:18.817 align:middle line:84%
I mean, reducing
by half on average,

01:16:18.817 --> 01:16:21.150 align:middle line:84%
which means that some people
reduce by more, some people

01:16:21.150 --> 01:16:23.520 align:middle line:84%
by less, that's a
pretty profound result

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:26.020 align:middle line:90%
and I think worth trying it.

01:16:26.020 --> 01:16:26.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:27.480 align:middle line:90%
Good answer.

01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:28.060 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:28.860 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:30.780 align:middle line:84%
Nick, it's been a
pleasure speaking to you.

01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:31.780 align:middle line:90%
It's been too long.

01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:32.730 align:middle line:90%
>> It's been too long.

01:16:32.730 --> 01:16:32.970 align:middle line:90%
I know.

01:16:32.970 --> 01:16:34.848 align:middle line:84%
Well, we rotate around
each other online

01:16:34.848 --> 01:16:35.890 align:middle line:90%
and see what we're doing.

01:16:35.890 --> 01:16:38.460 align:middle line:84%
So it always feels
like we're connecting.

01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:40.590 align:middle line:90%
But you are in my heart always.

01:16:40.590 --> 01:16:43.040 align:middle line:84%
We've been on this
journey for a long time.

01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:46.770 align:middle line:84%
Like we said, we were in the
same stages of making a film

01:16:46.770 --> 01:16:47.960 align:middle line:90%
and putting it out there.

01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:48.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:49.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:50.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Don't know what we're doing.

01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:52.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Have no idea what we
were doing, you know?

01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And I just want to credit
you again for sticking with it

01:16:55.230 --> 01:16:59.610 align:middle line:84%
and making sure that you stay
consistent with the awesome

01:16:59.610 --> 01:17:04.270 align:middle line:84%
discovery that you helped bring
to more people by coalescing

01:17:04.270 --> 01:17:06.520 align:middle line:84%
and collaborating with great
experts around the world.

01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:08.580 align:middle line:84%
You've been helping to
improve the visibility

01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:09.732 align:middle line:90%
of this important practice.

01:17:09.732 --> 01:17:11.940 align:middle line:84%
I know it's something that
Laurentine turns to a lot.

01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:14.220 align:middle line:84%
Occasionally, I use
it myself as well.

01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And I find it's a
really powerful practice

01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:17.220 align:middle line:90%
to just calm the body.

01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:19.637 align:middle line:84%
Like you said, in the first
instance, that's what it does.

01:17:19.637 --> 01:17:21.300 align:middle line:90%
It helps to calm the body down.

01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:22.140 align:middle line:84%
I think it's awesome
what are you doing.

01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:22.710 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for your time.

01:17:22.710 --> 01:17:23.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.
