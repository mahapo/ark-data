00:00:04.248 --> 00:00:07.380 align:middle line:90%


00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.597 align:middle line:10%
It's James here
from Food Matters,

00:00:09.597 --> 00:00:12.650 align:middle line:10%
and today I'm speaking with
Vishen Lakhiani, the founder

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.190 align:middle line:10%
of Mindvalley and someone who is
deeply committed and concerned

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.440 align:middle line:10%
to pushing humanity
forward and shifting

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.600 align:middle line:10%
the shape of consciousness
on planet Earth,

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.738 align:middle line:10%
and also the future
of education.

00:00:22.738 --> 00:00:24.780 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be touching
on a few topics today,

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.830 align:middle line:90%
and I'm excited to chat.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:26.630 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Vishen.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.430 align:middle line:90%
How are you doing?

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, James.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>> So we live in a Western,
educated, industrialized, rich,

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.470 align:middle line:90%
and democratic society.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.860 align:middle line:84%
We make up about 10% to 12%
of the global population,

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.710 align:middle line:84%
and yet we seem to have
figured certain things out

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.540 align:middle line:84%
but completely failed
at other things.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.570 align:middle line:84%
How have we ended up so
unhappy, depressed, anxious,

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.890 align:middle line:84%
and really struggling with
this modern culturescape,

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.810 align:middle line:90%
as you call it, that we live in?

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think it's really
part of the growth process,

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.280 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.160 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
to understand is

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.770 align:middle line:84%
that all of us, whether you
live in the Western world or you

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.560 align:middle line:84%
live in a very traditional
society like in India

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.080 align:middle line:84%
or in China, we are all
like fish swimming in water.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.660 align:middle line:84%
A fish swimming in water cannot
see and has no idea that it is

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.390 align:middle line:84%
in water because it is
so immersed in water.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.460 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, when we
live in this world,

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.060 align:middle line:84%
we are immersed in the
culturescape-- a tangled web

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.510 align:middle line:84%
of rituals, beliefs,
ideologies, dogma,

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.590 align:middle line:84%
ideas spread from generation
to generation to generation.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.400 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know that all of
this exists solely in our head.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Ken Wilbur says that there
are two types of reality.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.130 align:middle line:90%
There is absolute truth.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.437 align:middle line:84%
Absolute truth is
this rock is hard,

00:01:42.437 --> 00:01:44.270 align:middle line:84%
and if I hit you on the
head with this rock,

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.620 align:middle line:90%
it's going to hurt.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.020 align:middle line:84%
Every society, every
culture can agree to that.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.570 align:middle line:90%
And then there's relative truth.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And relative truth is the ideas
that we have individually,

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.810 align:middle line:84%
culture by culture by
culture, on love, marriage,

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.960 align:middle line:84%
relationship, the definition
of ideas like success,

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.740 align:middle line:84%
career, the 9:00 to 5:00, our
ideas of God or what is right

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.750 align:middle line:90%
or what is wrong or morality.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of the stuff
that's stressing us out

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.670 align:middle line:84%
is stuff that doesn't
actually exist.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.130 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't exist.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.350 align:middle line:84%
It simply exists
in our own heads

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.560 align:middle line:84%
in this realm of relative truth
because we are conditioned

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.690 align:middle line:90%
to believe that it is so.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.430 align:middle line:90%
So let me give you an example.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.320 align:middle line:84%
I recently got
divorced, and it was

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.770 align:middle line:84%
one of the most beautiful,
amazing, conscious experiences.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.500 align:middle line:84%
My wife and I, we were
together for 19 years.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And we decided to do a
conscious uncoupling.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And what that
meant is we decided

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.800 align:middle line:84%
to end our idea of
foreverness, but do it

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.650 align:middle line:84%
in the most conscious way where
we stayed friends and business

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.540 align:middle line:90%
partners and co-parents.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.360 align:middle line:84%
But we were the tiny
fraction of people

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.160 align:middle line:84%
who actually went
through a divorce

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.840 align:middle line:90%
and had an incredible time.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.720 align:middle line:84%
In fact, after our divorce,
we took an eight-day holiday

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.770 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.040 align:middle line:84%
But most people when they go
through a divorce, it's pain.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.710 align:middle line:84%
It's agony because
the culturescape,

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.770 align:middle line:84%
the collective ideology
of what is real,

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.400 align:middle line:84%
has conditioned them to
believe that love is forever,

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.920 align:middle line:84%
that when you marry someone,
you stay with them forever,

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.260 align:middle line:90%
till death do you part.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes
time for that to end,

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.700 align:middle line:90%
it is an unmitigated disaster.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And you should be
ashamed, and you

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.490 align:middle line:84%
should fight that other person
for whatever you built up

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:30.580 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.560 align:middle line:84%
So you see, the culturescape
is filled with outdated dogma

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.880 align:middle line:90%
and ideology.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.850 align:middle line:84%
I call these rules
our bullshit rules.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.170 align:middle line:84%
We are living within
the context of rules.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.330 align:middle line:84%
They are rules that
serve us-- don't jump off

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.830 align:middle line:84%
a tall building-- and they
are rules that hold us back.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.680 align:middle line:84%
The cause of all our
stress, all our anxiety,

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.260 align:middle line:84%
all our fear in
the Western world

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.980 align:middle line:84%
is because as we built up this
vast culturescape that moves us

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.510 align:middle line:84%
forward, we are also
getting ourselves tangled up

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.220 align:middle line:90%
in this web of rules.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.688 align:middle line:84%
>> Profound message
there for humanity.

00:04:08.688 --> 00:04:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the
things you are doing

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.997 align:middle line:84%
is trying to test those
rules in your actions,

00:04:12.997 --> 00:04:14.330 align:middle line:90%
in your life which is fantastic.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.029 align:middle line:90%
It's fun to follow.

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:18.399 align:middle line:84%
One of the deeply
entrenched systems

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:22.540 align:middle line:84%
we have in our modern world
is this idea of education.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And from the day
we're born, we're

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.990 align:middle line:84%
sort of pushed into
this system that people

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.390 align:middle line:90%
say has been designed--

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.550 align:middle line:84%
either it's by design or
whether it's an accident

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:34.930 align:middle line:90%
or it's an Industrial Era thing.

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.388 align:middle line:84%
What are your thoughts on the
founding ideas and intentions

00:04:37.388 --> 00:04:39.340 align:middle line:84%
of the education
system, and where do you

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.070 align:middle line:84%
think its biggest
failings are currently?

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.600 align:middle line:84%
>> So my views on the
education system--

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.620 align:middle line:84%
the education system is one
of those elements of society

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.580 align:middle line:84%
that just hasn't evolved
as rapidly as it should.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.790 align:middle line:84%
You see, according to Ray
Kurzweil, the VP of technology

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.400 align:middle line:84%
of Google, by 2029, all
of us within our pockets

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.160 align:middle line:84%
will have our own personalized
artificial intelligence.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.620 align:middle line:84%
If you've watched
Marvel's "Avengers,"

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Iron Man has his AI, Jarvis,
that runs his entire life.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.520 align:middle line:84%
All of us are about to
get our own personalized

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.050 align:middle line:90%
Jarvis within the next decade.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.357 align:middle line:84%
This is also going to
be true for our kids.

00:05:17.357 --> 00:05:19.690 align:middle line:84%
This is also going to be true
for kids in the developing

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.120 align:middle line:84%
world because the cost of
smartphones and tablets

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.250 align:middle line:90%
is going to drop to $10 apiece.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.990 align:middle line:84%
What this means
is that all of us

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.360 align:middle line:84%
are going to have
a backup brain.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Suchitra Mitra, who won the
TED Prize for Education--

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.120 align:middle line:84%
I once heard him
speak, and he said

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.700 align:middle line:84%
the way we educate our
kids is ridiculous.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.030 align:middle line:84%
So someone asked, what do
we need to stop teaching?

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And he said, stop
teaching spelling.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Stop teaching math
because our kids

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.620 align:middle line:84%
are going to have a backup
brain that can already do that.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Why are we teaching them skills
that were needed in 1970?

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.730 align:middle line:84%
So then the question is,
what do we teach our kids?

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, we teach our
kids transformation.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.520 align:middle line:84%
There is a difference between
learning and transformation.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.350 align:middle line:90%
Learning is facts and figures.

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.430 align:middle line:84%
Learning is stuff that
you easily forget,

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.680 align:middle line:90%
but transformation is different.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.330 align:middle line:84%
Transformation is
beyond learning.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.420 align:middle line:84%
Transformation is an
expansion of your worldview.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And a mind, once
expanded, can never again

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.920 align:middle line:90%
shrink to its original size.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And once your worldview changes
where you become more authentic

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.290 align:middle line:84%
or you become more
empathetic and kind

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.490 align:middle line:84%
or you become more compassionate
or you become more autonomous,

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.020 align:middle line:90%
you never lose that sense.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, philosophers and
anthropologists and professors

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.220 align:middle line:84%
who study transformation
say that transformation

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.990 align:middle line:84%
in the world today
comes from two things.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.770 align:middle line:84%
The first is the
disorienting dilemma.

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.630 align:middle line:84%
It is the setback,
the suffering,

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:52.080 align:middle line:84%
the thing that pounds you
and knocks you off course.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.260 align:middle line:84%
But when you bounce back
from that bankruptcy

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.580 align:middle line:84%
or from that broken heart
or from that divorce

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.462 align:middle line:84%
or from that bout in
hospital, you are wiser,

00:06:59.462 --> 00:07:01.170 align:middle line:84%
and you see the world
in a different way.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And you know what you need to
do next to avoid that setback.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.330 align:middle line:90%
Google did a study.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.060 align:middle line:84%
This was cited in Salim
Ismail's fantastic book,

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.980 align:middle line:90%
"Exponential Organizations."

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.340 align:middle line:84%
Google found that its
best people were not,

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.100 align:middle line:84%
contrary to popular
belief, STEM graduates--

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.020 align:middle line:84%
Science, Technology,
Engineering, Math--

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:26.160 align:middle line:84%
but young people who had
gone through suffering

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.920 align:middle line:84%
and had emerged from
that suffering humbler,

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.350 align:middle line:90%
kinder, more compassionate.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.150 align:middle line:90%
Those were the best people.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:37.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, transformation
comes from suffering,

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:42.870 align:middle line:84%
but it also comes from a gradual
expansion of meaning schema.

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:45.180 align:middle line:84%
This gradual expanding
of meaning schema

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.635 align:middle line:84%
is when we learn from mentors,
when we travel the world, when

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:50.760 align:middle line:84%
we're introduced to people
who have figured it out,

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.610 align:middle line:84%
and they are willing to
help us figure it out,

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.040 align:middle line:90%
when we wisen up.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:00.960 align:middle line:84%
The point of education has to
be to speed up the accumulation

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.490 align:middle line:90%
of meaning schema--

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:05.700 align:middle line:84%
in short, to speed up wisdom,
to speed up transformation

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.980 align:middle line:84%
so that the human
machine doesn't

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.560 align:middle line:90%
have to go through suffering.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And when we do go
through suffering,

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:16.295 align:middle line:84%
we know how to sail past
it and see it as a lesson.

00:08:16.295 --> 00:08:17.670 align:middle line:84%
So the problem
with our education

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:21.810 align:middle line:84%
is it isn't paying enough
attention to helping people

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:25.440 align:middle line:84%
transform by teaching them new
definitions of relationships,

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.080 align:middle line:84%
new definitions of
love, by teaching them

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.450 align:middle line:84%
that the dogma of
organized religion

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:33.299 align:middle line:84%
can often create
pain and setback,

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:35.575 align:middle line:84%
and to teach them new
models of spirituality,

00:08:35.575 --> 00:08:37.950 align:middle line:84%
to teach them creativity, to
teach them entrepreneurship,

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.570 align:middle line:84%
to teach them that
love doesn't have

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:40.980 align:middle line:90%
to come from outside forces.

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.720 align:middle line:90%
It can be generated within.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.763 align:middle line:84%
That you are enough as
you are, no matter what

00:08:45.763 --> 00:08:48.180 align:middle line:84%
your parents or your teacher
or your preacher or the media

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:48.780 align:middle line:90%
says.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.180 align:middle line:84%
There are so many different
components of transformation

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.360 align:middle line:84%
that we can serve up to
our children, yet we don't.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.550 align:middle line:84%
We teach people
biology, but we do not

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:59.580 align:middle line:84%
teach them how to
extend their lifespans

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.290 align:middle line:90%
and exist in a healthy way.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:04.470 align:middle line:84%
We teach people morality,
but we don't teach them

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.830 align:middle line:84%
how to truly be
compassionate and empathize

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.210 align:middle line:90%
with other human beings.

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:11.520 align:middle line:84%
We teach people to sing
the national anthem,

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.710 align:middle line:84%
but we don't teach them
that in today's world,

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:17.460 align:middle line:84%
we are citizens of
Spaceship Earth,

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.640 align:middle line:84%
and we need to join
hands across borders.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:25.260 align:middle line:84%
We teach people accounting,
but we don't teach them

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.210 align:middle line:84%
how to be an
entrepreneur and how

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.190 align:middle line:84%
to deal with the
setbacks and the failure

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:31.800 align:middle line:84%
that you might face when
you go on that journey.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.610 align:middle line:84%
So modern education is
defunct because it's

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:40.175 align:middle line:84%
training people for an age
before the backup brain.

00:09:40.175 --> 00:09:41.300 align:middle line:90%
>> This is really profound.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.030 align:middle line:84%
One thing I want to touch on,
and I think we're segueing

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:45.770 align:middle line:84%
into-- and I think you covered
education really well there--

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:51.100 align:middle line:84%
is we're not teaching
our children how

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:56.020 align:middle line:84%
to transform, to love, to
connect, to be empathetic,

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.330 align:middle line:84%
these critical skills
to master their biology.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:02.350 align:middle line:84%
But then how-- if somebody
is an adult, they're 45,

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:07.750 align:middle line:84%
and now they're approaching this
idea that they're dealing with

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:10.270 align:middle line:84%
trauma that they
were born into--

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:13.060 align:middle line:84%
they're dealing with
maybe a narcissistic

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:16.480 align:middle line:84%
or an abusive parent, or they're
dealing with physical trauma

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.595 align:middle line:90%
when they were younger.

00:10:17.595 --> 00:10:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And so they've passed
through the education system.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.520 align:middle line:90%
They're old.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.730 align:middle line:90%
They're out of that system.

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Of course they can re-educate
and look at programs

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:26.887 align:middle line:84%
you're doing, but how do we deal
with these emotional traumas,

00:10:26.887 --> 00:10:28.720 align:middle line:84%
circling in on this one
particular vertical?

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.000 align:middle line:84%
Because I think this is one
of the biggest challenges

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.110 align:middle line:90%
of our time.

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:34.870 align:middle line:84%
We've all suffered some
form of conditional love,

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:37.060 align:middle line:84%
or we've all suffered
some form of trauma,

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.580 align:middle line:84%
and yet we reach our
40s or 50s, and we're

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.590 align:middle line:84%
trying to deal with
that as an adult.

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:43.720 align:middle line:84%
How do we become aware
of that, and how do we

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.560 align:middle line:90%
heal some of those problems?

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So all of us face certain
trauma, sufferings, setback.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.700 align:middle line:84%
How do we become aware
of that and heal that?

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.080 align:middle line:84%
That is the essence
of transformation.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.740 align:middle line:84%
It's when you're able
to expand your worldview

00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:00.250 align:middle line:84%
to see the cause of this trauma,
the cause of this suffering,

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:02.410 align:middle line:90%
and move beyond it.

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:04.690 align:middle line:84%
Victor Frankl in "Man's
Search for Meaning"

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:07.930 align:middle line:84%
said "when meaning is
given to suffering,

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:10.360 align:middle line:90%
it ceases to become suffering."

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.400 align:middle line:84%
One of the greatest
things that we

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.750 align:middle line:84%
can grow into as we get
older is the ability

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:20.530 align:middle line:84%
to look back at the suffering,
the trauma, the pain

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:22.720 align:middle line:84%
that we went
through, and see how,

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.510 align:middle line:84%
within these moments of
pain, there were lessons

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:29.170 align:middle line:84%
to be learned, and how this pain
made us stronger, more whole,

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:31.430 align:middle line:90%
more complete individuals.

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:34.240 align:middle line:84%
One of the root causes
of transformation

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.970 align:middle line:84%
is a concept called a
disorienting dilemma,

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:42.100 align:middle line:84%
which means that a
pain that is horrible--

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:45.100 align:middle line:84%
it's something that shakes
you, but through that, you

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.600 align:middle line:90%
become a better person.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, I like to
look back at pain.

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:54.970 align:middle line:84%
I like to look back at suffering
and see how, from that moment,

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:57.880 align:middle line:84%
there was an insight
or a new idea

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.570 align:middle line:84%
or a new sense of
myself that emerged.

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:05.110 align:middle line:84%
The Rumi said, "the wound
is the part through which

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:06.660 align:middle line:90%
the light enters."

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And the Rumi also said, "all
ye who cannot take a good rub,

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.880 align:middle line:84%
how will you ever
become a polished gem?"

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And so when we look
back at suffering

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:17.920 align:middle line:84%
and see how it made us
whole, it gave us lessons,

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.477 align:middle line:90%
it ceases to become suffering.

00:12:20.477 --> 00:12:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
the greatest skills

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.700 align:middle line:90%
that a human being can learn.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:29.090 align:middle line:84%
There is a light on the
other end of suffering.

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:32.180 align:middle line:84%
So I like to look back
at moments of pain.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm about to
enter a moment of pain,

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.850 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a
project that failed

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:42.320 align:middle line:84%
or a person who treated me
unkindly, I ask myself, wow,

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.730 align:middle line:90%
this is kind of exciting.

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:46.990 align:middle line:84%
I wonder what I'm going
to learn from that.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:48.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Great question to ask.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was taught everything
is absolutely always unfolding

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:53.140 align:middle line:84%
perfectly, which
trains you to see

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:54.440 align:middle line:90%
the perfection in every moment.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's a fast track
to transformation.

00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:01.450 align:middle line:84%
A lot of our failings get
brought up in parenting.

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And many people are not aware
of their subconscious behavior

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.840 align:middle line:84%
until they have a child
that they're parenting,

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:11.140 align:middle line:84%
and then they witness themselves
behaving in ways that they

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:12.340 align:middle line:90%
maybe shouldn't.

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:14.920 align:middle line:84%
You've worked with Shefali
and a few others, who--

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:15.940 align:middle line:90%
I adore her work.

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:19.240 align:middle line:84%
I think she's going to help
heal the next generation

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.910 align:middle line:84%
and maybe cut some of the
servers that are holding us

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:23.200 align:middle line:90%
back from evolving.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:27.610 align:middle line:84%
What's your thoughts on this
parenting dilemma in that you

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:30.430 align:middle line:84%
are finding your
failings as a new parent,

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:35.860 align:middle line:84%
and how can we evolve
our style of parenting

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:38.950 align:middle line:84%
to serve the needs of
the next generation

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:43.040 align:middle line:84%
and truly move forward in
a fashion that we need to?

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.270 align:middle line:84%
>> So my advice on parenting
might be counterintuitive.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And I want to bring in ideas
from different philosophers

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.480 align:middle line:84%
and parenting
experts whom I've had

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.160 align:middle line:90%
the pleasure of learning from.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.740 align:middle line:84%
First, the first
rule of parenting

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.080 align:middle line:90%
comes from Shelly Lefkoe.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And Shelly said, your
only job as a parent

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:03.600 align:middle line:90%
is to keep your children safe.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.500 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.030 align:middle line:84%
It's to keep your
children safe--

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:09.030 align:middle line:84%
to teach them how to cross
the street, to teach them

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:10.830 align:middle line:90%
how to protect themselves.

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:13.460 align:middle line:90%
That's your only job.

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Shefali Tsabary provides
the second rule.

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And the second rule is, when
you become a parent, that

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.640 align:middle line:84%
is the universe giving
you the ultimate textbook

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.590 align:middle line:90%
to help you grow yourself.

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:30.130 align:middle line:84%
Parenting is not about
you evolving your kids.

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:31.450 align:middle line:90%
They're going to be fine.

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:33.970 align:middle line:84%
They are their own
individual souls.

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:36.220 align:middle line:84%
Parenting is about
you growing yourself.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:40.030 align:middle line:84%
Your kids are going to teach
you so much more about life

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:42.490 align:middle line:84%
than what you would
initially think.

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And so you want to let
your kids be who they are.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.230 align:middle line:84%
Do not impose your
beliefs on your children.

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Your job as a parent is
to keep your children

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.420 align:middle line:90%
free of your own bullshit.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.610 align:middle line:84%
Do not impose your
religion on your children.

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:00.040 align:middle line:84%
Let them decide how they
will want to view God.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Do not suggest to them that
they need to come home with A's.

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:06.100 align:middle line:84%
Let them decide if they
want it themselves.

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:09.070 align:middle line:84%
Your job, according to
Shefali and according

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:11.050 align:middle line:84%
to Shelly Lefkoe, two of
the greatest parenting

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:14.440 align:middle line:84%
minds out there, is to
make sure that you do not

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:18.520 align:middle line:84%
infect your children
with your beliefs,

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.710 align:middle line:84%
but to let them form
their own beliefs

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:23.890 align:middle line:84%
and to ensure that those
beliefs are healthy.

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the things we
have to recognize as parents

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.190 align:middle line:84%
is that every little
thing we do is going

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:33.610 align:middle line:84%
to cause our children to take
on some belief or the other,

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:36.010 align:middle line:84%
just like every little
thing our parents did

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:38.080 align:middle line:90%
imposed a belief onto us.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.210 align:middle line:84%
So I was once in a
car with my child.

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And Hayden, my son,
asked me a question,

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:44.620 align:middle line:84%
and the question was
something on science.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And just as I was
about to answer him,

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:49.750 align:middle line:84%
my phone rang,
and it was my CFO.

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:52.762 align:middle line:84%
And I know that if my CFO
calls me on a weekend,

00:15:52.762 --> 00:15:54.470 align:middle line:84%
something has gone
wrong in the business,

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:56.140 align:middle line:90%
and I have to take the call.

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:57.282 align:middle line:90%
So I picked up the call.

00:15:57.282 --> 00:15:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I put
the phone to my ear,

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:01.260 align:middle line:90%
I realized something.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.620 align:middle line:84%
By asking Hayden a question
and then picking up the phone

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:08.790 align:middle line:84%
and putting it to my ear, there
is a good, probable chance

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:12.240 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to infect
Hayden's meaning-making machine

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.770 align:middle line:84%
with the following
thought pattern.

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:17.560 align:middle line:84%
My dad cares about work
more than he cares about me.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.710 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, I am
not as significant.

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:22.400 align:middle line:90%
I could not take that risk.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:26.800 align:middle line:84%
So while having my CFO on the
phone, I asked him to hold.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And I turned to
Hayden, and I explained

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:29.570 align:middle line:90%
to him what was going on.

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:31.180 align:middle line:90%
Specifically, I said this.

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:35.210 align:middle line:84%
Hayden, I really want
to answer your question,

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:37.250 align:middle line:90%
but my CFO just called.

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:38.450 align:middle line:90%
Something may have broken.

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:40.850 align:middle line:84%
Let me quickly deal with
this because my priority

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:43.340 align:middle line:84%
today on this Sunday
is to be with you.

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:44.900 align:middle line:84%
So give me one
minute, and then we're

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:47.180 align:middle line:84%
going to go deep
into your question.

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:50.420 align:middle line:84%
That simple thing
helps Hayden preserve

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:51.860 align:middle line:90%
his meaning-making machine.

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.440 align:middle line:84%
It prevents him from taking on
any type of unconscious belief

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.530 align:middle line:84%
that he is less important to
his father than his father's

00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:58.430 align:middle line:90%
company.

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And that really is one
of the ultimate skills

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:02.570 align:middle line:90%
you want to learn as a parent.

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Rule number one is
that your only job

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:07.010 align:middle line:90%
is to keep your kids safe.

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:10.099 align:middle line:84%
Rule number two-- do not
impose your beliefs on the kid.

00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:13.640 align:middle line:84%
Rule number three, which
comes from rule number one--

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.250 align:middle line:84%
keep your kids safe
from damaging beliefs

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:19.710 align:middle line:84%
that they might take on
based on your behavior.

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:20.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Brilliant.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:21.920 align:middle line:90%
Well summarized.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:27.319 align:middle line:84%
I am enjoying your journey into
exploring this idea of uniting

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:31.010 align:middle line:90%
humanity under one flag.

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:32.900 align:middle line:84%
Do you think it's
going to take all of us

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.450 align:middle line:84%
to take a trip to
Mars or outer space

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:39.800 align:middle line:84%
to realize that we are just, as
you say, meat bodies hurdling

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.320 align:middle line:90%
on this rock through space?

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think that
we are rocketing

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.740 align:middle line:84%
towards this sort of unified
consciousness, this unified

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:51.710 align:middle line:90%
group of people on one planet?

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:54.830 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems that it's
going either way in the media,

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:57.320 align:middle line:84%
and I want to know
your opinion about how

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:59.730 align:middle line:84%
we can bring people together
and raise consciousness

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:00.530 align:middle line:90%
on planet Earth.

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:02.720 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk
about unity, right?

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.000 align:middle line:84%
So I want to be very,
very, very firm.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.700 align:middle line:84%
My belief is that
we need to move

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.220 align:middle line:90%
beyond the idea of nations.

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.380 align:middle line:84%
Humanity needs to
unite in the way

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:16.340 align:middle line:84%
that the European Union has
become a union of nations.

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:18.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, this does not
mean free borders

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.910 align:middle line:90%
so that borders disappear.

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:22.310 align:middle line:84%
Even within the EU,
there were various rules

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:24.890 align:middle line:84%
that decided when
a nation would get

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:28.730 align:middle line:84%
to join this body called the
EU, and a nation like Britain

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:30.320 align:middle line:90%
can choose to exit.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.840 align:middle line:84%
However, what is
going to happen,

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:36.500 align:middle line:84%
and what has happened with
organizations like the EU,

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.270 align:middle line:90%
is that it prevents war.

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:40.010 align:middle line:90%
It prevents petty politics.

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:43.070 align:middle line:84%
It gets people to
see that we have

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:46.250 align:middle line:84%
more in common with the
people across our border

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:47.630 align:middle line:90%
than we think.

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is a beautiful
way to view humanity.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:53.450 align:middle line:84%
The only way we can solve the
big global issues of our time

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:55.850 align:middle line:84%
is to solve it as
a unified species.

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:58.850 align:middle line:84%
When men colonizes
Mars, the flag

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:01.550 align:middle line:84%
that should be on that
rocketship going to Mars

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:04.757 align:middle line:84%
should not be the
United States flag.

00:19:04.757 --> 00:19:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And I know this is going
to piss off people.

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:08.390 align:middle line:90%
It should be the Earth flag.

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:10.640 align:middle line:84%
Because the only
way we are going

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:15.680 align:middle line:84%
to be able to become a species
that spans the milky ways

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.320 align:middle line:90%
is unified as earthlings.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And so one of my quests
is to move humanity

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:24.690 align:middle line:84%
towards greater unity
under an Earth flag.

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:27.140 align:middle line:84%
An Earth flag is not the
flag of the United Nations.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.960 align:middle line:84%
The United Nations
is a governing body.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:33.860 align:middle line:84%
The Earth flag has to be a
symbol with no power of its own

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:35.940 align:middle line:90%
except the power we give it.

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm working
on a 20-year project

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:42.020 align:middle line:84%
to create a flag for
collective humanity.

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:44.330 align:middle line:90%
Now, why is this important?

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Nationalism is one of the most
dangerous forces on the planet

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.240 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.660 align:middle line:84%
We have seen how ideas
such as nationalism

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:53.960 align:middle line:84%
have cost nations like
Britain to shoot themselves

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:57.970 align:middle line:84%
in the foot, nations like
America to embrace Trumpism.

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:01.580 align:middle line:84%
Otto Scharmer from MIT
suggests that politics today

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:03.650 align:middle line:90%
is not about left or right.

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:07.460 align:middle line:84%
It's about being
closed or unity.

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:10.400 align:middle line:84%
It is about shutting yourself
and burying your head

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:14.240 align:middle line:84%
in the sand and saying, la, la,
la, la, global warming isn't

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:18.140 align:middle line:84%
real, let's build a border
wall and shut out the Mexicans.

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:22.930 align:middle line:84%
Or it's about unity, which means
saying that we as a species

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:24.920 align:middle line:84%
have to look out
for each other, need

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.660 align:middle line:84%
to take care of our
planet, and need

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:30.410 align:middle line:84%
to ensure that our world is
good multiple generations down.

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:32.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't care about
the views of the left

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.260 align:middle line:84%
or the right of the
political spectrum.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:37.490 align:middle line:84%
But what I do care is that
nationalism and this idea

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:41.510 align:middle line:84%
of closing ourselves in and
that our religion, our race,

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:45.180 align:middle line:84%
or ethnicity, our nation
is better than others,

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:47.240 align:middle line:90%
that is a very dangerous idea.

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And we need to inoculate the
human species against that.

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Human beings are
very programmable.

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:54.440 align:middle line:84%
They can be programmed
towards ideas

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:57.350 align:middle line:84%
that unify them and
create more compassion

00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:58.340 align:middle line:90%
and love in the world.

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:01.280 align:middle line:84%
But they can also be
programmed for ideas

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.920 align:middle line:90%
that create disunity and hate.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.140 align:middle line:84%
The question is, where
is the human race going,

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:08.640 align:middle line:90%
and what do we want to bet on?

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that we are moving
more and more towards unity.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:16.710 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at issues
like global warming,

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:20.520 align:middle line:84%
no country on its own can
prevent global warming.

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:23.370 align:middle line:84%
The only way to do it is to
do it as a collective species.

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:26.130 align:middle line:84%
No country on its
own can prevent wars.

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:29.590 align:middle line:84%
The only way to do it is to do
it as a unified human species.

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think this
is where we need

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:33.120 align:middle line:90%
to move towards as a species.

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.370 align:middle line:84%
The idea of the
Earth flag is to show

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:40.230 align:middle line:84%
people, is to remind people that
they do not belong to a nation.

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:42.780 align:middle line:84%
They were born in a
nation in this lifetime,

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:48.390 align:middle line:84%
but their greater belonging is
with a collective human race,

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:50.190 align:middle line:90%
is with planet Earth.

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And I believe once people
see this symbology--

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:55.770 align:middle line:84%
and you do not need to be in
space looking down on the Earth

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:57.500 align:middle line:90%
to be reminded of this.

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.300 align:middle line:84%
The memetic idea
of an Earth flag

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:03.150 align:middle line:84%
already creates a
form of inoculation

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:04.720 align:middle line:90%
against nationalism.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.490 align:middle line:84%
This is what we are
striving towards.

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:08.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome, Vishen.

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'll be with
you cheering on.

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:11.330 align:middle line:90%
One more question.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:14.462 align:middle line:84%
I am onboard with everything
you're talking about.

00:22:14.462 --> 00:22:15.920 align:middle line:84%
However, some
people, they're going

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.360 align:middle line:84%
to focus on the
personal transformation

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.160 align:middle line:90%
and do that work.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.660 align:middle line:84%
But there's a greater,
bigger mission at play here.

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And as a species,
we voted out-- or as

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:26.360 align:middle line:84%
a modern, domesticated species,
we voted out feudalism.

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.960 align:middle line:90%
We voted out dictatorships.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.820 align:middle line:84%
We voted out
communism, and we voted

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:35.660 align:middle line:84%
in this liberal, democratic
capitalistic system,

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:36.915 align:middle line:90%
good and bad.

00:22:36.915 --> 00:22:38.540 align:middle line:84%
There are some great
spectrums of that.

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And I believe
conscious businesses--

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:44.690 align:middle line:84%
Mindvalley, private entities and
even public entities-- or you

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:46.370 align:middle line:90%
think about TOMS Shoes.

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:48.560 align:middle line:84%
People who have moved beyond
just helping the people

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.420 align:middle line:84%
in their organization,
helping the planet,

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:52.550 align:middle line:84%
but having a purpose,
a bigger purpose

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:55.910 align:middle line:84%
have the capability to make
the most radical changes.

00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Because if we shift
our consumption habits,

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:02.030 align:middle line:84%
we're able to shift and
affect fast global change

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:04.220 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to relying
on governments.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe in this
ideology, and do you

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:08.270 align:middle line:84%
believe it will be
conscious business

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:11.360 align:middle line:84%
and conscious entrepreneurs
and the consumers that

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.910 align:middle line:84%
support those businesses that
are able to push humanity

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:14.875 align:middle line:90%
forward faster?

00:23:14.875 --> 00:23:17.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe conscious
business is the way forward,

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.460 align:middle line:84%
but it's not just about
conscious business.

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:22.550 align:middle line:84%
We have to look at consciousness
from different perspectives.

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:23.990 align:middle line:90%
Now, I look at it this way.

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:27.050 align:middle line:84%
We need to bring conscious
practices into our education

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:28.890 align:middle line:84%
system so we educate
the next generation.

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, we need to bring
conscious business forward.

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And conscious business really
means that it's not just

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:36.170 align:middle line:90%
about profit and loss.

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:39.260 align:middle line:84%
It's about serving
the human species

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.810 align:middle line:90%
multiple generations down.

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And then we have to look
at conscious selves,

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:47.270 align:middle line:84%
about people
learning to take care

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:49.220 align:middle line:90%
of their body and themselves.

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And we need to look at
conscious relationships.

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And this means
conscious families,

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:55.580 align:middle line:84%
conscious partnerships,
the way companies work

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:57.560 align:middle line:84%
with their employees,
and vise versa,

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:00.350 align:middle line:84%
the way governments work with
its people, and vise versa.

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And finally, on
top of all of this,

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:05.060 align:middle line:84%
we need to look at
conscious citizenry

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:08.780 align:middle line:84%
and conscious relationships
between human beings

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.603 align:middle line:90%
and the ecology.

00:24:10.603 --> 00:24:12.020 align:middle line:84%
When you put all
of this together,

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:13.670 align:middle line:84%
I think we have a
pretty good path

00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:16.250 align:middle line:84%
towards improving the
conditions in planet Earth--

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:19.700 align:middle line:84%
not just now, but for
multiple generations down.

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:20.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Vishen.

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:21.870 align:middle line:90%
It's always a pleasure.

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:24.230 align:middle line:84%
I love getting a download
from you every now and then

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:28.460 align:middle line:84%
and helping take
that to people that

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:31.610 align:middle line:84%
might be needing it in times
of suffering or looking

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:32.850 align:middle line:90%
for insight.

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:34.900 align:middle line:90%
And I appreciate your time.
