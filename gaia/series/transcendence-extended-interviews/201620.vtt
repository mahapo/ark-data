00:00:07.792 --> 00:00:09.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi, it's James here
from Food Matters,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.340 align:middle line:10%
and welcome to this
interview with Sonia Ricotti.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Sonia is an expert at
helping people bounce back

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.100 align:middle line:84%
from disaster and tragedy,
whether it's emotional,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.900 align:middle line:90%
financial or health.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.820 align:middle line:84%
And she is an expert,
because she's been there

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.880 align:middle line:84%
before herself, and she's
developed tools techniques

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.190 align:middle line:84%
and strategies to help
millions of other people

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.878 align:middle line:84%
turn a breakdown
to a breakthrough.

00:00:30.878 --> 00:00:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be talking
with her today about what

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.370 align:middle line:90%
it takes to bounce back.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.320 align:middle line:90%
Sonia.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:36.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>> How are you doing?

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.633 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm great, how are you?

00:00:38.633 --> 00:00:40.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Good, thank you.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.490 align:middle line:84%
So your story starts
with your story.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.570 align:middle line:90%
You have had an interesting one.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.320 align:middle line:84%
Can you share that
with me, what happened,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.910 align:middle line:90%
where was it, when was it?

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:50.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, boy, yes.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.990 align:middle line:84%
So a few years ago, my entire
life just came crashing down.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And I had lost my home
due to foreclosure.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.390 align:middle line:84%
I was six figures in debt,
$124,000 to be exact.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.130 align:middle line:90%
I also, my ex was an alcoholic.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.840 align:middle line:90%
That relationship broke up.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And I had a very
serious health challenge

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.840 align:middle line:84%
where I had a serious blood
clot as well, under my arm,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.360 align:middle line:84%
so very close to
my heart and lungs.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to go into
emergency treatment for that.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And the crazy part is, all
those things happened all

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.940 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And as everything was
going on in my life

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.540 align:middle line:84%
and just crashing down, I just,
I literally fell to my knees.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.830 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't know how I
was going to get through it.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.200 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how I was
going to get out of it.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.330 align:middle line:10%
I really hit rock bottom.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.350 align:middle line:10%
And everything was fine
before any of that.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden overnight,
things just started.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.900 align:middle line:84%
It was like a snowball, and
things just, this happened

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.400 align:middle line:84%
and this happened
and this happened.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.560 align:middle line:84%
It was like when
it rains, it pours.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And I got to a place one
day where I hit rock bottom.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And I was in my, and I remember
this like it was yesterday.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And I was lying in my
bed and just crying.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.370 align:middle line:84%
Crying, crying, crying all by
myself, rolled up in a ball.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And the story that I
kept on telling myself

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.040 align:middle line:84%
is, how did this
happen, how am I

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.220 align:middle line:84%
going to get out of this,
what am I going to do.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.170 align:middle line:90%
And I felt really helpless.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And for a really brief moment,
I wanted to end it all.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And not because I wanted to end
it all like really end it all,

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.800 align:middle line:90%
I just wanted the pain to stop.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.950 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how to
make that pain stop.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And so what I
allowed myself to do,

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.508 align:middle line:84%
is I just allowed myself
to just cry it all out.

00:02:54.508 --> 00:02:57.050 align:middle line:84%
You know, sometimes when we're
going through a difficult time

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.630 align:middle line:84%
and we want to cry or
we feel like crying,

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.170 align:middle line:84%
we do everything possible to not
do that and distract ourselves.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And I actually allowed myself in
that moment to play the victim

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.805 align:middle line:90%
and just said, just cry it out.

00:03:08.805 --> 00:03:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And what's amazing by
doing that, by the way,

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.490 align:middle line:84%
is that you just release
it out to the universe.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And you immediately feel
better to honor yourself

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.250 align:middle line:90%
and what you're feeling.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.050 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.740 align:middle line:84%
It's OK to feel bad when
something bad happens.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.180 align:middle line:90%
Something bad's happening.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.890 align:middle line:90%
Life is life, things happen.

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:25.730 align:middle line:90%
So I allowed that.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And allowed myself
to cry my eyes

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.220 align:middle line:84%
were all swollen and
tears down my face.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And after crying for about a
good hour, I got out of bed,

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.490 align:middle line:84%
I walked around the
bed to the window.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking
outside the window.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And I remember there was
this beautiful maple tree.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And I just looked
out the window and I

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.180 align:middle line:84%
said, I don't know
why this is happening,

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.060 align:middle line:84%
but one thing I know for sure,
something big, something huge,

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.220 align:middle line:84%
something way bigger than me
is going to come out of this,

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.710 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not going through
all this crap for nothing.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.430 align:middle line:90%
And it was like a declaration.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.209 align:middle line:90%
It was an intention I sent.

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.100 align:middle line:90%
I sent out to the universe.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to repeat that.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.620 align:middle line:10%
Because I think it's really
important for everyone

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.720 align:middle line:10%
when they're going
through a difficult time

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.762 align:middle line:10%
to create their own declaration
and set their intention.

00:04:33.762 --> 00:04:34.970 align:middle line:90%
I didn't do it intentionally.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.220 align:middle line:90%
That was just a natural thing.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.300 align:middle line:84%
I did, but it was the
best thing I ever did.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why
this is happening,

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.950 align:middle line:84%
but one thing I know for sure,
is something big, something

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.810 align:middle line:84%
huge, something
way bigger than me

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.630 align:middle line:84%
is going to come out of
this, because I'm not going

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.000 align:middle line:90%
through this crap for nothing.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not kidding you.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.950 align:middle line:84%
Once I did that, it was
like I sent the message out

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.640 align:middle line:84%
to god, universe,
whatever you believe in,

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.050 align:middle line:90%
and it got the wheels in motion.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And about a week later, I
was still in that house.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.810 align:middle line:84%
We hadn't lost it yet,
we're about to lose it.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And as I was walking up
the stairs of that house,

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:19.250 align:middle line:84%
on the fifth step I got
a message from wherever.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And it was one word, and that
one word was, unsinkable.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.180 align:middle line:90%
And it was so random.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.620 align:middle line:84%
I remember, it so
weird, I could,

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.430 align:middle line:84%
I remember actually where
I was and when it happened.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And the message came and it was
one word, it was unsinkable.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.685 align:middle line:84%
And I knew exactly
what it meant.

00:05:35.685 --> 00:05:37.310 align:middle line:84%
Wasn't like, well,
that's a weird word,

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.820 align:middle line:90%
where did that come from.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.040 align:middle line:90%
And it was unsinkable.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.010 align:middle line:90%
I go, oh, interesting.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.080 align:middle line:90%
I understand now.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.430 align:middle line:90%
And I continued walking up.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.760 align:middle line:84%
I got to the landing and I
said, I really get it now.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm going through all this
stuff because my mission in life

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.290 align:middle line:84%
is to help others bounce
back from difficult times.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:01.100 align:middle line:84%
Now get your butt in gear,
Sonia, and bounce back quickly

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:06.110 align:middle line:84%
and turn it around so you can
go out there and teach others.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.480 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I did.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.890 align:middle line:84%
With regards to that
moment of insight

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:18.470 align:middle line:84%
where you turned the situation
around, my observation of that

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.160 align:middle line:84%
is that you created a new sense
of meaning around something.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.528 align:middle line:84%
How is it that meaning can help
change the situation for people

00:06:26.528 --> 00:06:28.070 align:middle line:84%
when they're going
through something?

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.900 align:middle line:84%
Because you've given
that a different meaning.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:30.830 align:middle line:84%
You said, well, this
is, there's going

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.560 align:middle line:84%
to be something big coming out
of this, like that's a choice.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.270 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a choice, definitely.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And whatever choice
you make and whatever

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.960 align:middle line:84%
meaning you add to
whatever is going on,

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.760 align:middle line:84%
will determine your outcome and
how quickly you bounce back.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.400 align:middle line:84%
I could have chosen something
completely opposite.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.670 align:middle line:84%
My life is over, I can't believe
this, what am I going to do,

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm such a loser, how did this
happen to me, I can't believe.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.250 align:middle line:90%
Like all these negative things.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.240 align:middle line:84%
I will never get out of this
mess and be bitter forever

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.150 align:middle line:84%
and ever, and we all know
people who are like that.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:10.490 align:middle line:84%
But that wasn't my, I
found, I found a meaning

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.830 align:middle line:90%
that is bigger than me.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.870 align:middle line:84%
That was something
like it was that light

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.360 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the tunnel
and it was really bright,

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.850 align:middle line:84%
and I knew it was there
and I needed to find

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.970 align:middle line:90%
my way outside that tunnel.

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And so that meaning
is really important.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And we can choose that
at any given time.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.100 align:middle line:84%
We can choose a
different meaning.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And the best way to find out you
know whether it's serving you

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.800 align:middle line:90%
or not is, how do you feel.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Whatever meaning
you've made it mean

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:43.100 align:middle line:84%
or whatever meaning you
added to that situation,

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:48.050 align:middle line:84%
does it make you feel
expanded or contracted?

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, being
able to help humanity

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.730 align:middle line:84%
around this, because people
are suffering everywhere,

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:59.790 align:middle line:84%
I all of a sudden was grateful
in that moment for a little.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:02.390 align:middle line:84%
Like I obviously wish I
could come to this big aha

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:03.890 align:middle line:84%
without going through
all this stuff

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:05.150 align:middle line:90%
and be able to help people.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:05.950 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.030 align:middle line:84%
People wouldn't
listen to me if I had.

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:10.250 align:middle line:84%
If I hadn't experienced
pain and suffering,

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:13.490 align:middle line:84%
they would have said,
you don't understand.

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:16.070 align:middle line:84%
So I had to go through
it to be able to do that.

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:17.580 align:middle line:90%
I chose that.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.360 align:middle line:84%
I could have made a million
other choice choices.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And anyone can choose
at any given moment

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:25.100 align:middle line:90%
what they want it to mean.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:31.370 align:middle line:84%
In the end, I really
believe that you

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:33.900 align:middle line:90%
can get through anything.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And you can turn lemonade
from lemons, if you choose to.

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:44.330 align:middle line:84%
Or you could take those lemons
and just keep them as lemons.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.710 align:middle line:90%


00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:49.930 align:middle line:84%
>> The thing about your
transformation that I find

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:54.160 align:middle line:84%
interesting, is that one of
the first steps was this huge

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.910 align:middle line:84%
aspirational goal in a way,
which seems unfathomable

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:00.000 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of people.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.440 align:middle line:84%
How is dreaming big
such an important part

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.040 align:middle line:90%
of this process for you?

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And how can you take really, how
did you take yourself, I mean,

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:09.230 align:middle line:84%
it was more a moment of
insight more than anything,

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:10.030 align:middle line:90%
I would say.

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.580 align:middle line:84%
Like some sort of divine insight
that helped you see this.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:16.150 align:middle line:84%
But how do you take people from
being stuck to dreaming big?

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And how is dreaming
big and important part

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:20.440 align:middle line:84%
of going through a
difficult challenge?

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.200 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, it's interesting,
because it's even,

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.940 align:middle line:84%
it sounds very evolved and
oh, I got this message.

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:31.120 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, if you really
analyze this and break it down,

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:36.250 align:middle line:84%
it was really more, it
was more out of spite.

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.110 align:middle line:84%
It was more out of,
oh yeah, well, I'm

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:40.510 align:middle line:84%
not going through this
stuff for nothing.

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:41.650 align:middle line:90%
I'll show you.

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:42.910 align:middle line:90%
Who, I don't know.

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:44.043 align:middle line:90%
Seriously.

00:09:44.043 --> 00:09:45.460 align:middle line:84%
But it was more
out of that, where

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.440 align:middle line:84%
it's like, oh my goodness,
this just happened.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.090 align:middle line:84%
How am I going to
get out of this?

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:49.890 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:52.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going through all this
stuff for nothing, no way.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.480 align:middle line:90%


00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And then the universe,
god, whatever, said, OK.

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:03.880 align:middle line:10%
And so from dreaming big, what's
interesting about dreaming big,

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.820 align:middle line:10%
even that seemed crazy
when I said well,

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.770 align:middle line:10%
my mission now is to
help people bounce back

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:11.960 align:middle line:10%
from difficult times.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.610 align:middle line:84%
I said that, I made
that statement,

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:15.143 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't know
what that meant.

00:10:15.143 --> 00:10:16.810 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
that would look like.

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:20.650 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know where
it would take me.

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:22.585 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like I said
this and I'm like,

00:10:22.585 --> 00:10:24.460 align:middle line:84%
oh, and I know exactly
how I'm going to do it

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:26.502 align:middle line:84%
and the next week everyone's
going to bounce back

00:10:26.502 --> 00:10:28.880 align:middle line:84%
and it's all done and
I'll have my book written.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:29.680 align:middle line:90%
I just said that.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.290 align:middle line:84%
It was, sometimes you
need to set a goal

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:34.480 align:middle line:90%
or create that dream.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.000 align:middle line:90%
You don't need to know the how.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.540 align:middle line:84%
Just first get the
dream together.

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And what I always say
is, pick that dream.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.270 align:middle line:84%
So if you're having
financial problems,

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:50.110 align:middle line:84%
how much money would you like
to make in the next year?

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And you come up with
an amount in your mind.

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:54.880 align:middle line:90%
And what I always say is this.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.610 align:middle line:84%
Once you've picked
that amount, you

00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:03.730 align:middle line:84%
have an amount picked in
your mind, times it by 10.

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:06.010 align:middle line:90%
And everyone's, oh, my goodness!

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:07.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make
a million dollars?

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.430 align:middle line:90%
You know, that kind of thing.

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's like yeah,
and why didn't you

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:14.890 align:middle line:90%
pick that amount to begin with?

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's because we have
difficulty dreaming big.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And often, we are the ones
that are our own obstacles

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.260 align:middle line:90%
in our own way.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And whatever your
dreams are, when

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.710 align:middle line:84%
you're able to create
your big dreams,

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:36.340 align:middle line:84%
once you've decided on
that, then the opportunities

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:38.570 align:middle line:84%
and the ideas start
coming to you.

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:41.470 align:middle line:84%
So if your goal
was $100,000, you

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:44.230 align:middle line:84%
would then have ideas
and opportunities

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:47.350 align:middle line:90%
that are $100,000 worth.

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:49.510 align:middle line:84%
If you have a goal
of a million dollars,

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:51.427 align:middle line:84%
you will have ideas
and opportunities

00:11:51.427 --> 00:11:53.260 align:middle line:84%
that come to you that
are a million dollars.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.500 align:middle line:84%
Because your brain is
thinking at a different level.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.985 align:middle line:84%
When I decided I wanted to make
my first million, I remember,

00:11:59.985 --> 00:12:01.360 align:middle line:84%
this is how I was
going to do it.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.800 align:middle line:84%
This isn't how it
happened, but I

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.040 align:middle line:84%
started coming up with
ideas, which I would never

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.598 align:middle line:84%
have come up with if my goal
was $50,000 or $100,000.

00:12:09.598 --> 00:12:11.140 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to make
my first million.

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:12.370 align:middle line:84%
I said, I know how
I'm going to do it.

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:14.417 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't know any
other way, by the way.

00:12:14.417 --> 00:12:16.000 align:middle line:10%
And by the way,
there's a million ways

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.730 align:middle line:10%
to make a million
dollars, if not more.

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:20.080 align:middle line:10%
That's what I always say.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.680 align:middle line:10%
And my goal was, I'm going
to write a bestseller book

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.800 align:middle line:10%
and I'm going to sell
a million copies.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And when you have a
publisher, you usually

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.080 align:middle line:90%
get about $1 a book.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.550 align:middle line:84%
So that's how I'm going
to make a million dollars.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:34.180 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
write my first book.

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:35.890 align:middle line:84%
Is that how I made
my first million?

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:36.690 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:37.810 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:40.750 align:middle line:84%
But at least I had an
idea and it started

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.850 align:middle line:90%
making me think in that way.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:44.710 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I wrote a bestseller.

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:47.110 align:middle line:84%
No, I didn't make a
million dollars that way.

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:50.710 align:middle line:84%
But I came up with all
different other ideas.

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And so many things just started
arriving and landing in my lap,

00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:59.710 align:middle line:84%
because my mind now
was starting to look

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:02.680 align:middle line:90%
for things in that area.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.290 align:middle line:84%
So you become, once you
have that really big goal,

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:09.190 align:middle line:84%
then you become more
aware, more alert.

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:10.690 align:middle line:84%
Once you're looking
out that window,

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:12.980 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing what
you're looking for,

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:14.830 align:middle line:84%
which is how to make
a million dollars,

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:19.540 align:middle line:84%
how to find my soulmate, how
to have the dream career.

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:23.170 align:middle line:84%
All those things all of a
sudden start showing up for you.

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:28.600 align:middle line:84%
It's when you get stuck
in that negative space

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.090 align:middle line:84%
that you don't see
the opportunities.

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:34.450 align:middle line:84%
You're in this dark fog,
you're in that tunnel.

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:36.980 align:middle line:84%
There could be a million
doors of opportunities

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:37.780 align:middle line:90%
all around you.

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:40.330 align:middle line:90%
You will never see them.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.950 align:middle line:84%
You will never see them,
because you're stuck.

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:43.750 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:47.860 align:middle line:84%
I always say when
you are stuck, it's

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.190 align:middle line:84%
like you are staring
at a closed door.

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:54.280 align:middle line:84%
Not only is it closed,
but it's locked.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.160 align:middle line:90%
And you're not going anywhere.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by that, is
anytime you're complaining,

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:02.800 align:middle line:84%
anytime you are feeling
sorry for yourself,

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.900 align:middle line:84%
anytime you're saying,
why is this happening,

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.930 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe this is
happening, this isn't fair,

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:12.080 align:middle line:84%
and all that resentment and
anger around your situation,

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:16.390 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to move past that and
actually bounce back quickly,

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:17.890 align:middle line:90%
and bounce back big.

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:20.590 align:middle line:84%
It's really difficult.
Because you're just busy

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:22.690 align:middle line:90%
staring at this closed door.

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, there are all these
open doors all around you,

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:28.390 align:middle line:84%
but you don't see
them, because I'm

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:30.580 align:middle line:84%
too busy staring at
this closed door that's

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.890 align:middle line:90%
right in front of your face.

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And so what I say is, step
away from that closed door.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Stop focusing on all the
negative and all the things

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:41.200 align:middle line:90%
that you're not happy about.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And start focusing
on what you want

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:44.890 align:middle line:84%
and what you want to
create into your life,

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:48.490 align:middle line:84%
like what you want to
bring into your life.

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:50.320 align:middle line:90%
Focus on the positive.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you start
focusing on the positive

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:56.140 align:middle line:84%
and what you want to create
and dream big, all of a sudden

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:58.120 align:middle line:84%
you step away and
you look around

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.710 align:middle line:84%
and you say, oh my goodness,
where were all these open doors

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:01.510 align:middle line:90%
before?

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:02.310 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:04.600 align:middle line:84%
They were they're
all along, right?

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.240 align:middle line:84%
It's what you look for
is what you will find.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And if you're
constantly negative,

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:10.000 align:middle line:90%
you'll find more negativity.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.417 align:middle line:84%
If you're constantly
positive, you

00:15:11.417 --> 00:15:15.490 align:middle line:84%
will always find all the
positive things all around you.

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:18.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's one of those things that
once you start becoming aware

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:23.740 align:middle line:84%
what's in there and what's going
on and be able to shift that,

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:26.710 align:middle line:90%
your entire life will shift.

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:28.660 align:middle line:84%
You know, I talk
about reprogramming

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.730 align:middle line:90%
your conscious mind.

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And I usually break it
down into three steps.

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And the first one is
reprogram your conscious mind.

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And what your conscious mind
is, is all about your thoughts

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.210 align:middle line:90%
and what you're thinking.

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:47.600 align:middle line:84%
Now I honest, for me personally,
many, many years ago,

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:51.340 align:middle line:84%
I used to be the biggest
drama queen on the planet.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:54.370 align:middle line:84%
Now you imagine the
most negative person

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:57.337 align:middle line:84%
you know who's the biggest
drama queen on the planet,

00:15:57.337 --> 00:15:58.420 align:middle line:90%
just think of that person.

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:00.040 align:middle line:84%
Times that by
1,000, that was me.

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:00.840 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:04.060 align:middle line:84%
I can promise you, that's
how bad I used to be.

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:06.460 align:middle line:90%
Until one day I got a big aha.

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And I was at an event and
they were talking about this.

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And I walked out of
there with a light bulb

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:15.250 align:middle line:84%
on the top of my head,
realizing oh my goodness,

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:17.990 align:middle line:90%
are you kidding me.

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:20.455 align:middle line:84%
I've been creating my own
suffering all this time?

00:16:20.455 --> 00:16:22.960 align:middle line:90%


00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.190 align:middle line:90%
I just couldn't believe it.

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And the exciting part was,
well, that's a good thing,

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:29.210 align:middle line:84%
because that means
I can change it.

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:31.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm no longer a victim.

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And so when I say reprogram
your conscious mind,

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:36.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about your thoughts
and what you're thinking.

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:37.570 align:middle line:90%
So let me explain.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:38.860 align:middle line:90%
The way it works is this.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.330 align:middle line:84%
Is that when something negative
is happening around you,

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:43.750 align:middle line:84%
so it's let's say,
outside of you,

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:48.580 align:middle line:84%
and it could be in my case,
I was $124,000 in debt,

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:52.620 align:middle line:84%
my relationship was breaking
up, my ex was an alcoholic,

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.977 align:middle line:84%
I had serious health issues,
we were losing our home.

00:16:54.977 --> 00:16:56.560 align:middle line:84%
All these things
were happening to me.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.930 align:middle line:84%
All these things
were happening to me

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:03.160 align:middle line:84%
and I was feeling really sad,
depressed, angry, resentful,

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.960 align:middle line:90%
all those negative feelings.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.865 align:middle line:84%
And so if somebody would
have asked me and said, well,

00:17:07.865 --> 00:17:09.490 align:middle line:84%
why are you feeling
all those feelings?

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:10.390 align:middle line:90%
Why are you feeling sad?

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:11.319 align:middle line:90%
Why are you feeling angry?

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:12.569 align:middle line:90%
Why are you feeling resentful?

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:14.250 align:middle line:90%
What is all this negativity?

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:15.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm saying, why?

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:19.990 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm losing my home,
$124,000 in debt, my ex,

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:22.720 align:middle line:84%
at the time, he wasn't
my ex, is an alcoholic, I

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.089 align:middle line:90%
have serious health challenge.

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:26.530 align:middle line:90%
Of course I'm feeling this way.

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:28.130 align:middle line:90%
That's why I feel this way.

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:28.930 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:31.690 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:35.110 align:middle line:84%
So you have something outside
of you that's happening.

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:37.570 align:middle line:84%
Financial,
relationship, whatever,

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:39.340 align:middle line:90%
and you feel something.

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.720 align:middle line:84%
You assume that the
reason you feel this way

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.520 align:middle line:90%
is because of that.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:43.990 align:middle line:90%
But that isn't true.

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:46.690 align:middle line:84%
Something happens
between that and this.

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:49.070 align:middle line:90%
Something here happens.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is, you
have a thought about what's

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.730 align:middle line:90%
happening in your life.

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:57.970 align:middle line:84%
That thought is causing
you to feel the way you do.

00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:01.870 align:middle line:84%
So you are causing your
own pain and suffering.

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:03.060 align:middle line:90%
It's not out there.

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that's
true, is because you

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:07.900 align:middle line:84%
can have 10 people going
through the exact same situation

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:11.120 align:middle line:90%
and have 10 different reactions.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:11.920 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And so if that's the case,
then what's the difference?

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:17.200 align:middle line:90%
It's what you think.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.870 align:middle line:84%
So whenever you're going through
a difficult time in your life

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:22.120 align:middle line:84%
and you're not feeling good,
you have to ask yourself,

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:24.160 align:middle line:84%
OK, obviously
something's happening

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.550 align:middle line:84%
and things happen in life
and we have to deal with it

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:31.670 align:middle line:84%
and get through it, get back
up, move forward, handle it.

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:33.530 align:middle line:90%
How quickly you do that is this.

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens
is, you have to ask

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:38.448 align:middle line:84%
yourself that question
in those situations

00:18:38.448 --> 00:18:39.490 align:middle line:90%
when you don't feel good.

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:41.620 align:middle line:90%
And the question is this.

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.090 align:middle line:84%
What am I thinking
about right now

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:46.180 align:middle line:90%
that's making me feel this way?

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And the stories
we tell ourselves.

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.890 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't even talk
to your, you know,

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:57.310 align:middle line:84%
like your worst enemy the
way we talk to ourselves.

00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And of course, and
you'll, do that exercise.

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:02.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to this day,
I still do that.

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.900 align:middle line:84%
If I feel like I'm getting
upset or stressed or anything,

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:05.870 align:middle line:90%
I will ask myself.

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:07.600 align:middle line:90%
I say, wow, I do not feel good.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.920 align:middle line:90%
I need to stop for a second.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.140 align:middle line:90%
What is going on right now?

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.490 align:middle line:90%
What am I thinking right now?

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And then I go over the story
I've been telling myself.

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:17.890 align:middle line:84%
And I realize, oh,
well that makes sense.

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:20.570 align:middle line:90%
Now let's change the story.

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:21.370 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Because often, it's just a
story and your interpretation

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:25.300 align:middle line:90%
of what's going on.

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.758 align:middle line:84%
Well, what if you could actually
change that interpretation

00:19:27.758 --> 00:19:29.080 align:middle line:90%
to something positive?

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:31.320 align:middle line:84%
Because in the end, think
about, think about this.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.070 align:middle line:84%
Think about something
that happened to you

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:35.320 align:middle line:90%
in the past that was negative.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And then fast forward two years,
five years, and you look back

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:41.738 align:middle line:84%
and you most of the
time you would say,

00:19:41.738 --> 00:19:43.780 align:middle line:84%
that was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.250 align:middle line:84%
Could have been a
breakup, and then

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:48.160 align:middle line:84%
you later met your
real soulmate.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.620 align:middle line:84%
In my case, all those
things happened, and today,

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:52.090 align:middle line:90%
look at what I'm doing.

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Like if somebody gave me
a crystal ball and said,

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.370 align:middle line:84%
OK, Sonia, I know
you're depressed

00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:00.280 align:middle line:84%
and crying and playing the
victim and all that, OK.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.250 align:middle line:84%
Look at this, look
at this crystal ball.

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:06.760 align:middle line:84%
Look at your life of how it's
going to be in the future.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.560 align:middle line:84%
If I looked at that,
I would have said,

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't know whose life that is,
but there's no way it's mine,

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:15.770 align:middle line:84%
because I have no idea
how that's even possible.

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:17.320 align:middle line:90%
So you never know.

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:20.500 align:middle line:84%
You have to trust and
you have to believe,

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:22.220 align:middle line:90%
and you move forward.

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:24.880 align:middle line:84%
But I'm telling you, right here,
this is where it all begins.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.470 align:middle line:84%
By reprogramming
your conscious mind.

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:28.370 align:middle line:84%
Conscious mind
means your thoughts.

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:30.760 align:middle line:84%
You can easily become aware
of what you're thinking.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.680 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you do
that and you're

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:37.990 align:middle line:84%
able to shift it and turn it
into a positive story or a more

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:41.050 align:middle line:90%
positive story, you feel better.

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:43.720 align:middle line:84%
Because obviously,
your thoughts are

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:46.390 align:middle line:84%
what's causing you to
feel what you're feeling.

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:49.050 align:middle line:90%


00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:51.590 align:middle line:90%
>> So step one, conscious mind.

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:55.220 align:middle line:84%
Interrupt those thoughts,
question those thoughts,

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:58.460 align:middle line:84%
try to do some discovery
around why do I,

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.363 align:middle line:84%
why am I feeling
bad about this and

00:21:00.363 --> 00:21:01.530 align:middle line:90%
can I change those thoughts?

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:03.080 align:middle line:90%
So that makes sense.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.000 align:middle line:90%
I can understand that.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.360 align:middle line:90%
Step two, step three.

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:10.800 align:middle line:84%
So step two is reprogram
your subconscious mind.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:14.660 align:middle line:84%
So what that means is, this
is a lot harder by the way.

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:16.790 align:middle line:84%
You can do it, it's just
harder than, the other one

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:18.648 align:middle line:84%
is like, what am I
thinking about right now

00:21:18.648 --> 00:21:19.940 align:middle line:90%
that's making me feel this way.

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:20.960 align:middle line:90%
Pretty simple.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:24.020 align:middle line:84%
Step two, subconscious,
reprogram your subconscious

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:28.910 align:middle line:84%
mind, those are your
limiting beliefs.

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:33.750 align:middle line:84%
What you believe is
what you will manifest.

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:34.550 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to figure
out that area of your life

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:42.110 align:middle line:84%
that isn't working, what are
your beliefs around that area?

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:45.920 align:middle line:84%
Because those beliefs will
determine how successful you

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:48.558 align:middle line:90%
are in that area of your life.

00:21:48.558 --> 00:21:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's really interesting,
because sometimes we

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:54.178 align:middle line:84%
have beliefs and we don't even
know we have those beliefs.

00:21:54.178 --> 00:21:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's why that's step one
is important, because once you

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.350 align:middle line:84%
start becoming aware
of your thoughts,

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:00.683 align:middle line:84%
then you start recognizing
what you're telling yourself.

00:22:00.683 --> 00:22:03.770 align:middle line:84%
What you're telling yourself
is so powerful in determining

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:08.690 align:middle line:84%
what action you take,
determining of what direction

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:10.470 align:middle line:90%
you will go in your life.

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And so your limiting
beliefs are what

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:17.630 align:middle line:84%
really drive you in every way
without you even realizing it.

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:20.150 align:middle line:84%
The good news is,
that you can uncover

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:21.510 align:middle line:90%
what your limiting beliefs are.

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And once you, in that
area that's not working,

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:26.090 align:middle line:84%
and once you do, then
you just shift them

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:29.240 align:middle line:84%
to positive empowering
beliefs instead.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And then once you've done that,
everything shifts in that area.

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.630 align:middle line:84%
But until you do
that, it'll be very

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:39.260 align:middle line:84%
difficult to truly transform
that area of your life.

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:42.085 align:middle line:84%
You might say, I want
to meet my soul mate.

00:22:42.085 --> 00:22:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And then you meet
your soul mate,

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:44.960 align:middle line:84%
but then you break
up three months later

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.580 align:middle line:84%
and then you're looking
for your soul mate again.

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.663 align:middle line:84%
And then you meet your
soul mate six months later,

00:22:48.663 --> 00:22:51.590 align:middle line:84%
and then you break up, and
there are limiting beliefs

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:54.500 align:middle line:84%
around that area of your
life around relationships.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Or money's a big
one for many people.

00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're finding you're
having a lot of difficulty

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.800 align:middle line:84%
making ends meet or you're not
reaching your financial goals

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:07.050 align:middle line:84%
and no matter how hard you
try, how harder you work,

00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:09.590 align:middle line:84%
no matter what you do,
it's still not happening,

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:11.540 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes it happens
and then you lose it

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:13.850 align:middle line:84%
and it happens and
you lose it, you

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:16.550 align:middle line:84%
need to analyze and figure
out what your beliefs are

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:18.830 align:middle line:90%
around the area of money.

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:20.040 align:middle line:90%
That's a really huge one.

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.498 align:middle line:84%
So what people are
normally looking

00:23:21.498 --> 00:23:23.120 align:middle line:84%
for when it comes
to making money,

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.250 align:middle line:84%
is all different kinds
of opportunities.

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:26.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to get a better job.

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:28.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start
a new business.

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do this.

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:31.790 align:middle line:90%
And those are all good things.

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:35.990 align:middle line:84%
But if you haven't shifted your
limiting beliefs around money,

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:40.640 align:middle line:84%
you will always be struggling
around money, no matter what.

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.320 align:middle line:84%
So the good news is,
all you have to do

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.940 align:middle line:84%
is uncover what your
limiting beliefs are.

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:45.523 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to give
you some examples

00:23:45.523 --> 00:23:49.820 align:middle line:84%
around what limiting beliefs
are around money, for instance.

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:52.220 align:middle line:90%
I'll never be a millionaire.

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:55.550 align:middle line:90%
Rich people are jerks.

00:23:55.550 --> 00:24:01.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm too old to be rich.

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:05.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm not smart enough to be rich.

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.870 align:middle line:90%
Money doesn't grow on trees.

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:10.790 align:middle line:84%
All these, whatever
your beliefs are.

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And often, by the way,
where these limiting beliefs

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:18.540 align:middle line:84%
come from, they come from our
childhood, our experiences.

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:21.770 align:middle line:84%
It comes over, it's like a
programming over the years.

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And the stories we're telling
ourselves about the different

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.300 align:middle line:90%
experiences that we have.

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.130 align:middle line:84%
Course, our parents
are our biggest ones.

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Like I grew up with you
have to save your money.

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:33.200 align:middle line:90%
You have to save your money.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.670 align:middle line:90%
You can't have that.

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:35.930 align:middle line:90%
We have no money.

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:37.430 align:middle line:90%
We're poor.

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:38.450 align:middle line:90%
All those things.

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And I, my parents were
immigrants from Italy.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm first
generation Canadian.

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And so they came with
like $10 in their pocket.

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:49.910 align:middle line:90%
There was so much scarcity.

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:52.890 align:middle line:84%
A lot of love, but
a lot of scarcity.

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to deprogram
all that over time

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.540 align:middle line:84%
once I started
understanding all of this.

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
about limiting beliefs,

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:05.600 align:middle line:84%
is that you will start
uncovering them all the time.

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:10.670 align:middle line:84%
Even like for me,
financially, I really

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:13.130 align:middle line:84%
figured out what all my
limiting beliefs were.

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually, I realized
I still had them years later

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:18.020 align:middle line:90%
after I was already successful.

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'd love to
give you an example.

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.150 align:middle line:84%
This is an extreme
example, but just

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:27.500 align:middle line:84%
to give you an idea of how
powerful limiting beliefs are.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:30.380 align:middle line:84%
I had bounced back,
and that was great.

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And my business was booming
and I was doing really well.

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And I was completely out of
debt and had a nice sum of money

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:37.040 align:middle line:90%
in my account.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.620 align:middle line:90%
And I was making six figures.

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And all my colleagues
and friends

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:44.990 align:middle line:90%
were making seven figures.

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And my goal was to make seven
figures, make my first million.

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And I tried and tried and I
didn't know what else to do.

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:54.770 align:middle line:90%
It just wasn't happening.

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:56.478 align:middle line:84%
Now I couldn't work
more hours, because I

00:25:56.478 --> 00:25:58.250 align:middle line:90%
was working so many hours.

00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing what
everyone else was doing

00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:03.890 align:middle line:84%
and why is it working
for them and not me?

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
thinking about that

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:07.040 align:middle line:90%
once when I was at a red light.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:10.510 align:middle line:84%
I was driving and I had
my little dog next to me.

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:12.470 align:middle line:84%
We're on our way
to the dog park.

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And I was stopped at a red
light and for some reason

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:16.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm thinking about this.

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, I
just don't understand.

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:19.460 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what else to do.

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:20.660 align:middle line:90%
How do I get to seven figures?

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:21.868 align:middle line:90%
How does everyone else do it?

00:26:21.868 --> 00:26:24.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing exactly what they're
doing, it's not working,

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:26.750 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand.

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And then it got quiet in my
head for like five seconds.

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
thought was this.

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.210 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but Sonia,
remember when you

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:37.010 align:middle line:84%
used to work in the
fitness industry

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:39.020 align:middle line:84%
and you used to
oversee five clubs

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:41.810 align:middle line:84%
and there were
like 300 employees.

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:44.600 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember how
stressful it was for you

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:47.610 align:middle line:90%
to have so many employees?

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:50.840 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have to have
so many employees in order

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:52.250 align:middle line:90%
to make seven figures.

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:54.680 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember
how miserable you

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.750 align:middle line:90%
were when you were doing that?

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:58.550 align:middle line:84%
People not showing
up for their shifts.

00:26:58.550 --> 00:26:59.780 align:middle line:90%
You have to let people go.

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:03.440 align:middle line:84%
They start crying, you have to
deal with all that situation.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.210 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
make seven figures.

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:08.350 align:middle line:90%


00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:10.410 align:middle line:90%
That story popped into my head.

00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:12.910 align:middle line:84%
And I just remember, and I think
it's because I became aware

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:15.220 align:middle line:90%
of my thoughts.

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:18.550 align:middle line:84%
But this one was so deep that I
never noticed this one until I

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:19.960 align:middle line:90%
was stopped at this red light.

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And I go, did I just really
just say that to myself?

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:26.200 align:middle line:90%
That's a limiting belief.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.843 align:middle line:84%
I had a limiting belief that
in order to make seven figures,

00:27:28.843 --> 00:27:30.010 align:middle line:90%
I'd have to have a big team.

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And if I had a big team, I
would be really miserable.

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:33.177 align:middle line:90%
Because you know what?

00:27:33.177 --> 00:27:36.070 align:middle line:90%
I was miserable in the past.

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:38.240 align:middle line:90%
And that isn't true.

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:41.920 align:middle line:84%
I know people, my colleagues who
have really small teams making

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.660 align:middle line:90%
multiple seven figures.

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:44.740 align:middle line:90%
So it wasn't even true.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:47.170 align:middle line:84%
It was a limiting belief
that I didn't even

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:49.653 align:middle line:84%
realize I had until
I became aware of it.

00:27:49.653 --> 00:27:51.070 align:middle line:84%
So I took it from
the subconscious

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:53.260 align:middle line:90%
and brought it to the conscious.

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And then I laughed at myself
and I said, oh my goodness,

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:58.270 align:middle line:90%
that's it.

00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:00.968 align:middle line:84%
I have been self-sabotaging
myself all along.

00:28:00.968 --> 00:28:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Because I really didn't
want that, because I knew

00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:05.410 align:middle line:90%
it would make me miserable.

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:06.550 align:middle line:90%
When it wasn't even true.

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:09.400 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, OK, well,
now my new belief is this.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:13.300 align:middle line:84%
I am going to make seven
figures, multiple seven

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:15.700 align:middle line:84%
figures, if possible,
that's ideal,

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.740 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to do
it with a small team

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:19.480 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to
be my dream team.

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And this dream team are
going to be super evolved,

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:25.090 align:middle line:84%
inspirational, really
behind the mission,

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:26.950 align:middle line:84%
and we will all love
each other and we're

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:30.680 align:middle line:84%
going to work together and
make this world a better place.

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:33.070 align:middle line:90%
Now that feels good.

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:34.990 align:middle line:90%
And I continued driving.

00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And shortly after
that, everything

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:37.960 align:middle line:90%
shifted in the business.

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:40.860 align:middle line:90%


00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:44.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So that process for shifting
that limiting belief system

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:48.300 align:middle line:84%
became from a subconscious
to a conscious process.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.410 align:middle line:90%
Powerful.

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:53.240 align:middle line:84%
What if people's subconscious
doesn't bubble up

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.350 align:middle line:90%
to their conscious mind?

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:56.958 align:middle line:84%
Are there other processes
that really can help people

00:28:56.958 --> 00:28:58.250 align:middle line:90%
break through limiting beliefs?

00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:00.208 align:middle line:84%
Because I know there's
things like hypnotherapy

00:29:00.208 --> 00:29:01.850 align:middle line:84%
or there might be
things like tapping

00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:04.640 align:middle line:84%
or any sort of ways to
get through emotional.

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.140 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the
first criticism

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:07.380 align:middle line:90%
people get about that.

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm glad you said money
doesn't grow on trees.

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:09.550 align:middle line:90%
That was mine.

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:12.630 align:middle line:84%
I remember 2003, Tony
Robbins seminar, I'm like,

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:14.240 align:middle line:90%
I want to do something I love.

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.987 align:middle line:84%
My job, I enjoy it,
but I want to make

00:29:15.987 --> 00:29:17.070 align:middle line:90%
a difference in the world.

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:17.480 align:middle line:90%
I want to do this.

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And I realized I had this
limiting belief that money

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:20.227 align:middle line:90%
doesn't grow on trees.

00:29:20.227 --> 00:29:21.830 align:middle line:90%
You got to go out there.

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And that was a fascinating
thing to break through.

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:26.780 align:middle line:84%
Because once you do, then
the opportunities come.

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:29.330 align:middle line:84%
So I'm here nodding
in agreement.

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:32.090 align:middle line:84%
But yes, the main
question is, people

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:35.660 align:middle line:84%
are critical of shifting beliefs
because they might not all

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.380 align:middle line:90%
come to the surface.

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.470 align:middle line:90%
And so they're still there.

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Or if they're there,
they might not

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:42.770 align:middle line:84%
know how to fully
break through them.

00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:43.645 align:middle line:90%
How can they do that?

00:29:43.645 --> 00:29:47.150 align:middle line:84%
>> So what's interesting is
the more you do this work,

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:48.740 align:middle line:90%
the easier they come up for you.

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:51.380 align:middle line:84%
So that came up for me
while I was driving.

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And another exercise,
a really great exercise

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:58.340 align:middle line:84%
would be actually pick
that area of your life

00:29:58.340 --> 00:29:59.630 align:middle line:90%
that isn't working.

00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:00.710 align:middle line:90%
So let's say financial.

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:03.135 align:middle line:84%
And then just write
out the story.

00:30:03.135 --> 00:30:04.010 align:middle line:90%
Write out your story.

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:06.545 align:middle line:84%
Just hand write the story of
what's going on in that area.

00:30:06.545 --> 00:30:08.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I do journaling
every single morning.

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:10.407 align:middle line:84%
I start off my day
journaling and I just

00:30:10.407 --> 00:30:12.740 align:middle line:84%
write and write and write and
write and write and write.

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:13.820 align:middle line:90%
So you tell your story.

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:16.520 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I can't believe
that I'm six figures in debt.

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:17.990 align:middle line:90%
How did this happen?

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:19.250 align:middle line:90%
Whatever the story is.

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:21.555 align:middle line:84%
And I'm never going to make
any, that kind of money.

00:30:21.555 --> 00:30:23.180 align:middle line:84%
How am I ever going
to get out of debt?

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:24.763 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to end up
losing everything.

00:30:24.763 --> 00:30:26.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to, and whatever.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.040 align:middle line:84%
Just write and
write and don't edit

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:30.530 align:middle line:84%
or anything, just free flow
and write and write and write

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:32.360 align:middle line:90%
and tell your story.

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And keep on writing until
you just can't write anymore

00:30:35.150 --> 00:30:35.960 align:middle line:90%
around that.

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:39.230 align:middle line:84%
Just put it, whatever's in your
head, just put it on paper.

00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:42.690 align:middle line:84%
This is your truth
around that area.

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And then what I want you
to do is then go back,

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.520 align:middle line:90%
and then read it.

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:47.840 align:middle line:90%
And then read it again.

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And then read it again,
and then read it again.

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And by the time you read
it the fifth or sixth time,

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:55.730 align:middle line:84%
you're going to start
noticing the story.

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:57.500 align:middle line:90%
A, how negative it is.

00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And B, ask yourself
that question.

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:02.120 align:middle line:84%
Is like, is this really
true or is this the story

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:05.193 align:middle line:90%
I've been telling myself?

00:31:05.193 --> 00:31:06.110 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I did.

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:09.410 align:middle line:84%
I did that whole process
just sitting in the car.

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:10.290 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:11.670 align:middle line:84%
I knew immediately
that wasn't true.

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:13.310 align:middle line:84%
I just couldn't believe I was
telling myself that story.

00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:14.570 align:middle line:84%
The problem is,
we don't know what

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:16.760 align:middle line:84%
the story is that we're
telling ourselves that are

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:18.260 align:middle line:90%
these limiting beliefs.

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:19.730 align:middle line:84%
But by writing it
out, that's when

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:22.552 align:middle line:84%
you know you're telling
your story to yourself.

00:31:22.552 --> 00:31:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And so what's going on in here,
you're putting it on paper.

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:27.710 align:middle line:84%
Usually what's going on in
here, we don't pay attention to.

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:28.975 align:middle line:90%
We believe that's the truth.

00:31:28.975 --> 00:31:29.850 align:middle line:90%
That's not the truth.

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:32.463 align:middle line:90%
They're just thoughts.

00:31:32.463 --> 00:31:33.380 align:middle line:90%
They're just thoughts.

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:35.210 align:middle line:90%
That's not the truth.

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And so once you've
done that, you

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:39.800 align:middle line:84%
can become aware of
what you tell yourself.

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And then just read it
and go, is this all true.

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:46.040 align:middle line:90%
And remember, what is truth.

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.135 align:middle line:90%
Truth are facts.

00:31:47.135 --> 00:31:49.740 align:middle line:90%


00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:50.830 align:middle line:90%
Truth are facts.

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:52.010 align:middle line:90%
So pick out all the facts.

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Like even if like you broke
up with your girlfriend,

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:58.440 align:middle line:84%
your boyfriend, your
husband, your wife and you

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:01.130 align:middle line:84%
have this horrible breakup
and a horrible experience

00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:04.030 align:middle line:84%
and that's the area that's
not working for you today,

00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:06.572 align:middle line:84%
you're trying to meet your soul
mate, but you don't know why.

00:32:06.572 --> 00:32:08.130 align:middle line:90%
Well, write that story down.

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be shocked at what
you'll notice when you start

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:12.560 align:middle line:90%
reading how negative it was.

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And I've been in that place in
the past, and it's like, oh,

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:19.170 align:middle line:84%
he said he loved me,
but he never did.

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:20.160 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's the whole
drama around it.

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And you write it all out and
he did this and da-da-da.

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:30.388 align:middle line:84%
But he said he loved me, and I
dedicated 10 years of my life

00:32:30.388 --> 00:32:31.430 align:middle line:90%
and what a waste of time.

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Like the stuff we
tell ourselves.

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.650 align:middle line:90%
Write it all out.

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And then just look at
it and just say, OK, now

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:39.300 align:middle line:84%
what's really true
in this story.

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:42.030 align:middle line:84%
Not your interpretation of what
happened, what's really true.

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:46.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's like we went
out and we broke up.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:50.390 align:middle line:90%


00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:51.190 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:53.620 align:middle line:84%
Most of the rest of the stuff,
unless we went on vacation,

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:54.453 align:middle line:90%
we went on vacation.

00:32:54.453 --> 00:32:56.720 align:middle line:90%


00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:57.520 align:middle line:90%
Those are facts.

00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:59.560 align:middle line:84%
But everything else
is a story of what,

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:02.290 align:middle line:84%
because I can guarantee you,
if he wrote that same story,

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:04.750 align:middle line:84%
it'd be a totally different
story, like we were not even

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:05.710 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:07.663 align:middle line:90%
Like we were different people.

00:33:07.663 --> 00:33:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And so what's important is to be
able to write it down and write

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:11.130 align:middle line:90%
out your story.

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And once you start reading it,
you'll start picking up like,

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:18.260 align:middle line:84%
have I really been
believing this.

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And then once you
pick out what that is,

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:24.670 align:middle line:84%
you can easily shift it into
positive, empowering belief.

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:28.930 align:middle line:84%
So for money, for instance, I
always say this to this day,

00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:32.320 align:middle line:84%
and it's kind of an ongoing
joke with all my friends

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.220 align:middle line:84%
and family, because I
do this all the time.

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.610 align:middle line:84%
I love to say,
money flows easily,

00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:39.310 align:middle line:90%
freely and from everywhere.

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:42.280 align:middle line:84%
Money flows easily, freely
and from everywhere.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:45.320 align:middle line:84%
Money flows easily, freely
and from everywhere.

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And I have it on a
poster in my office.

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:51.850 align:middle line:84%
I will find a nickel on the
ground and I will pick it up

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:54.460 align:middle line:84%
and I will be,
money flows easily,

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:56.800 align:middle line:90%
freely and from everywhere.

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And any time, like I
see it all the time,

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:02.620 align:middle line:90%
and it's, and it really does.

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:04.550 align:middle line:90%
It's really crazy.

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:05.860 align:middle line:90%
It's really crazy.

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And so you start reprogramming
your subconscious mind.

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:12.909 align:middle line:84%
Instead of thinking money
doesn't grow on trees,

00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:17.139 align:middle line:84%
I'll never be a millionaire,
only other people,

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:21.820 align:middle line:84%
other people are the ones
that become rich, not me.

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:24.530 align:middle line:90%
Well, why not you?

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:26.139 align:middle line:90%
Why not you?

00:34:26.139 --> 00:34:27.790 align:middle line:90%
Ask yourself that question.

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:30.280 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of stuff
is going to come up.

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:31.362 align:middle line:90%
Why not you?

00:34:31.362 --> 00:34:32.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, because I'm
not smart enough.

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:34.389 align:middle line:84%
OK, there's another
limiting belief.

00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:35.972 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
people that are not

00:34:35.972 --> 00:34:40.239 align:middle line:90%
smart that are billionaires.

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And so it's important
to really uncover

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:45.040 align:middle line:84%
those limiting beliefs,
and trying to figure out

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:48.250 align:middle line:84%
what is it that has been
stopping me from moving forward

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:50.380 align:middle line:90%
in that area of my life.

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:52.040 align:middle line:90%
It's very powerful.

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:54.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling you right
now, once you uncover

00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:56.889 align:middle line:84%
what your limiting beliefs
are around that area that's

00:34:56.889 --> 00:35:00.340 align:middle line:84%
not working in your life,
everything will shift.

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:04.150 align:middle line:84%
You just need to turn it into
positive, empowering beliefs

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.990 align:middle line:90%
instead.

00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:08.470 align:middle line:84%
But you can't do that until
you uncover what they are.

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:09.700 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:10.540 align:middle line:90%
High five.

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:11.470 align:middle line:90%
I think it's awesome.

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:14.440 align:middle line:84%
And to be honest, I think I can
resonate so deeply with this

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.450 align:middle line:90%
because my story was a disaster.

00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:19.710 align:middle line:84%
My dad was totally unwell, had
to sell all of his business,

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:20.510 align:middle line:90%
couldn't work.

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:23.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, our family were
at a big crossroads.

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And then we quit our jobs
and we started researching

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:27.220 align:middle line:90%
about nutrition and health.

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And then that became the biggest
and best thing we've ever done.

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:31.930 align:middle line:84%
Last 10 years, we
brought Food Matters

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:34.363 align:middle line:84%
to the world, Hungry
for Change, FMTV,

00:35:34.363 --> 00:35:36.280 align:middle line:84%
which is this Netflix
for health and wellness,

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.720 align:middle line:84%
and we've helped
millions of people

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:38.860 align:middle line:84%
around the world
shift their health

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:41.360 align:middle line:84%
and their philosophies around
food and nutrition and health,

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:43.750 align:middle line:84%
because of what was the worst
thing ever in our family.

00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:45.738 align:middle line:84%
But if we believed
that we're not

00:35:45.738 --> 00:35:47.530 align:middle line:84%
up filmmakers, we didn't
go to film school,

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:48.905 align:middle line:84%
we had no idea
how to do this, we

00:35:48.905 --> 00:35:51.127 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't have been the
first film on Netflix

00:35:51.127 --> 00:35:52.960 align:middle line:84%
that really spoke about
health and wellness.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:55.060 align:middle line:90%
So I'm with you, sister.

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:59.057 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that
awareness comes from the story.

00:35:59.057 --> 00:36:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And I interviewed a
gentleman recently

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:03.098 align:middle line:84%
who had a horrible
story as well.

00:36:03.098 --> 00:36:05.390 align:middle line:84%
He was in a really bad car
accident and he nearly died.

00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And he went around with
a victim mentality.

00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:09.160 align:middle line:84%
I want to speak to victim
mentality here for a minute,

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:11.680 align:middle line:84%
because I think it
dovetails with your work,

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:13.615 align:middle line:90%
and also with belief systems.

00:36:13.615 --> 00:36:14.740 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I nearly died.

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
you face, people

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:17.390 align:middle line:84%
would say, because he had
a really big facial scar.

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:19.515 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, I nearly
died in a car accident.

00:36:19.515 --> 00:36:22.057 align:middle line:84%
But it was years later, after
doing all this work on Buddhism

00:36:22.057 --> 00:36:23.530 align:middle line:84%
and meditation and
self-awareness,

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:27.010 align:middle line:84%
he was at a workshop and this
person said, hang on a second.

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:28.420 align:middle line:90%
There was a car accident.

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:31.450 align:middle line:84%
Everything else you
added is your story.

00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:34.900 align:middle line:84%
Like you said, There's facts,
and then there's your story.

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:38.525 align:middle line:84%
And that story either paints
you as the victor or the victim.

00:36:38.525 --> 00:36:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I nearly
died in a car accident.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.970 align:middle line:84%
No, you're not nearly dead,
you're not nearly pregnant.

00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:45.050 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:46.630 align:middle line:84%
You're either pregnant
or you're dead

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:48.573 align:middle line:84%
or you're alive,
right, or not pregnant.

00:36:48.573 --> 00:36:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And so he was like, wow, there
was a breakthrough for him.

00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:53.725 align:middle line:84%
It's like, there was a
car accident, that was it.

00:36:53.725 --> 00:36:56.080 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't good or bad, it
was just, it was what it was.

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm alive, I'm OK now.

00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:58.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm really.

00:36:58.810 --> 00:37:01.817 align:middle line:84%
So how can people
be aware of the fact

00:37:01.817 --> 00:37:03.400 align:middle line:84%
of whether they're
painting themselves

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:05.230 align:middle line:90%
into a victim mentality?

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And is this the third
step that you alluded to?

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:08.800 align:middle line:90%
No, OK.

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:09.733 align:middle line:90%
Well.

00:37:09.733 --> 00:37:10.900 align:middle line:90%
>> We could talk about that.

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.790 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
victim mentality thing

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:14.790 align:middle line:84%
and then we can go to the
third step thereafter.

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>> The victim mentality is
really all about the story

00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:20.950 align:middle line:84%
you're telling yourself, I
mean, that's the bottom line.

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Is, like I always say,
it's OK to feel bad when

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:25.902 align:middle line:90%
something bad is happening.

00:37:25.902 --> 00:37:28.235 align:middle line:84%
But if it's 20 years later,
then that's not a good thing

00:37:28.235 --> 00:37:29.402 align:middle line:90%
and you're doing this wrong.

00:37:29.402 --> 00:37:30.740 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:33.160 align:middle line:84%
It's OK to feel bad when
something bad's happening.

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:36.580 align:middle line:84%
You can actually allow yourself
to be a victim, because you're

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:38.118 align:middle line:90%
doing it consciously now.

00:37:38.118 --> 00:37:39.160 align:middle line:90%
It's like, you know what?

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:41.080 align:middle line:84%
I just broke up
with my boyfriend,

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm really, really
sad right now.

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to
buck up and be strong

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:47.790 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to, I
could do this, la-la-la.

00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:48.590 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:51.590 align:middle line:84%
My heart is ripped
open, I'm broken open.

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:53.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to cry
right now and allow

00:37:53.090 --> 00:37:55.437 align:middle line:90%
myself to play the victim.

00:37:55.437 --> 00:37:57.020 align:middle line:84%
You're like giving
yourself permission

00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:58.850 align:middle line:90%
to feel what you're feeling.

00:37:58.850 --> 00:38:00.920 align:middle line:84%
What's amazing
with doing that, is

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:05.355 align:middle line:84%
that you're allowing yourself
to release what, you're human.

00:38:05.355 --> 00:38:07.730 align:middle line:84%
Of course you're going to have
times when you want to cry

00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:09.380 align:middle line:90%
and you want to let it out.

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:11.180 align:middle line:84%
You don't always
have to be strong,

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:14.060 align:middle line:84%
and you don't always
have to be perfect.

00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:16.850 align:middle line:84%
So you allow yourself
to release it.

00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And just that
release immediately

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:20.810 align:middle line:90%
makes you feel better.

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And so I actually tell people,
listen, even though all that

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:31.010 align:middle line:84%
happened, after that and more
recently, my mom passed away.

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And that honestly,
everything that happened,

00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:33.950 align:middle line:90%
this is the ironic part.

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:36.253 align:middle line:84%
Everything is relative,
because all that.

00:38:36.253 --> 00:38:37.670 align:middle line:84%
I lost my home due
to foreclosure,

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:40.550 align:middle line:84%
I was $124,000 in debt,
my ex was an alcoholic,

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:43.790 align:middle line:84%
relationship broke up, I had
serious blood clot health

00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:44.590 align:middle line:90%
issues.

00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:46.798 align:middle line:84%
Oh my god, that's the worst
thing that ever happened.

00:38:46.798 --> 00:38:49.760 align:middle line:84%
Until my mom got cancer
and was really sick

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:52.280 align:middle line:84%
and I watched her deteriorate
in front of my eyes

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:56.600 align:middle line:84%
and die in front of me and I
watch her take her last breath.

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.940 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, that
stuff, that's a joke.

00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:01.780 align:middle line:90%


00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:03.350 align:middle line:90%
So it's all relative.

00:39:03.350 --> 00:39:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And so the reason I'm mentioning
that is that it just occurred

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:09.370 align:middle line:84%
to me, especially when
my mom passed away,

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:11.230 align:middle line:84%
is what's really
important in life,

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:15.220 align:middle line:84%
and how we put so much
emphasis on all these things

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:17.200 align:middle line:84%
until something
really big happens.

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
that's not important.

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:21.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling you, when
my mom was hospitalized.

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:24.370 align:middle line:84%
Before she passed away, she
was hospitalized for six weeks.

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Before that, I was
tired, exhausted

00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:27.870 align:middle line:90%
with work and all that.

00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:29.620 align:middle line:84%
I needed to take time
off, but I couldn't,

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:31.610 align:middle line:90%
because I'm way too busy.

00:39:31.610 --> 00:39:33.260 align:middle line:84%
I've got too much
stuff going on.

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:35.380 align:middle line:84%
Like, I just can't
take time off.

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Soon as my mom was hospitalized,
I all of a sudden I'm

00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:40.420 align:middle line:90%
out for over six weeks.

00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:42.340 align:middle line:90%
Where did that come from?

00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:44.650 align:middle line:84%
It's because I got my
priorities straight.

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I'm saying
that, is that in the end,

00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:54.130 align:middle line:84%
yes, there'll be times that
you will play the victim,

00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:56.950 align:middle line:84%
but that's not
necessarily a bad thing.

00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:59.230 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes
things really do

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:01.450 align:middle line:90%
happen that make you feel bad.

00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:04.300 align:middle line:84%
And don't let
anyone ever tell you

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:05.500 align:middle line:90%
that you shouldn't feel bad.

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:07.917 align:middle line:84%
No one should be telling you
how you should feel any time.

00:40:07.917 --> 00:40:10.660 align:middle line:84%
You can bounce
back, and you will.

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:12.340 align:middle line:90%
It's how quickly you'll do it.

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:15.200 align:middle line:84%
But it's OK to feel
bad in that moment.

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't know
how comfortable I feel,

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:21.360 align:middle line:84%
like even that
whole word, victim.

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:24.100 align:middle line:84%
Like, it's not
victim, it's life.

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:26.590 align:middle line:90%
Life is life and things happen.

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Good things happen,
bad things happen.

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:30.910 align:middle line:90%
My mom used to always say this.

00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:34.570 align:middle line:90%
Sonia, life is like a staircase.

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:38.283 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you go up and
sometimes you go down.

00:40:38.283 --> 00:40:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And when you go
down and you don't

00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:43.450 align:middle line:84%
feel good, allow it, release
it, feel it at a deep level.

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:45.480 align:middle line:84%
I did that when my
mom was hospitalized.

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:48.082 align:middle line:84%
Seriously, I was crying
every day in the hospital.

00:40:48.082 --> 00:40:49.165 align:middle line:90%
I didn't care where I was.

00:40:49.165 --> 00:40:51.740 align:middle line:84%
I was waiting for the elevator
in the hospital, I was crying.

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:53.073 align:middle line:90%
I was in the room, I was crying.

00:40:53.073 --> 00:40:55.430 align:middle line:84%
The nurse and doctor
there, I was crying.

00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:56.890 align:middle line:90%
I never apologized ever.

00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:57.690 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:01.330 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what I
felt. My mom's dying.

00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:05.710 align:middle line:84%
So I feel sad and I'm going
to cry, and I'll be OK.

00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:08.690 align:middle line:90%


00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:09.490 align:middle line:90%
I'll be OK.

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:11.778 align:middle line:84%
But this is how
I feel right now.

00:41:11.778 --> 00:41:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And the good news is,
I had the tools to be

00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:15.620 align:middle line:90%
able to bounce back after that.

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:18.732 align:middle line:84%
But I think playing
the victim to me really

00:41:18.732 --> 00:41:21.190 align:middle line:84%
means like it's 20 years later
and you're still complaining

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:22.940 align:middle line:84%
about something that
happened 20 years ago

00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:24.850 align:middle line:84%
and you're just
not letting it go.

00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And that is actually a
huge part, by the way,

00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:31.190 align:middle line:90%
of step number three.

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:33.180 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to know what
step number three is?

00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:37.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And I love breaking
it into three steps,

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:39.940 align:middle line:84%
just so it's so much
easier to grasp.

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:43.900 align:middle line:84%
Step number three is elevating
your vibrational frequency

00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:49.570 align:middle line:84%
to a state of love,
peace, joy and gratitude.

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:52.220 align:middle line:84%
Once you get yourself to a
state of love, peace, joy

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:56.030 align:middle line:84%
and gratitude, everything
will shift in your life.

00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:57.190 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:59.830 align:middle line:84%
Now whether you believe
in the Law of Attraction

00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:01.610 align:middle line:84%
or you don't, it
doesn't really matter.

00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:03.010 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:42:03.010 --> 00:42:05.480 align:middle line:84%
If you get yourself to a
state of love, peace, joy

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:09.100 align:middle line:84%
and gratitude, how
would you feel?

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:11.110 align:middle line:90%
How would you like your life?

00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:12.560 align:middle line:90%
It would be great.

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:14.070 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter what you believe.

00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:15.820 align:middle line:84%
But I'm telling you,
once you get yourself

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:17.840 align:middle line:84%
to a state of love,
peace, joy and gratitude,

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:20.920 align:middle line:84%
which is the highest vibrational
frequency, especially love

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:22.870 align:middle line:84%
and peace, really
powerful, and you

00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:25.780 align:middle line:84%
do the work to be
able to get to that,

00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:27.820 align:middle line:84%
everything will be
OK in your life,

00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:32.230 align:middle line:84%
even when something quote
unquote, bad, happens.

00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And so you'll start attracting
more positive people, things,

00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:38.080 align:middle line:90%
situations in your life.

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:38.880 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.768 align:middle line:90%
Because that's who you're being.

00:42:40.768 --> 00:42:43.347 align:middle line:84%
You're being love,
peace, joy and gratitude.

00:42:43.347 --> 00:42:45.430 align:middle line:84%
That is what you will
attract back into your life.

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:48.658 align:middle line:84%
When you're being negative,
angry, resentful, all that,

00:42:48.658 --> 00:42:50.200 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
attract more of that.

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:50.530 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:52.780 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what you're
focusing on and that's what

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:54.010 align:middle line:90%
you're going to see.

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:56.260 align:middle line:90%
Remember all those open doors?

00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:57.072 align:middle line:90%
They're not there.

00:42:57.072 --> 00:42:59.530 align:middle line:84%
When you're in love, peace,
joy and gratitude, you're like,

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:01.100 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen so
many open doors.

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:03.235 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know which
one to go through, wow!

00:43:03.235 --> 00:43:05.740 align:middle line:90%


00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And so how do you get to a
state of love, peace, joy

00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:12.160 align:middle line:84%
and gratitude is the number one
question people always ask me.

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:14.080 align:middle line:90%
And there's many ways.

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:16.340 align:middle line:84%
There are many ways
that you can do it.

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things,
I'm going to give you

00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:23.140 align:middle line:90%
a few ways of doing it.

00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And probably all these
things you should do.

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:30.285 align:middle line:90%
Let go of the negative past.

00:43:30.285 --> 00:43:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're holding
onto the negative past,

00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:34.922 align:middle line:84%
the negative things that
happened to you in the past,

00:43:34.922 --> 00:43:36.880 align:middle line:84%
not only are you bringing
it into your present,

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:39.100 align:middle line:84%
but you're affecting
your future.

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:42.190 align:middle line:84%
Because every decision you
make, how you see things,

00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:45.580 align:middle line:84%
your perception, you're holding
onto something from the past,

00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:48.580 align:middle line:90%
so it's very negative.

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And so if you don't let
go of the negative past,

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:53.650 align:middle line:84%
it will be difficult
to transform

00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:56.770 align:middle line:90%
your life going forward.

00:43:56.770 --> 00:43:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people say,
well, how do we do that?

00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:09.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, one great way is to think
of the past as no longer real.

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:13.090 align:middle line:84%
Because the reality is,
the past doesn't exist.

00:44:13.090 --> 00:44:15.790 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of people argue that.

00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:17.267 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't exist.

00:44:17.267 --> 00:44:18.100 align:middle line:90%
Where does it exist?

00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:19.030 align:middle line:90%
Show it to me.

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:20.590 align:middle line:84%
Where does it,
where does it exist?

00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:21.680 align:middle line:90%
Is it this?

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:22.480 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't exist.

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:26.230 align:middle line:84%
The only place it exists
is this thing again!

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:29.410 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't exist.

00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And so the past, we're keeping
the past alive by our thoughts.

00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:36.930 align:middle line:84%
So the past are
really just thoughts.

00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:37.730 align:middle line:90%
They don't exist.

00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:41.560 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it happened, but it's
like reading a history book.

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:44.360 align:middle line:84%
World War I happened,
World War II happened,

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Sonia's ex was an
alcoholic and it was

00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:50.530 align:middle line:90%
a miserable time in her life.

00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And so the past doesn't really
exist when you really think

00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:57.310 align:middle line:90%
about it, except as a thought.

00:44:57.310 --> 00:45:00.490 align:middle line:84%
So if you could shift that
thought, you can let it go.

00:45:00.490 --> 00:45:04.240 align:middle line:84%
Hold on to those positive
experiences over time.

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:06.670 align:middle line:90%
The crazy part is this.

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:10.870 align:middle line:84%
Is that the future
doesn't exist either.

00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:15.580 align:middle line:90%
So the future is also a thought.

00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:17.860 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:20.200 align:middle line:84%
When you're thinking about
the future, you're thinking.

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:21.225 align:middle line:90%
It's not real.

00:45:21.225 --> 00:45:23.350 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean you don't
think about the future,

00:45:23.350 --> 00:45:24.290 align:middle line:90%
you don't plan for the future.

00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:25.090 align:middle line:90%
Of course, you do.

00:45:25.090 --> 00:45:25.930 align:middle line:90%
But think about it.

00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:27.832 align:middle line:90%
The future doesn't exist either.

00:45:27.832 --> 00:45:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
know that anytime

00:45:29.290 --> 00:45:32.260 align:middle line:84%
you're feeling stressed
or angry or worried,

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:36.400 align:middle line:84%
chances are you were either,
all those negative feelings,

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:38.608 align:middle line:84%
you're either focusing on
what happened in the past

00:45:38.608 --> 00:45:40.900 align:middle line:84%
or you're worrying about
what's going on in the future.

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:42.755 align:middle line:90%
You're not in the present.

00:45:42.755 --> 00:45:44.380 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as you
become aware of that,

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:46.918 align:middle line:84%
that immediately makes
everything better.

00:45:46.918 --> 00:45:48.460 align:middle line:84%
Because as soon as
you bring yourself

00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:51.730 align:middle line:84%
into this present moment,
which is my point here,

00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:55.240 align:middle line:84%
is that the past doesn't exist,
the future doesn't exist,

00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:58.180 align:middle line:84%
the only thing that exists
is this moment right now.

00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:00.070 align:middle line:84%
This conversation
we're having right

00:46:00.070 --> 00:46:04.270 align:middle line:84%
now is all that exists
in this exact moment.

00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:06.640 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean you
don't plan for the future.

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:10.900 align:middle line:84%
Because remember, while you're
planning, and once it arrives,

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:14.650 align:middle line:84%
it's not the future anymore,
it's the present again.

00:46:14.650 --> 00:46:16.930 align:middle line:90%
This is all there is.

00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:20.088 align:middle line:84%
And so the reason
I'm mentioning that,

00:46:20.088 --> 00:46:21.880 align:middle line:84%
is as soon as you let
go of the past, which

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:25.400 align:middle line:84%
is all negative energy,
then you can get yourself

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:27.400 align:middle line:84%
to that state of love,
peace, joy and gratitude,

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:29.620 align:middle line:84%
because it's not
holding you back.

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:32.300 align:middle line:90%
Forgiveness is another thing.

00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:35.120 align:middle line:84%
But of course, forgiveness has
everything to do with your past

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:35.920 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:37.795 align:middle line:84%
It's based on something
that happened to you,

00:46:37.795 --> 00:46:40.180 align:middle line:84%
something someone did
to you, or sometimes

00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:43.150 align:middle line:84%
you need to forgive
yourself for what you did.

00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:44.320 align:middle line:90%
None of us are perfect.

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:47.200 align:middle line:84%
We've all done things that
we're not happy about,

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:50.710 align:middle line:90%
because we're human.

00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:53.380 align:middle line:90%
And so to forgive yourself.

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:55.700 align:middle line:90%
And so forgiveness is key too.

00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:59.837 align:middle line:84%
And when we forgive,
it's really important

00:46:59.837 --> 00:47:01.420 align:middle line:84%
to realize that when
you're forgiving,

00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:06.580 align:middle line:84%
you're not condoning
what somebody did to you.

00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:08.710 align:middle line:90%
All you're doing is this.

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:13.970 align:middle line:84%
Is you're letting go
of that negativity.

00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:16.390 align:middle line:90%
You are doing it for yourself.

00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:18.070 align:middle line:84%
There's this
expression, and I can't

00:47:18.070 --> 00:47:22.060 align:middle line:84%
remember who the
author was, but not

00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:26.350 align:middle line:84%
forgiving is like
drinking rat poison

00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:29.920 align:middle line:90%
and expecting the rat to die.

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:31.120 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:34.510 align:middle line:84%
The only person dying
is us holding on to it.

00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And so forgiveness is
key, because you're

00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:37.750 align:middle line:90%
doing it for yourself.

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:39.400 align:middle line:90%
It's not for them.

00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:41.380 align:middle line:84%
And forgiveness can
happen without even

00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:44.170 align:middle line:90%
speaking to the person.

00:47:44.170 --> 00:47:47.290 align:middle line:84%
You can write a letter
and never send it.

00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:48.920 align:middle line:90%
In here you could forgive them.

00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:49.720 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:51.220 align:middle line:84%
It's for you, because
you're holding

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:52.310 align:middle line:90%
onto all that negativity.

00:47:52.310 --> 00:47:53.290 align:middle line:90%
And let's face it.

00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:55.990 align:middle line:84%
That person's probably not
even thinking about you.

00:47:55.990 --> 00:48:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And here, they're holding on
to this mental real estate

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:03.550 align:middle line:84%
that you're allowing them
to have in your mind.

00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:06.310 align:middle line:84%
They're taking on this
mental, this prime real estate

00:48:06.310 --> 00:48:07.690 align:middle line:90%
in our minds.

00:48:07.690 --> 00:48:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And they're just out
doing their own thing.

00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:11.050 align:middle line:90%
Just let it go.

00:48:11.050 --> 00:48:13.580 align:middle line:84%
It's the past,
doesn't exist anymore.

00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:17.800 align:middle line:84%
People are doing the best they
can with the tools they have.

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And they make
mistakes around that.

00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they grow and
learn and become evolved great

00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:26.030 align:middle line:84%
people, and
sometimes they don't.

00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's their journey,
that's not yours.

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:30.820 align:middle line:84%
You can choose that
for yourself and be

00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:34.000 align:middle line:84%
able to choose your
evolved awakened state

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.980 align:middle line:90%
and allow yourself to forgive.

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:39.260 align:middle line:84%
Forgiveness is important,
because once you forgive,

00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:42.130 align:middle line:84%
you're alleviating
all that negativity

00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:44.380 align:middle line:90%
and you're being expansive.

00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:46.240 align:middle line:90%
You're expanding yourself.

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:47.840 align:middle line:90%
And so forgiveness is important.

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:50.620 align:middle line:90%
The other thing is meditation.

00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And so meditation
is really important,

00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:57.070 align:middle line:90%
because it quiets your mind.

00:48:57.070 --> 00:48:58.210 align:middle line:90%
It quiets your mind.

00:48:58.210 --> 00:49:01.870 align:middle line:84%
It allows you to connect
to your higher self,

00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:04.780 align:middle line:84%
to source, whatever
you believe in.

00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And once you connect
your higher self,

00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:11.440 align:middle line:84%
you're able to get the messages
that are being sent to you.

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:15.040 align:middle line:84%
When you're in that
dark, resentful, angry,

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:17.470 align:middle line:84%
you won't forgive, you're
focusing on the past,

00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:19.270 align:middle line:84%
all that negative
stuff, it's negative.

00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:20.710 align:middle line:90%
You're not in a state of love.

00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:22.930 align:middle line:84%
You're not in a state of
peace, that's for sure.

00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:25.690 align:middle line:84%
You're not happy, so you're
not in a state of joy.

00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And so you're definitely
not in gratitude,

00:49:27.490 --> 00:49:29.720 align:middle line:84%
because you're focusing on
all the negative things.

00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:31.750 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, it's hard.

00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:33.490 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to attract
positive things

00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:34.782 align:middle line:90%
if that's what you're thinking.

00:49:34.782 --> 00:49:38.200 align:middle line:84%
So do everything you can to get
yourself to that state of love,

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:40.120 align:middle line:90%
peace, joy and gratitude.

00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:42.340 align:middle line:84%
Definitely let go of the
past, definitely forgive,

00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:45.010 align:middle line:84%
and do whatever allows
you to feel good.

00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:46.930 align:middle line:90%
Meditation is a great way.

00:49:46.930 --> 00:49:48.040 align:middle line:90%
Walking in nature.

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:51.610 align:middle line:84%
Go hiking, go to the park,
spend time with a journal

00:49:51.610 --> 00:49:52.840 align:middle line:90%
is really great.

00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:54.900 align:middle line:84%
But once you get
yourself to that state,

00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:57.760 align:middle line:84%
so imagine, you've reprogrammed
your conscious mind.

00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:00.790 align:middle line:84%
So your thoughts now, you're
becoming aware of them.

00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:03.607 align:middle line:84%
And you realize, and you're
shifting what you're thinking.

00:50:03.607 --> 00:50:05.440 align:middle line:84%
You're reprogramming
your subconscious mind.

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:07.232 align:middle line:84%
You've let go of all
those limiting beliefs

00:50:07.232 --> 00:50:10.060 align:middle line:84%
and turned them into
positive, empowering beliefs,

00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:12.790 align:middle line:84%
and you're in a state of love,
please, joy and gratitude.

00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:14.290 align:middle line:84%
How can your life
not be amazing?

00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:17.440 align:middle line:90%


00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:22.030 align:middle line:84%
So that's all you have to do
to live your greatest life

00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:23.230 align:middle line:90%
and bounce back.

00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:25.495 align:middle line:84%
That's why I say, you can
bounce back instantly.

00:50:25.495 --> 00:50:27.912 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is change
what you're telling yourself,

00:50:27.912 --> 00:50:29.547 align:middle line:90%
and you immediately feel better.

00:50:29.547 --> 00:50:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Now down the road, it will
take maybe a little bit

00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:35.690 align:middle line:84%
longer to get to all your
big dreams and goals.

00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:38.040 align:middle line:90%
But you can feel good right now.

00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:38.840 align:middle line:90%
You have a choice.

00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:39.715 align:middle line:90%
It's in your control.

00:50:39.715 --> 00:50:42.120 align:middle line:90%


00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:43.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:48.793 align:middle line:84%
So in bouncing back,
I've certainly in my life

00:50:48.793 --> 00:50:50.460 align:middle line:84%
gone through a lot
of interesting times,

00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:53.010 align:middle line:84%
and then seen them in
retrospect and learned from it

00:50:53.010 --> 00:50:55.710 align:middle line:84%
and grown from it and done
work on limiting belief systems

00:50:55.710 --> 00:50:57.725 align:middle line:84%
and helped to raise
my vibrational energy,

00:50:57.725 --> 00:50:59.100 align:middle line:84%
so I can resonate
with everything

00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:00.680 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about.

00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And the more that
I do that, the more

00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:06.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm able to close the gap
from an issue or a problem

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:10.170 align:middle line:84%
or a stress to peace,
love, gratitude and joy.

00:51:10.170 --> 00:51:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm like, oh,
I've been here before.

00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:14.407 align:middle line:84%
I know that something
great's about to happen out

00:51:14.407 --> 00:51:16.740 align:middle line:84%
of this experience, and I'm
being gifted this experience

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:19.540 align:middle line:84%
from the divine for some
reason that I'm yet unaware of,

00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:21.583 align:middle line:84%
but I know it's
going to be perfect.

00:51:21.583 --> 00:51:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's a belief
system I've adopted.

00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:24.792 align:middle line:84%
In fact, my belief
system is actually

00:51:24.792 --> 00:51:27.383 align:middle line:84%
everything is absolutely
always unfolding perfectly.

00:51:27.383 --> 00:51:28.800 align:middle line:84%
That was taught
to me by somebody,

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:30.250 align:middle line:84%
it was handed to
them by somebody.

00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, I'm
taking that, I love it.

00:51:32.370 --> 00:51:34.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's not everything
happens for a reason.

00:51:34.350 --> 00:51:36.300 align:middle line:84%
There is perfection
in everything.

00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And in that process of years
and years of working with that,

00:51:40.110 --> 00:51:43.410 align:middle line:84%
life is like grace is
joy and a blessing,

00:51:43.410 --> 00:51:46.770 align:middle line:84%
even when times are tough and
even when times are amazing.

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:50.160 align:middle line:84%
So do you think that for people,
the speed at which they're

00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:51.990 align:middle line:84%
able to close the
gap on this has

00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:56.187 align:middle line:84%
to do with the types
of belief systems

00:51:56.187 --> 00:51:58.020 align:middle line:84%
they've been able to
adopt, how well they've

00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:00.060 align:middle line:84%
been able to integrate
that into their lives?

00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And can you offer
hope to people that

00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:05.370 align:middle line:84%
might be feeling stuck that
there is a pathway to being

00:52:05.370 --> 00:52:06.340 align:middle line:90%
able to handle that?

00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:07.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, can you answer
that in some way?

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, absolutely.

00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:14.690 align:middle line:84%
So what's interesting is
it sounds like it's really

00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:16.350 align:middle line:90%
like hard work.

00:52:16.350 --> 00:52:18.360 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like it's hard
work to bounce back,

00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:20.340 align:middle line:90%
and it really isn't.

00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:23.340 align:middle line:90%
It really isn't.

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Anyone can really
do this, anyone.

00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:29.730 align:middle line:84%
And it is a willingness
to learn it.

00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:32.610 align:middle line:90%


00:52:32.610 --> 00:52:36.630 align:middle line:84%
The quickest way to
feel good instantly when

00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:40.590 align:middle line:84%
something major is happening,
is to stop resisting

00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:42.887 align:middle line:90%
what's going on in your life.

00:52:42.887 --> 00:52:44.970 align:middle line:10%
I just want to really
mention that, because that's

00:52:44.970 --> 00:52:46.920 align:middle line:10%
really important.

00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:51.060 align:middle line:10%
Often, a lot of our suffering
comes from resistance.

00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:53.700 align:middle line:10%
We're saying, this
shouldn't be happening.

00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:55.470 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe
this is happening.

00:52:55.470 --> 00:52:57.730 align:middle line:90%
What am I going to do?

00:52:57.730 --> 00:53:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you
surrender to what I say,

00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:05.190 align:middle line:84%
surrender to what
is, you are releasing

00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:06.330 align:middle line:90%
all that negative energy.

00:53:06.330 --> 00:53:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And when I say surrender,
I want to be clear.

00:53:08.410 --> 00:53:12.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm not talking about giving up.

00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:17.490 align:middle line:84%
But let's face it, whatever's
happening is happening.

00:53:17.490 --> 00:53:20.550 align:middle line:84%
You can say it shouldn't,
you can resist all you want,

00:53:20.550 --> 00:53:21.990 align:middle line:90%
it's happening.

00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:25.380 align:middle line:84%
So accept it exactly
the way it is, exactly

00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:27.690 align:middle line:84%
the way it isn't,
it's just happening.

00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:31.680 align:middle line:84%
When you become, like
even when I was in debt,

00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:35.270 align:middle line:84%
oh, my goodness, I'm
$124,000 in debt.

00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:40.410 align:middle line:90%
Or, I'm $124,000 in debt.

00:53:40.410 --> 00:53:41.460 align:middle line:90%
It's a fact.

00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:43.950 align:middle line:90%
It is the way it is.

00:53:43.950 --> 00:53:44.770 align:middle line:90%
It's different.

00:53:44.770 --> 00:53:46.270 align:middle line:84%
It's a different
energy around that.

00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:48.600 align:middle line:84%
So what's important,
is to understand

00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:50.760 align:middle line:84%
that anyone can stop
resisting once you

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:53.460 align:middle line:90%
realize you're resisting.

00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And by accepting it, you're able
to step back and go, OK, often

00:53:57.750 --> 00:54:02.260 align:middle line:84%
things are out of our control,
so why are we freaking out.

00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:03.060 align:middle line:90%
Out of our control.

00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:05.400 align:middle line:84%
Is like getting
angry, sad, resentful,

00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:07.590 align:middle line:84%
is that going to change
your situation right now

00:54:07.590 --> 00:54:11.190 align:middle line:84%
or is it just making
you feel really bad?

00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:12.940 align:middle line:84%
So if something, you're
in a car accident,

00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:14.550 align:middle line:84%
for instance, something,
somebody fender bender

00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:15.800 align:middle line:90%
and you're getting really mad.

00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:17.460 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:19.440 align:middle line:90%
Why are you getting mad?

00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:22.147 align:middle line:84%
Is that going to make
the accident not happen?

00:54:22.147 --> 00:54:24.480 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to go back in
time and all of a sudden you

00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:25.280 align:middle line:90%
don't have an accident?

00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:26.405 align:middle line:90%
No, it's still an accident.

00:54:26.405 --> 00:54:27.360 align:middle line:90%
It is the way it is.

00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:28.680 align:middle line:90%
Accept it.

00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:30.570 align:middle line:90%
Let it go and deal with it.

00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:33.940 align:middle line:84%
When you're coming from that
energy of it is the way it is,

00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:36.630 align:middle line:84%
because it is the way it
is, now let's move forward

00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:38.520 align:middle line:84%
and let's try to fix
this problem now.

00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:39.790 align:middle line:90%
What do I need to do?

00:54:39.790 --> 00:54:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Then those open doors
then start showing up.

00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:46.140 align:middle line:90%
And it's quite interesting.

00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:49.230 align:middle line:84%
I recently got a
speeding ticket.

00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:52.050 align:middle line:90%
And I recently got my dream car.

00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And I was driving, and honestly,
I was actually quite shocked

00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:57.540 align:middle line:84%
that it took that long
to get a speeding ticket.

00:54:57.540 --> 00:54:59.380 align:middle line:90%
That's all I have to say.

00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, and that's the thought
I had when he stopped me.

00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:06.040 align:middle line:84%
So he stopped me and
I'm like, oh boy, I

00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:09.220 align:middle line:84%
was going 138 kilometers an
hour in 100 kilometer an hour

00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:10.020 align:middle line:90%
on the highway.

00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, it wasn't
done intentionally.

00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:13.800 align:middle line:84%
It just, I looked down
and I looked there,

00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:15.060 align:middle line:90%
there's the police officer.

00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:17.370 align:middle line:84%
I looked up, the thing
was, oh, I'm speeding.

00:55:17.370 --> 00:55:18.360 align:middle line:90%
Didn't even realize.

00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:19.312 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, he stops me.

00:55:19.312 --> 00:55:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it takes
a while, and they check.

00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:24.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting there, and
I'm like, are you upset?

00:55:24.570 --> 00:55:25.550 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:55:25.550 --> 00:55:27.090 align:middle line:90%
Do you deserve this ticket?

00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:28.105 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:55:28.105 --> 00:55:30.090 align:middle line:90%
I so deserve this ticket.

00:55:30.090 --> 00:55:32.460 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe it took
this long for me to get one.

00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:37.500 align:middle line:84%
It's just because, what's
the point of getting upset?

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:38.320 align:middle line:90%
What's the point?

00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:39.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it's going to cost money.

00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:40.955 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's going to
have demerit points.

00:55:40.955 --> 00:55:42.750 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's going to
affect my insurance.

00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:45.977 align:middle line:84%
But all of that I can
change in that moment.

00:55:45.977 --> 00:55:47.310 align:middle line:90%
And this is what, the best part.

00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:49.140 align:middle line:90%
This is a perfect example.

00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:53.250 align:middle line:84%
So when the police officer came
and I rolled down my window

00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:55.860 align:middle line:84%
and then I have already have
my paperwork, insurance,

00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:58.815 align:middle line:84%
my driver's license,
and he looks down

00:55:58.815 --> 00:56:00.690 align:middle line:84%
and I go, here you go,
I know I was speeding.

00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:03.750 align:middle line:90%


00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:04.890 align:middle line:90%
I just admitted it.

00:56:04.890 --> 00:56:05.700 align:middle line:90%
Like who does that?

00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:06.630 align:middle line:90%
Nobody does that.

00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:08.700 align:middle line:84%
I know I was
speeding, here you go.

00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:10.200 align:middle line:90%
And he's like, what?

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:12.940 align:middle line:90%
I said, I know I was speeding.

00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:16.020 align:middle line:90%
He was like, oh, OK.

00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:17.880 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, I'll be back.

00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:19.620 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, OK.

00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:20.550 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:56:20.550 --> 00:56:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And of course, at the back of
my mind I was thinking, well,

00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:24.570 align:middle line:84%
should I have said, oh,
I'm sorry officer, and all

00:56:24.570 --> 00:56:25.695 align:middle line:90%
the whole story in my head.

00:56:25.695 --> 00:56:28.230 align:middle line:84%
I go, no, that's
all I needed to say.

00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:30.940 align:middle line:84%
I was speeding, and
basically, I deserve this.

00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And then he goes
back to the car.

00:56:32.730 --> 00:56:34.820 align:middle line:84%
He comes back five minutes
later and he goes, OK,

00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:38.880 align:middle line:84%
just to let you know, I reduced
it like you were going 115.

00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:40.080 align:middle line:90%
So no demerit points.

00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's like $60
ticket, here you go.

00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:46.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, thank you, officer,
I really appreciate it.

00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:47.820 align:middle line:90%
And I took off.

00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't, I wasn't
upset, I wasn't angry,

00:56:50.250 --> 00:56:51.930 align:middle line:90%
there was no negativity.

00:56:51.930 --> 00:56:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And if it were many years
before, I'd probably

00:56:54.450 --> 00:56:58.080 align:middle line:84%
be crying, oh no, officer, oh,
my goodness, I can't believe,

00:56:58.080 --> 00:56:59.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm so sorry.

00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And oh, now I'm
going to lose points.

00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And oh my god, my
insurance, and oh, how much

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:04.125 align:middle line:90%
is this ticket going to be?

00:57:04.125 --> 00:57:05.832 align:middle line:84%
Like, all this
negativity and who

00:57:05.832 --> 00:57:07.290 align:middle line:84%
knows how it would
have turned out.

00:57:07.290 --> 00:57:09.600 align:middle line:84%
One, I would have
definitely felt worse.

00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:12.210 align:middle line:84%
So the reason I'm
saying that, is

00:57:12.210 --> 00:57:15.630 align:middle line:84%
that's the easiest
way to really bounce

00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:19.560 align:middle line:84%
back immediately from
a being standpoint,

00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:23.490 align:middle line:84%
is just stop resisting
what's going on in your life.

00:57:23.490 --> 00:57:25.230 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we have
five different things,

00:57:25.230 --> 00:57:28.360 align:middle line:84%
and we feel like
everything's falling apart.

00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And so a great way
to stop resisting,

00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:34.695 align:middle line:84%
is just ask yourself
this question.

00:57:34.695 --> 00:57:37.350 align:middle line:90%


00:57:37.350 --> 00:57:42.780 align:middle line:84%
What problems do I have right
now right in this moment?

00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:45.240 align:middle line:84%
As you're watching
this, listening

00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:49.320 align:middle line:84%
to this, what problems
do you have right now?

00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:51.240 align:middle line:90%
Like this second.

00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Now unless a bear is
attacking you right now,

00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:59.100 align:middle line:84%
which is a problem, you wouldn't
be watching this right now.

00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:01.988 align:middle line:84%
You don't have any
problems right now.

00:58:01.988 --> 00:58:04.530 align:middle line:10%
And the reason I'm saying that,
is because you bring yourself

00:58:04.530 --> 00:58:07.050 align:middle line:10%
into the present.

00:58:07.050 --> 00:58:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And once you do that, then
just enjoy life right now.

00:58:09.810 --> 00:58:11.130 align:middle line:90%
Can you just let it go?

00:58:11.130 --> 00:58:12.120 align:middle line:90%
Just temporarily.

00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:15.063 align:middle line:90%
10 minutes, 10 hours, whatever.

00:58:15.063 --> 00:58:16.980 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you just enjoy
this moment right now

00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:18.360 align:middle line:84%
and allow yourself
to enjoy life?

00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:21.045 align:middle line:84%
You could worry about
your problems later.

00:58:21.045 --> 00:58:23.377 align:middle line:90%


00:58:23.377 --> 00:58:24.460 align:middle line:90%
And you ask that question.

00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:26.343 align:middle line:84%
What problems do I
have right this second?

00:58:26.343 --> 00:58:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens
is, this mind

00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:29.560 align:middle line:84%
is going on and on
and on and on and on,

00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:31.060 align:middle line:84%
and oh my god, I can't
believe that happened,

00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:33.393 align:middle line:84%
oh my goodness, oh, my god,
I've got all these problems.

00:58:33.393 --> 00:58:35.260 align:middle line:84%
How am I going to
get out of debt?

00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:37.430 align:middle line:84%
My so-and-so is sick, I've
got these health issues.

00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:39.305 align:middle line:84%
What am I going to do,
what am I going to do?

00:58:39.305 --> 00:58:41.680 align:middle line:90%
Future, past.

00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, what
we have right now,

00:58:45.310 --> 00:58:48.140 align:middle line:84%
the only thing that counts
right now is the present moment.

00:58:48.140 --> 00:58:49.100 align:middle line:90%
This is our life.

00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:50.308 align:middle line:90%
Everything else is a thought.

00:58:50.308 --> 00:58:52.590 align:middle line:90%


00:58:52.590 --> 00:58:55.120 align:middle line:84%
So you just bring yourself
to this present moment,

00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:58.080 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, yes, I have
issues and problems and things

00:58:58.080 --> 00:58:59.640 align:middle line:90%
I need to resolve.

00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:01.150 align:middle line:84%
But right now, I
want to feel good,

00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:02.817 align:middle line:84%
so I'm not going
to focus on that.

00:59:02.817 --> 00:59:04.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to focus on
this moment right now.

00:59:04.650 --> 00:59:06.700 align:middle line:84%
What problems do I
have right this second?

00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:07.500 align:middle line:90%
None.

00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:09.000 align:middle line:84%
That's a great way to
fall asleep at night.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.650 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes at night when
you're stressed out,

00:59:10.650 --> 00:59:12.690 align:middle line:84%
you can't sleep because
you got all these problems.

00:59:12.690 --> 00:59:13.740 align:middle line:90%
Ask yourself that question.

00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:16.170 align:middle line:84%
What problems do I have right
now as I'm lying in my bed,

00:59:16.170 --> 00:59:20.040 align:middle line:84%
cozy, under the covers,
nice and quiet and dark?

00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:22.350 align:middle line:90%
I have a roof over my head.

00:59:22.350 --> 00:59:26.435 align:middle line:84%
I'm, I don't have any
problems in this moment.

00:59:26.435 --> 00:59:28.560 align:middle line:84%
I'll worry about those
problems tomorrow, whatever.

00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:30.880 align:middle line:90%
I'll resolve them tomorrow.

00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:34.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm really grateful
for my bed right now.

00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And we can always be
grateful for something.

00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:40.950 align:middle line:84%
Often, we focus so
much on what's not

00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:43.440 align:middle line:90%
working versus what is working.

00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And once you focus
on what is working,

00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:49.380 align:middle line:84%
you'll start noticing that a lot
more is working than it's not.

00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:50.647 align:middle line:90%
And it's all perception.

00:59:50.647 --> 00:59:52.355 align:middle line:84%
I've been on a lot of
humanitarian trips,

00:59:52.355 --> 00:59:57.690 align:middle line:84%
so I've seen, we've pitched
tents in poor villages

00:59:57.690 --> 00:59:59.550 align:middle line:90%
in Guatemala.

00:59:59.550 --> 01:00:01.180 align:middle line:84%
I've traveled to
a lot of places.

01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:02.640 align:middle line:90%
I've seen that.

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:07.080 align:middle line:84%
I remember we were giving
out all these supplies

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:09.720 align:middle line:84%
and clothes and things in a
poor village in Nicaragua.

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'll never forget,
somehow I dropped something

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:18.480 align:middle line:84%
and these pencils
fell to the ground.

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:22.780 align:middle line:84%
And I never saw a bunch
of kids just attack them.

01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:24.150 align:middle line:90%
They just jumped on.

01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And I've never seen children
so happy to have a pencil.

01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:30.250 align:middle line:90%
I have a pencil!

01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:33.110 align:middle line:84%
They're running
around, yeah, me, too!

01:00:33.110 --> 01:00:36.030 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, wow.

01:00:36.030 --> 01:00:38.400 align:middle line:90%
It's all relative.

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And so when you've
seen all that,

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:42.988 align:middle line:84%
it's a lot easier
to be grateful.

01:00:42.988 --> 01:00:45.030 align:middle line:84%
So when I get stuck, and
believe me, to this day,

01:00:45.030 --> 01:00:46.710 align:middle line:84%
I still get stuck
every once in a while

01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:48.880 align:middle line:84%
and I have to do the inner
work and go, here we go again.

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:50.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm not feeling
good, what's going on

01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:51.475 align:middle line:84%
and what am I
thinking right now.

01:00:51.475 --> 01:00:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And then I, but I can shift it
immediately, because I'm human.

01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:56.333 align:middle line:84%
And so when I need
to be grateful,

01:00:56.333 --> 01:00:57.750 align:middle line:84%
I remember when
my mom passed away

01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:59.820 align:middle line:84%
and I was having a
really difficult time.

01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:03.120 align:middle line:84%
It was shortly after
she passed away.

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And I was sitting in my
backyard feeling sad.

01:01:09.390 --> 01:01:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought
to myself, now

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:17.560 align:middle line:84%
is a time to write my
"Fifty Shades of Gratitude."

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And I sat down and I wrote,
and it wasn't easy to write.

01:01:20.550 --> 01:01:23.280 align:middle line:84%
To find 50 things that
you're grateful for?

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:26.100 align:middle line:84%
It's the first 10 or
12 or 15 are easy.

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:28.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm happy my
brother's so awesome.

01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:30.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy my dad was alive.

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy that I can walk.

01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:34.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy that the sun is out.

01:01:34.530 --> 01:01:36.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy that I'm alive.

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:37.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm happy that my
dog is healthy.

01:01:37.710 --> 01:01:39.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy I have a great team.

01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:39.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy.

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:41.587 align:middle line:84%
And then after a
while, you're like, OK,

01:01:41.587 --> 01:01:45.910 align:middle line:84%
what, and then you start
running out of things.

01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And then I realize, I'm
really grateful that I

01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:53.430 align:middle line:90%
had the best mom ever.

01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:58.110 align:middle line:84%
She wasn't the perfect mom, but
she was the perfect mom for me.

01:01:58.110 --> 01:02:01.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm grateful that I had her for
as long as I did in my life.

01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:06.210 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people lose
their parents at a young age.

01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:10.830 align:middle line:84%
I am so lucky that I've
had both my parents

01:02:10.830 --> 01:02:13.420 align:middle line:90%
for such a long time.

01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:16.100 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people don't get that.

01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:19.700 align:middle line:84%
I am lucky and so
grateful that I had

01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:23.030 align:middle line:90%
a mother that loved me so much.

01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:25.400 align:middle line:84%
There isn't a person on this
planet that loved me more

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:27.290 align:middle line:90%
than my mother.

01:02:27.290 --> 01:02:28.440 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:29.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm so grateful.

01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:32.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm so lucky.

01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:35.012 align:middle line:84%
Versus like, I can't believe
my mom died and she had cancer

01:02:35.012 --> 01:02:36.970 align:middle line:84%
and she suffered, you
know, all that was going.

01:02:36.970 --> 01:02:38.510 align:middle line:90%
I just shifted it.

01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Do you know how quickly
I felt so much better?

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:43.520 align:middle line:90%
Much better.

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:46.650 align:middle line:84%
Focus on what's going
right in your life.

01:02:46.650 --> 01:02:49.142 align:middle line:90%
And there's a lot.

01:02:49.142 --> 01:02:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>> That's beautiful, Sonia.

01:02:51.730 --> 01:02:55.460 align:middle line:84%
I want to finish here, if you
can take me from the moment

01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:58.220 align:middle line:84%
that you reached that fifth
step on your stairwell

01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:00.230 align:middle line:84%
and had this epiphany
and this realization,

01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:01.670 align:middle line:84%
and then by the time
you got to the landing

01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:03.920 align:middle line:84%
you had another realization,
to where you are today.

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Because I want to get
closure on this story.

01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:06.927 align:middle line:84%
You've touched on
it a little bit.

01:03:06.927 --> 01:03:10.617 align:middle line:84%
You know, I wrote a book,
I did this, I help people.

01:03:10.617 --> 01:03:12.200 align:middle line:84%
But if we had to go
back to that story

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:14.392 align:middle line:84%
and you had to fast
forward it and tell me

01:03:14.392 --> 01:03:16.100 align:middle line:84%
what's happened in
your life, what you've

01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:18.183 align:middle line:84%
been able to achieve, the
books you're working on,

01:03:18.183 --> 01:03:22.970 align:middle line:84%
the film that's coming out,
the crystal ball life that you

01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:25.370 align:middle line:84%
looked at and thought, that
would have been impossible,

01:03:25.370 --> 01:03:26.960 align:middle line:90%
but actually became true.

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:28.730 align:middle line:84%
Can you finish
that story for me?

01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:30.580 align:middle line:84%
I think people would
like to hear it.

01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:31.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:33.060 align:middle line:90%
What is she talking about?

01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:33.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:38.360 align:middle line:84%
So my life today is
truly a dream life.

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:39.270 align:middle line:90%
Is it perfect?

01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:39.770 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:03:39.770 --> 01:03:40.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm like everyone else.

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Like that staircase,
sometimes you go up,

01:03:42.770 --> 01:03:44.390 align:middle line:90%
sometimes you go down.

01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And things happen
and life is life.

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Difference is, now
when things happen,

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:51.890 align:middle line:90%
I allow it to bounce off me.

01:03:51.890 --> 01:03:55.130 align:middle line:84%
I deal with it, I handle it,
I experience it, I feel it

01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:56.660 align:middle line:90%
and I move forward.

01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:59.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's a different
experience altogether.

01:03:59.630 --> 01:04:02.030 align:middle line:84%
So I bounce back really,
really, really quickly whenever

01:04:02.030 --> 01:04:03.270 align:middle line:90%
something happens.

01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:06.470 align:middle line:84%
But my actual life,
I was able to write

01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:09.020 align:middle line:84%
a bestseller book,
which was titled,

01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:11.690 align:middle line:90%
"The Unsinkable," same word.

01:04:11.690 --> 01:04:15.290 align:middle line:84%
We just finished filming
"The Unsinkable" movie.

01:04:15.290 --> 01:04:16.130 align:middle line:90%
Can you imagine?

01:04:16.130 --> 01:04:17.510 align:middle line:90%
Filmed a feature film.

01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:20.510 align:middle line:90%


01:04:20.510 --> 01:04:24.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm financially free.

01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:27.160 align:middle line:84%
So not only did I
get out of debt,

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:29.460 align:middle line:84%
when you're $124,000
in debt and you

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:31.710 align:middle line:84%
don't have a plan on how
you're going to get out of it

01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:33.590 align:middle line:84%
and you really believe
that there is no plan

01:04:33.590 --> 01:04:35.540 align:middle line:84%
and there is no way
other than bankruptcy,

01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:38.210 align:middle line:84%
and the thought did enter
my mind at one point, maybe

01:04:38.210 --> 01:04:41.250 align:middle line:84%
that is an option, but
I'm not giving up yet.

01:04:41.250 --> 01:04:46.950 align:middle line:84%
To going from being able
to, there was one day,

01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:48.980 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sorry if this
sounds like bragging,

01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:52.640 align:middle line:84%
but this actually did
happen, where in one day,

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:58.076 align:middle line:84%
we brought in $149,000 into
my business, in one day.

01:04:58.076 --> 01:05:01.400 align:middle line:84%
I was $124,000 in
debt and I thought

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:04.070 align:middle line:84%
there was just no way I was
ever going to get out of it.

01:05:04.070 --> 01:05:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And so today as I look
back, financially,

01:05:07.130 --> 01:05:09.260 align:middle line:84%
my financial dreams
have come true.

01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:11.340 align:middle line:84%
I never even thought
this was possible.

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:14.270 align:middle line:84%
So if you think it's not
possible for you, it is.

01:05:14.270 --> 01:05:16.550 align:middle line:90%
And times it by 10.

01:05:16.550 --> 01:05:17.360 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:18.980 align:middle line:90%
First of all.

01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And now all my friends
and colleagues,

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:22.290 align:middle line:90%
I get to travel the world.

01:05:22.290 --> 01:05:23.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm always traveling.

01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:26.240 align:middle line:90%
I get to help transform lives.

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:30.300 align:middle line:84%
I get to be friends
with and colleagues

01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:33.410 align:middle line:84%
with some of the top
transformational teachers

01:05:33.410 --> 01:05:34.880 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:37.970 align:middle line:84%
Not just meet them, but
actual close friends,

01:05:37.970 --> 01:05:40.370 align:middle line:84%
where we hop on
calls and we go out

01:05:40.370 --> 01:05:42.500 align:middle line:84%
of our way to meet each
other for lunch and dinner.

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:47.600 align:middle line:84%
Like I'm pinching myself
every day, every day.

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:50.982 align:middle line:84%
I remember recently I was
at Bob Proctor's house.

01:05:50.982 --> 01:05:52.690 align:middle line:84%
And I remember I was
sitting next to him,

01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:54.610 align:middle line:90%
I go, how did this happen?

01:05:54.610 --> 01:05:56.340 align:middle line:84%
Like, how am I sitting
with Bob Proctor?

01:05:56.340 --> 01:05:58.007 align:middle line:84%
We have a picture of
me and Bob Proctor.

01:05:58.007 --> 01:06:01.040 align:middle line:84%
Me in Bob Proctor's office,
and I have my feet on his desk

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:02.990 align:middle line:84%
and him going,
what are you doing?

01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:05.097 align:middle line:84%
Like that, with my
feet on his desk.

01:06:05.097 --> 01:06:06.930 align:middle line:84%
And I just remember
looking at that picture.

01:06:06.930 --> 01:06:10.270 align:middle line:90%
I go, how did that happen?

01:06:10.270 --> 01:06:14.600 align:middle line:90%
Like beyond my wildest dreams.

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:17.690 align:middle line:84%
That young woman who
was crying on that bed

01:06:17.690 --> 01:06:22.910 align:middle line:84%
had no idea how amazing
life was about to come.

01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:26.578 align:middle line:84%
Like how amazing my
life is about to be.

01:06:26.578 --> 01:06:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And so anyone going
through difficult times

01:06:28.370 --> 01:06:33.200 align:middle line:84%
right now, if you're, you are
that person like I was then.

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling like you
want to give up, hang on.

01:06:36.830 --> 01:06:39.890 align:middle line:84%
Because the greatest,
your greatest life

01:06:39.890 --> 01:06:41.900 align:middle line:90%
is just around the corner.

01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:44.150 align:middle line:84%
Because often when people
are ready to give up,

01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:47.060 align:middle line:84%
is just when things
are about to turn.

01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
happened with me.

01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And so I truly am
living my greatest life.

01:06:53.450 --> 01:06:55.290 align:middle line:90%
I have financial freedom.

01:06:55.290 --> 01:06:57.870 align:middle line:84%
I am helping people
around the world.

01:06:57.870 --> 01:06:59.510 align:middle line:90%
I have a bestseller book.

01:06:59.510 --> 01:07:07.980 align:middle line:84%
I have a film that I funded 100%
myself, a full feature film.

01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:09.560 align:middle line:90%
I have the most amazing friends.

01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:10.550 align:middle line:90%
I have great family.

01:07:10.550 --> 01:07:12.320 align:middle line:90%
I get to travel the world.

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:13.850 align:middle line:90%
It's truly a dream life.

01:07:13.850 --> 01:07:18.230 align:middle line:84%
I would not even have been able
to put a vision board way back

01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:20.695 align:middle line:84%
when with all these
things, because I

01:07:20.695 --> 01:07:22.070 align:middle line:84%
don't think I
would have believed

01:07:22.070 --> 01:07:23.255 align:middle line:90%
that would be even possible.

01:07:23.255 --> 01:07:26.150 align:middle line:90%
Like it was so ridiculous.

01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:29.870 align:middle line:90%
So, be ridiculous.

01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:33.020 align:middle line:84%
Be unrealistic and start
dreaming really big.

01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:35.720 align:middle line:90%
It can happen.

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:36.530 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

01:07:36.530 --> 01:07:37.850 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for your time, Sonia.

01:07:37.850 --> 01:07:38.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:07:38.650 --> 01:07:43.300 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:48.000 align:middle line:90%
