00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000 align:middle line:90%


00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi, it's James here
from "Food Matters."

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.378 align:middle line:84%
And today, we're
going to be taking

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:15.350 align:middle line:84%
a special spiritual discourse
into understanding more

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.420 align:middle line:84%
about what it means
to live a deeply

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.520 align:middle line:84%
compassionate, loving,
heart-centered and service-led

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.430 align:middle line:84%
life with none other than
Sadhvi Bhagawatiji Saraswatiji.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.940 align:middle line:90%


00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, Sadhvi.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.720 align:middle line:84%
>> It's wonderful to
be with you, James.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Likewise.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.400 align:middle line:84%
Your journey into
becoming a swami, per se,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.080 align:middle line:84%
is not a normal sort
of journey for most.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.530 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain to me the
sort of origins of your story

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.670 align:middle line:90%
and how this began for you?

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all,
it's really important

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.600 align:middle line:84%
to realize that although there
is a story and there is a plot,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.970 align:middle line:84%
and I'm happy to share it
with you, that at the core

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.420 align:middle line:90%
it's a story of grace.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And so as you hear it, realize
that what it is that's going on

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.880 align:middle line:84%
is a heart and a
life that's being

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.550 align:middle line:84%
cracked open to the presence
of more and more grace.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's really important
because people these days

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.760 align:middle line:84%
think much more in terms
of I'm going to do it.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And actually, there's
this incredible power

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.050 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, an incredible
intelligence in the universe,

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.460 align:middle line:84%
a wisdom in the universe, an
energy in the universe that

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.370 align:middle line:90%
is there for us.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And we just have to
open ourselves to it.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.310 align:middle line:90%
So I was 25.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.800 align:middle line:84%
I was in the midst of a
PhD program in psychology.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.060 align:middle line:84%
I had graduated from
Stanford, undergrad, and was

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.690 align:middle line:90%
doing a PhD in psychology.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.430 align:middle line:84%
I was not consciously
seeking or searching,

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.600 align:middle line:84%
which is incredibly embarrassing
to admit 23 years later, when

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.830 align:middle line:84%
my ego would love to
say, since childhood

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.500 align:middle line:84%
I was aware that there
must be something deeper.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And I was praying for it
and meditating upon it.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.520 align:middle line:90%
But that isn't my story.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.960 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea that
something else existed.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.080 align:middle line:84%
In this culture, in
this world, we're

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.800 align:middle line:84%
really kind of
indoctrinated to believe

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.620 align:middle line:84%
that a successful life
means get a good education,

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.750 align:middle line:84%
get a good career,
make a lot of money,

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.910 align:middle line:84%
look the right way
in the right clothes,

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.590 align:middle line:84%
get invited to
the right parties,

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.340 align:middle line:84%
vacation at the right
resorts, and boom, success.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.960 align:middle line:90%
And so I had those things.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.360 align:middle line:90%


00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:26.960 align:middle line:84%
I went to India with a
backpack because the person

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.320 align:middle line:84%
I was traveling with
wanted to go to India.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.570 align:middle line:90%
So it wasn't even my choice.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.580 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't even that I woke
up one day and said India.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.210 align:middle line:84%
My typical vacation
spot was Europe.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.040 align:middle line:90%
But India, OK.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, I only even agreed
to go to India-- again,

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.570 align:middle line:84%
as embarrassing because it
is almost 25 years later--

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.970 align:middle line:84%
I only agreed to
go because I was

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.610 align:middle line:90%
a staunch, staunch vegetarian.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.930 align:middle line:90%
I still am.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And trying to negotiate
broths, and sauces, and stocks,

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.330 align:middle line:84%
and things like that
in languages you

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.790 align:middle line:84%
don't speak, in restaurants
all over the world,

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:14.000 align:middle line:84%
is very difficult. And so
when India was suggested,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.760 align:middle line:84%
the one thing I realized
was, well, at least

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.490 align:middle line:90%
I'll be able to eat happily.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:25.700 align:middle line:84%
And on the airplane from
San Francisco to Delhi,

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.390 align:middle line:84%
I had this moment in which I
realized this makes no sense.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.700 align:middle line:90%
This is crazy.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm flying halfway
around the world,

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.400 align:middle line:84%
to a country I know
nothing about, that I'm not

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:44.462 align:middle line:84%
interested in, only because
they know what vegetarian means.

00:04:44.462 --> 00:04:45.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
find that there is

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.040 align:middle line:84%
chicken stock, or fish
sauce, or egg yolks,

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.650 align:middle line:90%
or something in my food.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was true
in the Bay Area.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.990 align:middle line:84%
I already was living in a
place where that was true.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.080 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have to fly across
the world for a good vegetarian

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.950 align:middle line:90%
meal.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.980 align:middle line:84%
So even though I was not
religious, I was raised Jewish,

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.020 align:middle line:84%
and had and still have a
very deep cultural connection

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.070 align:middle line:90%
to the Jewish people.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.340 align:middle line:90%
But it never was about God.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.200 align:middle line:84%
I never had any
connection with God.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.970 align:middle line:84%
I never had any
awareness of God.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.390 align:middle line:84%
I never had any
relationship with God.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.740 align:middle line:84%
But I did have a
very deep belief

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.080 align:middle line:84%
in what I used to call
the, capital P, Planner.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.940 align:middle line:90%
I was a scientist.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.160 align:middle line:84%
I had spent time in bio labs,
and chem labs, and stuff.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And you've got yourself
a Bunsen burner.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.750 align:middle line:90%
You've got yourself a crucible.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And nine times out of
10, nothing happens.

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.060 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes you get a bad smell.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.010 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes you get some smoke.

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:56.560 align:middle line:84%
But the idea that
somehow all of this

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.410 align:middle line:84%
happened randomly, when
we couldn't recreate it

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.810 align:middle line:84%
in a science lab knowing
everything we do,

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.410 align:middle line:90%
didn't make sense to me.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:08.890 align:middle line:84%
So I always had faith that
there was a, capital P, Planner,

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.680 align:middle line:84%
who understood the,
capital P, Plan.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.260 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand
it, but that was OK.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And so when I was
on the airplane,

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.290 align:middle line:84%
I thought this makes
no sense, which

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.670 align:middle line:84%
means that there must be
a purpose that I'm just

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.400 align:middle line:90%
not aware of.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.290 align:middle line:90%
Because I wasn't a wanderer.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:32.680 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't someone who just
kind of went somewhere

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.090 align:middle line:90%
for no reason.

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.340 align:middle line:90%
I was a doer.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And so I went through Stanford,
for example, undergrad in three

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.010 align:middle line:90%
years, instead of four years.

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're going
to do it, just do it.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.940 align:middle line:84%
So I wasn't the type
who just wandered.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.680 align:middle line:84%
So somewhere over the
Pacific I realized

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.150 align:middle line:90%
there is a reason I'm going.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know it, which means
I need to keep my heart open.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And if I can't
keep my heart open,

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to come
back to California

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.650 align:middle line:84%
because even though I've taken
a semester off from my program,

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.570 align:middle line:84%
there's still a lot of things I
could do that would be useful,

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.950 align:middle line:84%
and beneficial, and not just
wandering around a country I

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:19.610 align:middle line:90%
have no interest in.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.990 align:middle line:90%
So I have to keep my heart open.

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And that proved to be the best
vow I've ever taken in my life

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:34.270 align:middle line:90%
because about a weekish later--

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.800 align:middle line:84%
we were in Delhi
a couple of days.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And I opened a guidebook in
Delhi, a big "Lonely Planet"

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:43.540 align:middle line:84%
guidebook, and said,
Rishikesh, just like that.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:44.650 align:middle line:90%
It was close to Delhi.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.150 align:middle line:90%
I was a nature person.

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:47.080 align:middle line:90%
There's mountains.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.780 align:middle line:90%
There's river, yoga classes.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:53.050 align:middle line:84%
It was close enough to Delhi
that we could go and sort

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.690 align:middle line:84%
of plan out the rest
of the trip from there.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:08:00.370 align:middle line:84%
It seemed very nice, and
clean, and natural beauty.

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:06.040 align:middle line:90%


00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.100 align:middle line:84%
So we go to Rishikesh
a couple of days later.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.910 align:middle line:84%
And of all the hotels
in Rishikesh-- now,

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:16.240 align:middle line:84%
where our ashram
Parmarth Niketan is--

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.160 align:middle line:90%
now there's lots of hotels.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.870 align:middle line:84%
But at that time, 23 years
ago, all of the hotels

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:27.010 align:middle line:84%
were on the main downtown
side of Rishikesh

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:29.650 align:middle line:84%
or up in the northern
part of Rishikesh,

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:32.080 align:middle line:90%
called Lakshman Jhula.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.010 align:middle line:84%
Where our ashram is
there was only one hotel.

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And that hotel was
called the Green Hotel.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And in Delhi, I had
chosen that hotel

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.590 align:middle line:84%
because I was an ardent
environmentalist.

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And it never occurred to me that
the hotel was named Green Hotel

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.380 align:middle line:84%
just because its
walls were painted

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.210 align:middle line:90%
this kind of pastely green.

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:55.450 align:middle line:84%
But I thought Green
Hotel, OK, great.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:09:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And get to the
hotel, drop our bags.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm going to go
put my feet in the river.

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:08.830 align:middle line:90%
I was hot.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.610 align:middle line:90%
I was tired.

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:15.610 align:middle line:84%
Just-- I'm going to go
put my feet in the river.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.970 align:middle line:90%
And I go down.

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And before my feet
even touched the water,

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:30.370 align:middle line:84%
I looked out over
this river that's

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:31.960 align:middle line:84%
sacred, that's the
Mother Goddess.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.330 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't know that.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.830 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know
that at the time.

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:40.070 align:middle line:90%
I just knew river.

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:41.290 align:middle line:90%
And I stand there.

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:43.090 align:middle line:90%
And I look out over the river.

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, in
that moment, it was

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:49.900 align:middle line:84%
like a veil was ripped
off, not just my eyes,

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:55.990 align:middle line:84%
but off of every way of knowing
that I had, off of every sense

00:09:55.990 --> 00:10:02.800 align:middle line:84%
organ, off of my brain, off of
my mind, off of my identity,

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.930 align:middle line:84%
as though this veil
was just pulled off.

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:10.270 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly I could see.

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:11.560 align:middle line:90%
But not just with my eyes.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:16.780 align:middle line:84%
I could see you with
my entire being.

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:20.757 align:middle line:84%
And what I saw I
was so beautiful.

00:10:20.757 --> 00:10:21.715 align:middle line:90%
And I burst into tears.

00:10:21.715 --> 00:10:25.460 align:middle line:90%


00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:27.260 align:middle line:90%
And nothing else mattered.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:32.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in that moment,
just suddenly nothing

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:41.600 align:middle line:84%
else mattered, except being
here, with this sacred river,

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:48.410 align:middle line:84%
in this extraordinary,
exquisite truth, of my oneness

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:56.420 align:middle line:84%
with God, whom I had just beheld
with every sense that I have.

00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Not just outside of
me, but inside of me.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And there was no distinction
between the inside

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:05.840 align:middle line:90%
and the outside.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- all I could
say for so long was just,

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:12.080 align:middle line:90%
oh, my god, it's so beautiful.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.240 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god, it's so beautiful.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.760 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god, it's so beautiful.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know how, or where,
or why, or in what capacity.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.705 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't matter.

00:11:27.705 --> 00:11:29.080 align:middle line:84%
I just knew I'm
meant to be here.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.330 align:middle line:90%


00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And about-- and
a few days later,

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:45.180 align:middle line:84%
I discovered the ashram where
I live, Parmarth Niketan,

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:49.960 align:middle line:84%
has an alternate way of getting
from the hotel to the river.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:50.760 align:middle line:90%
It was clean.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:51.900 align:middle line:90%
It was beautiful.

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:55.170 align:middle line:84%
The alleyway was not
so clean and beautiful.

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And the ashram was just
exquisite, and gardens,

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:01.750 align:middle line:84%
and beautiful statues-- and
again, I didn't know anything--

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:05.520 align:middle line:84%
but just beautiful statues
and beautiful gardens.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And I'm walking through one
day, just walking from the river

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.370 align:middle line:84%
back to the hotel, to
go to the bathroom.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:15.450 align:middle line:90%
And I hear a voice.

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And the voice says
you must stay here.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.120 align:middle line:84%
I look around because clearly
if there was a voice someone

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:22.920 align:middle line:90%
spoke.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.470 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a welling
up of intuition.

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:27.390 align:middle line:90%
People ask, well, what was it?

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:28.470 align:middle line:90%
Was it a felt sense?

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.230 align:middle line:90%
No, it was a voice.

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:32.072 align:middle line:90%
Was it your voice?

00:12:32.072 --> 00:12:34.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, it was my
voice because as you'll find out

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:35.970 align:middle line:90%
there was no one else.

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:41.360 align:middle line:84%
But it didn't speak
like my voice.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.840 align:middle line:90%
It was a man's voice.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:49.020 align:middle line:84%
It was an externally
perceived voice.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.720 align:middle line:90%
So I turn around.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.862 align:middle line:90%
And there's no one.

00:12:53.862 --> 00:12:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And then I figure
out, all right, I

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.580 align:middle line:90%
guess I didn't hear a voice.

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.060 align:middle line:90%
And didn't think much of it.

00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.610 align:middle line:90%
And kept walking.

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And about 30 seconds
later, I hear it again.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.070 align:middle line:90%


00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:06.520 align:middle line:90%
You must stay here.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.820 align:middle line:90%
And again, I turned around.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:08.920 align:middle line:90%
And there's no one.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:13.272 align:middle line:84%
Look, is somebody shouting
from a balcony somewhere?

00:13:13.272 --> 00:13:15.210 align:middle line:90%
No one.

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:17.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, in my entire
frame of reference

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.180 align:middle line:84%
I was not even someone
who read spiritual books

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:25.160 align:middle line:84%
or went to discourses
about spiritual people.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.950 align:middle line:84%
My whole frame of reference
of people who heard voices

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:29.640 align:middle line:84%
were schizophrenics
and Joan of Arc.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:33.590 align:middle line:90%


00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I was just about
to ignore it again,

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:43.800 align:middle line:84%
when what was very clearly my
own voice kicked in, and said,

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.310 align:middle line:90%
OK, you can do that.

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:48.770 align:middle line:84%
You can just pretend that
you've not heard a voice.

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:50.780 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:53.220 align:middle line:90%
We understand.

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:54.950 align:middle line:84%
But what that means
is that you're not

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:57.870 align:middle line:90%
keeping your heart open.

00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- I mean, I
have these conversations

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:00.680 align:middle line:90%
with myself.

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:05.610 align:middle line:84%
I've always been very, very
deeply committed to truth,

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:06.410 align:middle line:90%
from childhood.

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:12.060 align:middle line:84%
That was-- that was my core
tenet, truth at all costs.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:20.527 align:middle line:84%
And so my inner voice says very
clearly, all right, go ahead.

00:14:20.527 --> 00:14:21.860 align:middle line:90%
Pretend you didn't hear a voice.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:22.700 align:middle line:90%
No problem.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.230 align:middle line:90%
We get it.

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to have to turn
around and get yourself back

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:30.638 align:middle line:84%
to Delhi, to get yourself
back on a flight to America,

00:14:30.638 --> 00:14:32.430 align:middle line:84%
because you're not
keeping your heart open.

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:36.330 align:middle line:90%
And that was the value talking.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.910 align:middle line:84%
So you can pretend you
didn't hear a voice.

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:42.730 align:middle line:84%
But you're not going
to go back on your vow.

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And I was in the midst of these
days of just spiritual ecstasy.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.830 align:middle line:90%


00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:53.500 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to
go back to Delhi.

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:54.490 align:middle line:90%
We'd just gotten here.

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:58.730 align:middle line:90%


00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought, all
right, I just heard a voice.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.390 align:middle line:90%
And I look up.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And I see a sign that
says, "Office" in English.

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:10.700 align:middle line:90%
And I walk in.

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:14.390 align:middle line:90%
And I say, I want to stay here.

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:17.870 align:middle line:90%
And it's a long story.

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:22.370 align:middle line:90%
But the end of the story--

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:25.670 align:middle line:90%
fast forward about a week.

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:31.880 align:middle line:84%
I finally am able to meet the
president, the head of Parmarth

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.700 align:middle line:84%
Niketan, who, because
I had been told

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.600 align:middle line:84%
they had to meet the
president, in my mind,

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.760 align:middle line:84%
my mental construct
was president

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.880 align:middle line:84%
means a gentleman in a suit,
and tie, and a briefcase,

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.470 align:middle line:90%
and a desk.

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea that the
person I was about to meet it

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:54.290 align:middle line:84%
was an enlightened
holy man, a revered--

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:55.490 align:middle line:90%
revered religious leader.

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:58.220 align:middle line:90%


00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And so when I finally,
finally met Pujya Swamiji,

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:07.070 align:middle line:84%
it was as though he
were the glue that

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:09.920 align:middle line:84%
brought all of the different
pieces of the experiences

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.740 align:middle line:84%
I'd been having over the
previous week together.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.590 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly it made sense.

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly I realized,
oh, yeah, it's here.

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:22.610 align:middle line:90%
It's under him.

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:27.920 align:middle line:84%
It's doing this type of work,
schools, and women's programs,

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:34.620 align:middle line:84%
and health care, and
environment, and this service,

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:38.160 align:middle line:84%
in this extraordinary
spiritually

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:43.540 align:middle line:84%
open ecstasy that
I'm supposed to be.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And so suddenly
it all made sense.

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And that was-- September,
it'll be 23 years.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.320 align:middle line:90%
And it's just been--

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.370 align:middle line:90%
it's been extraordinary.

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:58.680 align:middle line:84%
But circling back to the
beginning, its grace.

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.020 align:middle line:90%
I was not a meditator.

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.630 align:middle line:90%
I was not a spiritual seeker.

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:07.859 align:middle line:84%
I was not someone who was
praying to God for a guru

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:10.589 align:middle line:90%
or for the light.

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And what I love about that is
grace doesn't discriminate.

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Grace isn't saying,
you're worthy, you're not.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:23.339 align:middle line:84%
Grace isn't keeping some kind
of a tally of how many hours

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:28.500 align:middle line:84%
you've spent meditating, how
many lustful or greedy thoughts

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.290 align:middle line:90%
you've had.

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:35.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, we put everything
kind of into this Santa Claus

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:37.000 align:middle line:84%
analogy, of Santa Claus
knows you've been good,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:37.800 align:middle line:90%
you've been bad.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.230 align:middle line:84%
There's kind of this list,
the good girls, the bad girls,

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:41.910 align:middle line:90%
the good boys, the bad boys.

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:44.460 align:middle line:90%
And so we do that spiritually.

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:47.270 align:middle line:90%


00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:50.870 align:middle line:90%
But that's not how grace works.

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:56.120 align:middle line:90%
All grace needs is an opening.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why I
say, it's not my story.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.830 align:middle line:90%
It's grace's story.

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:03.520 align:middle line:84%
I got picked up
and carried there.

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.780 align:middle line:84%
There's one more piece
though that's just

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:09.110 align:middle line:90%
a fun part of the story.

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:16.880 align:middle line:84%
That after I met Pujya Swamiji
for the first time, I told him

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:17.690 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to stay.

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:20.630 align:middle line:84%
I didn't tell them
I had heard a voice.

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:23.390 align:middle line:84%
I just told him
I wanted to stay.

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And he says to me, this is your
home, stay whenever you like.

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:32.470 align:middle line:90%
He says, I'm going away again.

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:33.470 align:middle line:90%
He had been out of town.

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:35.510 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'm going
out of town again.

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:37.010 align:middle line:84%
But I'll be back
in about a week.

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:39.290 align:middle line:84%
He said, but in any
case, don't worry.

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:42.230 align:middle line:90%


00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:44.664 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell them to give
you a room anytime.

00:18:44.664 --> 00:18:48.460 align:middle line:90%


00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:51.140 align:middle line:84%
No, sorry-- he said, I'll
be here for about a week.

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:53.335 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going
out of town again.

00:18:53.335 --> 00:18:54.710 align:middle line:84%
We were heading
to the mountains.

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:58.160 align:middle line:84%
So he said no problem, go to
the mountains if you want.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.440 align:middle line:84%
Even if I'm not here by
the time you get back,

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.750 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell them to
give you a room.

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:04.470 align:middle line:90%
You're always welcome.

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I walk out of his
meeting area thinking,

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:11.180 align:middle line:84%
OK, we'll go to the mountains
and stay when we come back.

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And I get to this point in
the central part of the ashram

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:17.870 align:middle line:84%
where we have this hand pump,
which is how most of India

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:19.520 align:middle line:84%
traditionally has
always operated.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:20.728 align:middle line:90%
We've got this big hand pump.

00:19:20.728 --> 00:19:22.312 align:middle line:84%
We also have running
water, of course.

00:19:22.312 --> 00:19:24.410 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, we have
this beautiful hand pump,

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:28.850 align:middle line:84%
that people actually
come from dozens of miles

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:31.880 align:middle line:84%
away from, to get that
pure, beautiful water.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And I was about to turn
to walk out of the ashram.

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:39.446 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly my feet won't walk.

00:19:39.446 --> 00:19:44.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, literally my feet
are stuck to the ground.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.940 align:middle line:90%
And it felt like I--

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.072 align:middle line:84%
like I was crazy-glued
to the ground.

00:19:49.072 --> 00:19:52.930 align:middle line:90%


00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And so initially I
think, oh, my god, I've

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.530 align:middle line:84%
got some kind of
horrible disease.

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:58.760 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I've got tetanus.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:19:59.660 align:middle line:90%
I've got polio.

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:01.580 align:middle line:84%
I've got something
that I was supposed

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:04.520 align:middle line:84%
to be vaccinated against and
the vaccination didn't work.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.155 align:middle line:90%


00:20:07.155 --> 00:20:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And then I come down
and I realize, all

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:11.810 align:middle line:84%
right, chances are
lethal diseases

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:14.810 align:middle line:90%
don't come on like this.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:17.090 align:middle line:84%
You were sitting on the
ground, on the floor, talking

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:18.050 align:middle line:90%
to Swamiji.

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.675 align:middle line:84%
You're not used to
sitting on the floor

00:20:19.675 --> 00:20:21.160 align:middle line:84%
or maybe your feet
are just asleep.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I bend down and I start
kind of massaging my legs.

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And there's no pins or
needles, no tingling.

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:32.870 align:middle line:90%
I can feel them fully.

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:34.790 align:middle line:90%
They just don't move.

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I close my eyes, and
I was studying neurology

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:39.500 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:40.520 align:middle line:90%
And so I close my eyes.

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And I'm literally
picturing motor neurons

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:46.610 align:middle line:90%
and they're firing.

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And, OK, the right side
of the brain, and the

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:49.445 align:middle line:90%
left side of the body.

00:20:49.445 --> 00:20:52.750 align:middle line:90%


00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.250 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:56.923 align:middle line:84%
And now you have to
picture me standing right

00:20:56.923 --> 00:20:58.090 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the ashram.

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:00.070 align:middle line:90%
My arms are kind of flailing--

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:03.540 align:middle line:84%
flailing around
to get me to move.

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:05.770 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:09.910 align:middle line:84%
So at that moment, from the
back gardens of the ashram,

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:13.810 align:middle line:84%
this group of kids comes tearing
down the ashram path, just

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:18.280 align:middle line:84%
playing tag, or some Indian
version of some kids' racing

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.960 align:middle line:90%
game.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And instinctively, I
move backwards just

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:24.500 align:middle line:90%
to get out of the way.

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized,
oh, great, I'm free.

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:29.120 align:middle line:90%
I can move.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.430 align:middle line:90%
And I can't.

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:34.980 align:middle line:90%
My legs will not move forward.

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:38.540 align:middle line:84%
And I then think, like a
good scientist, well, OK,

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:40.940 align:middle line:90%
so I've just moved backwards.

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.590 align:middle line:90%
I can't move forwards.

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:45.020 align:middle line:84%
It means I've contracted
some disease whereby

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.030 align:middle line:90%
I can only walk backwards.

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:48.650 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:51.440 align:middle line:84%
It had been sort of an
adventurous week anyway.

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.720 align:middle line:90%
I decide I'll just spin around.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.250 align:middle line:90%
And I spin around.

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'll walk out of
this ashram backwards.

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:01.320 align:middle line:90%
So I spin around.

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.910 align:middle line:84%
So now my back is
toward the exit

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:12.050 align:middle line:84%
of the ashram, prepared to walk
backwards out of the ashram.

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:13.230 align:middle line:90%
And my feet won't--

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:14.030 align:middle line:90%
they won't move.

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:16.640 align:middle line:84%
I cannot lift my
foot off the ground.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:20.480 align:middle line:90%


00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And I stop and I
realize, oh, my god, I

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:25.490 align:middle line:84%
can't walk in that
direction at all,

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:29.510 align:middle line:84%
not facing forward,
not facing backward.

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:33.020 align:middle line:84%
But I had just moved
backwards, back

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:35.180 align:middle line:84%
towards Swamiji's
room, when the kids had

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:36.830 align:middle line:90%
come tearing around the bend.

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:40.260 align:middle line:90%


00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And I was now facing
in that direction

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:44.825 align:middle line:90%
because I had spun around.

00:22:44.825 --> 00:22:45.825 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, I wonder.

00:22:45.825 --> 00:22:48.690 align:middle line:90%


00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And I start walking
forward, no problem.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.330 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't whether I was facing
forward or facing backward.

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:58.860 align:middle line:84%
It was whether I was trying
to walk out of the ashram

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:00.750 align:middle line:90%
or stay in the ashram.

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:02.250 align:middle line:90%
And so I walk back--

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:07.187 align:middle line:84%
now no problem at all-- back
towards Pujya Swamiji's room.

00:23:07.187 --> 00:23:08.520 align:middle line:90%
And I walked back into the room.

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:09.870 align:middle line:90%
Of course, it's full of people.

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:12.390 align:middle line:90%
He's got open darshan going on.

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:14.420 align:middle line:90%
I walked back in.

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:16.170 align:middle line:90%
And I just stand in the doorway.

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:18.110 align:middle line:90%
And he's meeting some people.

00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And after a few
moments, he looks up.

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:23.070 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't look
surprised to see me,

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:26.050 align:middle line:84%
maybe only three or four
minutes had passed anyway.

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him, I think
I'm supposed to stay now.

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:34.620 align:middle line:90%


00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:37.410 align:middle line:90%
And he says, welcome.

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:38.210 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:40.900 align:middle line:90%


00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And you stayed 23
years and counting.

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>> I stayed 23
years and counting.

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And I've taken official
vows of renunciation.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.870 align:middle line:84%
I took my vows of renunciation
in the year 2000, vows

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:56.320 align:middle line:84%
of sannyas, been
officially ordained

00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:01.450 align:middle line:84%
into that beautiful
order of renunciation.

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:07.000 align:middle line:84%
I've been so blessed to be
able to serve in so many ways

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.020 align:middle line:84%
through Divine Shakti
Foundation, which

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:15.040 align:middle line:84%
is a foundation dedicated
to women and children.

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:19.730 align:middle line:84%
We provide free education,
vocational training,

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:24.580 align:middle line:84%
health care in the villages,
empowerment programs.

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:29.350 align:middle line:84%
I've been blessed to be able
to serve as president of that.

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:34.060 align:middle line:84%
Our Global Interfaith
WASH Alliance,

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:38.680 align:middle line:84%
which is the world's first
international alliance

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:43.750 align:middle line:84%
of leaders of the major
religions coming together

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:47.200 align:middle line:84%
for water sanitation
and hygiene--

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:51.580 align:middle line:84%
and I serve as the
Secretary-General of that.

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:56.320 align:middle line:84%
We're working with the
United Nations and so many

00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:02.440 align:middle line:84%
other partners to
bring about a world

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:08.890 align:middle line:84%
where everyone has access to
safe and sufficient water,

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:11.170 align:middle line:90%
sanitation, hygiene.

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Because, did you know that
today more people are suffering

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:17.890 align:middle line:84%
and dying due to lack of
clean water than due to all

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:19.990 align:middle line:90%
forms of violence combined?

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:24.130 align:middle line:84%
So we're very, very
active with that.

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:27.010 align:middle line:84%
It's just been such
an incredible blessing

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:30.640 align:middle line:84%
to be able to serve
in that way and to be

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:38.050 align:middle line:84%
able to do so much
speaking, so much teaching.

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And yet I'm acutely aware
that it isn't me teaching.

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:45.520 align:middle line:90%
It's not me speaking.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:51.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm being used the same way that
this microphone is being used.

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And so whether it's speaking
about women's rights

00:25:56.530 --> 00:26:00.610 align:middle line:84%
and equality in India or
with the United Nations;

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:05.380 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's speaking
about spirituality. and peace,

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:10.970 align:middle line:84%
and love, and all of the
components of a spiritual life;

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:12.490 align:middle line:84%
whether it's
teaching meditation,

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:15.910 align:middle line:84%
whatever aspect that
that teaching may take

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:22.090 align:middle line:84%
or that speaking may
take, it's not me.

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:27.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm a vehicle, a
vessel, through which

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:31.990 align:middle line:84%
that which needs to be
spoken is being spoken,

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:34.460 align:middle line:90%
when I can get out of the way.

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:38.250 align:middle line:84%
That's the only time, it
works is when I can get my--

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:45.800 align:middle line:84%
my preconstructed
ideas-- when I can

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:50.960 align:middle line:84%
get my preconstructed ideas,
my ego, my, lower case s,

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:56.660 align:middle line:84%
self out of the way,
so that grace can flow.

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:59.400 align:middle line:90%
That's when it touches people.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:03.920 align:middle line:84%
It's not about some wisdom I'm
manufacturing on the inside.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.260 align:middle line:84%
It's about how
much I can get out

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:09.620 align:middle line:84%
of the way, how clear
of a vessel I can be,

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:14.510 align:middle line:84%
how empty of a vessel I
can be for Grace to flow.

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:18.990 align:middle line:84%
As I said, there's a
wisdom in the universe.

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And if I can be a clear
vessel for that wisdom

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:28.510 align:middle line:84%
to use me to flow
through for others,

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:31.100 align:middle line:84%
that's such an
incredible blessing

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:34.970 align:middle line:90%
to be able to be used like that.

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:38.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:40.040 align:middle line:84%
I can empathize with
this story in a way,

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.690 align:middle line:84%
having spent some
time in ashrams.

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:44.300 align:middle line:84%
But that is a very
unique one, nonetheless.

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:48.290 align:middle line:84%
For you to stay so committed
for so long, is beautiful.

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:52.680 align:middle line:90%
>> You know, here's the thing.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:57.870 align:middle line:84%
Everything we do in life we
do to make ourselves happy.

00:27:57.870 --> 00:28:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean that
in a selfish way.

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:03.500 align:middle line:84%
Sure, some of our vision of
happiness is very shallow.

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:06.260 align:middle line:90%


00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:07.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to see a good movie.

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:09.405 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have a
chocolate ice cream cone.

00:28:09.405 --> 00:28:11.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have
a one-night stand.

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:14.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to steal
somebody else's thing.

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:15.470 align:middle line:90%
So then I'll have more.

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:16.550 align:middle line:90%
And then I'll be happy.

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:19.550 align:middle line:84%
So it leads us,
sometimes in harmless,

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:24.620 align:middle line:84%
sometimes in not so
harmless, directions.

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:30.920 align:middle line:84%
But even those of us who
are more deeply grounded,

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:33.210 align:middle line:84%
we're still doing
it to be happy.

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:40.490 align:middle line:84%
So whether it's, I'm meditating
and praying, and doing seva,

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:43.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm still ultimately
doing it for my happiness.

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Here's how it looks
at the end of the day.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.180 align:middle line:84%
When I lie down to
go to sleep at night,

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:53.870 align:middle line:84%
and I know that I have spent
that day doing something that

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:57.680 align:middle line:90%
benefits others, I feel happy.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's still-- it's
still our own happiness.

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:06.380 align:middle line:84%
It's just a much longer term,
more grounded and anchored,

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:10.580 align:middle line:84%
vision and awareness of
happiness than a chocolate ice

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:16.280 align:middle line:84%
cream cone, or stealing
something, or a movie,

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:18.170 align:middle line:90%
or a pay raise.

00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:23.630 align:middle line:84%
But it's still because this
is what makes me happy.

00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And I mention that
because when you say,

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:29.540 align:middle line:84%
oh, it's so great that
you've stayed committed,

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:32.090 align:middle line:84%
and people say, oh,
you've left everything

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:36.980 align:middle line:84%
as though I had made this noble
sacrifice of all of that which

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:40.640 align:middle line:84%
is good in the
world, I've left that

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:45.080 align:middle line:84%
behind for this very austere,
not good at all life,

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:48.020 align:middle line:84%
because I'm somehow
of a qualitatively

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:51.700 align:middle line:90%
different caliber of person.

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.390 align:middle line:90%
And that's not true at all.

00:29:53.390 --> 00:30:00.920 align:middle line:84%
I make the exact same
decisions that everybody makes,

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:07.730 align:middle line:84%
which is, what is it that's
going to make me happy?

00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:10.550 align:middle line:84%
I've learned to look at
a long-term happiness,

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:14.330 align:middle line:84%
at a deep happiness, at a
pervasive happiness, rather

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:20.000 align:middle line:84%
than a short-term surface
level, up and down happiness.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:29.730 align:middle line:84%
But for me, living in a place
in which people are committed

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:34.800 align:middle line:84%
to a spiritual practice;
in which people are there

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:39.330 align:middle line:84%
to be bathed and
steeped in spirituality;

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:44.760 align:middle line:84%
in which what we offer
is spiritual anchoring,

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:50.850 align:middle line:84%
spiritual grounding, spiritual
opening, oneness, connection,

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:57.720 align:middle line:84%
love, truth; in
which we are serving,

00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:02.610 align:middle line:84%
providing children
with education,

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:05.250 align:middle line:84%
providing women with
empowerment, and training,

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:10.230 align:middle line:84%
and opportunities, providing
the sick with medical care;

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:13.500 align:middle line:84%
working for the environment,
water, sanitation, hygiene,

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:17.470 align:middle line:84%
disaster relief, all
of these programs,

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:19.020 align:middle line:84%
well, it's not
because I've somehow

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:22.200 align:middle line:90%
made a more noble choice.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:27.930 align:middle line:84%
It's that doing that
makes me feel good.

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:32.880 align:middle line:90%
When I feel good, I'm happier.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And so I've stayed committed
because what I've realized

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:44.790 align:middle line:84%
is that as far as
package deals of life go,

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:46.440 align:middle line:90%
this is the package deal.

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't mean that
it's always super enjoyable.

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:52.250 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
there aren't challenges.

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:55.920 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that the
spiritual path is not

00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:02.010 align:middle line:84%
one in which the darkest
aspects of who you are

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:05.900 align:middle line:84%
pulled from within and
shoved in your own face.

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:09.396 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
working in India is easy.

00:32:09.396 --> 00:32:11.340 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean being
celibate is easy.

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:17.160 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean working 24/7,
365 days a year is easy.

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:27.920 align:middle line:84%
But it means that looking at
the choices for life, looking

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:30.110 align:middle line:84%
at all that I know,
all that I've seen,

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:36.620 align:middle line:84%
l that I've experienced, this
is the choice that brings me

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:38.600 align:middle line:84%
actually the greatest
amount of happiness,

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:44.630 align:middle line:84%
the greatest amount of peace,
that is the most pervasive,

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:51.285 align:middle line:84%
the most long lasting,
the deepest, hence I stay.

00:32:51.285 --> 00:32:54.000 align:middle line:90%


00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.300 align:middle line:90%
>> That's amazing.

00:32:56.300 --> 00:33:01.490 align:middle line:84%
This sense of experiencing
spiritual divinity

00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:03.470 align:middle line:84%
or having a
shaktipat experience,

00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:08.000 align:middle line:84%
or something like this, seems
distant for many people.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And I would argue
that in the West,

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:17.210 align:middle line:84%
we live in what might crudely be
said a weird culture, Western,

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:20.366 align:middle line:84%
educated, industrialized,
rich, and democratic.

00:33:20.366 --> 00:33:22.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, thank you.

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:25.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And as part of
living in that world,

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:30.020 align:middle line:84%
we seem to have detached
ourselves from the spirit.

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:33.530 align:middle line:84%
We're looking down
on our phones always.

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:35.640 align:middle line:84%
We're not connecting
with others.

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:38.780 align:middle line:84%
We're not open to receiving
messages or intuition.

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:42.290 align:middle line:84%
How do you think
this type of living

00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:45.518 align:middle line:84%
is affecting humanity in this
way, potentially negative,

00:33:45.518 --> 00:33:47.060 align:middle line:84%
in a way that we're
being conditioned

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:48.143 align:middle line:90%
to believe certain things?

00:33:48.143 --> 00:33:50.951 align:middle line:90%
And how can we be more open?

00:33:50.951 --> 00:33:52.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm, beautiful question.

00:33:52.280 --> 00:34:02.480 align:middle line:90%


00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:06.190 align:middle line:90%
There was a man.

00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:08.000 align:middle line:90%
He goes to the doctors one day.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And he says doctor, there's
something very wrong with me.

00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:14.480 align:middle line:90%
My entire body hurts.

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.850 align:middle line:90%
Whatever I touch, it hurts.

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:19.280 align:middle line:90%
When I touch my head, it hurts.

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.230 align:middle line:84%
When I touch my
stomach, it hurts.

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:23.870 align:middle line:90%
When I touch my back, it hurts.

00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:26.420 align:middle line:90%
When I touch my knee, it hurts.

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor is very confused
because usually people come

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.710 align:middle line:84%
in with one complaint, either
a headache, or a stomach

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:34.250 align:middle line:90%
ache, or a backache.

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:36.710 align:middle line:90%
And this guy, everything hurts.

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:39.949 align:middle line:84%
So he runs every
test and every scan.

00:34:39.949 --> 00:34:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And at the end, he calls
the guy in and he says,

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:45.889 align:middle line:84%
so the good news
is there is nothing

00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:49.699 align:middle line:84%
wrong with your head, or
your back, or your stomach,

00:34:49.699 --> 00:34:51.260 align:middle line:90%
or your knee.

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:55.070 align:middle line:84%
The bad news is your
finger is broke.

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And because your finger is
broken, whatever you touch,

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:02.100 align:middle line:90%
it hurts.

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And I love that joke
because this to me

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:11.480 align:middle line:84%
is the core of what's happening
to us in society today.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:14.450 align:middle line:90%
We have lost our connection.

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:16.850 align:middle line:84%
We've lost our
connection to truth.

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:18.640 align:middle line:84%
We've lost our
connection to spirit.

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:21.590 align:middle line:84%
We've lost our
connection to source.

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:26.060 align:middle line:84%
We've lost our connection to
the oneness of consciousness

00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:28.780 align:middle line:90%
that flows through us.

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:32.110 align:middle line:90%
And so our lives hurt.

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:35.530 align:middle line:90%
And we blame the stock market.

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And we blame interest
rates and mortgage rates.

00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:40.000 align:middle line:90%
And we blame the traffic.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.200 align:middle line:90%
And we blame our weight.

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And we blame our employers, and
our employees, or our spouses,

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:47.260 align:middle line:84%
or our lack of spouse,
or our children,

00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:49.500 align:middle line:84%
or our lack of children,
or whatever it may be.

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:53.572 align:middle line:90%


00:35:53.572 --> 00:35:55.280 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, the
problem is that we're

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:57.500 align:middle line:84%
moving through the world
with a broken connection,

00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:01.250 align:middle line:84%
like this guy's whole body hurt
because his finger was broken.

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:04.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, we are moving through the
world with a broken connection.

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:07.550 align:middle line:90%
And so it hurts.

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, but
we are causing hurt.

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:13.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's one thing
that we're hurting.

00:36:13.850 --> 00:36:16.010 align:middle line:84%
It's another thing
than then because I

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:23.480 align:middle line:84%
hurt, because I feel
like a separate object,

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:27.440 align:middle line:84%
because I am disconnected
from soul, spirit, source,

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:30.980 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, love,
truth, oneness--

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:33.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm living as an object.

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.880 align:middle line:84%
I therefore see
you as an object.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:39.260 align:middle line:90%


00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:42.200 align:middle line:84%
Form connects to form,
content connects to content.

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:46.070 align:middle line:84%
So, body connects to
body, soul to soul.

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:48.890 align:middle line:84%
If I'm identifying
as body, if I'm

00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:53.010 align:middle line:84%
moving through the world
as separate object, body,

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:57.050 align:middle line:84%
whether it's my mind, my role,
my job, my title, my weight,

00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:59.900 align:middle line:84%
my gender, my sexual
orientation, whatever aspect

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:03.740 align:middle line:84%
of this that I'm rooted in this
identity, this is who I am--

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:07.160 align:middle line:84%
or my current emotion,
anger frustration--

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:13.220 align:middle line:84%
if I'm moving through the world
from that place, that's object.

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:14.780 align:middle line:90%
That's body.

00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:17.750 align:middle line:84%
Even the emotional stuff,
it's chemistry and electricity

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:19.910 align:middle line:90%
in my brain.

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:23.255 align:middle line:84%
I'm then going to
respond to you as object.

00:37:23.255 --> 00:37:28.540 align:middle line:90%


00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:30.460 align:middle line:90%
There's separation between us.

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:34.190 align:middle line:84%
One object over here, all this
huge chunk of empty space.

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:36.720 align:middle line:84%
There's another object over
there, then some empty space.

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Then the guy behind
the camera over there,

00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:40.640 align:middle line:84%
then empty space,
and grace over there.

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:44.640 align:middle line:90%
So we're all separate.

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And when I move through
the world like that,

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:54.250 align:middle line:84%
I consume, and
consume, and consume.

00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And destroy, and destroy,
and destroy because the world

00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:00.970 align:middle line:90%
becomes an object.

00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And whether it's
women who get raped,

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:10.550 align:middle line:84%
whether it's trees that are cut
down, whether it's rivers that

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:14.240 align:middle line:84%
are being polluted,
whether it's women

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:19.980 align:middle line:84%
and children in sweatshops
who are being oppressed,

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:25.680 align:middle line:84%
whether it's our own children
we're beating or demeaning,

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.927 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's the soil that
we're polluting from factories

00:38:28.927 --> 00:38:31.260 align:middle line:84%
because of our craving for
more, more, more, more, more,

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:33.750 align:middle line:84%
whatever it may
be, as long as I'm

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:39.480 align:middle line:84%
moving through the world as
separate, disconnected object,

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.850 align:middle line:84%
not only am I going
to suffer, but I'm

00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:46.710 align:middle line:84%
going to bring about
suffering in the world

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:48.110 align:middle line:90%
because it's so disconnected.

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:48.910 align:middle line:90%
It's an object.

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:51.270 align:middle line:84%
So an object can
only be two things.

00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:54.450 align:middle line:84%
Either you're something that's
going to be a benefit to me.

00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:59.080 align:middle line:84%
I can use you, to get ahead, or
for my own personal pleasure,

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:04.620 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it may be, or you
are an obstacle on my path.

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And so whether you
are a human being,

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:14.390 align:middle line:84%
whether you are a tree,
whether you are a river,

00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:18.950 align:middle line:84%
either I'm going to use you
or I need to remove you.

00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:21.810 align:middle line:90%


00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:25.650 align:middle line:84%
In either case, I'm going to
bring about suffering for you.

00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:28.770 align:middle line:90%


00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:33.060 align:middle line:84%
So that disconnection
that we speak about

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:36.750 align:middle line:84%
is the root of, not only
our own suffering, not only

00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:40.110 align:middle line:84%
the depression, and
suicide tendencies,

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:42.030 align:middle line:84%
and the anxiety,
and the addictions,

00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:46.260 align:middle line:84%
and all of that that we
suffer from individually,

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:47.820 align:middle line:90%
it's the root of terrorism.

00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:48.885 align:middle line:90%
It's the root of wars.

00:39:48.885 --> 00:39:52.110 align:middle line:90%


00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:56.160 align:middle line:84%
It's also the root of the
environmental destruction.

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:59.730 align:middle line:84%
We feel so separate
from Mother Earth.

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:04.630 align:middle line:84%
We feel so separate
from future generations.

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:06.610 align:middle line:84%
If someone said to you,
suffocate your child,

00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:09.970 align:middle line:90%
you're like, no way.

00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:13.600 align:middle line:84%
There is no amount of money you
could pay a parent to convince

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.000 align:middle line:90%
them to suffocate their child.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.160 align:middle line:90%


00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And we are
contributing to a world

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:29.340 align:middle line:84%
actively, in which
children of the future

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:36.220 align:middle line:84%
will not have air to breathe,
will not have water to drink.

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:38.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we're able
to do that when

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.570 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't be able to
suffocate our own child

00:40:40.570 --> 00:40:42.520 align:middle line:84%
or deprive our own
child of water,

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:45.610 align:middle line:84%
it's only because we
feel separate from that.

00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:49.330 align:middle line:84%
We're unable to
see them as self.

00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And so this is where--
the word "yoga," or "yog,"

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:56.800 align:middle line:84%
as it's literally pronounced
in Sanskrit, literally

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:59.320 align:middle line:90%
means Union.

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:02.800 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about
yoga, the practice of yog,

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:05.320 align:middle line:84%
it's not a union of
my nose to my knees

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.990 align:middle line:84%
or a union of my
fingers to my toes.

00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:10.600 align:middle line:90%
Finally, I can touch the ground.

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:15.157 align:middle line:84%
It's a union of the
self to the divine.

00:41:15.157 --> 00:41:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter
what your religion; it

00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:19.330 align:middle line:84%
doesn't matter if you're
spiritual, but not religious;

00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:23.710 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter
if you're atheist,

00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:28.750 align:middle line:84%
as long as you are aware
that there is something

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:31.430 align:middle line:90%
to you other than your body.

00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And if doubt that,
if you doubt that,

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:38.950 align:middle line:84%
just ask yourself, well,
over the course of my life

00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:41.370 align:middle line:84%
how many times has
my body changed?

00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And we know scientifically,
every seven, eight,

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:47.410 align:middle line:84%
nine years, every single cell
of my body has regenerated.

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:50.020 align:middle line:84%
OK, so how many times
has that happened?

00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And the skin cells
are only a few days.

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:56.590 align:middle line:84%
It's just my internal
organs that take longer.

00:41:56.590 --> 00:42:03.430 align:middle line:84%
But I've been saying "I," I've
been saying "me" my whole life.

00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:06.490 align:middle line:84%
There hasn't been any
disruption in the continuity

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:08.380 align:middle line:90%
of my awareness of self.

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:12.040 align:middle line:84%
So who is that self
that's not your body?

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:14.620 align:middle line:84%
Who is that self that's not
your relationships, that's

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:16.900 align:middle line:84%
not your title, that's
not your career?

00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:19.030 align:middle line:84%
Because you were
saying I long before

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:22.930 align:middle line:84%
you had a title, or a
career, or that relationship.

00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:25.270 align:middle line:84%
You were saying
I long before you

00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:28.540 align:middle line:84%
were an alcoholic, or depressed,
or too fat, or too thin.

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:31.300 align:middle line:90%


00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:32.440 align:middle line:90%
What's that I?

00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:35.740 align:middle line:90%
Who's that I?

00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:42.765 align:middle line:84%
And so as long as
we connect with--

00:42:42.765 --> 00:42:44.140 align:middle line:84%
if you don't want
to call it God,

00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:47.200 align:middle line:84%
call it spirit, call it
consciousness, call it love,

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:51.230 align:middle line:84%
call it truth, call
it-- doesn't matter.

00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:54.610 align:middle line:84%
But the connection
with that, that exists,

00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:58.370 align:middle line:84%
that is who we are, the
truth of who we are,

00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:05.590 align:middle line:84%
and that pervades the universe,
that connection is actually

00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:11.690 align:middle line:84%
what will save us from
suffering in our lives.

00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's what will very
literally save our species.

00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:18.410 align:middle line:84%
The Earth doesn't
need us to save her.

00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:20.370 align:middle line:90%
The Earth is going to be alive.

00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:21.740 align:middle line:90%
She survived the Ice Age.

00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:23.260 align:middle line:90%
She survived everything.

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:25.280 align:middle line:84%
She's going to survive
an age of fire.

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:26.210 align:middle line:90%
We won't survive it.

00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:29.120 align:middle line:90%


00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And so that connection
to the Earth,

00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:39.690 align:middle line:84%
to the children, the
grandchildren, the future,

00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:42.910 align:middle line:84%
that connection is what
will save our species.

00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:45.450 align:middle line:84%
So whether you're talking
about personal depression,

00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:50.280 align:middle line:84%
personal addiction,
personal sense of misery,

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:54.030 align:middle line:84%
or you're talking about
planetary destruction,

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:59.140 align:middle line:84%
at the very core the answer is
the same, connection, oneness.

00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:02.720 align:middle line:90%


00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:06.215 align:middle line:90%
Om Namah Shivaya.

00:44:06.215 --> 00:44:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Om Namah Shivaya.

00:44:08.970 --> 00:44:12.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Practically speaking,
how can people do this?

00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Some people find it so
difficult to adhere to

00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:18.990 align:middle line:84%
or to subscribe to
some of the practices.

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:22.140 align:middle line:84%
Even meditation is
difficult for some people.

00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:24.240 align:middle line:84%
How can practically
people connect in?

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:26.370 align:middle line:84%
How can they find more
oneness and more peace

00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:29.120 align:middle line:84%
because there's so many
modalities and so many

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:30.240 align:middle line:90%
ideas out there?

00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:32.680 align:middle line:90%
Here's an app to calm your mind.

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:33.480 align:middle line:90%
Here's tapping.

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:34.280 align:middle line:90%
Here's this.

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:36.092 align:middle line:90%
I love a lot of them.

00:44:36.092 --> 00:44:38.550 align:middle line:84%
What do you think are some of
the greatest ways that people

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:41.010 align:middle line:84%
can connect in and experience
their own divinity and more

00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:43.740 align:middle line:90%
oneness?

00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>> At the end of the
day, you come home.

00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:47.910 align:middle line:90%
You're stressed.

00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:48.710 align:middle line:90%
You're tired.

00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:49.860 align:middle line:90%
You've had a busy day.

00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:53.300 align:middle line:90%


00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:57.390 align:middle line:90%
You get into a hot bathtub, OK.

00:44:57.390 --> 00:45:00.975 align:middle line:84%
Now what does that hot
bath tub feel like?

00:45:00.975 --> 00:45:01.850 align:middle line:90%
Oh, right.

00:45:01.850 --> 00:45:04.720 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's the prerequisite
for the "ah" experience

00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:15.960 align:middle line:90%
of the bath?

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:17.050 align:middle line:90%
What's required for that?

00:45:17.050 --> 00:45:21.210 align:middle line:90%


00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:22.110 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:22.910 align:middle line:90%
What do you need?

00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:30.540 align:middle line:84%
What's the only prerequisite to
be able to have a "ah" moment?

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
yes, we need water.

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:33.920 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:35.753 align:middle line:84%
The water needs to be
the right temperature.

00:45:35.753 --> 00:45:38.210 align:middle line:90%
It needs to be full.

00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:40.250 align:middle line:90%
What do we need to do for that?

00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:43.450 align:middle line:90%


00:45:43.450 --> 00:45:46.180 align:middle line:84%
You've got to take
off your clothes.

00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:51.670 align:middle line:84%
If you walk in from work or from
wherever you are in your shoes,

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:54.040 align:middle line:84%
in your suit and
tie, in your top hat,

00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:57.450 align:middle line:84%
and you get into the most
beautiful, warm bubble bath,

00:45:57.450 --> 00:46:00.660 align:middle line:84%
and you want to
feel relaxed, you're

00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:03.370 align:middle line:84%
going to feel soggy, and
gross, and weighted down,

00:46:03.370 --> 00:46:06.200 align:middle line:90%
and horrendous.

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.500 align:middle line:90%
So the bath is available.

00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:11.980 align:middle line:90%
The "ah" is available.

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:15.880 align:middle line:84%
The only thing preventing
you from having it

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:18.490 align:middle line:90%
is the weight of your clothes.

00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is the same with
our internal connection.

00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:24.870 align:middle line:84%
It's not about what
practice you use.

00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:27.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could say, what's
the best way to get undressed?

00:46:27.370 --> 00:46:27.760 align:middle line:90%
Well, you know what?

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:29.920 align:middle line:84%
It really doesn't matter,
whatever works for you.

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Top to bottom,
inside out, you want

00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:34.400 align:middle line:84%
to unbutton it
two-handed, one-handed,

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:37.790 align:middle line:84%
and have somebody else unbutton
you, it doesn't matter.

00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:41.830 align:middle line:84%
All that matters is you've
got to get those clothes off.

00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:44.950 align:middle line:90%
And in the same way, see--

00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:48.190 align:middle line:90%


00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:49.810 align:middle line:90%
connection is within me.

00:46:49.810 --> 00:46:50.680 align:middle line:90%
It is me.

00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:53.720 align:middle line:84%
It's not like learning
rocket science.

00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:57.310 align:middle line:84%
It's not something I have
to gain from outside.

00:46:57.310 --> 00:46:59.320 align:middle line:90%
It is who I am.

00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:04.330 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
going back to self.

00:47:04.330 --> 00:47:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And so meditation
is extraordinary.

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:15.080 align:middle line:90%
Prayer is extraordinarily.

00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:19.410 align:middle line:90%
Service, extraordinary.

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:22.220 align:middle line:84%
On that level, I would recommend
a practice of all three

00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:23.685 align:middle line:90%
of those.

00:47:23.685 --> 00:47:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'll come back
to that in a moment.

00:47:25.310 --> 00:47:32.060 align:middle line:84%
But where we're
going is in the self.

00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And so the question, of
course, then becomes, well,

00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:35.360 align:middle line:90%
why can't I be like that now?

00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:36.560 align:middle line:90%
Why do I have to do anything?

00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:37.340 align:middle line:90%
Why meditate?

00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:37.850 align:middle line:90%
Why pray?

00:47:37.850 --> 00:47:38.650 align:middle line:90%
Why serve?

00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:43.010 align:middle line:84%
If it's me, why am I not able
to just live like that all

00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:44.630 align:middle line:90%
the time?

00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:49.340 align:middle line:84%
Because of all of that,
which is not self, hence

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:51.590 align:middle line:90%
my clothes metaphor.

00:47:51.590 --> 00:47:55.460 align:middle line:84%
When you want that warm bath
for the soul, for the self,

00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:58.850 align:middle line:84%
for the body, you've just got to
take off your physical clothes.

00:47:58.850 --> 00:48:01.670 align:middle line:84%
If it's just your
body you want relaxed,

00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:04.640 align:middle line:84%
just the body you want
the warm bath for,

00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:07.670 align:middle line:90%
get off your physical clothes.

00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:08.570 align:middle line:90%
You've got it.

00:48:08.570 --> 00:48:13.730 align:middle line:90%
You've got your "ah" moment.

00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:16.830 align:middle line:84%
But when you want
it for the soul,

00:48:16.830 --> 00:48:20.300 align:middle line:84%
it's not about getting rid
of your physical clothes.

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:24.800 align:middle line:84%
It's about removing all
of that which is not self,

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:33.650 align:middle line:84%
that we have stuck on to
the self, ego, expectations,

00:48:33.650 --> 00:48:37.940 align:middle line:84%
attachment, fear, desires,
subconscious and unconscious

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:43.030 align:middle line:84%
programming, identities,
personalities, histories.

00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:46.850 align:middle line:90%


00:48:46.850 --> 00:48:50.345 align:middle line:84%
If you're going
to hold onto that,

00:48:50.345 --> 00:48:51.845 align:middle line:84%
and you're not going
to let that go,

00:48:51.845 --> 00:48:55.535 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter what
form of meditation you do.

00:48:55.535 --> 00:48:57.410 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to be
able to experience it.

00:48:57.410 --> 00:49:02.060 align:middle line:84%
It's like getting into the
bathtub in your ski clothes.

00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:04.752 align:middle line:84%
Well, as I said, you can have
the best bath in the world.

00:49:04.752 --> 00:49:06.710 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to feel
relaxed because you've

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:10.190 align:middle line:84%
got this heavy down jacket,
that's just getting heavier

00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:14.160 align:middle line:84%
by the minute as the
jacket soaks up the water.

00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:25.290 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm suffocated by all
of that which is not self,

00:49:25.290 --> 00:49:28.140 align:middle line:90%
I need to let it go.

00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:31.185 align:middle line:84%
And this is where meditation is
such an extraordinary practice.

00:49:31.185 --> 00:49:33.810 align:middle line:90%


00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:38.880 align:middle line:84%
It helps us to let
go of the not self.

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:43.020 align:middle line:84%
It's not that
meditation brings God

00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:46.710 align:middle line:84%
or that meditation brings
peace and enlightenment.

00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Meditation removes that
which is keeping us

00:49:49.830 --> 00:49:55.410 align:middle line:84%
from seeing and living in the
divinity, the light, the joy,

00:49:55.410 --> 00:49:57.750 align:middle line:84%
the peace that is who we
are, the same way the clothes

00:49:57.750 --> 00:50:00.180 align:middle line:90%
keep you from enjoying the bath.

00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And another way to think about
it is the Sun is shining.

00:50:05.010 --> 00:50:07.860 align:middle line:90%
We're sitting in a dark room.

00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:10.950 align:middle line:84%
In that dark room we're
doing prayers for the Sun,

00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:13.500 align:middle line:84%
and Sun Salutations,
and Sun Mudras.

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And we're yearning for the
Sun, when all we've got to do

00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:21.120 align:middle line:90%
is throw open those blinds.

00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:24.570 align:middle line:84%
So it's not about how
do I bring the Sun?

00:50:24.570 --> 00:50:26.730 align:middle line:84%
It's about how do I
throw open the blinds

00:50:26.730 --> 00:50:31.800 align:middle line:84%
and experience the
Sun that is there,

00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:35.130 align:middle line:90%
and that is actually who I am?

00:50:35.130 --> 00:50:40.740 align:middle line:84%
So whatever practice
helps you let

00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:44.550 align:middle line:84%
go of the attachment--
you know, I

00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:48.180 align:middle line:84%
think for me personally, I
think when I'm meditating,

00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:51.300 align:middle line:90%
I think of a piece of Velcro.

00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And so the top layer is kind
of this superficial level

00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:58.250 align:middle line:90%
existence.

00:50:58.250 --> 00:51:03.060 align:middle line:84%
The role that I play, the
relationships that I have,

00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:07.120 align:middle line:84%
the physical body that I
have, all of that, my history.

00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And the bottom part is the
truth of who I am, soul, spirit.

00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And most of us live with the
two of them stuck together

00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:16.620 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:21.180 align:middle line:84%
We have wrapped up our
awareness of soul, self,

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:25.080 align:middle line:84%
with how much money you
make, who you're married to,

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:27.130 align:middle line:84%
whose parent you are,
whose child you are,

00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:29.040 align:middle line:90%
how much you weigh.

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:31.320 align:middle line:90%
And meditation is this.

00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:36.130 align:middle line:90%


00:51:36.130 --> 00:51:41.530 align:middle line:84%
That's not a perfect analogy
because this, soul, spirit,

00:51:41.530 --> 00:51:44.950 align:middle line:84%
doesn't actually go
anywhere or become anything.

00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:46.430 align:middle line:90%
It just is.

00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:49.750 align:middle line:84%
But we'll call this the
awareness of soul, spirit.

00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:52.720 align:middle line:84%
So this isn't actually
the soul, spirit.

00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:54.970 align:middle line:90%
It's awareness of soul, spirit.

00:51:54.970 --> 00:52:00.850 align:middle line:84%
So where my awareness is
stuck in here, as I meditate

00:52:00.850 --> 00:52:04.330 align:middle line:84%
it drops, and it
drops, and it drops,

00:52:04.330 --> 00:52:06.460 align:middle line:90%
and it drops, and it drops.

00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly here I am, sitting
in an awareness of soul, spirit

00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:20.080 align:middle line:84%
that is dropped into the
ocean of the self, that's

00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:25.660 align:middle line:84%
no longer stuck to the role,
the identity, the title,

00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:28.150 align:middle line:90%
the external object.

00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:30.130 align:middle line:90%
And so that's the goal.

00:52:30.130 --> 00:52:35.590 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, meditation is
a fantastic technique.

00:52:35.590 --> 00:52:44.580 align:middle line:90%
Just do it, five minutes a day.

00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:46.890 align:middle line:84%
People who say I can't
meditate, well, then

00:52:46.890 --> 00:52:50.100 align:middle line:90%
just commit to sitting.

00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:56.890 align:middle line:84%
If somebody says to you
in five minutes a day,

00:52:56.890 --> 00:53:01.260 align:middle line:84%
you can have what you're
looking for in life,

00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:03.060 align:middle line:90%
really we wouldn't do it?

00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:05.790 align:middle line:90%
I mean, seriously?

00:53:05.790 --> 00:53:06.880 align:middle line:90%
We go to the gym.

00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:08.740 align:middle line:90%
We go to the grocery store.

00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:11.130 align:middle line:90%
We get on Facebook.

00:53:11.130 --> 00:53:14.130 align:middle line:90%
We go to work, obviously.

00:53:14.130 --> 00:53:18.150 align:middle line:84%
We do all of these things
to get what we want.

00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And then what we really need
for the heart, the awareness,

00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:26.950 align:middle line:90%
we don't do it.

00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:30.570 align:middle line:84%
So I would say commit
to just sitting.

00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Don't worry about
what's going to happen.

00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:37.410 align:middle line:84%
But make a commitment, I
will sit and I won't budge.

00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:40.650 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens to
most of us is we sit down.

00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And we say, all right, focus
on the breath, or your mantra,

00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:48.500 align:middle line:84%
whatever form of meditation
you're doing, or become aware.

00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:50.411 align:middle line:90%
And, of course, that's true.

00:53:50.411 --> 00:53:53.160 align:middle line:90%
It's the nature of the mind.

00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And instead of just allowing
the thoughts to breeze--

00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:02.150 align:middle line:84%
blow across our awareness--
and I always say,

00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:04.800 align:middle line:84%
if you were lying on your
back, looking up at the sky--

00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:06.750 align:middle line:90%
it's a blue sky day.

00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:09.300 align:middle line:90%
You've got some wispy clouds.

00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:11.370 align:middle line:90%
There's two ways of doing that.

00:54:11.370 --> 00:54:16.280 align:middle line:84%
One way is, a cloud
comes and you a see it.

00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And you hook your
attention into it.

00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And you follow it all
the way over there.

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:25.680 align:middle line:84%
The other way is you keep
the awareness on the blue sky

00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:27.570 align:middle line:90%
in between the clouds.

00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, I'm
focused on the sky.

00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:31.170 align:middle line:90%
And the clouds keep blowing.

00:54:31.170 --> 00:54:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way
that we meditate.

00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:35.340 align:middle line:90%
The clouds are our thoughts.

00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:36.660 align:middle line:90%
The clouds are distractions.

00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:40.170 align:middle line:84%
The clouds are my
itchy leg, or the smell

00:54:40.170 --> 00:54:42.390 align:middle line:84%
of my muffins baking
in the kitchen,

00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:46.050 align:middle line:90%
or the things that I have to do.

00:54:46.050 --> 00:54:51.000 align:middle line:84%
The blue sky is the
space between them.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.685 align:middle line:84%
And what happens for most
of us is a thought comes.

00:54:53.685 --> 00:54:57.540 align:middle line:90%


00:54:57.540 --> 00:55:00.340 align:middle line:84%
Ah, I can smell
the muffin baking.

00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:03.600 align:middle line:90%
And we jump on it.

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:04.892 align:middle line:90%
God, that's smells really good.

00:55:04.892 --> 00:55:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And I hope the
muffins don't burn.

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:08.140 align:middle line:90%
I know I set the timer properly.

00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:10.540 align:middle line:84%
But God, yeah, did I
really do it right?

00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:13.030 align:middle line:84%
I remember one
time when I was 11,

00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:16.298 align:middle line:84%
I thought I set the
timer for 10 minutes.

00:55:16.298 --> 00:55:17.590 align:middle line:90%
But it was actually 20 minutes.

00:55:17.590 --> 00:55:18.200 align:middle line:90%
And they burned.

00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:19.783 align:middle line:84%
And, oh, my god, I
was so embarrassed.

00:55:19.783 --> 00:55:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And my mom yelled at
me-- and god, muffins.

00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:23.500 align:middle line:90%
That's why I don't eat muffins.

00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:24.580 align:middle line:90%
I love croissants.

00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:26.110 align:middle line:90%
God, I remember we were--

00:55:26.110 --> 00:55:28.060 align:middle line:84%
we were in Paris, on
the Champs-Elysses.

00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:29.745 align:middle line:90%
And I had that croissant.

00:55:29.745 --> 00:55:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And why don't we go to Paris
this Christmas vacation?

00:55:32.590 --> 00:55:44.000 align:middle line:84%
So I went from a smell, a smell
that wafted into my awareness,

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.822 align:middle line:84%
to suddenly planning my
Christmas vacation in Paris.

00:55:47.822 --> 00:55:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And I've gone
through my whole sort

00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:51.890 align:middle line:84%
of childhood psychology of how
I gave up muffins and started

00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:52.700 align:middle line:90%
liking croissants.

00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:56.040 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, the
whole drama's there.

00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And then when we catch
ourselves planning the vacation,

00:55:59.810 --> 00:56:01.290 align:middle line:90%
most of us say, well, forget it.

00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:02.090 align:middle line:90%
I can't meditate.

00:56:02.090 --> 00:56:04.010 align:middle line:90%
This is stupid.

00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:06.130 align:middle line:90%
I've got a whole to-do list.

00:56:06.130 --> 00:56:07.690 align:middle line:90%
And we stand up and walk away.

00:56:07.690 --> 00:56:11.660 align:middle line:90%


00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And all you need to do is
just notice, oh, distracted.

00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:19.670 align:middle line:90%
Just bring it back.

00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:21.200 align:middle line:90%
Just bring it back.

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:22.640 align:middle line:90%
Just bring it back.

00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:23.990 align:middle line:90%
Just bring it back.

00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:25.820 align:middle line:10%
Just bring it back.

00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And eventually what happens is
the space between the thoughts

00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:33.500 align:middle line:90%
gets longer.

00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And you don't end up
all the way in Paris

00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:40.780 align:middle line:84%
before you notice that you
have gotten distracted.

00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:44.960 align:middle line:84%
So you bring it back
a little bit faster.

00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And if seated meditation
is difficult for you

00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:52.460 align:middle line:84%
right now, begin with a walking
meditation, walk in nature.

00:56:52.460 --> 00:56:54.095 align:middle line:90%
Get your bare feet in the dirt.

00:56:54.095 --> 00:56:56.630 align:middle line:90%


00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:59.420 align:middle line:90%
Do it open-eyed.

00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:03.650 align:middle line:84%
Sit and watch the
flowing of a river.

00:57:03.650 --> 00:57:09.060 align:middle line:84%
Watch a candle flame,
whatever it may be.

00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:13.053 align:middle line:84%
There's no rule that says
meditation has to be seated,

00:57:13.053 --> 00:57:13.970 align:middle line:90%
with your eyes closed.

00:57:13.970 --> 00:57:17.300 align:middle line:90%


00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:18.590 align:middle line:90%
Watch a candle flame.

00:57:18.590 --> 00:57:20.180 align:middle line:90%
Watch a flowing river.

00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:21.530 align:middle line:90%
Walk through nature.

00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:23.960 align:middle line:84%
But the process
is the same, which

00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:28.800 align:middle line:84%
is, I'm anchored in the
space between the thoughts.

00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:31.830 align:middle line:90%


00:57:31.830 --> 00:57:33.930 align:middle line:90%
It's not my contemplation time.

00:57:33.930 --> 00:57:37.200 align:middle line:90%
It's not my self-analysis time.

00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:39.510 align:middle line:90%
Those are all great things.

00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:41.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm all in favor of analysis.

00:57:41.070 --> 00:57:44.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm all in favor of
insight and contemplation.

00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:47.010 align:middle line:90%
But it's not meditation.

00:57:47.010 --> 00:57:50.595 align:middle line:84%
Meditation is being grounded in
the space between the thoughts.

00:57:50.595 --> 00:57:55.440 align:middle line:90%


00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:56.240 align:middle line:90%
Service.

00:57:56.240 --> 00:58:00.640 align:middle line:90%


00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:04.330 align:middle line:84%
Service because-- but see, this
is where meditation and service

00:58:04.330 --> 00:58:07.840 align:middle line:84%
have to go together
because otherwise we

00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:13.870 align:middle line:84%
serve as the good
people doing good work.

00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:15.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm a humanitarian.

00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:16.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm a philanthropist.

00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:19.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm a karma yogi.

00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:21.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do good work.

00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:25.030 align:middle line:84%
We've got Post-it notes
on our computer that

00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:27.457 align:middle line:84%
say practice one
random act of kindness

00:58:27.457 --> 00:58:28.540 align:middle line:90%
today, whatever it may be.

00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:32.170 align:middle line:90%


00:58:32.170 --> 00:58:35.650 align:middle line:90%
That's not the highest way.

00:58:35.650 --> 00:58:37.630 align:middle line:90%
It's still great.

00:58:37.630 --> 00:58:40.810 align:middle line:84%
If that's where you're at,
by all means keep doing it.

00:58:40.810 --> 00:58:47.980 align:middle line:84%
But also realize this isn't
the highest of where I'm going.

00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:51.950 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, the goal is not
me over here serving you over

00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:54.400 align:middle line:84%
there, because, see,
we're still separate.

00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:59.050 align:middle line:84%
At least I'm not raping or
abusing you, or using you

00:58:59.050 --> 00:59:00.190 align:middle line:90%
or discarding you.

00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:01.390 align:middle line:90%
At least I'm helping you.

00:59:01.390 --> 00:59:02.950 align:middle line:90%
But we're still separate.

00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:05.410 align:middle line:84%
We're still two
different objects.

00:59:05.410 --> 00:59:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately the goal is, I
serve you because you are self.

00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:14.830 align:middle line:84%
If I trip and I fall--
this is my favorite example

00:59:14.830 --> 00:59:19.180 align:middle line:84%
about this-- if I trip
and I fall, and I injure

00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:22.750 align:middle line:84%
my right leg, my
left leg is going

00:59:22.750 --> 00:59:25.420 align:middle line:90%
to pick up the extra weight.

00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:28.090 align:middle line:90%
We call that limping.

00:59:28.090 --> 00:59:32.510 align:middle line:84%
No one had to say, oh, great,
wonderful, humanitarian left

00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:33.310 align:middle line:90%
leg.

00:59:33.310 --> 00:59:36.730 align:middle line:84%
Would you mind picking
up a little extra weight?

00:59:36.730 --> 00:59:41.390 align:middle line:84%
It does it automatically because
it knows the right leg is self.

00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And if I trip, and I fall,
and I injure my right leg,

00:59:44.290 --> 00:59:48.310 align:middle line:84%
week, after week, after week the
left leg is never going to say,

00:59:48.310 --> 00:59:52.900 align:middle line:90%
oh, forget it, like I'm done.

00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:53.900 align:middle line:90%
Pick up your own weight.

00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:55.870 align:middle line:84%
I did that last week
and the week before.

00:59:55.870 --> 00:59:58.420 align:middle line:90%


00:59:58.420 --> 01:00:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And if after tripping
and hurting my leg.

01:00:03.790 --> 01:00:09.220 align:middle line:84%
I come down with a cold, or a
flu, or a headache, or measles,

01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:12.700 align:middle line:84%
whatever it may be, my
body is not going to say,

01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:14.200 align:middle line:90%
you know what, forget it.

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:16.960 align:middle line:90%
We did the leg injury.

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:18.167 align:middle line:90%
We did the fever.

01:00:18.167 --> 01:00:19.000 align:middle line:90%
We did the headache.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.610 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not doing
measles, enough.

01:00:21.610 --> 01:00:24.160 align:middle line:84%
It's going to keep
responding to whatever

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:27.885 align:middle line:84%
the need is because the
entire mechanism understands

01:00:27.885 --> 01:00:28.685 align:middle line:90%
we are self.

01:00:28.685 --> 01:00:32.600 align:middle line:90%


01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:35.120 align:middle line:84%
If a bee flew over and
stung me, immediately my arm

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:36.616 align:middle line:90%
would go like this.

01:00:36.616 --> 01:00:37.416 align:middle line:90%
I would--

01:00:37.416 --> 01:00:38.940 align:middle line:90%
[RUBBING BEE STING]

01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:39.740 align:middle line:90%
It's self.

01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:41.710 align:middle line:90%
It's one.

01:00:41.710 --> 01:00:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And so that service
is of self to self.

01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's the highest
level, is I see me in you.

01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:55.490 align:middle line:90%
I see you in me.

01:00:55.490 --> 01:01:00.050 align:middle line:84%
I see the divine in
both, that sameness.

01:01:00.050 --> 01:01:02.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking at you over there.

01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:11.040 align:middle line:84%
But if I'm at my highest
level, it's me in there.

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And my highest level of me is
not my identified role, me.

01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:20.270 align:middle line:90%
It's divinity.

01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:25.130 align:middle line:84%
So that same spirit in me,
there it is over there in you.

01:01:25.130 --> 01:01:27.920 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, I'm
going to serve,

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:30.806 align:middle line:84%
the same way the left
leg serves the right leg.

01:01:30.806 --> 01:01:34.460 align:middle line:90%


01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:37.100 align:middle line:84%
But you don't have to wait
till you have that awareness

01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:40.340 align:middle line:84%
to serve as long
as you're serving,

01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:45.860 align:middle line:90%
you serve with that as the goal.

01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:52.080 align:middle line:84%
Instead of me feeling like
this great humanitarian,

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.180 align:middle line:84%
can I understand
I'm serving self?

01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:59.400 align:middle line:84%
Instead of seeing you as the
recipient of what I'm giving,

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:02.280 align:middle line:90%
can I see you as self?

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:05.040 align:middle line:90%
And then that becomes a way.

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:08.020 align:middle line:90%


01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:08.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:13.980 align:middle line:84%
I think it's important because
people feel lacking direction.

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:16.375 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes just going
out and serving others

01:02:16.375 --> 01:02:17.750 align:middle line:84%
can give you a
sense of direction

01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:19.950 align:middle line:84%
because it's just like,
wow, I've got a great life.

01:02:19.950 --> 01:02:20.790 align:middle line:90%
How lucky I am.

01:02:20.790 --> 01:02:27.570 align:middle line:84%
How dare I feel ungrateful,
or anxious, or depressed,

01:02:27.570 --> 01:02:28.730 align:middle line:90%
or worried.

01:02:28.730 --> 01:02:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And so just serving alone can
provide a sense of service

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:36.640 align:middle line:84%
or crack that door open to
seeing oneness in the other.

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:38.600 align:middle line:84%
But if you could
talk about that?

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:39.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:42.420 align:middle line:90%


01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:49.610 align:middle line:90%
So first of all, there's of--

01:02:49.610 --> 01:02:54.460 align:middle line:84%
a lot of baggage around
purpose these days.

01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:58.920 align:middle line:90%
And so many people come to us--

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:04.260 align:middle line:84%
bereft people, with
what look like from

01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:06.180 align:middle line:84%
the outside, wonderful
lives, people

01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:09.240 align:middle line:84%
who are doing
meaningful work, engaged

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:11.175 align:middle line:90%
in meaningful relationships.

01:03:11.175 --> 01:03:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And they'll come
and they'll say,

01:03:12.550 --> 01:03:15.300 align:middle line:90%
but I don't know my purpose.

01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like we're
getting really indoctrinated,

01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:22.860 align:middle line:84%
and to the point
where it's starting

01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:27.900 align:middle line:84%
to feel unhealthily so,
into this concept of,

01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:30.960 align:middle line:90%
you have one purpose.

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
be something grand,

01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:38.190 align:middle line:84%
and romantic, and never been
done before, and extraordinary.

01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And until and
unless you find it,

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:42.450 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter
what else you do.

01:03:42.450 --> 01:03:46.260 align:middle line:84%
It's not enough because
it's not your purpose.

01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And that feels to me
like a tragic myth.

01:03:51.930 --> 01:03:59.490 align:middle line:84%
We don't come into this world
branded on the behind with,

01:03:59.490 --> 01:04:05.850 align:middle line:84%
CEO of this company,
president of that country,

01:04:05.850 --> 01:04:10.980 align:middle line:90%
world famous this, head of that.

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:19.650 align:middle line:84%
We come into this world branded
with divine, branded with true,

01:04:19.650 --> 01:04:25.960 align:middle line:84%
love, wholeness,
completeness, consciousness.

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And so this concept
of "find your purpose"

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:35.430 align:middle line:84%
has driven us into
these holes of,

01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:37.050 align:middle line:90%
well, it has to be one thing.

01:04:37.050 --> 01:04:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, it
has to be something

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:46.040 align:middle line:84%
that I will make a living,
as though somehow the market

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:51.240 align:middle line:84%
place were created to
pay me for my purpose.

01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And as though it's
going to be grand,

01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:56.400 align:middle line:90%
and romantic, and extraordinary.

01:04:56.400 --> 01:05:00.460 align:middle line:90%
And this just isn't true at all.

01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And it feels like such a
tragic, insidious almost,

01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:13.050 align:middle line:84%
myth and indoctrination
into people.

01:05:13.050 --> 01:05:21.020 align:middle line:84%
Our purpose as human beings
here on Earth is to wake up.

01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:24.160 align:middle line:90%
That is why we are here.

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:29.800 align:middle line:84%
According to the
spiritual tradition,

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:34.480 align:middle line:84%
the Vedic, Hindu, Indian
spiritual tradition,

01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:39.070 align:middle line:84%
the reason that we have a
human birth is to wake up.

01:05:39.070 --> 01:05:42.580 align:middle line:84%
It is said very beautifully
in a beautiful teaching.

01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:46.930 align:middle line:90%
Three things are most precious.

01:05:46.930 --> 01:05:50.140 align:middle line:90%
Number one, a human birth.

01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:57.220 align:middle line:84%
Number two, the quest for
learning and awakening.

01:05:57.220 --> 01:06:01.300 align:middle line:84%
Number three, the
presence of the holy ones.

01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, the presence of the
holy ones, number three

01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:05.860 align:middle line:90%
is in service of number two.

01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:09.370 align:middle line:90%


01:06:09.370 --> 01:06:11.980 align:middle line:84%
The presence of the
holy ones will give you

01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:15.370 align:middle line:84%
the blessings, the light,
the awareness, the energy,

01:06:15.370 --> 01:06:23.210 align:middle line:84%
the shaktipat to have that
awareness of who you are.

01:06:23.210 --> 01:06:27.580 align:middle line:84%
That's why we're
here, is to wake up.

01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:29.770 align:middle line:90%
That's our purpose.

01:06:29.770 --> 01:06:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And so whether that is done as a
window washer, or a mail clerk,

01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:42.400 align:middle line:84%
or the CEO of a company, or
the president of a country,

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:47.830 align:middle line:84%
or a waitress, that's
not what's important.

01:06:47.830 --> 01:06:51.160 align:middle line:84%
But because we've got
these frames, that

01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:54.940 align:middle line:84%
have said that somehow my
purpose must be inextricably

01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:59.050 align:middle line:84%
linked with my job, we've
gotten ourselves really stuck.

01:06:59.050 --> 01:07:01.510 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:03.700 align:middle line:84%
So even if we take it
to the individual level.

01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:07.990 align:middle line:84%
So, OK, all of our collective
purpose is to wake up

01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:10.840 align:middle line:84%
and to know who
we are, the truth

01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:16.180 align:middle line:84%
of our divinity, collective
purpose, universal purpose you

01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:18.070 align:middle line:90%
can say.

01:07:18.070 --> 01:07:23.290 align:middle line:84%
But then each of us, of course,
has our own individual Dharma,

01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:29.050 align:middle line:84%
we would say, path, purpose,
individually here on Earth,

01:07:29.050 --> 01:07:33.910 align:middle line:84%
that is dictated in many
ways by our skill sets,

01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:36.340 align:middle line:84%
by the opportunities
that we've been given,

01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:38.830 align:middle line:84%
by the family of origin
we've been born into.

01:07:38.830 --> 01:07:41.740 align:middle line:84%
Our whole karmic
package is there

01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:45.590 align:middle line:84%
for us to fulfill
our unique Dharma.

01:07:45.590 --> 01:07:48.490 align:middle line:90%


01:07:48.490 --> 01:07:51.450 align:middle line:84%
But, A, it's not
always romantic.

01:07:51.450 --> 01:07:52.740 align:middle line:90%
B, it's not always fun.

01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:54.990 align:middle line:84%
C, it's not always
extraordinary.

01:07:54.990 --> 01:08:00.380 align:middle line:84%
D, it's not always
going to be paid for.

01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:04.300 align:middle line:84%
So if you think,
for example, about--

01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:06.610 align:middle line:84%
in India, you drive
down the street.

01:08:06.610 --> 01:08:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And still to this
day on highways,

01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:14.350 align:middle line:84%
you'll see poor people on the
side of the road hammering

01:08:14.350 --> 01:08:17.859 align:middle line:84%
large rocks into small rocks,
smaller rocks into tiny rocks,

01:08:17.859 --> 01:08:19.790 align:middle line:84%
ultimately into
gravel whether that's

01:08:19.790 --> 01:08:21.760 align:middle line:90%
going to become the road--

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:26.330 align:middle line:90%
that is plastered onto the road.

01:08:26.330 --> 01:08:27.640 align:middle line:90%
And it's still done manually.

01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:30.970 align:middle line:84%
You've got men and
women with hammers.

01:08:30.970 --> 01:08:36.340 align:middle line:84%
So really that guy or
that lady came onto Earth

01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:39.770 align:middle line:90%
to be a roadside rock hammerer?

01:08:39.770 --> 01:08:41.020 align:middle line:90%
No, that's not a purpose.

01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:43.359 align:middle line:90%
That's not a Dharma.

01:08:43.359 --> 01:08:49.420 align:middle line:84%
But if this guy gets it into his
head, oh, my god, what's my--

01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:55.700 align:middle line:84%
what's my purpose, he's
going to be all confused.

01:08:55.700 --> 01:09:00.319 align:middle line:90%
And why is he hammering rocks?

01:09:00.319 --> 01:09:03.649 align:middle line:84%
Because he's got
to feed his family.

01:09:03.649 --> 01:09:05.479 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the
only way he's got,

01:09:05.479 --> 01:09:11.210 align:middle line:84%
with zero education, zero
training, zero opportunity,

01:09:11.210 --> 01:09:14.069 align:middle line:84%
to put food on the table
to feed his family.

01:09:14.069 --> 01:09:17.060 align:middle line:90%
And why is he working overtime?

01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Because he wants to send
his daughter to school,

01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:25.050 align:middle line:84%
because nobody in their village
has ever educated a girl child.

01:09:25.050 --> 01:09:27.510 align:middle line:84%
But this guy, for
whatever reason,

01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:31.640 align:middle line:84%
has decided his daughter
is going to school.

01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:33.260 align:middle line:84%
She's not going to
beg on the road.

01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:35.000 align:middle line:90%
She's not going to hammer rocks.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.200 align:middle line:90%
She's going to go to school.

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:39.306 align:middle line:90%
So he's going to work overtime.

01:09:39.306 --> 01:09:42.779 align:middle line:90%


01:09:42.779 --> 01:09:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Being the guy who's the
first man in the village

01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:52.380 align:middle line:84%
to send his daughter to
school, that's his Dharma.

01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:56.340 align:middle line:84%
That's his purpose, to
bring about now a wave

01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:57.750 align:middle line:90%
that he may not even know about.

01:09:57.750 --> 01:10:00.330 align:middle line:90%


01:10:00.330 --> 01:10:01.590 align:middle line:90%
Because it's not a nice life.

01:10:01.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:middle line:84%
You don't have a real
long life expectancy

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.460 align:middle line:90%
when that's how you live.

01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:08.400 align:middle line:84%
So maybe he doesn't
live very long.

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:11.520 align:middle line:90%
Maybe he moves to another slum.

01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he has no idea now that
other men have started sending

01:10:18.090 --> 01:10:20.370 align:middle line:90%
their daughters to school.

01:10:20.370 --> 01:10:25.038 align:middle line:84%
So he may not even be
there to have any idea.

01:10:25.038 --> 01:10:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And he's not moving
through the world

01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:27.870 align:middle line:90%
thinking this is my Dharma.

01:10:27.870 --> 01:10:30.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be the
guy in the village.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.200 align:middle line:84%
He just knows, I've got to
send my daughter to school.

01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:37.260 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
hammer those rocks.

01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's important to realize
because if he were looking

01:10:40.530 --> 01:10:45.910 align:middle line:84%
for his purpose in the
hammering of the rocks,

01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:48.070 align:middle line:90%
he'd be very frustrated.

01:10:48.070 --> 01:10:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And so in the same way, if
we are looking for our job

01:10:51.550 --> 01:10:56.340 align:middle line:84%
to be the fulfillment
of our purpose,

01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:58.320 align:middle line:84%
some people may be very
blessed, very lucky.

01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.120 align:middle line:90%
Great.

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:00.960 align:middle line:84%
When they overlap,
nothing like it.

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:03.630 align:middle line:84%
But if they don't, don't
want it, maybe your purpose

01:11:03.630 --> 01:11:06.330 align:middle line:84%
is to make beautiful music,
to make beautiful art,

01:11:06.330 --> 01:11:08.250 align:middle line:90%
to write beautiful poems.

01:11:08.250 --> 01:11:13.840 align:middle line:84%
But maybe at this moment
people aren't buying them.

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:16.260 align:middle line:84%
OK, but that doesn't mean
it's not your purpose.

01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:18.030 align:middle line:84%
But what it may
mean is, you better

01:11:18.030 --> 01:11:20.850 align:middle line:84%
get a job as a waiter, or a
waitress, or a gas station

01:11:20.850 --> 01:11:22.860 align:middle line:84%
attendant, or whatever
it is, so that you've

01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:24.690 align:middle line:90%
got food on the table.

01:11:24.690 --> 01:11:27.710 align:middle line:90%
And don't feel badly.

01:11:27.710 --> 01:11:30.480 align:middle line:84%
Don't feel like somehow
that's beneath your purpose.

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Because if you've
got a job that's

01:11:31.970 --> 01:11:34.040 align:middle line:84%
putting food on the
table and giving you

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:41.410 align:middle line:84%
the free time that you
need to create the music,

01:11:41.410 --> 01:11:44.680 align:middle line:84%
to create the art
that is your purpose,

01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:48.040 align:middle line:84%
so that you can give
it away, so that you

01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:53.350 align:middle line:84%
don't have to create art that's
in line with what sellable,

01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:56.230 align:middle line:84%
so that you actually can
create the art of your heart

01:11:56.230 --> 01:11:58.177 align:middle line:84%
and give it away if
nobody wants to buy it--

01:11:58.177 --> 01:12:00.760 align:middle line:84%
because, see, you got this job
as a waitress or a receptionist

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:01.560 align:middle line:90%
over here.

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:03.790 align:middle line:90%


01:12:03.790 --> 01:12:06.910 align:middle line:90%
Nothing wrong with that.

01:12:06.910 --> 01:12:10.180 align:middle line:84%
But we're indoctrinating
people to believe, oh,

01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:12.280 align:middle line:84%
being that waitress is
beneath you because see

01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:17.650 align:middle line:84%
your purpose is to be the
artist or the musician.

01:12:17.650 --> 01:12:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And if it's really your
purpose, it'll pay.

01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And so either people give it
up because they tried for years

01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:26.050 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't pay.

01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:27.675 align:middle line:84%
And then they decide,
well, it must not

01:12:27.675 --> 01:12:30.640 align:middle line:84%
be my purpose, which is
a tragedy because it's

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:35.890 align:middle line:84%
depriving the world of
that art, of that music.

01:12:35.890 --> 01:12:41.420 align:middle line:84%
Or they continue to
starve because it

01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:45.230 align:middle line:84%
feels beneath them to take a
job that isn't their purpose.

01:12:45.230 --> 01:12:48.930 align:middle line:90%


01:12:48.930 --> 01:12:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And that is where
we get really stuck.

01:12:52.350 --> 01:12:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And so highest core level, your
purpose is just to wake up.

01:12:59.190 --> 01:13:05.160 align:middle line:84%
On an individual level,
do not expect that

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:09.930 align:middle line:84%
how you put food on
the table is supposed

01:13:09.930 --> 01:13:15.840 align:middle line:84%
to be the embodiment of
your Dharma, your purpose,

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:19.030 align:middle line:90%
your highest calling.

01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:25.710 align:middle line:84%
But also don't expect that that
highest calling is always fun.

01:13:25.710 --> 01:13:31.860 align:middle line:84%
Two quick examples on that,
one, a story and one scripture.

01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:34.395 align:middle line:90%
So the story is a saint.

01:13:34.395 --> 01:13:37.880 align:middle line:84%
A holy man is
bathing in the river.

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And there's a scorpion
drowning in the river.

01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And the holy man picks up
the scorpion to save it,

01:13:43.710 --> 01:13:47.520 align:middle line:84%
and put it on the edge of the
river so it doesn't drown.

01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:50.880 align:middle line:84%
And as he picks it up,
the scorpion stings him.

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:53.160 align:middle line:90%
And he flings his arm in pain.

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And the scorpion drops
back down into the water.

01:13:57.540 --> 01:13:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And the man goes to pick it
up again because again it

01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:01.710 align:middle line:90%
starts to drown.

01:14:01.710 --> 01:14:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And again, as he picks it,
up the scorpion stings it.

01:14:04.290 --> 01:14:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And again, he howls in
pain and flings his hand.

01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And the scorpion
falls in the water.

01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And this drama goes
on for several times.

01:14:13.850 --> 01:14:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And a guy on the shore,
watching this whole episode,

01:14:17.550 --> 01:14:21.790 align:middle line:84%
says to the holy
man, Baba, forget it.

01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:22.590 align:middle line:90%
Let it drown.

01:14:22.590 --> 01:14:23.390 align:middle line:90%
It's a scorpion.

01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:26.510 align:middle line:90%


01:14:26.510 --> 01:14:29.420 align:middle line:84%
It's going to just
keep stinging you.

01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And the saints says, it
stings me because to sting

01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:35.930 align:middle line:90%
is its Dharma.

01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:40.020 align:middle line:84%
I save him because
to save is my Dharma.

01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And if he's not leaving
his Dharma, why should

01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:43.280 align:middle line:90%
I leave mine?

01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:47.040 align:middle line:90%


01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:49.710 align:middle line:90%
So it doesn't always feel good.

01:14:49.710 --> 01:14:51.900 align:middle line:90%
It's not always fun.

01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:56.130 align:middle line:90%
It's not always appreciated.

01:14:56.130 --> 01:14:58.130 align:middle line:90%
But it's our Dharma.

01:14:58.130 --> 01:15:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And the last piece on this
is from the "Bhagavad Gita,"

01:15:02.870 --> 01:15:09.530 align:middle line:84%
in which Lord Krishna is
explaining to Arjuna why

01:15:09.530 --> 01:15:13.340 align:middle line:90%
he has to fight this battle.

01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:17.990 align:middle line:84%
The "Bhagavad Gita"
begins with Arjuna saying,

01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:21.920 align:middle line:84%
I see my family members on the
other side of this battlefield.

01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:23.420 align:middle line:90%
Forget it.

01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:26.510 align:middle line:90%
Let them keep all the land.

01:15:26.510 --> 01:15:27.863 align:middle line:90%
Forget it.

01:15:27.863 --> 01:15:28.780 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to fight.

01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:31.630 align:middle line:90%


01:15:31.630 --> 01:15:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And Lord Krishna says to
him basically, not so fast.

01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:37.480 align:middle line:90%
This is your Dharma.

01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:38.550 align:middle line:90%
It's not about land.

01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:39.520 align:middle line:90%
It's not about a war.

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:42.370 align:middle line:84%
It's about restoring
Dharma, restoring

01:15:42.370 --> 01:15:46.030 align:middle line:84%
integrity,
righteousness, in a land

01:15:46.030 --> 01:15:51.850 align:middle line:84%
where unrighteousness,
darkness, has taken over.

01:15:51.850 --> 01:15:56.140 align:middle line:84%
This battle must be
fought to restore Dharma.

01:15:56.140 --> 01:16:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And you are the guy whose Dharma
it is to fight this battle.

01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:03.580 align:middle line:90%
And I'm god.

01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:04.570 align:middle line:90%
So I'm telling you so.

01:16:04.570 --> 01:16:07.450 align:middle line:90%


01:16:07.450 --> 01:16:10.960 align:middle line:84%
Didn't feel good,
wasn't romantic,

01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:14.590 align:middle line:84%
wasn't fun, wasn't
what he wanted to do,

01:16:14.590 --> 01:16:20.420 align:middle line:84%
wasn't appreciated,
but was his Dharma.

01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is really
important because that's

01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:27.640 align:middle line:84%
the New Age media
paints purpose, Dharma,

01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:30.850 align:middle line:84%
as though somehow you're
going to find yourself

01:16:30.850 --> 01:16:35.440 align:middle line:84%
on the cover of a magazine,
when you figure out

01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:36.785 align:middle line:90%
what your purpose is.

01:16:36.785 --> 01:16:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And you actually live
it and fulfill it

01:16:38.410 --> 01:16:41.230 align:middle line:84%
because you're going
to be the most famous

01:16:41.230 --> 01:16:47.320 align:middle line:84%
that, the best this, the
richest that, the newest this.

01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:49.360 align:middle line:90%
Maybe sometimes.

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:54.700 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some people, maybe
that's some people's Dharma.

01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:58.630 align:middle line:84%
But it's not--
not most people's.

01:16:58.630 --> 01:17:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And to really stay rooted
in, not the romance, not

01:17:05.410 --> 01:17:10.000 align:middle line:84%
the grandeur, not what's going
to feel good in the moment,

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:16.150 align:middle line:84%
but what's in alignment
with the core of who I am.

01:17:16.150 --> 01:17:21.850 align:middle line:84%
Not what my Facebook feed
tells me I should be,

01:17:21.850 --> 01:17:27.700 align:middle line:84%
not what the paid advertisements
for self-development courses

01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:30.340 align:middle line:84%
that are trying to sell me
something are telling me

01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:32.170 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't be.

01:17:32.170 --> 01:17:38.765 align:middle line:84%
But actually my core truth,
what is in alignment with that.

01:17:38.765 --> 01:17:41.620 align:middle line:90%


01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:43.780 align:middle line:90%
And to move forward with that.

01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And when we know who we are
we will know what to do.

01:17:47.470 --> 01:17:50.890 align:middle line:84%
The problem these days is,
we have no idea who we are.

01:17:50.890 --> 01:17:53.020 align:middle line:90%
So we have no idea what to do.

01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying to
make our identities.

01:17:56.770 --> 01:17:59.020 align:middle line:90%
We do it the opposite now.

01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:02.290 align:middle line:84%
We do something because our
Facebook feed says we should,

01:18:02.290 --> 01:18:05.470 align:middle line:84%
or the guy next door is, or the
lady in the cubicle over there

01:18:05.470 --> 01:18:08.620 align:middle line:84%
is, or somebody has
told me I should.

01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And then we base
an identity on it.

01:18:11.710 --> 01:18:13.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you do that.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.480 align:middle line:90%
Therefore, you are this person.

01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:20.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's why
we're miserable.

01:18:20.050 --> 01:18:23.180 align:middle line:84%
First, we need to
figure out who I am?

01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:25.850 align:middle line:90%


01:18:25.850 --> 01:18:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And again, I'm consciousness,
and truth, and love,

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:31.640 align:middle line:90%
and divinity.

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:34.720 align:middle line:84%
So at the core, the
most important aspect

01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:39.490 align:middle line:84%
is how do I move through
the world as that?

01:18:39.490 --> 01:18:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And then, OK, what
is my unique way

01:18:42.730 --> 01:18:45.010 align:middle line:90%
that that's going to manifest?

01:18:45.010 --> 01:18:48.220 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I'm a school teacher.

01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:51.310 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'm the waitress, who
serves up smiles with muffins,

01:18:51.310 --> 01:18:52.540 align:middle line:90%
whatever I may be.

01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:58.490 align:middle line:90%


01:18:58.490 --> 01:19:04.550 align:middle line:84%
But that is all in the service
of that higher purpose, which

01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:05.930 align:middle line:90%
is to wake up.

01:19:05.930 --> 01:19:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And so not to get bogged down
in the title, in the prestige,

01:19:11.930 --> 01:19:12.930 align:middle line:90%
in the trappings.

01:19:12.930 --> 01:19:15.830 align:middle line:90%


01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:19.400 align:middle line:84%
But to just keep
staying rooted in,

01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:23.780 align:middle line:84%
is this an expression of
my highest truth, which

01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:31.370 align:middle line:84%
is love, which is light, which
is divinity, which is oneness?

01:19:31.370 --> 01:19:34.250 align:middle line:84%
Is this an expression
of that which

01:19:34.250 --> 01:19:43.920 align:middle line:84%
is sacred to me, my unique
expression of truth,

01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:47.100 align:middle line:84%
love, divinity,
sacredness here on Earth?

01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And if it is,
that's your purpose.

01:19:50.930 --> 01:19:53.450 align:middle line:90%
That's your Dharma.

01:19:53.450 --> 01:19:56.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

01:19:56.260 --> 01:19:58.550 align:middle line:84%
You've answered
all my questions.

01:19:58.550 --> 01:20:01.010 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to finish on
service and purpose.

01:20:01.010 --> 01:20:03.470 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:07.550 align:middle line:84%
So because we finished there,
I think we're finished.

01:20:07.550 --> 01:20:10.220 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for your time.

01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:11.180 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate that.

01:20:11.180 --> 01:20:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And that was a deeply
enlightening conversation.

01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:19.008 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very grateful
for the work that you do

01:20:19.008 --> 01:20:20.300 align:middle line:90%
and the service that you offer.

01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:23.300 align:middle line:90%
