00:00:06.112 --> 00:00:08.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi, it's James here from
"Food Matters" and today,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.940 align:middle line:90%
we have an extra special guest.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.590 align:middle line:84%
His name is Lewis
Howes, and he's

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.573 align:middle line:84%
gone from not getting
his goal to achieving

00:00:14.573 --> 00:00:16.990 align:middle line:84%
a goal and a level of greatness
that you could hardly ever

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.790 align:middle line:90%
imagine.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And he is now inspiring
hundreds of thousands

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.750 align:middle line:84%
of people around the globe,
if not millions every month,

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.850 align:middle line:84%
through his podcasts
helping them achieve

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.810 align:middle line:90%
their own level of greatness.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:27.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Lewis, how you doing?

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Doing well, man.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:29.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.180 align:middle line:90%
Nice to chat.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, man.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So your story started
out with having this goal

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.040 align:middle line:90%
as a child.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.930 align:middle line:84%
Your father had these
expectations for you.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.370 align:middle line:84%
You had expectations
for yourself,

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.650 align:middle line:84%
and you worked, you
were like nearly got it

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.020 align:middle line:84%
and then, boom,
something happened.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.130 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about what that was like
going through that experience

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.210 align:middle line:84%
and ending up really living
with your sister for a while.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I mean, for me the
whole dream was always to be

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.940 align:middle line:84%
a professional athlete,
but originally,

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.070 align:middle line:84%
it was an All-American
athlete in college,

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.800 align:middle line:84%
just cause when I was a kid, I
was watching sports with my dad

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.400 align:middle line:84%
on the couch and we would
watch the Ohio State Buckeyes,

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.860 align:middle line:84%
and we'd see these All-Americans
who were the greatest

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.277 align:middle line:84%
in the country and I said,
well, that's what I want to be.

00:01:08.277 --> 00:01:10.550 align:middle line:84%
I want to be one of the
greatest in the country.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
dream, and I actually

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.270 align:middle line:84%
achieved that dream of being
an All-American in two sports

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.770 align:middle line:84%
but then, ultimately,
it's the goal,

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.600 align:middle line:84%
get paid to do what
you love, and that

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.000 align:middle line:84%
was to be a professional
football player.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.380 align:middle line:84%
I did it for a little
bit until I got injured.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.590 align:middle line:84%
I broke my wrist right
here-- you can see the scar--

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.195 align:middle line:84%
diving into a wall playing arena
football, and snapped my wrist.

00:01:31.195 --> 00:01:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And so over the next
year and a half,

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.690 align:middle line:84%
I was on my sister's
couch six months

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.990 align:middle line:84%
in a full-arm cast
just like this,

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.480 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't have a
college degree at the time.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.850 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really go to
school to learn anything

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.510 align:middle line:84%
except for to play sports, so
I didn't have any other skills.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:52.690 align:middle line:84%
This was in the height of the
economic challenge in the US

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.560 align:middle line:84%
in 2008, 2009, where people with
degrees weren't getting jobs

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.040 align:middle line:84%
and so for me, I really
didn't know what to do next.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.120 align:middle line:84%
My whole identity was wrapped
around in being an athlete

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.880 align:middle line:84%
and now, I couldn't
do that anymore.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.210 align:middle line:84%
So I had some
challenging moments

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.960 align:middle line:84%
for that year and a half living
for free at my sister's house,

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.170 align:middle line:84%
eating her food for free,
just trying to survive,

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.710 align:middle line:84%
but what I started to do
was reach out to mentors.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.720 align:middle line:84%
As an athlete, I
had great coaches

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.670 align:middle line:84%
who helped me become
a better athlete,

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.130 align:middle line:84%
so I said how can I
transition and learn

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.550 align:middle line:84%
from great mentors, great
coaches in life or in business

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.800 align:middle line:84%
to see how I can apply
those same principles

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.250 align:middle line:84%
to my next chapter, to
my next season of life?

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.390 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I did.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.330 align:middle line:84%
I just started reaching
out to mentors,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.530 align:middle line:84%
learning information,
trying to consume as much

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.460 align:middle line:84%
as I could, and figure out
what I wanted to do next.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.040 align:middle line:84%
>> How challenging was it
for you to have a goal that

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.930 align:middle line:84%
you'd set and worked so hard
for and even to sort of impress

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.290 align:middle line:84%
your father, in a way, to have
to let that go and to have

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.330 align:middle line:90%
to go, I can't do that anymore?

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.940 align:middle line:84%
>> It's really challenging
when you lose your identity,

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.160 align:middle line:90%
especially as an athlete.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.335 align:middle line:84%
This is the way you've been
praised your entire life.

00:03:06.335 --> 00:03:08.710 align:middle line:84%
This is the way you've been
acknowledged your entire life

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.730 align:middle line:84%
as being this good or great
athlete known for this one

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.270 align:middle line:90%
thing that you can do.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.660 align:middle line:84%
So when you can no
longer do the one thing

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.630 align:middle line:84%
that everyone praises you
and acknowledges you for,

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.830 align:middle line:84%
then you don't get
acknowledgment anymore.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.920 align:middle line:84%
You have to figure
out, well, who am I?

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.750 align:middle line:84%
What type of
character do I have?

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.360 align:middle line:90%
What type of energy do I have?

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.740 align:middle line:90%
What's my purpose?

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.900 align:middle line:84%
What's my mission
beyond this one identity

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.290 align:middle line:90%
that I don't have anymore?

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.890 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it was
extremely depressing

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.180 align:middle line:84%
for many months, one,
because I was injured.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.640 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like I went
out on my own terms.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.980 align:middle line:84%
I went out on an injury, so it
was extremely depressing just--

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.017 align:middle line:84%
you lose-- your
friends no longer

00:03:50.017 --> 00:03:51.850 align:middle line:84%
want to hang out with
you because you're not

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.020 align:middle line:90%
into it anymore.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.030 align:middle line:84%
You're not getting acknowledged,
so I'm just thinking, well,

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.780 align:middle line:90%
what--

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:56.510 align:middle line:90%
who am I?

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:57.310 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.120 align:middle line:90%
What's my purpose?

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's the challenge, just
rediscovering and reinventing

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.500 align:middle line:90%
my purpose once I lost my dream.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.000 align:middle line:84%
So I think it takes--
that's why you

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.370 align:middle line:84%
see a lot of professional
athletes struggle,

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.370 align:middle line:84%
even if they were at the top
of the game, made millions,

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.460 align:middle line:84%
you see when they retire, it's
like they lose their identity

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.520 align:middle line:84%
and some of them go on down
the road of drugs, depression,

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.320 align:middle line:90%
suicide.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.720 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
challenges that happen,

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.220 align:middle line:84%
even with some of
the biggest stars,

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.990 align:middle line:84%
because they're tied into their
identity of their one skill,

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.715 align:middle line:84%
not who they are
as a human being.

00:04:30.715 --> 00:04:33.340 align:middle line:84%
So I had to learn about just how
to become a better human being

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.070 align:middle line:84%
and not rely on my
athletic abilities.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So take your story a
little bit further for us.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.810 align:middle line:84%
So you went from this place
to being on the couch,

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.150 align:middle line:84%
to being a little bit of
an internet entrepreneur,

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.150 align:middle line:84%
then to figuring out that
helping people discover

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.430 align:middle line:84%
their own greatness is
really your calling.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.200 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about how
that story evolved

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.700 align:middle line:84%
and give me a little bit of a
snapshot of some of the things

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.570 align:middle line:84%
that you're doing
today in the podcast.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, early on, I just wanted
to make enough money to get off

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.790 align:middle line:84%
my sister's couch, so
it was survival mode.

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.500 align:middle line:84%
Like how can I learn this
online marketing stuff

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.540 align:middle line:84%
so I can make enough to find
an apartment and pay for rent?

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.850 align:middle line:90%
And I did that.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.510 align:middle line:84%
I got an apartment
for $495 and it

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.870 align:middle line:84%
felt like I was finally a
grown human being, right?

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:16.950 align:middle line:90%
I could afford things.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.920 align:middle line:84%
I could pay my bills,
and then I just

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.080 align:middle line:84%
said, how can I earn as
much money as possible

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.300 align:middle line:84%
so I never have to
go back to the couch,

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.360 align:middle line:84%
so I can get out of
this tiny apartment?

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And I became obsessed
with learning

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.810 align:middle line:84%
about how to build a
business and earning

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.090 align:middle line:90%
as much money as possible.

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.480 align:middle line:84%
I did that for a couple of
years and pretty quickly,

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.340 align:middle line:84%
started to make seven
figures in my business.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.070 align:middle line:84%
But what I realized
is I was more focused

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.620 align:middle line:84%
on money over impact,
or over things

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.090 align:middle line:90%
that really fulfilled me.

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.970 align:middle line:84%
It was helping me get out
of this survival mode, which

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.950 align:middle line:84%
was great, but
then I said, well,

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.630 align:middle line:90%
what is it I really want to do?

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.110 align:middle line:84%
If I could do
anything in my life,

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.490 align:middle line:84%
if I could live a more
purposeful, meaningful life

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.470 align:middle line:84%
and really do something
that I dream about,

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:59.670 align:middle line:90%
what would that be?

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I've always
been fascinated by people

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.800 align:middle line:84%
and understanding human
beings and interviewing them,

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.990 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't really
have a platform before.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.830 align:middle line:84%
So now I said, OK,
I've got the resources.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:09.630 align:middle line:90%
I've got the money.

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.810 align:middle line:84%
I've got about four or five
years of business experience

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.430 align:middle line:84%
of online marketing,
let me go do

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.525 align:middle line:84%
the thing I really want to do
which was interview people.

00:06:17.525 --> 00:06:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And I started this
podcast called

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.420 align:middle line:84%
"The School of
Greatness" because I

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.610 align:middle line:84%
said to myself, so
many things that I wish

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.500 align:middle line:90%
I would've learned in school--

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.330 align:middle line:84%
I felt like the
education system the way

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.850 align:middle line:84%
I was raised in it
was broken for me.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.770 align:middle line:84%
I was always in the
special needs classes.

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:32.760 align:middle line:90%
I was dyslexic.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.630 align:middle line:84%
It was hard for me to
understand to read and write,

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.295 align:middle line:84%
and I just felt so insecure
my entire childhood,

00:06:38.295 --> 00:06:40.920 align:middle line:84%
and that's why I got into sports
because it gave me confidence.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.230 align:middle line:84%
It was something
I could do well.

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:46.050 align:middle line:84%
So I said, man, I
wish I could ask

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.047 align:middle line:84%
people who have done incredible
things in sports and business

00:06:49.047 --> 00:06:51.630 align:middle line:84%
and science, I wish I could ask
them the things about how they

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.530 align:middle line:84%
got to where they
are, and I wish

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.905 align:middle line:84%
that's the stuff I would
have learned growing up.

00:06:55.905 --> 00:06:57.280 align:middle line:84%
So I said, I'm
going to go create

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.760 align:middle line:84%
the thing that I wish
I could listen to

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.330 align:middle line:90%
and that's what I did.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.950 align:middle line:84%
I started this journey
with this podcast.

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:06.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, five years
later, interviewed

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.550 align:middle line:84%
over 600 people, some of the
top in the world of what they

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:13.590 align:middle line:84%
do in business, sports, science,
and it's been incredible just

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.130 align:middle line:84%
to learn the principles
that people have applied

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.040 align:middle line:84%
to their life on how
they've overcome challenges

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.500 align:middle line:84%
and how they've
achieved their dreams.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.380 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted to pull
out those little nuggets

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.660 align:middle line:84%
of information that people
could lean on and use

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.100 align:middle line:84%
in their own life and it's
been an incredible journey.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell me about who your top
10, top 15 people you have--

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:35.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my gosh.

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:38.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, every time I get
to connect with athletes,

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.500 align:middle line:84%
it's always a pleasure
of mine, so when

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.500 align:middle line:84%
I had Novak Djokovic on,
he was incredibly inspiring

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:48.360 align:middle line:84%
about his story, living through
the wars in his country.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.898 align:middle line:84%
Maria Sharapova, I had Ray
Lewis, Super Bowl champion.

00:07:52.898 --> 00:07:55.440 align:middle line:84%
So those are great, when I get
the best athletes in the world

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.580 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.880 align:middle line:90%
Some of the pop stars--

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:06.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm a big fan of Krewella,
the duo singing sisters.

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:07.650 align:middle line:90%
I really like them.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:11.310 align:middle line:84%
I really like J Balvin, I
really like Tim Ferriss,

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:14.423 align:middle line:90%
Liz Gilbert, Scooter Braun.

00:08:14.423 --> 00:08:16.090 align:middle line:84%
There's just been
some incredible people

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:17.335 align:middle line:90%
I've got to connect with.

00:08:17.335 --> 00:08:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:21.300 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to talk
about now is really

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.780 align:middle line:84%
transitioning a little
bit more to goal setting,

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.660 align:middle line:84%
and I want to focus on that
for a second because you talk

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:31.200 align:middle line:84%
a lot about goal setting in
your podcast, in your work,

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.929 align:middle line:90%
and "School of Greatness" book.

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that I wanted to touch on,

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:39.270 align:middle line:84%
first of all, is that
around goal setting,

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:40.799 align:middle line:84%
do you think that
a lot of people

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:43.409 align:middle line:84%
are setting goals
based on the culture,

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:45.450 align:middle line:84%
based on what other
people's goals are?

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:48.150 align:middle line:84%
Because I find that
so many people end up

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:51.457 align:middle line:84%
living their lives attaining
one goal and then they get it,

00:08:51.457 --> 00:08:53.040 align:middle line:84%
and they're like,
hang on, actually, I

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:53.957 align:middle line:90%
didn't want this goal.

00:08:53.957 --> 00:08:58.590 align:middle line:84%
What have I done spending my
whole life doing this activity?

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.900 align:middle line:84%
How do people know if
their goals are authentic,

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:05.430 align:middle line:84%
and what's your process around
helping people set goals?

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>> I think a lot of people
set goals based on what

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.890 align:middle line:84%
their family or their
peers want them to do,

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:15.390 align:middle line:84%
and that's good if it's
also what you want to do.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:17.180 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of times
people chase things

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.930 align:middle line:84%
that they don't fully
love, and so they're

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:20.095 align:middle line:90%
living someone else's life.

00:09:20.095 --> 00:09:21.720 align:middle line:84%
So I think you got
to figure out what's

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.470 align:middle line:90%
the thing that I want to do?

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:27.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, one of the biggest
regrets of the dying, those

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:28.830 align:middle line:84%
that are about to
die, they said they

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:31.680 align:middle line:84%
wish they would have
lived life on their terms

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.740 align:middle line:84%
and done more what
they wanted to do,

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.750 align:middle line:84%
not what other people
want them to do.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:40.140 align:middle line:84%
You live a healthier life when
you do things you want to do,

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.580 align:middle line:84%
and so I think you
got to discover

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.997 align:middle line:84%
what are the things that brings
you the most joy, the most

00:09:43.997 --> 00:09:46.860 align:middle line:84%
passion, the most fulfillment,
the most meaning, because life

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.895 align:middle line:84%
is about living a meaningful
life, not someone else's

00:09:49.895 --> 00:09:51.270 align:middle line:84%
meaning, but what's
your meaning.

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:52.860 align:middle line:84%
This is your
journey to discover,

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.820 align:middle line:90%
not someone else's journey.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, I was
blessed to always

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.170 align:middle line:84%
have parents that were
supportive of my dreams,

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.240 align:middle line:84%
said if you want to be
a professional athlete,

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.590 align:middle line:90%
we support it.

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:07.050 align:middle line:84%
They didn't push it
on me, necessarily.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:09.750 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
I was driven by.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.400 align:middle line:90%
Luckily, I had that opportunity.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.510 align:middle line:90%
Most people don't have that.

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think you really
got to figure out

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.790 align:middle line:84%
what brings you the
most joy and why do you

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:19.440 align:middle line:90%
want to do these things?

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.060 align:middle line:84%
The why is the most
important thing.

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:23.610 align:middle line:84%
Am I doing it for
superficial reasons?

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:25.290 align:middle line:84%
Then it's not going
to be fulfilling.

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.960 align:middle line:84%
Am I doing it because I want
to live a life of impact

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.700 align:middle line:90%
and meaning and service?

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.950 align:middle line:84%
That's where we get our
greatest fulfillment, when

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:35.220 align:middle line:84%
we serve humanity in some
way, through our mission,

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.183 align:middle line:84%
through our purpose,
through our dreams.

00:10:37.183 --> 00:10:39.600 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's first getting
clear on what is my mission?

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And we all have a
different season

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:42.930 align:middle line:90%
of life with different missions.

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:44.430 align:middle line:84%
When I was in high
school, I just

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:46.175 align:middle line:84%
wanted to be a
college All-American

00:10:46.175 --> 00:10:47.550 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to
be a pro athlete.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:49.680 align:middle line:84%
That's all I cared
about, and maybe have

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.090 align:middle line:90%
a couple of girls talk to me.

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:53.040 align:middle line:90%
That was my dream, right?

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.200 align:middle line:84%
After that was over, I
had to reinvent myself.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:55.500 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:56.470 align:middle line:90%
What do I want?

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:58.950 align:middle line:84%
What's the purpose of my life
for this season of my life?

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:01.345 align:middle line:84%
Well, I want to get
off my sister's couch.

00:11:01.345 --> 00:11:02.220 align:middle line:90%
I want to make money.

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:06.660 align:middle line:84%
I want to build a business
and learn this part of life.

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:08.970 align:middle line:84%
Once I did that and I made
a few million dollars,

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:11.580 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, that's really
not the most fulfilling thing

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:12.840 align:middle line:90%
that I want anymore.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.880 align:middle line:84%
Money is cool, but
it wasn't everything.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.160 align:middle line:84%
So I said, what
do I really want,

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.680 align:middle line:90%
if I could do anything I want?

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:23.800 align:middle line:84%
I said, I want to impact
100 million lives.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:24.600 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.070 align:middle line:90%
Why do I want to do this?

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:29.688 align:middle line:90%
Why do I want to impact people?

00:11:29.688 --> 00:11:31.230 align:middle line:84%
For me, it was really
saying you know

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:35.400 align:middle line:84%
what, at the end of the day,
all the money in the world,

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't get to take
it with me, but if I

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.950 align:middle line:84%
can impact 100 million people
to help them improve their life,

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.620 align:middle line:84%
to help them live a life
with meaning, of purpose,

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.210 align:middle line:84%
then I felt like that would
be a fulfilling life for me.

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:47.010 align:middle line:90%
My dream.

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:50.430 align:middle line:84%
It may not be someone else's
dream, but it would be for me.

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:53.897 align:middle line:84%
So that's the season of the
life that I'm in right now,

00:11:53.897 --> 00:11:55.980 align:middle line:84%
and that's where I feel
like it brings me the most

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:58.440 align:middle line:84%
fulfillment, the most joy,
the most passion, the most

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:03.197 align:middle line:84%
energy, so I lean into the
thing that gives me that fuel.

00:12:03.197 --> 00:12:05.280 align:middle line:84%
So I think all of us get
to think about well, what

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.950 align:middle line:84%
is the thing that brings us
the most joy, the most passion,

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:09.930 align:middle line:90%
the most excitement for life?

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:13.110 align:middle line:84%
Because that is going
to fuel our actions when

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:16.500 align:middle line:84%
we go through adversity,
challenges, struggles,

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.690 align:middle line:84%
stress, depression,
because we're all

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:20.550 align:middle line:90%
going to face challenges.

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:22.680 align:middle line:84%
So what's the fuel
that's going to get us

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.690 align:middle line:84%
through those
challenges of life?

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think our
why and our vision

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.040 align:middle line:90%
support us in having that fuel.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.150 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Great tie together
with the goal and fuel,

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:35.490 align:middle line:84%
because I think it's
going to change, too,

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:36.907 align:middle line:84%
like you said, the
season of life,

00:12:36.907 --> 00:12:39.480 align:middle line:84%
like you and I might just
want to be watercolor painters

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.650 align:middle line:90%
in like 15 years' time--

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:40.710 align:middle line:90%
>> That's it.

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:42.377 align:middle line:84%
>> --and we got to
make peace with that.

00:12:42.377 --> 00:12:43.304 align:middle line:90%
>> That's it.

00:12:43.304 --> 00:12:44.250 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:45.820 align:middle line:84%
>> It's an interesting
transition to think about

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.940 align:middle line:84%
saying, well, hey, now, I've got
this now and I'm driven by this

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:50.010 align:middle line:84%
mission, but like I've got to
be open to the fact that maybe

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:52.010 align:middle line:84%
in 15 years' time, I just
want to do watercolor.

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:53.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, or surf all day.

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:54.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Or surf all day.

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.432 align:middle line:84%
But then, again, I
think you touched

00:12:56.432 --> 00:12:58.140 align:middle line:84%
on having an element
of service gives you

00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.848 align:middle line:84%
that sense of fulfillment,
which gives it

00:12:59.848 --> 00:13:01.250 align:middle line:90%
a sense of energy and passion.

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:02.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:03.547 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the
things around goals,

00:13:03.547 --> 00:13:05.760 align:middle line:84%
which I think is really
important to consider here,

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.310 align:middle line:84%
is that people are
driven by pleasure,

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:10.450 align:middle line:84%
and they're driven
by pain or fear.

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:12.390 align:middle line:90%
But a lot of people pick--

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:14.380 align:middle line:84%
like, when they think
about their goals,

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.020 align:middle line:84%
they get fearful about,
well, if I don't achieve it,

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be ridiculed
or if I don't get this,

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:19.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be--

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:20.700 align:middle line:84%
and then you get
all this pressure

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.500 align:middle line:84%
from people like the
big man, Tony Robbins,

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.330 align:middle line:84%
and even yourself,
you're like, you've

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.260 align:middle line:90%
got to set unrealistic goals.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And I get that and I
love it, but people

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.630 align:middle line:84%
get scared about that because
they get scared of failure.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:30.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you help people
approach fear in their lives

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:36.990 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to goal setting
and setting out on a big

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:39.420 align:middle line:90%
venture?

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:42.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me let me address
something first before that.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:49.420 align:middle line:84%
I used to-- in my
first half of my life,

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.170 align:middle line:84%
I really was
committed to my dreams

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.180 align:middle line:90%
in order to prove people wrong.

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:56.670 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be a professional
athlete because people

00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:00.390 align:middle line:84%
said I couldn't do it, because
kids picked on me, because I

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:02.775 align:middle line:84%
was picked last on
the dodgeball game,

00:14:02.775 --> 00:14:04.650 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't have
many friends growing up

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:05.940 align:middle line:90%
in elementary school.

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:09.180 align:middle line:84%
So I said, I'm going to
do this to prove everyone

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:16.290 align:middle line:84%
wrong about me and to prove
to them how good I am,

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:17.825 align:middle line:90%
whatever it is.

00:14:17.825 --> 00:14:19.200 align:middle line:84%
So for the first
half of my life,

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:24.060 align:middle line:84%
I was driven by a negative
fuel around this goal,

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:28.110 align:middle line:84%
and that negative drive was so
powerful that it allowed me--

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:30.180 align:middle line:90%
it helped me to achieve my goal.

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.170 align:middle line:90%
I was so focused.

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:34.080 align:middle line:84%
I knew exactly what I wanted,
but the energy behind it

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.010 align:middle line:90%
was negative.

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:39.220 align:middle line:84%
It was to prove five people
wrong who doubted me.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And so when I
achieved my goal, I

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.580 align:middle line:84%
remember feeling
so empty inside.

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.380 align:middle line:90%
It's like, OK, I had the goal.

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.310 align:middle line:90%
I had the structure.

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:49.685 align:middle line:84%
I had the game plan, the daily
actions, all the things we

00:14:49.685 --> 00:14:51.780 align:middle line:90%
talked about and it happened.

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.040 align:middle line:90%
Why am I still not happy?

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.150 align:middle line:90%
Why am I unfulfilled?

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:59.010 align:middle line:84%
Why was I actually angrier after
I achieved it than ever before?

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:01.870 align:middle line:84%
I was so disciplined
for 15 years of my life,

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:05.230 align:middle line:84%
and now I got exactly what
I wanted and I wasn't happy.

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And I reflected on this and
said, well, maybe my goal

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.740 align:middle line:90%
is just not big enough.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:10.720 align:middle line:84%
I need to go after
a bigger goal,

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.590 align:middle line:84%
and so I kept going after these
unrealistic goals in business

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:17.100 align:middle line:84%
and life and I kept
achieving them,

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.140 align:middle line:84%
but it was all based
on this negative fuel

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:20.700 align:middle line:90%
of proving people wrong.

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And when I realized
I hit 30 years old

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:25.830 align:middle line:84%
and I realized I was a "New
York Times" best seller,

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:28.800 align:middle line:84%
I was building this massive
business, building an audience,

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.560 align:middle line:84%
and nothing was working no
matter how big of the goal.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.630 align:middle line:84%
I still wasn't
happy and I realized

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:35.682 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to prove
people wrong still.

00:15:35.682 --> 00:15:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
shifted to saying

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.265 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to try to
prove people wrong anymore.

00:15:39.265 --> 00:15:41.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to try to lift
others up and prove people

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.730 align:middle line:84%
right and live a life of
service and impact people,

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:47.818 align:middle line:84%
and that's when I felt at
peace about my goal setting.

00:15:47.818 --> 00:15:49.860 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's something
important to talk about

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.860 align:middle line:84%
is like are you
setting goals to prove

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:55.110 align:middle line:84%
your parents wrong
or your friends wrong

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:57.833 align:middle line:84%
or other people wrong
who doubted you?

00:15:57.833 --> 00:15:59.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't think
that's a healthy way

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:01.500 align:middle line:84%
to set goals, so first
be clear on why you're

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.750 align:middle line:84%
setting your goals
and make sure it's

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.617 align:middle line:90%
a reason around fulfillment.

00:16:05.617 --> 00:16:07.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, the second thing
you talked about

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.510 align:middle line:84%
is should we be setting
unrealistic goals?

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:11.430 align:middle line:90%
Was that the question, right?

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:14.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So a lot of the times, people
in the PD space are like, well,

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:16.350 align:middle line:84%
you've got to set
a personal goal.

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:18.683 align:middle line:84%
>> Shoot for the stars and
maybe land on the moon, yeah.

00:16:18.683 --> 00:16:21.147 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, exactly, and a lot of
people can get anxious about

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:23.730 align:middle line:84%
that, or fearful or they doubt
themselves, where they're like,

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:25.950 align:middle line:90%
well, I can't achieve that.

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:27.450 align:middle line:84%
How do people move
beyond that fear?

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>> I think people play
very small in their life,

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.960 align:middle line:84%
and they're not aware of how
powerful they actually are

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.460 align:middle line:84%
and how much they can actually
create or how much they could

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:36.930 align:middle line:90%
achieve in their life.

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:40.500 align:middle line:84%
For example, when I coach
entrepreneurs and I say,

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.850 align:middle line:84%
what is your income
and impact goal?

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:44.600 align:middle line:84%
Because we want it to
be measurable and we

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.870 align:middle line:84%
want it to be in
a specific time.

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:47.245 align:middle line:84%
Let's say for the
next 12 months,

00:16:47.245 --> 00:16:49.530 align:middle line:84%
you have an impact
and an income goal.

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:50.682 align:middle line:90%
What is your goal and why?

00:16:50.682 --> 00:16:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times,
they'll tell me

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.390 align:middle line:84%
a number of how many
people they want to impact

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:55.758 align:middle line:90%
and how much they want to make.

00:16:55.758 --> 00:16:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And I say to them,
what would it look

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:01.980 align:middle line:84%
like if you were able to do
that in the next 60 days?

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:03.660 align:middle line:84%
If you could achieve
that big goal

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:08.141 align:middle line:84%
that you set for yourself for
the year, but during 60 days?

00:17:08.141 --> 00:17:09.349 align:middle line:90%
Do you think you could do it?

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:10.780 align:middle line:90%
And they're like well, no.

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:11.822 align:middle line:90%
I never thought about it.

00:17:11.822 --> 00:17:13.589 align:middle line:84%
It just seems like
such a big goal.

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Then I break it
down and I say, OK,

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:17.460 align:middle line:84%
this is going to seem
dramatic, but imagine

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:20.460 align:middle line:84%
I have a gun to your head
and I said in 60 days,

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.510 align:middle line:84%
if you don't make this happen,
I'm going to pull the trigger.

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:25.900 align:middle line:84%
Someone's going to
pull the trigger on you

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:29.850 align:middle line:84%
and everyone you love, could
you achieve that big goal

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:31.010 align:middle line:90%
in 60 days?

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:32.170 align:middle line:90%
And they say, absolutely.

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:32.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:35.760 align:middle line:84%
So why was it so big
in a year that you

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.340 align:middle line:84%
weren't even sure you were about
to make it happen in a year,

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:41.880 align:middle line:84%
but now when something is
on the line, life, something

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.010 align:middle line:84%
you care about, you said
no matter what, you'd

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:45.460 align:middle line:90%
be able to make it happen?

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:46.440 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.562 align:middle line:84%
So what is limiting you from
making it happen sooner?

00:17:49.562 --> 00:17:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And usually, we don't
have enough urgency

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:53.010 align:middle line:84%
and we don't believe
in ourselves enough.

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:56.640 align:middle line:84%
There's a fear of failure,
a fear of looking bad, not

00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.020 align:middle line:84%
having the resources,
something breaking down.

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:02.940 align:middle line:84%
But when we have a sense
of urgency for our life,

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:04.812 align:middle line:84%
we're able to do
incredible things.

00:18:04.812 --> 00:18:06.270 align:middle line:84%
So I think a lot
of people are just

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:09.690 align:middle line:84%
afraid of dreaming
big and going big

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:13.770 align:middle line:84%
because of the fear of
looking bad or failing.

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Instead, I try to shift and say,
let's have a bigger purpose,

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:19.110 align:middle line:90%
like an imagined life is now.

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:21.900 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that you maybe
only have a couple of days,

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.700 align:middle line:84%
a couple of weeks,
a couple of months,

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:25.390 align:middle line:84%
what do you want
to do in your life?

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And when we have more urgency
in our life and we make it more

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:32.580 align:middle line:84%
precious, we're willing
to do things that we've--

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:36.660 align:middle line:84%
fear becomes irrelevant because
we say, this matters now

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.467 align:middle line:90%
and I'm to do whatever it takes.

00:18:38.467 --> 00:18:40.050 align:middle line:84%
So I think when we
shift our mindset--

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:42.330 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just constantly
trying to evoke that out

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:45.160 align:middle line:84%
of other people and
in myself and say,

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.130 align:middle line:90%
why am I waiting for two years?

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Why can't I do
this in two months?

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:51.570 align:middle line:84%
Why can't I do
this in six months?

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Who cares if I've never
done something before.

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:56.192 align:middle line:84%
Why can't I learn it and come
from a different perspective?

00:18:56.192 --> 00:18:57.900 align:middle line:84%
Even if I don't have
years of experience,

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.790 align:middle line:90%
why can't I do this?

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:02.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that's
what pulls people back

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:05.880 align:middle line:84%
is this thinking
that we have forever,

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.740 align:middle line:84%
thinking that
they're not capable,

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.050 align:middle line:84%
they don't have the
resources or the time,

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:13.310 align:middle line:84%
but really, they just need
to shift their urgency

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:18.430 align:middle line:90%
and know that they are capable.

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:19.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:19.800 align:middle line:90%
Very inspirational.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, how does
it work, though,

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:24.670 align:middle line:84%
if people want to set a
goal that doesn't seem big,

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:26.460 align:middle line:90%
but if people want to do--

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.640 align:middle line:84%
like I've met a very
dynamic group of people,

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.770 align:middle line:84%
and just recently
as one example,

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:34.860 align:middle line:84%
my family has moved
into a remote island

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:36.380 align:middle line:90%
in the Pacific called Vanuatu--

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.730 align:middle line:84%
a cyclone or a typhoon
just passed through there,

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:40.022 align:middle line:90%
the other night, everyone's OK.

00:19:40.022 --> 00:19:40.945 align:middle line:90%
It's all good.

00:19:40.945 --> 00:19:42.570 align:middle line:84%
But there's a gentleman
on that island.

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:43.642 align:middle line:90%
He's a gay artist.

00:19:43.642 --> 00:19:45.100 align:middle line:84%
He's a Polynesian
gentleman married

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.160 align:middle line:90%
to a Russian ex-diplomat.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.680 align:middle line:84%
Aloi Pilioko-- eccentric,
as you can imagine.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.680 align:middle line:84%
Paints his car,
his wine glasses,

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:52.680 align:middle line:90%
everything in his house.

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.650 align:middle line:84%
It's like living in a museum
and he's an amazing painter

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:59.280 align:middle line:84%
and he's had exhibitions in
Paris, and all over the world.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.580 align:middle line:84%
But his goal seems
small, I just want paint.

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:03.990 align:middle line:90%
I just want to paint.

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:05.660 align:middle line:84%
How do you approach
people, because I'm

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:07.070 align:middle line:84%
trying to land the plane
on this a little bit

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.910 align:middle line:90%
for everyday people.

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:09.500 align:middle line:84%
There's people that are
A players that are like,

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.270 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I want to take on the
world, yes, I want to do this.

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:12.238 align:middle line:90%
I just want to achieve.

00:20:12.238 --> 00:20:14.030 align:middle line:84%
What if we've got
someone listening to this

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:15.155 align:middle line:90%
and is like, you know what?

00:20:15.155 --> 00:20:16.580 align:middle line:84%
I just want to be
an awesome mum,

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:19.770 align:middle line:84%
or I just want to be
an artist and paint,

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:21.770 align:middle line:84%
and I don't care if my
work's successful or not,

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:23.193 align:middle line:90%
I just want to paint.

00:20:23.193 --> 00:20:25.610 align:middle line:84%
How do you sort of approach
that in terms of goal setting?

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:26.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:28.675 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I never want
to make anyone wrong

00:20:28.675 --> 00:20:30.800 align:middle line:84%
if they want to do something
with their life that's

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.700 align:middle line:84%
not like save the world or cure
cancer or whatever it may be,

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:34.500 align:middle line:90%
that's OK.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.950 align:middle line:84%
But I think you just
got to think about,

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:41.300 align:middle line:84%
how do I want my life to
look like when I'm gone?

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:44.330 align:middle line:84%
Am I going to have any regrets
if I didn't go do that thing,

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:48.340 align:middle line:84%
whether it be chase that studio
that I wanted to paint in

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.440 align:middle line:84%
or I wanted to go start
my company or leave my job

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.750 align:middle line:84%
and do something on the
side or whatever it may be,

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:55.540 align:middle line:84%
are you going to
have any regrets?

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And I just try to think of
my life like if I don't go

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:01.280 align:middle line:84%
do this thing, will I
regret it when I'm dying?

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:05.360 align:middle line:84%
If I live to 100 and beyond
will I regret not going for it?

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And for me, actually, the
goal of achieving goals

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:10.640 align:middle line:90%
is not what's important for me.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.350 align:middle line:84%
I want to make the
Olympics still.

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:14.600 align:middle line:84%
I want to impact
100 million people,

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.730 align:middle line:84%
but if I don't achieve
them, I'm going

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:19.190 align:middle line:84%
to be 100% at peace
because I know

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:22.070 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to go all
in in my effort to trying

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:23.665 align:middle line:90%
to make it happen.

00:21:23.665 --> 00:21:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And if I look back at the
end of the day, I'll say,

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:26.690 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:29.210 align:middle line:84%
You gave everything and
that's what matters to me.

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:30.770 align:middle line:84%
It's not actually
achieving the goal,

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:33.830 align:middle line:84%
it's the pursuit of saying
at least I went for it.

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:35.540 align:middle line:90%
At least I tried my best.

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:39.110 align:middle line:84%
At least I did whatever it
took, and I might have failed,

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:40.370 align:middle line:90%
but I went for it.

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:41.870 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's
just more of saying,

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:43.640 align:middle line:84%
how do you want
your life to look?

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.170 align:middle line:84%
If you want to be
the mom of three

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.600 align:middle line:84%
and raise incredible
human beings that

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:51.980 align:middle line:84%
change the world or that
live a great life, awesome.

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.660 align:middle line:84%
If that makes you
happy and you feel

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:57.673 align:middle line:84%
fulfilled in that
life's mission, awesome.

00:21:57.673 --> 00:21:59.090 align:middle line:84%
But I think ask
yourself, is there

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:03.780 align:middle line:84%
anything deep inside that
I would like to go after

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:06.020 align:middle line:84%
and am I holding
back on that dream?

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:09.550 align:middle line:84%
If so, then I think you're
letting yourself down

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:11.330 align:middle line:84%
and you're letting
the world down,

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:14.260 align:middle line:84%
because you have an incredible
gift to share with the world

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.580 align:middle line:84%
and if you're just
going to hoard your gift

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:19.670 align:middle line:84%
and not share it, then I
think that's a disservice

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:21.905 align:middle line:90%
to humanity.

00:22:21.905 --> 00:22:23.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Beautiful and I
couldn't agree more.

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:25.590 align:middle line:84%
There's people harboring
incredible talent.

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Incredible talents.

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:29.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And ability to serve and
this film's a lot about helping

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.190 align:middle line:84%
to unlock people's
capability and potential.

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think if you just
don't want to do something

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:36.838 align:middle line:84%
because you don't care
about it, that's fine,

00:22:36.838 --> 00:22:38.630 align:middle line:84%
but if you care deeply
about it, but you're

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:42.620 align:middle line:84%
afraid to put yourself out
there, then that's the crime.

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:44.555 align:middle line:84%
So don't be afraid to
put yourself out there

00:22:44.555 --> 00:22:45.680 align:middle line:90%
or at least give it a shot.

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:47.442 align:middle line:90%
Who cares if it fails?

00:22:47.442 --> 00:22:48.650 align:middle line:90%
At least you're going for it.

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:52.320 align:middle line:84%
At least you're living
your life by example.

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:56.150 align:middle line:84%
You're teaching your kids, your
family members that, hey, mommy

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:59.090 align:middle line:84%
is scared of starting
this thing on the side,

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:00.980 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to do it
anyways because that's

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:01.950 align:middle line:90%
what I believe in.

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:04.460 align:middle line:84%
I believe in teaching
you kids this process,

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:07.160 align:middle line:84%
as well, that, hey, you should
go after the things you love.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.140 align:middle line:84%
Fight for the things
you dream about.

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:10.160 align:middle line:90%
Who cares if you fail?

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.240 align:middle line:90%
At least you did it.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.790 align:middle line:84%
At least you went
for it and that's

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:15.270 align:middle line:90%
a beautiful part of life.

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:18.470 align:middle line:84%
So I think if you don't have
that dream of doing something,

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:19.690 align:middle line:90%
it's all good.

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:22.540 align:middle line:84%
Just you raise your kids and
be the best parents you can be,

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:26.010 align:middle line:84%
and that's an amazing
human being, as well.

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:29.540 align:middle line:84%
You know, the parent that goes
after their dreams and neglects

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:33.200 align:middle line:84%
their kids is probably
not the best example, so

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.380 align:middle line:90%
how can you do it all?

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:35.760 align:middle line:90%
That's what's beautiful.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:36.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.990 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk a little
bit about visualization

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:41.277 align:middle line:84%
now, because I know
that a lot of the guests

00:23:41.277 --> 00:23:42.860 align:middle line:84%
that you probably
have in your podcast

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:44.400 align:middle line:84%
and even you in your
own personal life

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.025 align:middle line:84%
probably use these
tools, I'm guessing,

00:23:46.025 --> 00:23:47.570 align:middle line:84%
but I want to hear
from you on it.

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And mental rehearsal
is an important skill

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:52.840 align:middle line:84%
that so many people
use, and I think

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.880 align:middle line:84%
about Novak building
an imaginary trophy

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:58.115 align:middle line:84%
at a young age of six,
imagining winning Wimbledon

00:23:58.115 --> 00:23:59.657 align:middle line:84%
and becoming number
one in the world.

00:23:59.657 --> 00:24:02.540 align:middle line:84%
This is like an impossible
dream for somebody in Serbia

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:05.070 align:middle line:84%
at that time, and then
doing it on the same day.

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:05.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Crazy.

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:06.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Like there is no--

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:07.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Crazy.

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.700 align:middle line:90%
>> You can't even make that up.

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>> That's insane.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:13.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So do you believe in the
power of visualization and/or

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:16.070 align:middle line:90%
mental rehearsal or manifesting?

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:18.530 align:middle line:84%
How do you apply it and have
you seen people apply it?

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:20.988 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't think you can achieve
anything without seeing it

00:24:20.988 --> 00:24:23.540 align:middle line:84%
first and experiencing it
first within our minds.

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:27.620 align:middle line:84%
From my experience, everything
I've done, all my dreams,

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:31.250 align:middle line:84%
I dreamed about and experienced
vividly before they happened,

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:36.950 align:middle line:84%
so I just don't many people
who have won the Super

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:40.020 align:middle line:84%
Bowl without thinking about it
and experiencing themselves.

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:41.840 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they thought
it was a long shot,

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.670 align:middle line:84%
but they still dreamed about it
and saw themselves in the game,

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:48.180 align:middle line:84%
catching the ball, throwing
the pass, whatever it may be,

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:50.030 align:middle line:84%
so I think you have
to do that in order

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:53.720 align:middle line:84%
to be able to achieve such
extraordinary dreams that

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.750 align:middle line:90%
are so unlikely.

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:58.760 align:middle line:84%
I started doing this
at a very young age

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:02.180 align:middle line:84%
because I was always
alone, so I imagined myself

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:05.110 align:middle line:84%
doing things with other
people, playing sports

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:06.310 align:middle line:90%
and I would always dream.

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And then when I
got to college, I

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:12.360 align:middle line:84%
felt like I started to master
this process, especially

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.860 align:middle line:90%
in the decathlon.

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:16.440 align:middle line:84%
I remember taking
on the decathlon

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:19.170 align:middle line:84%
and I had six months to
train for the decathlon

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:20.730 align:middle line:84%
before the national
championships.

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:23.220 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be an
All-American decathlete.

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And my coach said, you
need to do everything

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:26.820 align:middle line:84%
I tell you to do for
the next six months

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:28.488 align:middle line:90%
if you want a chance.

00:25:28.488 --> 00:25:30.030 align:middle line:84%
I had never done
the decathlon before

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:31.822 align:middle line:84%
and there were many
events that I had never

00:25:31.822 --> 00:25:34.975 align:middle line:84%
competed in, the pole vault, the
javelin, the discus, the shot

00:25:34.975 --> 00:25:38.460 align:middle line:84%
put, the 110 high hurdles, all
very technical events that I

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:40.690 align:middle line:90%
had to learn how to master.

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:45.210 align:middle line:84%
I would watch game
film an hour before I

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:48.390 align:middle line:84%
went to bed every single
night of the top pole vaulters

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:51.900 align:middle line:84%
in the world and I would
just watch this in my bed

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:54.630 align:middle line:84%
and I would imagine myself
and go through the motions

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:57.210 align:middle line:84%
as they were putting
the pole into the box,

00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:59.460 align:middle line:84%
driving their knee
up, going upside down,

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:01.830 align:middle line:84%
inverting and
flipping over the bar.

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:06.000 align:middle line:84%
I would in my bed watch it
and then mimic it myself

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.880 align:middle line:84%
and just repeat the pattern
over and over again,

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.640 align:middle line:84%
so that when I went to
sleep, I was imagining myself

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.860 align:middle line:84%
as the top pole
vaulter in the world

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:16.620 align:middle line:84%
and going through
repetition after repetition.

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Then the next morning, I
would go to practice and apply

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.950 align:middle line:84%
what I visualized and
practiced in my mind,

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:24.510 align:middle line:84%
and I would do
this over and over

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:26.940 align:middle line:84%
and over again on
every different event,

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:30.420 align:middle line:84%
so I could see myself as one
of the best in the world.

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And little by
little I got better,

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:35.730 align:middle line:84%
and I made it to the
national championships

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:38.550 align:middle line:84%
and I made All-American by
being one of the top eight

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:40.390 align:middle line:90%
decathletes in the country.

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And I know for a fact, there's
no way I would have been able

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:46.470 align:middle line:84%
to overcome the
challenges, the stress,

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:49.920 align:middle line:84%
and the adversity of the entire
season-- it was so taxing--

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.630 align:middle line:84%
without having
the mental clarity

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:54.690 align:middle line:90%
of seeing the results first.

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:57.080 align:middle line:84%
I wanted them, but I
want to believe in myself

00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:59.580 align:middle line:84%
because I would have never have
seen it happening in my mind

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:00.600 align:middle line:90%
first.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.780 align:middle line:84%
So I think we have to
do some type of practice

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:08.190 align:middle line:84%
in imagining what it could
be like feeling the feelings,

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:09.780 align:middle line:84%
whether it be
launching that business

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:11.905 align:middle line:84%
and having a team that
we're talking to, whether it

00:27:11.905 --> 00:27:14.650 align:middle line:84%
be playing a sport,
whether it be having

00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:18.120 align:middle line:84%
the partner of your
dreams, imagining what

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.370 align:middle line:84%
that person looks
like when you wake up

00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:22.800 align:middle line:84%
and you see them
smiling back at you.

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.860 align:middle line:84%
The feeling you have of
the joy, or the passion,

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:27.520 align:middle line:84%
and the love that you've
never felt in your life.

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.420 align:middle line:84%
If you can't imagine
it, you're going

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:31.390 align:middle line:90%
to get the scraps of life.

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:34.230 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get what's
left over from everyone else's

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:37.560 align:middle line:84%
dreams, so you must
imagine exactly what

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:42.030 align:middle line:84%
you want if you want to
have exactly what you want.

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:44.702 align:middle line:84%
>> Listen, we touched on this
a little bit before around

00:27:44.702 --> 00:27:47.160 align:middle line:84%
fulfillment, but I want to take
a little bit of a different

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.618 align:middle line:84%
angle on it, if you'll follow
me on this for a second here.

00:27:49.618 --> 00:27:50.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Happiness is something
that's seemingly eluding a lot

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.970 align:middle line:84%
of people, and there's multiple
reasons for it, I'm sure.

00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:59.225 align:middle line:84%
There's nutritional
deficiencies,

00:27:59.225 --> 00:28:00.100 align:middle line:90%
which is a big thing.

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you don't
feed your brain,

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:02.580 align:middle line:90%
it's very difficult to be happy.

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:03.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:05.850 align:middle line:84%
>> There's also people not
following their passion,

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:09.150 align:middle line:84%
living someone else's dream, or
doing something that they think

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:10.800 align:middle line:84%
they're meant to be doing, but
they're not really meant to be

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:11.040 align:middle line:90%
doing.

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.960 align:middle line:84%
There's so many different
ways to skin this,

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.160 align:middle line:84%
but we've got more
people than ever

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.490 align:middle line:90%
before taking antidepressants.

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:16.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:19.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's a big deal, and so
far we help people a lot with

00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:24.510 align:middle line:84%
nutrition, but if you had
to take your knowledge

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:27.540 align:middle line:84%
of everything you've had today
in this space of helping people

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:32.400 align:middle line:84%
become great and try to distill
what makes people happy and how

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.650 align:middle line:84%
people can achieve
happiness in their life,

00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:37.110 align:middle line:90%
how would you approach that?

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:40.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I think Tony Robbins said
that success is a science

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:46.470 align:middle line:84%
and fulfillment is an art,
and Robin Williams is a great

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:47.750 align:middle line:90%
example of that.

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Here's arguably
one of the funniest

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.510 align:middle line:84%
people in the world
who brought so much joy

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:54.730 align:middle line:84%
and happiness to people, but
he wasn't happy with himself.

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:57.267 align:middle line:84%
There was something
darker deep with inside,

00:28:57.267 --> 00:28:59.100 align:middle line:84%
but he learned how to
be successful and make

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:01.142 align:middle line:84%
other people happy, but
he couldn't figure it out

00:29:01.142 --> 00:29:04.410 align:middle line:84%
for himself until he
had committed suicide.

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And what I learned early on
when I was on my sister's couch,

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:15.200 align:middle line:84%
I was eating so much
crap food and for me, I

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.838 align:middle line:84%
remember thinking first, I
need to master my nutrition.

00:29:17.838 --> 00:29:19.380 align:middle line:84%
I was having so much
junk food, but I

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:20.640 align:middle line:90%
didn't understand anything.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:24.210 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that eating
pizza and pasta all day

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:27.000 align:middle line:84%
long was not good for my
brain or my happiness.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.420 align:middle line:84%
Short-term happiness,
yes, long-term, no.

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And when I shifted
my nutrition, I

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:35.100 align:middle line:84%
felt that it was an
automatic sense of my body,

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:36.480 align:middle line:90%
my chemistry changed.

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:39.280 align:middle line:84%
I felt happier just by
the things that I ate

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.608 align:middle line:84%
and when I became aware
of what to put in my body.

00:29:41.608 --> 00:29:43.275 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
for me was nutrition.

00:29:43.275 --> 00:29:45.020 align:middle line:84%
It was getting
clear on how can I--

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:47.040 align:middle line:84%
they used to call me
"Flewis" for fat Lewis

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:50.350 align:middle line:84%
because I got so big after
I got done playing sports

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:53.450 align:middle line:84%
because I was eating
so much, I didn't care,

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:55.080 align:middle line:84%
because in sports,
I could burn it off,

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:57.120 align:middle line:84%
but now I'm not
playing anymore and I'm

00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.310 align:middle line:90%
feeling lethargic and slow.

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:01.200 align:middle line:84%
So nutrition for me was
the number one thing.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:05.220 align:middle line:84%
When I got my nutrition down,
I had this positive fuel

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:07.470 align:middle line:84%
and energy that I
could run through life

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:08.730 align:middle line:90%
and not be exhausted.

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:11.460 align:middle line:84%
The second thing was
my thoughts and ideas.

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:13.410 align:middle line:84%
If I'm thinking a lot
of negative things

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:17.220 align:middle line:84%
and having negative thoughts,
holding onto grudges,

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:20.080 align:middle line:84%
getting defensive, I'm
not going to be happy.

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:22.650 align:middle line:84%
So I had to learn my
emotional fitness next.

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:24.480 align:middle line:84%
First was the physical
fitness, nutrition,

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:27.540 align:middle line:84%
then emotional fitness,
and that's a practice.

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:29.790 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a daily
practice for me.

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:32.203 align:middle line:84%
That's why every single
morning I wake up

00:30:32.203 --> 00:30:34.120 align:middle line:84%
and I talk about gratitude
with my girlfriend.

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:36.930 align:middle line:84%
It's our first thing we talk
about what are we grateful for

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:39.330 align:middle line:84%
and what are we excited
about creating today?

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:40.410 align:middle line:90%
Having something to do.

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Having something
we're excited about

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.660 align:middle line:84%
brings us more
happiness and joy.

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:48.390 align:middle line:90%


00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:51.780 align:middle line:84%
Every time someone calls my
cell phone and leaves a message,

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:55.530 align:middle line:84%
on my answering message it
says, before you tell me

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:57.690 align:middle line:84%
what you want, tell me
what you're grateful for.

00:30:57.690 --> 00:31:00.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm always evoking
gratitude out of others.

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And then at night,
I'm writing down

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:03.875 align:middle line:84%
and talking to my
girlfriend about what

00:31:03.875 --> 00:31:05.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm grateful for from the day.

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:10.770 align:middle line:84%
Gratitude for me is the
key to starting and living

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:12.210 align:middle line:90%
a happier life.

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:15.410 align:middle line:84%
Without gratitude, we don't
have a positive perspective.

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:19.050 align:middle line:84%
We're ungrateful and it's
easier for us to be negative.

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:21.480 align:middle line:84%
So we've got the
nutritional side of things,

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.398 align:middle line:84%
then I've got the
emotional health,

00:31:23.398 --> 00:31:25.440 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I really
focus on and after that,

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.060 align:middle line:90%
it's community.

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And when I have
positive relationships,

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:31.210 align:middle line:84%
I feel happier
and more fulfilled

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:33.460 align:middle line:84%
and I feel a deeper
sense of connection.

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:36.180 align:middle line:84%
So those are really the three
things that I tried to master

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:40.050 align:middle line:84%
and continually try to improve
in order to set myself up

00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:42.030 align:middle line:90%
for a happier life.

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Beautiful and gratitude
is such an important point,

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:47.250 align:middle line:90%
and I think it's so underrated.

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:48.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Huge.

00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>> And sometimes, when I--

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:54.480 align:middle line:84%
even moving to Vanuatu recently
and seeing a culture of people

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:56.200 align:middle line:90%
that live day to day--

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>> --just with the food that
they can cut down from a tree

00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:02.430 align:middle line:84%
with a knife and having
simple shelter over themselves

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:05.070 align:middle line:84%
and they're grateful to
God, to their creator,

00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:07.120 align:middle line:84%
to everything for the
opportunity to even exist.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:10.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And they're so happy and
that is just infectious,

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:13.110 align:middle line:84%
and it's like, well, hang on,
I've got all these aspirations

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:14.850 align:middle line:84%
and goals, and I've got to
achieve them first before I can

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:15.930 align:middle line:90%
be happy.

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:17.610 align:middle line:84%
That's a trap and I
see a lot of people

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:18.780 align:middle line:90%
getting caught in that trap.

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:22.507 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I mean, for me, it's
hard to be angry and grateful

00:32:22.507 --> 00:32:24.840 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, and that's
why I think we have to have

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:26.260 align:middle line:90%
perspective in our life.

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:30.030 align:middle line:84%
This is why I live a life to try
to give back as much as I can

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:32.340 align:middle line:84%
to people that don't
have as much as me.

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Every year, we build schools
for kids in Ghana and Guatemala

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.810 align:middle line:84%
and Laos, and every time
I go and visit these kids,

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:41.490 align:middle line:90%
they literally have nothing.

00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:43.080 align:middle line:90%
They don't even have--

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.220 align:middle line:90%
they have food for the day.

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:45.450 align:middle line:90%
They live in a little hut.

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:48.180 align:middle line:84%
They live on the dirt,
but they're so happy

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:50.190 align:middle line:84%
and I'm like, man,
this perspective.

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:52.620 align:middle line:84%
They're so grateful
for the little things.

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:55.830 align:middle line:84%
They're so joyful to have
a community and a family.

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:59.360 align:middle line:84%
They're so grateful that there
is a school to go to now.

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think you go to
these places in the world

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.950 align:middle line:84%
and you come back and drive
through Beverly Hills, one

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:06.870 align:middle line:84%
of the most wealthiest
places in the world,

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:08.370 align:middle line:84%
and you just think
to yourself, man,

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:10.890 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing
to complain about.

00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:15.300 align:middle line:84%
If I focus on perspective, I
have so much good in my life,

00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:18.660 align:middle line:84%
even if it seems stressful
and overwhelming,

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:21.660 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not getting what I want,
or the coffee was too hot today

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:24.330 align:middle line:84%
at Starbucks, look
at perspective

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:26.910 align:middle line:84%
and be grateful that you
have somewhere to go,

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:29.353 align:middle line:84%
that you have a
job to go to, even

00:33:29.353 --> 00:33:31.020 align:middle line:84%
though you're stuck
in traffic, at least

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:32.030 align:middle line:90%
you have somewhere to go.

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:32.830 align:middle line:90%
You have a family.

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:34.770 align:middle line:90%
You have a home to come back to.

00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think when we
reflect on the things

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:40.440 align:middle line:84%
that we are grateful for,
we allow for more things

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:43.740 align:middle line:84%
to be grateful
for into our life.

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So explain to me
your practice again.

00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:47.370 align:middle line:84%
You think about what
you're grateful for.

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:49.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you meditate or do you
do closed-eye stuff or you

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:50.370 align:middle line:90%
journal?

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:52.860 align:middle line:84%
What is the main ways that
you practice gratitude, again,

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:53.860 align:middle line:90%
if you could recap that?

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:57.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah for me, gratitude is
a constant throughout the day,

00:33:57.150 --> 00:33:59.610 align:middle line:84%
so I try to set myself
up with triggers.

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:02.100 align:middle line:84%
In the morning, I talk
about it with my girlfriend

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:04.410 align:middle line:84%
what I'm grateful for,
what she's grateful for,

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:06.620 align:middle line:84%
and what we're excited
about creating that day.

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:11.040 align:middle line:84%
I think having a purpose of what
we're going to do is important.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:13.177 align:middle line:84%
When someone calls
me, I'm invoking it.

00:34:13.177 --> 00:34:14.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying, what are
you grateful for?

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:17.250 align:middle line:84%
Whether they get a call from
me and I don't pick it up,

00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:20.400 align:middle line:84%
it's on my voice message or if
they call me and I do pick up,

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.010 align:middle line:84%
I say, what are
you grateful for?

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'm invoking
it in other people

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:26.310 align:middle line:84%
to get them to think about
perspective, as well.

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:28.449 align:middle line:84%
At night, I journal
it and write it down,

00:34:28.449 --> 00:34:30.989 align:middle line:84%
but I'm also evoking
it from my girlfriend

00:34:30.989 --> 00:34:32.310 align:middle line:90%
and we're talking about it.

00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:34.949 align:middle line:84%
So for me, if I don't do
it throughout the day,

00:34:34.949 --> 00:34:37.650 align:middle line:84%
I can easily go back to
a place of negativity

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:40.620 align:middle line:84%
or a place of I'm not getting
what I want or I'm not happy

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:42.867 align:middle line:90%
or it should be done this way.

00:34:42.867 --> 00:34:44.909 align:middle line:84%
I could easily be one of
the most negative people

00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:47.280 align:middle line:84%
in the world and that's
why I need to set myself up

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.690 align:middle line:90%
with a structure.

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:50.489 align:middle line:84%
Every single
morning, for me, this

00:34:50.489 --> 00:34:52.889 align:middle line:84%
is what's important is
to get a workout in,

00:34:52.889 --> 00:34:55.290 align:middle line:84%
and it changes from day
to day, week to week,

00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:57.840 align:middle line:84%
but do something where I move
my body, because then I'm

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:01.590 align:middle line:84%
moving any negative energy
I have out of my system

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:05.500 align:middle line:84%
and allowing myself to flow
with more positive energy.

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.090 align:middle line:84%
I make my bed every
single morning,

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:10.390 align:middle line:84%
because that's important to have
a clean space mentally, mostly

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:12.040 align:middle line:90%
emotionally and physically.

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And then meditation, I
do about 12 to 15 minutes

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:18.310 align:middle line:84%
where I'm just really focusing
on what my intention is

00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:21.100 align:middle line:84%
for the day and how
I want to show up.

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:23.950 align:middle line:84%
If there is traffic, how
do I want to respond?

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:26.140 align:middle line:84%
If someone says something
nasty to me online,

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:27.970 align:middle line:90%
how am I going to react?

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:30.790 align:middle line:84%
If someone frustrates me,
how do I want to respond?

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:34.720 align:middle line:84%
So for me it's life is
happening around us,

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:37.982 align:middle line:84%
and there's so many chaotic
things that are happening.

00:35:37.982 --> 00:35:39.940 align:middle line:84%
We can't control the
things that are happening.

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:43.330 align:middle line:84%
The only thing we can control is
our response to everything, so

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:44.830 align:middle line:84%
how are we going
to allow everything

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:48.820 align:middle line:84%
to upset us and frustrate us
and control and have power

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:51.370 align:middle line:84%
over our life that
day, or do we want

00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:53.290 align:middle line:84%
to be the authors of
our story that day

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:56.110 align:middle line:84%
and have complete control
of how we respond?

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's why a
morning routine is important

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:01.690 align:middle line:84%
and also an evening
routine is important,

00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:05.830 align:middle line:84%
because when I go to bed
prepared and visualizing

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:08.620 align:middle line:84%
before I sleep of how I
want to live the next day,

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:11.620 align:middle line:84%
I usually wake up
happier than if I just go

00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:14.320 align:middle line:90%
to sleep with nothing in mind.

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:17.450 align:middle line:84%
That's why visualization
is really important.

00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:18.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:19.360 align:middle line:90%
Great tools.

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.860 align:middle line:90%
Great strategies.

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:22.962 align:middle line:84%
So I've got one last
question for you

00:36:22.962 --> 00:36:25.420 align:middle line:84%
here because I think we should
definitely wrap up right now

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:27.370 align:middle line:84%
and the last question is,
imagine you walked out

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:28.870 align:middle line:84%
on this stage and
you're backstage,

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:31.520 align:middle line:84%
maybe you got your
power move, right?

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.893 align:middle line:84%
You're backstage, you're
pumping yourself up,

00:36:33.893 --> 00:36:35.560 align:middle line:84%
and you're about to
walk out and someone

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.102 align:middle line:84%
hands you the
microphone, and they're

00:36:37.102 --> 00:36:39.730 align:middle line:84%
like, Lewis, you've got
the whole world out there

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:43.850 align:middle line:84%
listening, you've got
one minute, two minutes.

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:44.650 align:middle line:90%
Leave your message.

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:45.450 align:middle line:90%
Leave your legacy.

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:46.300 align:middle line:90%
Go for it.

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:47.717 align:middle line:84%
What are you going
to teach today?

00:36:47.717 --> 00:36:49.110 align:middle line:90%
I ask people that question, too.

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:52.000 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's powerful.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.190 align:middle line:84%
So if I got one or two
minutes to share my message

00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:59.560 align:middle line:84%
with the world, I
would say, first off,

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:03.670 align:middle line:84%
that your dreams matter
because you matter,

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:06.580 align:middle line:84%
so follow your dreams because
that's the thing that brings us

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:09.850 align:middle line:84%
the most joy, when we have
something to look forward to.

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:12.550 align:middle line:84%
When we have something
we want to chase,

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:16.000 align:middle line:84%
it gives us a purpose,
a reason, and a meaning

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.270 align:middle line:84%
to get up every single
day and make a difference,

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:22.628 align:middle line:84%
so your dreams matter
because you matter,

00:37:22.628 --> 00:37:23.545 align:middle line:90%
so follow your dreams.

00:37:23.545 --> 00:37:26.350 align:middle line:90%


00:37:26.350 --> 00:37:28.090 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have
your health, you're

00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:30.880 align:middle line:84%
not going to be around long
enough to live your dreams.

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:35.500 align:middle line:84%
Do whatever you can to protect
your physical, emotional, and

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:37.840 align:middle line:90%
mental stability.

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Really master the art
of health in your life

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:43.540 align:middle line:90%
and make it a top priority.

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And the final thing is
if you live your dreams,

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:49.945 align:middle line:84%
you achieve all these
things for yourself,

00:37:49.945 --> 00:37:52.840 align:middle line:84%
and you live a healthy
lifestyle, that's good

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:57.040 align:middle line:84%
and it serves you, but make
sure you live a life of service.

00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:58.960 align:middle line:84%
Give back all the
things you learn,

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:01.000 align:middle line:84%
all the lessons you
learn, teach others

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.640 align:middle line:84%
along the way because you
wouldn't be where you're

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:07.900 align:middle line:84%
at without all the mentors of
the world who guided you, so

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:12.250 align:middle line:84%
make sure you're constantly
living a life of service.

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:13.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect, well said.

00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:14.050 align:middle line:90%
I love it, Lewis.

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:15.520 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:16.590 align:middle line:90%
So you've got this idea.

00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:17.200 align:middle line:90%
You've got this dream.

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:19.690 align:middle line:84%
You got this passion, what do
you need to create around you

00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:20.500 align:middle line:90%
in order to achieve it?

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:22.958 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think in order to
live a happy, meaningful life,

00:38:22.958 --> 00:38:26.200 align:middle line:84%
as well, you want to make sure
you're very picky and choosy

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:30.100 align:middle line:84%
about who you spend your time
with because if someone around

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:33.400 align:middle line:84%
you is constantly negative, it's
hard to be grateful and happy.

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:36.370 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to feel joyful
when someone is constantly

00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:41.120 align:middle line:84%
taking away your joy, so
your tribe, the community

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:43.910 align:middle line:84%
and your mentors, your
coaches, your friends,

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:45.910 align:middle line:84%
they're very important
about who you choose

00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:47.800 align:middle line:90%

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:49.498 align:middle line:84%
There's quotes out
there about, you

00:38:49.498 --> 00:38:51.040 align:middle line:84%
become the average
of the five people

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.570 align:middle line:90%
you spend the most time with.

00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:56.380 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very true
that your happiness is also

00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:59.860 align:middle line:84%
the average of the happiness
of the five people around you.

00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:02.290 align:middle line:84%
If people are not
happy a lot of the time

00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:04.418 align:middle line:84%
and you're spending a
lot of energy with them,

00:39:04.418 --> 00:39:06.210 align:middle line:84%
you're going to pick
up on that negativity.

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:07.700 align:middle line:90%
You're going to feed into it.

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:12.070 align:middle line:84%
So surround yourself with
joyful, purpose-driven

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:14.680 align:middle line:84%
individuals who live
a life of gratitude

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:16.900 align:middle line:84%
and who believe in
the similar things.

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:19.540 align:middle line:84%
That is going to support
you in accelerating

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:21.640 align:middle line:84%
to achieving your
goals and your dreams,

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:25.150 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to bring you more
fulfillment and more energy.

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:27.465 align:middle line:84%
So you get to be conscious
and mindful of saying,

00:39:27.465 --> 00:39:29.840 align:middle line:84%
hey, having those conversations
with your friends saying,

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:32.260 align:middle line:84%
hey, I want to make sure
that we practice gratitude.

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:35.710 align:middle line:84%

we're not gossiping,

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:37.960 align:middle line:84%
not talking negative
about other people,

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:39.820 align:middle line:84%
but we're more inspiring
with each other,

00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:41.710 align:middle line:84%

about bigger ideas,

00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:45.580 align:middle line:84%
and we're acknowledging
each other for our gifts

00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:47.620 align:middle line:84%
and for the small
wins every single day.

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:50.200 align:middle line:84%
We're not comparing
or judging each other.

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:52.780 align:middle line:84%
