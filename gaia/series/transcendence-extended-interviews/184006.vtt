[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:01.992 --> 00:00:13.970 align:middle line:90%


00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.379 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, long time ago.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.800 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the
things that I was

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.660 align:middle line:84%
blessed to have mortality
motivation at a young age.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.910 align:middle line:84%
A 19-year-old kid coming
out of high school in love

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.220 align:middle line:84%
with my high school
sweetheart, we break up

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.210 align:middle line:84%
our first semester in
college, and my whole identity

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.560 align:middle line:90%
was tied up into her.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And so that
relationship fell apart.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.530 align:middle line:90%
I fell apart.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And by the end of my freshman
year in college, I'm suicidal.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.500 align:middle line:90%
And I have just no hope.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.558 align:middle line:84%
I have that moment where
I'm questioning life.

00:00:44.558 --> 00:00:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And then it teeters
on the other side

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.340 align:middle line:90%
of planning to take my life.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.102 align:middle line:84%
And then, fortunately,
marketing changed

00:00:50.102 --> 00:00:52.560 align:middle line:84%
my life, which is kind of a
funny thing to think about now,

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.410 align:middle line:84%
but I was depressed,
and I was laying in bed,

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.190 align:middle line:90%
and I read the school newspaper.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And there was this
big full page ad.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And it had this white
sandy beach, this turquoise

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.620 align:middle line:84%
blue ocean, perfect wisp
of sky, and this palm tree.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And across the top.
it said "escape."

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And when you're miserable,
when you're upset,

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.500 align:middle line:90%
you want to escape.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.100 align:middle line:90%
You want to run.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.670 align:middle line:90%
You want to hide.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.470 align:middle line:90%
You want to avoid.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.580 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I did.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.700 align:middle line:90%
But I saw this.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.900 align:middle line:84%
It said "escape-- summertime
work in the Dominican

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.410 align:middle line:90%
Republic-- students needed."

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.105 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, yeah.

00:01:27.105 --> 00:01:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know where
the Dominican Republic was,

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.160 align:middle line:90%
but I knew she wasn't there.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.108 align:middle line:84%
So I take the job,
go down there.

00:01:33.108 --> 00:01:34.900 align:middle line:84%
I become a glorified
tour guide, basically,

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.730 align:middle line:84%
working for an
entrepreneur down there.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And then one night, returning
from a client's house

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.380 align:middle line:84%
about midnight, my friend
Kevin and I hopped in the car,

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.360 align:middle line:90%
and we started barreling home.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And they just paved this
new road, so a long stretch,

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.570 align:middle line:90%
brand new paved road.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.280 align:middle line:84%
We're flying 85 miles
an hour down the road.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And that was that was where
it began for me, that road.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.060 align:middle line:84%
We're going 85 miles
an hour down this road.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.220 align:middle line:90%
All the windows are down.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.800 align:middle line:84%
That magical Caribbean air
is coming into the car.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.301 align:middle line:90%
I felt something stirring.

00:02:07.301 --> 00:02:08.259 align:middle line:90%
Something was going on.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.842 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
it was at the time.

00:02:09.842 --> 00:02:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Tom Cochrane's
"Life is a Highway"

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.530 align:middle line:84%
is playing on the radio as we're
barreling down this highway.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And then we came upon a corner
that in the United States

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.620 align:middle line:84%
would have had one of those
U-turn-shaped arrow signs,

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.130 align:middle line:84%
watch out, sharp corner
ahead, 15 miles an hour.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.130 align:middle line:84%
Didn't have a sign, so
we rounded that corner

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.490 align:middle line:90%
going 85 miles an hour.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And that was my turning point
because in the next couple

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.407 align:middle line:84%
moments, which
seemed slow motion,

00:02:36.407 --> 00:02:37.990 align:middle line:84%
I learned that at
the end of our life,

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.420 align:middle line:90%
we basically evaluate our life.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.580 align:middle line:84%
When you're sliding
into death's doorway,

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.955 align:middle line:90%
you think about your life.

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And you ask yourself questions
to evaluate whether or not

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.580 align:middle line:90%
you were happy with your life.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.997 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
if at the time it

00:02:48.997 --> 00:02:51.130 align:middle line:84%
was a spiritual thing, a
cognitive thing, or just

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.588 align:middle line:84%
an emotional sense,
but when you're

00:02:52.588 --> 00:02:55.720 align:middle line:84%
crashing into death's doorway,
the first question you ask is,

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.930 align:middle line:90%
did I live?

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Did I live vibrantly and
passionately and joyously?

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.990 align:middle line:90%
Did I live my life?

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Was I alive and
vibrant and here?

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And you want to
know that question.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.810 align:middle line:84%
The car, as it
slid off the road,

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.227 align:middle line:84%
we hit a little
retainer wall that

00:03:13.227 --> 00:03:15.080 align:middle line:90%
used to be an irrigation ditch.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.780 align:middle line:90%
And we popped up in the air.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.830 align:middle line:84%
I smacked my head on the
door, got knocked out.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.910 align:middle line:84%
But I started seeing
all these images

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.350 align:middle line:84%
of these times in my life when
I was around my people I loved--

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.560 align:middle line:84%
family, friends,
moments-- not omniscient,

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.390 align:middle line:84%
but just moments
like I viewed it.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.310 align:middle line:84%
There was my sister
there, and my mom there,

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.260 align:middle line:90%
and my friends there.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And you see these
images of the people you

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.850 align:middle line:90%
love at the end of your life.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And it makes you
ask, did I love?

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.390 align:middle line:84%
Did I love openly and
honestly and completely?

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Or did I shut down because
one time I got hurt,

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.063 align:middle line:90%
which is what happened for me.

00:03:52.063 --> 00:03:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And through that breakup,
my high school sweetheart,

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.090 align:middle line:84%
and I shut my heart down, and
I didn't feel life anymore.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.620 align:middle line:90%
I didn't feel myself.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.400 align:middle line:84%
I didn't sense that broader
range of emotions we all want.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.360 align:middle line:84%
The car hit the ground,
rolled several times.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.560 align:middle line:84%
By the time I came to,
Kevin was screaming

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.642 align:middle line:90%
at the top of his lungs.

00:04:10.642 --> 00:04:11.850 align:middle line:90%
"Brendon, get out of the car!

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:12.230 align:middle line:90%
Get out of the car!

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.830 align:middle line:90%
Get out of the car!"

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.205 align:middle line:84%
And I looked over, and he had
this huge chunk of his head

00:04:15.205 --> 00:04:17.670 align:middle line:84%
was open and there was
blood all over him.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:18.470 align:middle line:90%
And he's screaming.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.130 align:middle line:90%
His eyes are wild.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.670 align:middle line:90%
"Get out of the car!

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:20.120 align:middle line:90%
Get out of the car!

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.920 align:middle line:90%
Get out of the

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And I look at him,
and I'm terrified.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And he crawls
outside the window.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.207 align:middle line:84%
And I go to get outside my
window, but it's smashed.

00:04:27.207 --> 00:04:28.790 align:middle line:84%
The whole car is
smashed on top of me.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And all I have is this
little windshield,

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.460 align:middle line:84%
what used to be the windshield
in front of me, this opening.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And I crawl through
this windshield.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.490 align:middle line:90%
And I pull myself up.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And I stand up on this
crumpled hood of this car.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And I look down, and there's
blood all over my body.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And Kevin's screaming
off to the side.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.222 align:middle line:84%
This terror is going
down through my body,

00:04:48.222 --> 00:04:50.180 align:middle line:84%
realizing that I'm in
trouble because I can see

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.250 align:middle line:90%
all this blood on my body now.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And this wooziness came
over, and I thought

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.120 align:middle line:90%
I was going to pass out.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.860 align:middle line:84%
And I remember looking
down at the hood

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.152 align:middle line:84%
and seeing all my blood come
off of my body on the hood

00:05:00.152 --> 00:05:03.350 align:middle line:84%
of this car, and feeling
like I was going to pass out,

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.760 align:middle line:84%
and looking down, just
thinking, did I even matter?

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.353 align:middle line:90%


00:05:09.353 --> 00:05:10.520 align:middle line:90%
Was there a purpose to this?

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.850 align:middle line:84%
Was there a reason I'd
been through all this?

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.770 align:middle line:90%
And we wonder that.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't like the
answer to that question.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.740 align:middle line:90%
I was a 19-year-old kid.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.435 align:middle line:90%
I've never looked beyond myself.

00:05:19.435 --> 00:05:20.810 align:middle line:84%
I never thought
about the future.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.143 align:middle line:84%
You don't talk about legacy
when you're 19 unless you're

00:05:23.143 --> 00:05:24.340 align:middle line:90%
around some great people.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And I just hadn't been around
that type of folks before.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And so I learned through
this car accident

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.660 align:middle line:84%
that that's what we ask
at the end of our lives.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.740 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
evaluate our lives,

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.990 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to ask these
three specific questions.

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.340 align:middle line:90%
We're going to say, did I live?

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.630 align:middle line:90%
Did I love?

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:38.930 align:middle line:90%
And did I matter?

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.607 align:middle line:90%
And this is 20 years ago for me.

00:05:41.607 --> 00:05:42.940 align:middle line:90%
And so every night, I go to bed.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.350 align:middle line:90%
I say, did I live today?

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:45.580 align:middle line:90%
Did I love today?

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.290 align:middle line:90%
Did I matter today?

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like every
night the answer is yes,

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.100 align:middle line:90%
but most of the nights it is.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.933 align:middle line:84%
And the nights when
it's yes on all of them,

00:05:52.933 --> 00:05:54.753 align:middle line:84%
I sleep the best
because I'm fulfilled.

00:05:54.753 --> 00:05:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm always telling
people, I say, you know what?

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Even if you don't resonate
with those questions,

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.610 align:middle line:84%
they're not exactly yours,
figure out your questions.

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.110 align:middle line:84%
Figure out, at the
end of my life,

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:05.808 align:middle line:90%
how would I evaluate my life?

00:06:05.808 --> 00:06:07.850 align:middle line:84%
What questions would I
ask to know whether or not

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.327 align:middle line:90%
I lived a good life?

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Because if you find out
what those questions are--

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:12.210 align:middle line:90%
just make them up.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.340 align:middle line:84%
Decide, OK, I might
ask, am I a good mom?

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.320 align:middle line:84%
I might ask, did I
follow my passion?

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.050 align:middle line:84%
I might ask, did I honor
the gifts that God gave me?

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Find out what questions
you're going to ask.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And once you know what
those questions are,

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.440 align:middle line:84%
then you can live
each day intentionally

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.536 align:middle line:84%
so you're happy with
the answers at the end.

00:06:28.536 --> 00:06:33.360 align:middle line:90%


00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, asking questions
about your life

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.350 align:middle line:84%
gives you the one thing
we all need more--

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.960 align:middle line:90%
intention and presence.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:40.800 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.560 align:middle line:84%
If you're not asking questions
about where you want to be

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.060 align:middle line:84%
or what you want
experience in life,

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.685 align:middle line:84%
it's just like you
can wake up each day

00:06:46.685 --> 00:06:48.490 align:middle line:84%
and just go through
the motions each day,

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.520 align:middle line:84%
but if you woke
up and said, what

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.760 align:middle line:84%
emotions do I want to experience
today, now you're able to say,

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.600 align:middle line:84%
oh, I want to choose
to experience joy.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.100 align:middle line:84%
I want to choose
to experience love.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.410 align:middle line:84%
I want to choose to experience
fun and passion and excitement

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:03.210 align:middle line:90%
and thrill.

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:04.920 align:middle line:84%
But you can't do
that if you just

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.600 align:middle line:90%
go through the mundane of life.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Life will just serve
you up the mundane.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And you'll start getting
bored with your life.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.517 align:middle line:84%
You'll start feeling
very comfortable.

00:07:12.517 --> 00:07:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And you'll start saying, well,
why am I not experiencing

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:18.210 align:middle line:84%
more of that magic
that I know is in life?

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:19.720 align:middle line:84%
It's because you're
waiting for it.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:20.850 align:middle line:84%
I always tell people
there's only two things that

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:21.960 align:middle line:90%
change your life.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.697 align:middle line:84%
Either, A, something new
comes into your life,

00:07:24.697 --> 00:07:25.530 align:middle line:90%
and that shifts you.

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:26.240 align:middle line:90%
That shakes you.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.720 align:middle line:84%
That makes you a
different person.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:32.630 align:middle line:84%
Or, B, something new
comes from within.

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And intention,
knowing what we want

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.830 align:middle line:84%
to experience during the day,
that gives the power of choice.

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:40.600 align:middle line:84%
It's like Victor
Frankl taught us.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.430 align:middle line:84%
The last of human
freedoms is the ability

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.035 align:middle line:90%
to choose one's own attitude.

00:07:44.035 --> 00:07:45.670 align:middle line:90%
It's choice.

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And from the ability to
focus on a question to say,

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:52.630 align:middle line:84%
OK, did I live today,
that gives you intention.

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:54.187 align:middle line:90%
Am I going to live today?

00:07:54.187 --> 00:07:55.270 align:middle line:90%
Am I really going to live?

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:57.828 align:middle line:84%
Because you work with
people like I who've

00:07:57.828 --> 00:07:59.120 align:middle line:90%
been at the end of their life--

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.370 align:middle line:84%
they're in the last days,
weeks, months of their life,

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:02.537 align:middle line:90%
last moments of their life--

00:08:02.537 --> 00:08:03.900 align:middle line:90%
I've been with hundreds of them.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.540 align:middle line:90%
And they all say the same thing.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.060 align:middle line:90%
They say, I want today.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.160 align:middle line:90%
I want to feel today.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.910 align:middle line:90%
They want to experience the day.

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:12.498 align:middle line:84%
It's not like, I
guess I'll see what

00:08:12.498 --> 00:08:13.790 align:middle line:90%
they're going to serve me here.

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:15.332 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder what's
in the newspaper.

00:08:15.332 --> 00:08:17.600 align:middle line:84%
They're like, I want
to call someone I love.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.340 align:middle line:90%
Could you get my brother?

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.690 align:middle line:90%
Could I talk to this person?

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:21.898 align:middle line:90%
Could you give me some paper?

00:08:21.898 --> 00:08:23.365 align:middle line:84%
I want to write
some things down.

00:08:23.365 --> 00:08:24.740 align:middle line:84%
It's because
they're intentional.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.360 align:middle line:84%
They have what I call
mortality motivation.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.860 align:middle line:84%
They're aware of this
incredible blessing of breath

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:32.370 align:middle line:90%
that we have in the moment.

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:35.400 align:middle line:84%
They're aware that the
next moment might not come.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And because they
have that awareness,

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.030 align:middle line:84%
a new intention comes for
how to be and how to feel

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:42.770 align:middle line:84%
and how to experience
and how to relate.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.187 align:middle line:84%
I tell people all the time,
it's like, if you're not aware

00:08:45.187 --> 00:08:47.412 align:middle line:84%
that that might be
gone, what's going

00:08:47.412 --> 00:08:49.370 align:middle line:84%
to motivate you to bring
something magic to it?

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:50.660 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
mortality motivation

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:54.770 align:middle line:84%
gives us choice, gives
us intention, gives us

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:56.040 align:middle line:90%
those questions.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.100 align:middle line:84%
So it's the simplest
process ever.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.833 align:middle line:84%
Start your day and ask, what
do I want experience today?

00:09:01.833 --> 00:09:04.250 align:middle line:84%
When I take a shower in the
morning, I have this practice.

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:05.840 align:middle line:84%
I ask myself three questions
every single morning

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.640 align:middle line:90%
in the shower.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.270 align:middle line:84%
I ask, first and
foremost, I say,

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:11.530 align:middle line:84%
what today is going
to be incredible?

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:15.090 align:middle line:84%
What can I get excited about
or have enthusiasm about today?

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Number two, what
might trip me up?

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:21.260 align:middle line:84%
What might throw me off my
game, cause stress, bother me?

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.313 align:middle line:84%
Because if I can
anticipate it, then

00:09:23.313 --> 00:09:24.980 align:middle line:84%
I can ready myself
for it and say, well,

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.900 align:middle line:84%
how can my highest self
meet that challenge?

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And then three, what can I do
to surprise somebody today?

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a jokester, so I like
to pull a prank on somebody.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.500 align:middle line:84%
Or I like to send a nice
gift card or surprise

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.497 align:middle line:84%
somebody with a call or
random text or random video.

00:09:39.497 --> 00:09:40.580 align:middle line:90%
Those are my three things.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And starting in those
questions each day--

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:45.230 align:middle line:84%
how can experience enthusiasm or
look forward to something, how

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:47.688 align:middle line:84%
can I deal with something that's
going to make me struggle,

00:09:47.688 --> 00:09:49.270 align:middle line:84%
and how can I
surprise somebody--

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:51.950 align:middle line:84%
I've just primed my whole
day for the emotions

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:54.957 align:middle line:84%
I want to experience, not the
ones that randomness or trouble

00:09:54.957 --> 00:09:55.790 align:middle line:90%
is going to give me.

00:09:55.790 --> 00:10:03.560 align:middle line:90%


00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.553 align:middle line:84%
I've told my car accident
story around the world.

00:10:06.553 --> 00:10:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And people come up to
me all the time and say,

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:09.640 align:middle line:90%
I had an accident.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.810 align:middle line:90%
And it was worse than yours.

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:13.300 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't change.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.260 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:18.078 align:middle line:84%
And I say, I don't know if
you'll like that answer.

00:10:18.078 --> 00:10:19.370 align:middle line:90%
And they say, what do you mean?

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:23.640 align:middle line:84%
I say, because you didn't
demand it of yourself.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And people don't
like that answer.

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:29.810 align:middle line:84%
But, see, meaning just
doesn't happen to us.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:31.150 align:middle line:90%
It can happen unconsciously.

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:33.570 align:middle line:84%
Like, well, I felt something
from that car accident.

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:34.470 align:middle line:90%
No big deal.

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:36.512 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't sit down
and say, you know what?

00:10:36.512 --> 00:10:39.180 align:middle line:84%
I need to associate
a meaning with this.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:43.170 align:middle line:84%
I need to demand that thing
meant something to me.

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:44.960 align:middle line:84%
People don't like
the word "demand,"

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.100 align:middle line:84%
but high performers
use it all the time.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.670 align:middle line:84%
We have external demands,
like competition.

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And we have internal demands,
like standards, goals, values,

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.170 align:middle line:84%
morality that
makes us do things.

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:57.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're not going to draw
any meaning from any given

00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.280 align:middle line:84%
situation in your
life until you say,

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.170 align:middle line:84%
what is the meaning I
want to give to that,

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:03.930 align:middle line:90%
consciously as an adult--

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:06.175 align:middle line:84%
not as a child, when that
thing happened to me; not

00:11:06.175 --> 00:11:07.800 align:middle line:84%
as the victim when
I didn't feel power;

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.020 align:middle line:84%
but now, removed
from the situation.

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.750 align:middle line:84%
I didn't gain a lot of
meaning from my car accident

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:15.270 align:middle line:84%
exactly that night or exactly
those next couple of days.

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:16.380 align:middle line:90%
It was stirring in there.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.860 align:middle line:84%
But I had to go, man,
that shook me up.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.570 align:middle line:90%
What was that about?

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:22.800 align:middle line:90%
What did that mean to me?

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.870 align:middle line:90%
What do I want that to mean?

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:26.817 align:middle line:84%
And then I demanded
myself, sit and write.

00:11:26.817 --> 00:11:28.650 align:middle line:84%
Literally, I sat down,
and I recorded, like,

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:29.880 align:middle line:90%
what do I feel about that?

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:30.880 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.422 align:middle line:84%
What were the emotions
going through?

00:11:32.422 --> 00:11:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And who do I want to
be because of that?

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:35.770 align:middle line:84%
I think the most
important thing is,

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:39.240 align:middle line:84%
when someone has a traumatic
incident, a difficulty,

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.060 align:middle line:84%
a situation they did not
want, life challenges

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:45.360 align:middle line:84%
and punches them in the face
and it puts them down, it's

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.520 align:middle line:84%
to get back up and
say, well, who do I

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.010 align:middle line:90%
want to be because of that?

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:53.310 align:middle line:84%
How do I want to treat other
people because of that?

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:55.890 align:middle line:84%
It's setting an intention
because that thing?

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:57.387 align:middle line:84%
It can have meaning
or not meaning.

00:11:57.387 --> 00:11:58.470 align:middle line:90%
I just say, you know what?

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Life is so short, try and attach
meaning to lots of things.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.660 align:middle line:84%
You walk down the street, and
you see the beautiful flowers.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:04.702 align:middle line:90%
Give it a little meaning.

00:12:04.702 --> 00:12:06.450 align:middle line:84%
Say, gosh, isn't
this so blessing

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:08.490 align:middle line:84%
that this sidewalk has
some flowers on it?

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:10.470 align:middle line:84%
As simple as that is,
but people don't even

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:11.762 align:middle line:90%
do that in their own marriages.

00:12:11.762 --> 00:12:13.220 align:middle line:84%
They don't do that
their own teams.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.610 align:middle line:84%
They don't do
their own business.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:17.600 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of going through
as fast as they possibly can.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.100 align:middle line:84%
I would say it's like it's like
when you watch somebody eat,

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:21.750 align:middle line:84%
especially here in
the United States,

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.300 align:middle line:84%
people are eating like
beasts on the run.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.060 align:middle line:84%
There's no intention
to the meal.

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:27.060 align:middle line:90%
They're just like going.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:30.060 align:middle line:84%
It's like something to scarf
down to go onto the next thing.

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:33.630 align:middle line:84%
They're not giving
that meal the moment.

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:36.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think every
moment of the day,

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.580 align:middle line:90%
every minute is a meal.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.590 align:middle line:90%
We can choose to savor it.

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:43.200 align:middle line:84%
We can choose to experience
it, see it, and sense

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.330 align:middle line:90%
our environment.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.200 align:middle line:84%
But people aren't doing
that because they're

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.165 align:middle line:90%
on to the next thing.

00:12:47.165 --> 00:12:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And so unfortunately
what happens

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:50.790 align:middle line:84%
after a traumatic incident
happens to somebody,

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:52.210 align:middle line:84%
they're just on
to the next thing.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:53.250 align:middle line:90%
And then I meet them.

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:55.292 align:middle line:84%
And they say, Brendon, I
had a car accident, too.

00:12:55.292 --> 00:12:56.925 align:middle line:90%
It didn't mean anything to me.

00:12:56.925 --> 00:12:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And I had more dramatic
experience than you did.

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And I say, yeah, you
didn't demand it.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.370 align:middle line:84%
You didn't sit down and say,
what did that mean to me?

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:07.290 align:middle line:90%
And how do I want to change?

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:08.620 align:middle line:90%
I did that.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:09.420 align:middle line:90%
I wrote about it.

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:10.890 align:middle line:90%
I journaled about it.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And then I said,
every night I'm going

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:15.480 align:middle line:84%
to ask myself questions
to evaluate whether or not

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.870 align:middle line:90%
I did that.

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:18.150 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's the secret.

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:20.670 align:middle line:84%
The secret ultimately
is having discipline.

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:22.920 align:middle line:84%
It's not a popular world,
but to go to the next level,

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.030 align:middle line:90%
you need discipline.

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:25.230 align:middle line:90%
And you can't avoid it.

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:26.430 align:middle line:90%
Everyone wants to avoid it.

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:27.850 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you're
going to go on a diet?

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:29.720 align:middle line:84%
If you're really going to make
it happen, you need discipline.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.637 align:middle line:84%
But the same thing-- you
want to think better?

00:13:31.637 --> 00:13:32.930 align:middle line:90%
You need discipline.

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:33.870 align:middle line:84%
You want to have
a better morning?

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:34.450 align:middle line:90%
You need discipline.

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:35.450 align:middle line:90%
You want to love better?

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:36.750 align:middle line:90%
You need discipline.

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:39.120 align:middle line:90%
In discipline, we find freedom.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.250 align:middle line:84%
In discipline, we find our
stairway to the next level.

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:43.630 align:middle line:90%
And it's hard.

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:45.750 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't do
something every day,

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:47.430 align:middle line:90%
it's hard to master it.

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:49.580 align:middle line:84%
Some people want to
have better thoughts.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:51.360 align:middle line:84%
People want better
relationships.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.850 align:middle line:84%
But often they don't give
into that thing each day.

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:56.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean give
in, I mean give into,

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.500 align:middle line:90%
to be generous into something.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to
develop a skill,

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.630 align:middle line:84%
you want change a relationship,
you want to build a career,

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:07.510 align:middle line:84%
it has to be daily of you giving
and being generous into it--

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:08.310 align:middle line:90%
daily.

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:10.810 align:middle line:84%
So I was generous
into my intentions.

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:12.810 align:middle line:90%
I focused on them every day.

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:15.897 align:middle line:84%
And it's that daily focus
that shifted it for me.

00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's why
a lot of people, they

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:18.962 align:middle line:90%
don't get that shift.

00:14:18.962 --> 00:14:20.670 align:middle line:84%
They didn't make
something a daily focus.

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:28.520 align:middle line:90%


00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.890 align:middle line:84%
What holds people back
is first and foremost

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:33.400 align:middle line:90%
the desire for comfort and ease.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.200 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.390 align:middle line:84%
They say, well, I
want to be great,

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:38.460 align:middle line:90%
but I'm really comfortable here.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.290 align:middle line:90%
I understand this.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:42.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm not scared every day.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.152 align:middle line:84%
Or I just I don't want to
go through that struggle.

00:14:45.152 --> 00:14:47.610 align:middle line:84%
I think the most important
thing in reaching the next level

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:51.610 align:middle line:84%
in our life is to honor
the struggle, to say, oh,

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:52.410 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:55.440 align:middle line:84%
To ratchet up, to go to that
next level of potential,

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.210 align:middle line:90%
I need to honor that process.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:59.250 align:middle line:84%
That process is going
to bring hardship.

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:00.720 align:middle line:90%
It's going to bring frustration.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.100 align:middle line:90%
It's going to bring the unknown.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:03.975 align:middle line:84%
It's going to bring
people making fun of you.

00:15:03.975 --> 00:15:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And instead of saying, oh,
I'm so scared, honor it.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.130 align:middle line:90%
Go, that's part of the process.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:11.988 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you want to change
your life and get healthier,

00:15:11.988 --> 00:15:13.530 align:middle line:84%
you want to go to
the gym, people go,

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:14.767 align:middle line:90%
oh, it's going to be so hard.

00:15:14.767 --> 00:15:16.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have
to learn a new diet.

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:17.767 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have
to lift weights.

00:15:17.767 --> 00:15:20.100 align:middle line:90%
And I go, honor that.

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:23.610 align:middle line:84%
That journey of hardship,
that journey of struggle

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:26.160 align:middle line:84%
opens the door to
the next level.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.312 align:middle line:84%
We should appreciate
that and honor that.

00:15:28.312 --> 00:15:30.270 align:middle line:84%
So I think first and
foremost the reason people

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:34.860 align:middle line:84%
don't attain their potential is
they're fearful of the hardship

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:36.750 align:middle line:90%
that that change would bring.

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And I say look forward
to it, anticipate it,

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:41.790 align:middle line:84%
and say that's going to make
me smarter, wiser, better,

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:44.370 align:middle line:84%
more kind, more
capable, more confident

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:46.025 align:middle line:90%
to go through the muck.

00:15:46.025 --> 00:15:47.400 align:middle line:84%
I work with a lot
of Green Berets

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.160 align:middle line:90%
and very elite military levels.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.493 align:middle line:90%
And they have this great saying.

00:15:50.493 --> 00:15:54.102 align:middle line:84%
They say you have
to embrace the suck.

00:15:54.102 --> 00:15:56.310 align:middle line:84%
You have to know, this is
going to suck a little bit.

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:56.640 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:57.720 align:middle line:90%
Let's go at it, guys.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.070 align:middle line:90%
We know it's going to suck.

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:02.250 align:middle line:84%
Just knowing that and allowing
that is really important.

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And then once you understand
that people don't achieve

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.300 align:middle line:84%
their potential because
they don't honor struggle,

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.260 align:middle line:90%
then it's easy.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:12.150 align:middle line:84%
It's bad thinking, bad
habits, bad environment.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:13.287 align:middle line:90%
So simple to break it down.

00:16:13.287 --> 00:16:15.120 align:middle line:84%
Like, meet somebody
who's really struggling,

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.640 align:middle line:84%
it's one of those three or
a combination those three.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:18.860 align:middle line:90%
It's ruining them.

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:19.920 align:middle line:90%
They're bad thinking.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.680 align:middle line:84%
They're constantly in
a scarcity mindset.

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.540 align:middle line:84%
They're constantly
in a blaming mindset

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.240 align:middle line:84%
to either others or
their own self-hatred.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.360 align:middle line:84%
It's bad habits where they
just have no routines.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:33.720 align:middle line:84%
Their habits are
all unconscious.

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:37.080 align:middle line:84%
They don't have deliberate
high performance practices,

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.800 align:middle line:90%
deliberate habits where--

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.658 align:middle line:84%
a deliberate habit means you
can't automatically do it.

00:16:41.658 --> 00:16:43.200 align:middle line:84%
It's like the next
level of the habit

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.750 align:middle line:84%
where you have to force
yourself to do it.

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:47.610 align:middle line:84%
It gets a little
easier, but you always

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:49.800 align:middle line:84%
have to remind
yourself to do it.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.140 align:middle line:90%
Or it's a bad environment.

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:52.840 align:middle line:90%
They have a negative spouse.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.900 align:middle line:84%
They have people around
them making fun of them.

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.490 align:middle line:90%
They have trolls online.

00:16:56.490 --> 00:17:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And they let that
negativity win the day.

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.960 align:middle line:84%
It's very easy for people
to let the negative drown

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.582 align:middle line:90%
out their ambition.

00:17:05.582 --> 00:17:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And now this person who
has a lot of potential,

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:09.707 align:middle line:84%
a lot of greatness, who
could go to this next level,

00:17:09.707 --> 00:17:13.440 align:middle line:84%
they don't because they're
listening to the wrong voices.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:17.260 align:middle line:84%
They're not listening to
that inside restlessness,

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.837 align:middle line:84%
that inside thing that
says, come on, man.

00:17:19.837 --> 00:17:21.670 align:middle line:84%
That inside thing says
we gotta change this.

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:23.760 align:middle line:84%
That inside thing that
is scary sometimes

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.540 align:middle line:84%
because it says we
gotta blow all this up

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.790 align:middle line:90%
because it's wrong for us.

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:30.553 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it feels irresponsible
to listen to that voice

00:17:30.553 --> 00:17:32.720 align:middle line:84%
and very responsible listen
to the person that says,

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.000 align:middle line:90%
now be careful.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.070 align:middle line:84%
But if you're always
listening to that person

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:41.950 align:middle line:84%
or that side of you, then what
ends up winning is certainty.

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And people who need
a lot of certainty,

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:47.500 align:middle line:84%
and that's their thing, it's
hard for them to rattle past

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.500 align:middle line:84%
their comfort zone because
past the comfort zone is a lot

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:56.620 align:middle line:84%
of unknown, is a lot of fears,
a lot of a future that you just

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:59.260 align:middle line:90%
cannot possibly anticipate.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:02.240 align:middle line:84%
But that's the only place
where greatness lies.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.300 align:middle line:84%
That's the only place
because greatness is always

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.110 align:middle line:90%
going to be a future tense.

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:11.740 align:middle line:84%
Right now, we can feel good,
but our ultimate greatness, it's

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:13.570 align:middle line:90%
not right now.

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:15.280 align:middle line:90%
Right now is beauty.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.840 align:middle line:90%
Right now is blessing.

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.270 align:middle line:90%
Right now is meaning.

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:22.100 align:middle line:90%
It's the moment.

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:25.330 align:middle line:90%
Greatness is an ultimate legacy.

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:28.480 align:middle line:84%
Until we're at that death bed or
that final moment of cognition

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.900 align:middle line:84%
before we blink out and
we go to the next level,

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:35.770 align:middle line:84%
until we're right there,
greatness isn't ours.

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:38.080 align:middle line:84%
It's something we
have to strive for.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:42.340 align:middle line:84%
It's just like morality
is never ultimately ours.

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.410 align:middle line:84%
We're always
striving towards it.

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:46.300 align:middle line:90%
Greatness is that way, too.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.000 align:middle line:90%
And so for those who are just--

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.800 align:middle line:84%
they're stuck right here,
they've got to evaluate,

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:51.910 align:middle line:90%
what are my thoughts?

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:52.900 align:middle line:90%
What are my habits?

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And have I set up an
environment to win?

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And if none of these are
consciously done, they cannot--

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:00.465 align:middle line:84%
they cannot-- obtain
their full potential.

00:19:00.465 --> 00:19:07.740 align:middle line:90%


00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.740 align:middle line:84%
I can tell if
somebody is trapped

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:13.490 align:middle line:84%
in conformity by looking
at their first 60 minutes

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:15.230 align:middle line:90%
this morning.

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:16.130 align:middle line:90%
That's how I know.

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:17.570 align:middle line:90%
Are you really living your life?

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:18.440 align:middle line:90%
Let's gauge it.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.980 align:middle line:84%
If you wake up and you do what
86% of smartphone owners do,

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:22.950 align:middle line:90%
they grab their phone.

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:24.020 align:middle line:90%
It's right next to the bed.

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:24.890 align:middle line:90%
They grab their phone.

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:25.690 align:middle line:90%
They look at it.

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And they go into
the social media.

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:28.580 align:middle line:90%
They go into their email.

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.020 align:middle line:84%
They go in their text,
their voice message,

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:32.690 align:middle line:84%
or whatever else they're looking
at on their phone, their games.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And they're starting
their day in reaction.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.030 align:middle line:90%
That's how we know.

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:41.210 align:middle line:84%
If you are living a conforming
life, it means you're waking up

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:42.830 align:middle line:90%
and you are a consumer.

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:43.880 align:middle line:90%
That's how you know.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:44.750 align:middle line:90%
You're waking up.

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.400 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is not
directing the day.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.390 align:middle line:90%
You're not planning.

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:48.850 align:middle line:90%
You're not asking what you want.

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:49.650 align:middle line:90%
You're going in.

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:51.620 align:middle line:84%
I always say people who
wake up and they check

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.030 align:middle line:90%
their inbox is a great example.

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:56.840 align:middle line:84%
The inbox is nothing but a
convenient organizing system

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.280 align:middle line:90%
of other people's agendas.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.830 align:middle line:90%
So you wake up, you check in.

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:02.720 align:middle line:84%
It's all these people
asking for something.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.247 align:middle line:84%
And now it's the world directing
your attention and your day.

00:20:06.247 --> 00:20:08.080 align:middle line:84%
That's why I tell people,
no, don't do that.

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:11.120 align:middle line:84%
We did this study in High
Performance Academy where we

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:14.510 align:middle line:84%
said you cannot check your
email or any social media

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:17.090 align:middle line:84%
for the first 60
minutes of your day.

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:20.480 align:middle line:84%
We increased productivity and
people's self-reported activity

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.840 align:middle line:84%
over the course of
seven days by 30%.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.870 align:middle line:90%
And it held for 90 days.

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:29.830 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if you got 30%
more productivity each day.

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:30.830 align:middle line:90%
Well, the way you do it?

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:33.680 align:middle line:84%
Stop conforming to what the
world is throwing at you.

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.720 align:middle line:84%
Don't wake up and go
into reaction mode.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.900 align:middle line:84%
Wake up and say, what do I
want this day to be about?

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.060 align:middle line:84%
Wake up and set some good
intentions for yourself.

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Wake up and move your body
to open up some health,

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.610 align:middle line:84%
open up some breath,
open up some endorphins.

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:48.650 align:middle line:84%
Sit down with a piece
of paper and say, OK,

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:50.875 align:middle line:90%
what are my main projects today?

00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Who do I need to reach out
to and ask questions of?

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.340 align:middle line:84%
Or who am I waiting
on a decision

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.423 align:middle line:90%
to I need to reach out to?

00:20:55.423 --> 00:20:57.140 align:middle line:84%
What are my main
priorities today?

00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:59.140 align:middle line:90%
Do that work first.

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.680 align:middle line:84%
It's like Stephen
Covey taught us--

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:01.940 align:middle line:90%
be proactive.

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:03.740 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, first,
plan your day.

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:05.960 align:middle line:84%
Ask what you want of it
before you go and say,

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:08.240 align:middle line:90%
what does everybody else need?

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.190 align:middle line:84%
Because the way to
know conformity,

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:13.640 align:middle line:84%
it's not like we talk about
in personal development

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.300 align:middle line:84%
or you read it, you watch it
in a certain movie where people

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:20.630 align:middle line:84%
are talking about conformity is
like this mass culture thing.

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:22.730 align:middle line:90%
Conformity happens every day.

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Are you just consuming a bunch
of other people's voices?

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.090 align:middle line:84%
Or are you contributing
and sharing your own?

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:32.375 align:middle line:84%
Are you reacting
to all the noise?

00:21:32.375 --> 00:21:34.250 align:middle line:84%
Or are you finding some
stillness and silence

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:35.630 align:middle line:90%
within each day?

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:37.310 align:middle line:90%
It's very easy to tell.

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:39.750 align:middle line:84%
Conformity is the little
things that we do.

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:43.550 align:middle line:84%
It's that little time that
we want to create something

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:47.720 align:middle line:84%
and, well, we lost
three hours on YouTube.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.790 align:middle line:84%
It's the tells that
happen all day long.

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:51.500 align:middle line:90%
How did you wake up?

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:53.320 align:middle line:90%
What did you really plan today?

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.070 align:middle line:84%
How many of your goals--
did you knock off

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:57.080 align:middle line:90%
three significant goals today?

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:58.100 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you didn't?

00:21:58.100 --> 00:21:59.063 align:middle line:90%
You're conforming.

00:21:59.063 --> 00:22:00.230 align:middle line:90%
You don't like to hear that.

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:01.280 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, I just--

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.680 align:middle line:84%
I have obligations
and responsibilities.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, no, your obligation
and your responsibility

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.530 align:middle line:84%
is to live your mission
and your purpose,

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:12.410 align:middle line:84%
that you were given this
unique soul, this unique gift,

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:16.252 align:middle line:84%
this unique container that is
unique out of 7 billion people,

00:22:16.252 --> 00:22:17.210 align:middle line:90%
and you're being asked.

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:18.668 align:middle line:84%
People will say,
what's my purpose?

00:22:18.668 --> 00:22:21.347 align:middle line:90%
I say, well, let's take a look.

00:22:21.347 --> 00:22:22.180 align:middle line:90%
What's your purpose?

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:23.920 align:middle line:90%
What do we know to be true?

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, we know for sure
that you're unique.

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:30.160 align:middle line:84%
Out of 7 billion people, we
cannot line up a genetic exact

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:30.960 align:middle line:90%
match.

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.560 align:middle line:90%
We just know that by science.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.830 align:middle line:84%
We know that by spirit, as
well, that you're unique.

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:38.220 align:middle line:84%
So part of your purpose,
live that uniqueness.

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:39.330 align:middle line:90%
Don't conform.

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:40.130 align:middle line:90%
Be you.

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:41.630 align:middle line:84%
Share with the world
what you really

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:43.770 align:middle line:84%
think, what you really
feel, what you really want.

00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:45.540 align:middle line:84%
Contribute things that
pull at your heart

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:47.825 align:middle line:90%
because maybe that's God inside.

00:22:47.825 --> 00:22:49.200 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's a
part of you that's

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.770 align:middle line:84%
like there's some kind of
thing that's being called

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:55.515 align:middle line:84%
and you're supposed to listen
because only you got that gift.

00:22:55.515 --> 00:22:57.300 align:middle line:90%
And you got that message.

00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.075 align:middle line:90%
You're supposed to do that.

00:22:59.075 --> 00:23:00.450 align:middle line:84%
I also say, what
else do we know?

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:02.910 align:middle line:84%
7 billion people, we're
all interconnected.

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And by and large, despite all
the negativity in the media,

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:10.080 align:middle line:84%
7 billion people get along
extraordinarily well.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And we're all compelled
to belong and to love.

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And so part of your purpose
is to create an environment

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.790 align:middle line:84%
of belonging and love, to allow
other people to feel accepted

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:22.920 align:middle line:90%
and cared for and honored.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.760 align:middle line:84%
Because if we didn't
do that for each other,

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.700 align:middle line:90%
we'd blow up the planet.

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:30.300 align:middle line:84%
And the third thing
that we all know, life?

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:31.420 align:middle line:90%
Short.

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:32.830 align:middle line:90%
It's precious.

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:33.630 align:middle line:90%
You hear it.

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:36.960 align:middle line:84%
You can't read any old
sage or any philosopher who

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.880 align:middle line:90%
doesn't talk about mortality.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.170 align:middle line:90%
It's going to go.

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And so the compelling drive is
to live it while we are here.

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:47.490 align:middle line:84%
Live your unique
life, love others,

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:49.800 align:middle line:84%
and live while you
are here, and we

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.910 align:middle line:84%
know you'll be honoring that
purpose, those unique things

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:55.885 align:middle line:84%
that we can tell and
measure by science

00:23:55.885 --> 00:23:57.260 align:middle line:84%
and that is here
and true for us.

00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:06.030 align:middle line:90%


00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:07.800 align:middle line:90%
I think fear has changed.

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure that
I agree that people

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:13.875 align:middle line:84%
think I'm not good enough
or I don't deserve it.

00:24:13.875 --> 00:24:15.750 align:middle line:84%
I think we're in a time
where people actually

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:16.590 align:middle line:90%
think they are good enough.

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:17.520 align:middle line:90%
I mean, look at Instagram.

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look at the pictures
they're taking of themselves.

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:20.880 align:middle line:90%
They think they're great.

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:24.110 align:middle line:84%
It's not do I think I'm great
that is stopping people.

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:27.270 align:middle line:84%
What is stopping people is what
real psychological fear is.

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:30.050 align:middle line:84%
Real psychological fear only
comes out of three things.

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying psychological
fear, not physiological.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:35.850 align:middle line:84%
What I mean is there is no
tiger chasing me right now.

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:38.880 align:middle line:84%
So if there's no imminent
threat of physical harm,

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.430 align:middle line:84%
then there's only three
psychological mechanisms

00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:42.570 align:middle line:90%
that create fear.

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:45.130 align:middle line:90%
Number one is called loss pain.

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:47.400 align:middle line:84%
Loss pain means if
I do that, then I'm

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.590 align:middle line:84%
going to lose something
I like over here.

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:52.090 align:middle line:84%
If I make a change,
I lose something.

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:54.000 align:middle line:84%
If I quit smoking,
I lose that time

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.770 align:middle line:84%
when I get to leave the
building and take those couple

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:59.280 align:middle line:84%
deep breaths and just
get away from everybody.

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:03.210 align:middle line:84%
If I go to change my diet,
then I lose the foods I love.

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:06.580 align:middle line:84%
If I quit this job, then I lose
those co-workers I do like.

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:08.160 align:middle line:90%
I lose my health insurance.

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.210 align:middle line:84%
So people don't
change because they're

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:10.877 align:middle line:84%
scared they're going
to lose something--

00:25:10.877 --> 00:25:14.070 align:middle line:84%
lose something tangible,
lose something intangible.

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:16.860 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they feel like
I'm going to lose respect.

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:18.510 align:middle line:90%
People will make fun of me.

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I'll lose status,
position, power, money.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.160 align:middle line:90%
So they don't proceed.

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.600 align:middle line:90%
Even if they think they're OK--

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:25.950 align:middle line:90%
they like themselves.

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:27.420 align:middle line:84%
Self-esteem might
not be the issue.

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:29.253 align:middle line:84%
They're just thinking
I might lose something

00:25:29.253 --> 00:25:30.630 align:middle line:90%
that's important to me.

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:33.240 align:middle line:90%
And loss pain terrorizes people.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.363 align:middle line:90%
So they stay stuck.

00:25:34.363 --> 00:25:35.280 align:middle line:90%
Because you know what?

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.480 align:middle line:90%
I know this.

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.470 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that.

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to lose
the things I'm already

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.160 align:middle line:90%
certain about in life.

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:44.660 align:middle line:84%
Second thing that people fear
is called hardship pain--

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:47.760 align:middle line:84%
hardship-- often
called process pain.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:51.000 align:middle line:84%
The process of
changing will bring

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.840 align:middle line:90%
doubt, uncertainty, discomfort.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.060 align:middle line:84%
It will bring
hardship to me where

00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:59.982 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to stretch and
learn and retool new things.

00:25:59.982 --> 00:26:01.440 align:middle line:84%
People don't quit
the job because I

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.443 align:middle line:84%
go, oh, I'm going to
have to create a resume.

00:26:03.443 --> 00:26:04.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have
to go interview.

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:06.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have to put
myself out there again.

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:10.110 align:middle line:84%
People don't go dating because
they say the same things today.

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:12.390 align:middle line:84%
People don't go and try to
change because they say,

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:14.382 align:middle line:90%
oh, well, the process--

00:26:14.382 --> 00:26:15.840 align:middle line:84%
if I want to lose
weight, I'm going

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.910 align:middle line:84%
to have to learn
to cook new things.

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have to change my
schedule to go to the gym now.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:22.540 align:middle line:90%
It's going to hurt.

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:24.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be
sore all the time.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:25.320 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do that.

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.090 align:middle line:90%
That's process pain.

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And then the last one
is called outcome pain.

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:34.530 align:middle line:84%
Outcome pain is I'm scared that
if I go through all of that, I

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:39.030 align:middle line:84%
put myself out there, I
try, I endured the hardship,

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:41.910 align:middle line:84%
the grass won't be
greener on the other side.

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:43.950 align:middle line:90%
I tried all of this work.

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:48.150 align:middle line:84%
I did all the things you told
me only to be disappointed.

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:50.860 align:middle line:84%
They're terrified
of disappointment.

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:53.880 align:middle line:84%
They're not terrified
of a tiger eating them.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.200 align:middle line:90%
It's not physiological.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.150 align:middle line:84%
It's psychological
warfare in their mind

00:26:57.150 --> 00:27:00.673 align:middle line:84%
going if I do that, it
might not turn out well.

00:27:00.673 --> 00:27:01.590 align:middle line:90%
And then what happens?

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:03.050 align:middle line:90%
Well, then I lose something.

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:04.670 align:middle line:84%
What happens when
I lose something?

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:06.340 align:middle line:90%
Then it becomes hard.

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And they get trapped in this
spinning loop of fear, of loss,

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:13.910 align:middle line:84%
of hardship, and outcome
that they didn't want.

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And the only way
to shift somebody

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.513 align:middle line:84%
is to change how they're
thinking about those things.

00:27:18.513 --> 00:27:20.680 align:middle line:84%
What we're thinking about
when we're trapped in fear

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:24.070 align:middle line:84%
is this statement--
"what if" followed

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:25.900 align:middle line:90%
by a negative statement.

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:28.690 align:middle line:90%
What if I lose respect?

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:30.670 align:middle line:90%
What if people make fun of me?

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:32.465 align:middle line:90%
What if I fail?

00:27:32.465 --> 00:27:34.090 align:middle line:84%
What if it's not as
good as I promised?

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:35.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's always
"what if" followed

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:36.070 align:middle line:90%
by a negative statement.

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And you have to teach people,
well, first, pursue that.

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Ask the question and
really consider it.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:43.100 align:middle line:84%
What happens if those things--
what's the worst case scenario?

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:45.260 align:middle line:84%
But then we have to teach
him to flip it and say,

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:48.610 align:middle line:84%
"well, what if" followed
by a positive statement.

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:51.670 align:middle line:84%
What if you don't lose anything,
but you gain the things

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:53.290 align:middle line:90%
you really want in your life?

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:56.180 align:middle line:84%
What if the process doesn't
terrorize you and make

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:56.980 align:middle line:90%
you awful?

00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:58.820 align:middle line:84%
What if you could
enjoy the process?

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:01.390 align:middle line:84%
What if that process could
make you stronger and better

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:02.650 align:middle line:90%
and capable?

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:04.270 align:middle line:84%
What if instead
of, oh, it's going

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:06.400 align:middle line:84%
to turn out terrible,
what if it turns out great

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:09.520 align:middle line:84%
and I finally get what
I've always wanted?

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And we have to teach,
them where to focus.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.270 align:middle line:84%
If the "what if" is followed
by negative statement,

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:16.700 align:middle line:84%
their mind goes like this,
and it turns in their gut.

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:18.010 align:middle line:84%
It's how you get
stomach acid, and you

00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:19.840 align:middle line:84%
feel like you're going
to be sick with doubt.

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:21.420 align:middle line:84%
It's because you're
asking "what if" followed

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:22.420 align:middle line:90%
by negative statements.

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:26.530 align:middle line:84%
Most anxiety, if it's not
a physiological problem

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:29.148 align:middle line:84%
or torment, it's really
coming from the mind--

00:28:29.148 --> 00:28:30.940 align:middle line:84%
"what if" followed by
a negative statement.

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:34.390 align:middle line:84%
But if we start asking what
if this amazing thing could

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:35.320 align:middle line:90%
happen?

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.450 align:middle line:90%
Then we start to find hope.

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:39.200 align:middle line:90%
We start to find willpower.

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.660 align:middle line:90%
We start to find motivation.

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:43.502 align:middle line:84%
We start to find a morning
that's brighter than yesterday.

00:28:43.502 --> 00:28:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's why people
need to get over the idea

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:47.560 align:middle line:90%
that fear is keeping them down.

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:49.480 align:middle line:90%
Your mind is keeping you down.

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:53.167 align:middle line:84%
Fear is just usually poor
management of our mind.

00:28:53.167 --> 00:29:00.330 align:middle line:90%


00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:04.970 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think visualization
is a beginning.

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:06.020 align:middle line:90%
You have to have that.

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:07.250 align:middle line:90%
That's like step one.

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:08.420 align:middle line:90%
It's like, what do you want?

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:09.950 align:middle line:90%
Can you see it?

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:12.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think visualization
has to be a full body

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:13.850 align:middle line:90%
emotional experience.

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:17.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people say, Brendon,
how do I visualize well?

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.567 align:middle line:90%
I say, are you sweating?

00:29:19.567 --> 00:29:20.650 align:middle line:90%
They go, what do you mean?

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:23.890 align:middle line:84%
I say, when you sit and you
think about that dream, I mean,

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:26.250 align:middle line:84%
do you start sweating
and getting exciting?

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:28.940 align:middle line:84%
There's a little bit of anxiety
and that thrust of like, wow,

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:29.870 align:middle line:90%
what would that take?

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:31.120 align:middle line:90%
And what would that feel like?

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:33.530 align:middle line:84%
Can you actually feel
yourself in that moment?

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:34.730 align:middle line:90%
Does it cause chills?

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:37.295 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if there's no
physiological sensation,

00:29:37.295 --> 00:29:38.810 align:middle line:90%
you're not visualization.

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:40.310 align:middle line:90%
You're dreaming.

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:42.380 align:middle line:84%
You're not using the full
weaponry of your mind

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:47.213 align:middle line:84%
until your visualizations are
in full and bring feeling.

00:29:47.213 --> 00:29:49.130 align:middle line:84%
That's when you know
you're visualizing right.

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:51.350 align:middle line:84%
So first, it's like
weaponizing the whole body.

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:53.120 align:middle line:90%
You should feel it and sense it.

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.020 align:middle line:90%
Be there.

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:54.590 align:middle line:90%
Because the greats?

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:55.100 align:middle line:90%
That's what they do.

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.130 align:middle line:90%
They can feel it.

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:58.640 align:middle line:84%
They feel what it's like
to finish that race, touch

00:29:58.640 --> 00:29:59.930 align:middle line:90%
the wall in swimming.

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:02.810 align:middle line:84%
They feel what it's like
to give that smash serve.

00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:06.530 align:middle line:84%
They actually-- it's not just
visualization, it's feeling.

00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:08.450 align:middle line:90%
They can feel it and sense it.

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:10.280 align:middle line:90%
They're fully immersed.

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:13.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's like it's
like a virtual reality.

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:15.080 align:middle line:90%
They've put themselves there.

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.550 align:middle line:90%
They see 360.

00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:19.370 align:middle line:90%
And it's not a short thing.

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:21.662 align:middle line:84%
Most visualizations,
they're too short.

00:30:21.662 --> 00:30:23.120 align:middle line:84%
They think about
for like a minute.

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.100 align:middle line:84%
La, la, la, la, la,
and they go to bed.

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:27.740 align:middle line:84%
It's like, no, no, you've got to
sit there and dream this stuff

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:28.190 align:middle line:90%
up.

00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:29.000 align:middle line:90%
Look around.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Be in virtual reality
of your dreams.

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:32.360 align:middle line:90%
Sense it.

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.160 align:middle line:90%
Feel it.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.610 align:middle line:90%
Feel that full emotion.

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:36.350 align:middle line:90%
That's like step one.

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:38.000 align:middle line:84%
What most people miss
in visualization,

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.180 align:middle line:90%
though, is step two.

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's imagining
the points that

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:45.080 align:middle line:84%
really matter when
you're about to quit,

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:47.850 align:middle line:84%
that moment when
things go wrong.

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:51.480 align:middle line:84%
It's the now the famous
story of Michael Phelps

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:55.590 align:middle line:84%
in which, when he was younger,
his goggles had broken.

00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And his coach made him
swim with it anyway.

00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.700 align:middle line:90%
He had to learn how to do that.

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And he learned to think about
all these different things that

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:02.400 align:middle line:90%
could go wrong.

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:03.930 align:middle line:84%
Later on, in one
of the Olympics,

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:06.172 align:middle line:84%
when his goggles had
started flooding with water,

00:31:06.172 --> 00:31:08.380 align:middle line:84%
he knew how to do it because
he'd thought through it.

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And he counted his
strokes to the wall.

00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And he won the race
and won the gold.

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And so you have these moments
where you have to imagine,

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:17.640 align:middle line:84%
if you're running a marathon,
imagine being in that marathon.

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:18.610 align:middle line:90%
You're doing great.

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:23.730 align:middle line:84%
But you also have to imagine
mile 18 when it sucks.

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:25.560 align:middle line:90%
Your shins are screaming.

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.390 align:middle line:90%
Your back is starting to ache.

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:29.490 align:middle line:84%
You feel pains of
all these places

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:30.870 align:middle line:90%
because that's going to be real.

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And you have to say,
what decision am I

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:35.400 align:middle line:84%
going to make when
the crap hits the fan?

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:37.740 align:middle line:84%
What decision am I going to
make when I want to quit?

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:40.232 align:middle line:84%
Visualization isn't
just positive thinking.

00:31:40.232 --> 00:31:41.940 align:middle line:84%
It's not just enduring
positive thinking.

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:46.050 align:middle line:84%
It's also saying
what might go wrong?

00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And how would my
highest self meet it?

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:49.512 align:middle line:90%
You have to see the--

00:31:49.512 --> 00:31:50.970 align:middle line:84%
what happens if
you get up on stage

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:52.950 align:middle line:90%
and you do forget your words?

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:53.940 align:middle line:90%
What happens next?

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:56.050 align:middle line:84%
You have to see
what happens next.

00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:58.020 align:middle line:84%
If you stop there, then
you're fear mongering,

00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:59.280 align:middle line:90%
and you'll shut down your dream.

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.020 align:middle line:84%
But if you see it,
and then see yourself

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:03.420 align:middle line:84%
work through the
difficulty, that's

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:06.410 align:middle line:84%
advanced stage of
visualizations.

00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:08.820 align:middle line:84%
Then, if you have
those two components--

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:11.340 align:middle line:84%
visualizing it with feeling,
emotion, and physiology,

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.867 align:middle line:84%
really feeling it; watching
where things are going to go

00:32:13.867 --> 00:32:16.200 align:middle line:84%
wrong and how you're going
to adjust and be your highest

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.220 align:middle line:90%
self--

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:19.320 align:middle line:84%
and then from there,
it's teaching yourself

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:21.750 align:middle line:90%
to say things to yourself.

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:25.212 align:middle line:84%
Visualization should also
incorporate language.

00:32:25.212 --> 00:32:26.670 align:middle line:84%
You should lay
there with your eyes

00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:30.360 align:middle line:84%
closed and say, OK, when that
happens, remind yourself.

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:31.740 align:middle line:90%
Go for it, Brendon.

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:32.850 align:middle line:90%
Keep going.

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:34.440 align:middle line:90%
You have to talk to yourself.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.260 align:middle line:84%
If there's no self talk
with your visualization,

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:39.836 align:middle line:84%
you're still in kindergarten
in personal development.

00:32:39.836 --> 00:32:47.160 align:middle line:90%


00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:52.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, it came into my work in
the beginning, which is funny.

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.720 align:middle line:84%
So I've been doing
this work for 20 years

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:57.000 align:middle line:84%
in my own personal
life, in the last 10

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.377 align:middle line:90%
years as a professional.

00:32:58.377 --> 00:33:00.210 align:middle line:84%
That means when I quit
my job, and I finally

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:01.830 align:middle line:90%
got paid to do this stuff.

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:04.620 align:middle line:84%
So for 10 years, it's
been about the journey

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:06.280 align:middle line:90%
within for 10 years.

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:08.190 align:middle line:90%
It's my famous statement.

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:09.660 align:middle line:84%
Only two things
change your life.

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Either something new
comes into your life,

00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:13.620 align:middle line:84%
or something new
comes from within.

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:15.810 align:middle line:84%
I think what ends
up happening is--

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:20.240 align:middle line:84%
for me, in my own personal
career-- was YouTube.

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Outside of my seminars,
where a lot of people

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:24.862 align:middle line:84%
couldn't attend because
of the price points--

00:33:24.862 --> 00:33:26.070 align:middle line:90%
suddenly YouTube comes along.

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:28.362 align:middle line:84%
And now it's like, oh, well,
Brendon's taught a million

00:33:28.362 --> 00:33:30.015 align:middle line:90%
people to meditate on YouTube.

00:33:30.015 --> 00:33:32.570 align:middle line:84%
You go and look at my YouTube
video, a million people plus--

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:34.112 align:middle line:84%
I don't know; maybe
it's two by now--

00:33:34.112 --> 00:33:38.970 align:middle line:84%
have watched that because I
think the zeitgeist changed.

00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:44.940 align:middle line:84%
I think meditation, mindfulness,
the concepts of presence,

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:46.893 align:middle line:90%
that power of now--

00:33:46.893 --> 00:33:48.810 align:middle line:84%
all of that has become
more important and more

00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:51.240 align:middle line:84%
conversational right now
because people are so

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:54.570 align:middle line:84%
inundated with
chaos, distraction,

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:58.620 align:middle line:84%
external obligation,
consumerism, and negativity.

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:00.300 align:middle line:90%
So they're struggling.

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:01.240 align:middle line:90%
They're struggling.

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And so they're looking
for answers now.

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:03.663 align:middle line:90%
And they're finding stuff.

00:34:03.663 --> 00:34:06.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look, they're finding
stuff from Alan Watts now.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.580 align:middle line:84%
They're finding stuff
from Buddha now.

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:11.730 align:middle line:84%
They're finding stuff from
Confucius and the Tao now.

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:14.460 align:middle line:84%
They're going back now
because they know they're not

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:15.389 align:middle line:90%
dealing with it now.

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:17.181 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have this
whole swell of people

00:34:17.181 --> 00:34:20.520 align:middle line:84%
now look into Marcus Aurelius
meditations, the stuff

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.179 align:middle line:84%
that we talked about
20, 30 years ago.

00:34:22.179 --> 00:34:25.770 align:middle line:84%
But now it's caught on
to the popular culture

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:30.489 align:middle line:84%
because the popular
culture is struggling.

00:34:30.489 --> 00:34:33.670 align:middle line:84%
People are overwhelmed, and they
don't know how to process it.

00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:35.690 align:middle line:90%
They are frustrated.

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:37.360 align:middle line:84%
They don't know
how to process it.

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:39.040 align:middle line:84%
They have already
tried everything else

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:41.830 align:middle line:84%
that we were taught in the
'80s and the '90s, which

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:46.360 align:middle line:84%
is basically consumerism, which
was lean on other things, which

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:51.118 align:middle line:84%
was attain power, money, wealth,
status, and you'll feel good.

00:34:51.118 --> 00:34:53.199 align:middle line:84%
But you have an
entire economy now

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:55.929 align:middle line:84%
that's chugged along pretty
well for decade after decade

00:34:55.929 --> 00:34:56.889 align:middle line:90%
after decade.

00:34:56.889 --> 00:34:59.389 align:middle line:84%
You've got a lot of comfort,
especially in the United States

00:34:59.389 --> 00:35:00.760 align:middle line:90%
and the Western worlds now.

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:02.390 align:middle line:84%
We haven't solved
all the problems.

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:06.310 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of still people
living in just abject poverty.

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:08.830 align:middle line:84%
But as more and more of the
world which is middle class,

00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:11.370 align:middle line:84%
then they've fought to get
there, then they look around

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:13.630 align:middle line:90%
and go, is this it?

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:15.950 align:middle line:90%
I still don't feel good.

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:18.230 align:middle line:84%
I still feel like I
did when I was broke.

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:22.330 align:middle line:84%
I still feel like I did
when I was struggling.

00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And people are having trouble
connecting with themselves.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.650 align:middle line:84%
They're not getting fulfillment
from the external world.

00:35:28.650 --> 00:35:31.200 align:middle line:84%
So they're saying,
where else can I look?

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.280 align:middle line:90%
And the only answer is within.

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:35.110 align:middle line:90%
So meditation has become that.

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it's always
been a big part of it.

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:41.760 align:middle line:84%
I started the release meditation
now seven, eight years ago.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:45.150 align:middle line:84%
I just close my eyes,
and I repeat the mantra,

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:46.845 align:middle line:90%
the word "release."

00:35:46.845 --> 00:35:50.580 align:middle line:84%
I just close my eyes
and say release,

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:54.290 align:middle line:90%
release, release, release.

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:56.040 align:middle line:84%
I just repeat that
over and over.

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:59.080 align:middle line:84%
When a thought comes in my
head, my mantra says release it.

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:00.450 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:03.240 align:middle line:84%
When tension is in
my body, my mantra

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:05.100 align:middle line:90%
says release that tension.

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And I just do that 20
minutes, usually twice a day,

00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:09.630 align:middle line:90%
and that's what worked for me.

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:12.350 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has to find
their own practice.

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:14.730 align:middle line:84%
What we know
without any doubt is

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:17.910 align:middle line:84%
that all of the science in
both mindfulness and meditation

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:19.470 align:middle line:84%
is proving over
and over again, we

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:23.370 align:middle line:84%
can decrease our stress
by will, by going

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:24.630 align:middle line:90%
into a meditative state.

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:28.200 align:middle line:84%
We can improve our
overall health by will,

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.210 align:middle line:84%
by going into a
meditative state.

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:34.330 align:middle line:84%
We can improve our daily
productivity, our creativity,

00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:36.600 align:middle line:84%
our resilience,
our relationships.

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:38.850 align:middle line:84%
Every facet of our life we
can improve by meditation.

00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:40.308 align:middle line:84%
But meditation
doesn't just happen.

00:36:40.308 --> 00:36:44.460 align:middle line:84%
You have to take the time
and go in that place.

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:46.460 align:middle line:90%
I do it when I'm in a taxi cab.

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:48.030 align:middle line:84%
Instead of talking with the
cab driver, I'm like, well,

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:49.770 align:middle line:84%
you know, you can talk
with the next five people.

00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:50.760 align:middle line:90%
Don't need to talk to me.

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:51.330 align:middle line:90%
Close my eyes.

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:53.040 align:middle line:84%
Every time I'm in a
car, close my eyes.

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:54.090 align:middle line:90%
I meditate.

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:55.680 align:middle line:84%
I also have transition
meditations,

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.900 align:middle line:84%
which I think is the most
important thing to today

00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:59.910 align:middle line:84%
because people are trying
to do so many things.

00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Transition meditation
means, OK, let's say

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:03.560 align:middle line:90%
I have two big activities.

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:07.290 align:middle line:84%
Gotta check my inbox, and then
I have to create a presentation.

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't just do my
email and then jump in

00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:11.860 align:middle line:90%
and start creating that.

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:14.910 align:middle line:84%
Instead, as soon as I get
done with the email, I get up.

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:15.750 align:middle line:90%
I'll go walk around.

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:16.670 align:middle line:90%
I'll get some water.

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:17.310 align:middle line:90%
I'll come back down.

00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:18.110 align:middle line:90%
I'll sit.

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'll just do a quick
two-, three-minute meditation.

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:23.520 align:middle line:84%
Then I'll start
the presentation.

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:26.620 align:middle line:84%
It's like I tell people, hey,
if you're a dad or you're a mom,

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:28.090 align:middle line:84%
and you're coming
home from work,

00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:30.250 align:middle line:84%
and your spouse or the
kids are in the house,

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:32.542 align:middle line:84%
don't take that long commute
where you're frustrated.

00:37:32.542 --> 00:37:34.750 align:middle line:84%
You're giving the bird to
everybody who cuts you off.

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And then you go in the house
with that energy of the day.

00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:38.800 align:middle line:90%
Pull up to your house.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.450 align:middle line:90%
Turn the engine off.

00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:43.500 align:middle line:84%
Close your eyes, and let
yourself turn off for a minute.

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:47.200 align:middle line:84%
Take a five-, 10-,
15-minute meditation.

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:48.550 align:middle line:90%
Then get up.

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:50.530 align:middle line:90%
Then go into the house.

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:53.740 align:middle line:84%
That transition from the
commute to going into the house

00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:57.750 align:middle line:84%
gives you time to reset,
to have some intention,

00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:59.230 align:middle line:84%
and to go in the
house as a better

00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:02.238 align:middle line:84%
mom, better dad, a better
caregiver, a better lover.

00:38:02.238 --> 00:38:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Because if we just keep going
from one thing to another thing

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:06.947 align:middle line:84%
to another thing to another
thing, to another thing,

00:38:06.947 --> 00:38:09.820 align:middle line:84%
not only does that lead to
burnout, it makes us miss life.

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:11.620 align:middle line:84%
It makes us lack
the ability to bring

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:13.520 align:middle line:90%
good energy into a moment.

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And so I tell people, find your
moments in between everything.

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:19.510 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing-- if
I've a full day of calls,

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:21.083 align:middle line:84%
and then I've gotta
go meet my wife,

00:38:21.083 --> 00:38:22.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to meditate
between those two.

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:23.530 align:middle line:90%
I have to.

00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:24.730 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, she's
going to get Brendon

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:25.893 align:middle line:90%
who just did the calls guy.

00:38:25.893 --> 00:38:27.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't want her
to have that guy.

00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:28.770 align:middle line:90%
I want her to have her husband.

00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:30.353 align:middle line:84%
And the only way I
can show up for her

00:38:30.353 --> 00:38:31.593 align:middle line:90%
is the transition meditation.

00:38:31.593 --> 00:38:39.640 align:middle line:90%


00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:41.728 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the biggest
problems in measuring

00:38:41.728 --> 00:38:44.020 align:middle line:84%
the next level for people is
that we've been all taught

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:46.933 align:middle line:84%
that it's about personality,
that your personality will

00:38:46.933 --> 00:38:48.100 align:middle line:90%
carry you to the next level.

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:50.740 align:middle line:84%
So take Myers Briggs,
take Strengths Finder,

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:55.270 align:middle line:84%
take Birkman, take all
the different assessments

00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:57.880 align:middle line:84%
to measure what you are
like and who you are.

00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And we keep thinking that what
we are like and who we are,

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.950 align:middle line:84%
these innate strengths, these
lucky blessings of preference

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:09.670 align:middle line:84%
and personality matter when
it comes to performance

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:10.780 align:middle line:90%
at the next level.

00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And what we know from all the
science now is it doesn't.

00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:17.680 align:middle line:84%
We cannot correlate your
personality to long-term

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:18.490 align:middle line:90%
performance.

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:19.510 align:middle line:90%
We just can't.

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:21.880 align:middle line:84%
So I started asking,
well, how can we

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:23.430 align:middle line:84%
start to assess
what's going to make

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:24.680 align:middle line:90%
somebody go to the next level?

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:27.670 align:middle line:84%
How do we measure
performance, not personality?

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:29.890 align:middle line:84%
So we created the High
Performance Indicator--

00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:32.230 align:middle line:84%
lots of research,
lots of validation

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:34.150 align:middle line:84%
for this program, now
the world's largest high

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:35.110 align:middle line:90%
performance study.

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And it basically found
that there's six things.

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:40.800 align:middle line:84%
If you get these six
things all in alignment,

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.610 align:middle line:84%
and these six
things are enduring

00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:47.650 align:middle line:84%
in your day in your
life, you'll basically

00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:49.780 align:middle line:90%
succeed over the long term.

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:51.040 align:middle line:90%
And those six things are this.

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:53.710 align:middle line:84%
One-- and this is the one I
didn't know was so important

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:55.450 align:middle line:90%
to high performance--

00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:57.560 align:middle line:90%
necessity.

00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:01.370 align:middle line:84%
If you don't feel it's
necessary to succeed

00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:02.580 align:middle line:90%
because of two things--

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:07.970 align:middle line:84%
one, an internal standard;
and, two, an external demand--

00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:10.380 align:middle line:84%
you won't succeed
over the long term.

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:11.810 align:middle line:84%
You might have
what psychologists

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:13.980 align:middle line:90%
call initial success.

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:15.510 align:middle line:90%
You get the good grade.

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:17.940 align:middle line:84%
You graduate the first
semester with high honors.

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:20.490 align:middle line:84%
But you won't make it
three more semesters

00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:24.120 align:middle line:84%
or throughout grad
school or your PhD

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.590 align:middle line:84%
and maintain that success
arc unless something inside

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:28.083 align:middle line:90%
says that this must happen.

00:40:28.083 --> 00:40:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, we know
that because Les Brown

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.645 align:middle line:84%
taught us to succeed
you got to be hungry.

00:40:33.645 --> 00:40:36.548 align:middle line:84%
Hunger, desire,
that's necessity.

00:40:36.548 --> 00:40:37.590 align:middle line:90%
That's what it really is.

00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:40.680 align:middle line:84%
Psychologically, it
says I must win this.

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:42.210 align:middle line:90%
I must do well.

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:43.560 align:middle line:90%
I must begin.

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:44.820 align:middle line:90%
I must be a better husband.

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:46.080 align:middle line:90%
I must be a better dad.

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:49.510 align:middle line:84%
Something makes it necessary
for us to get better.

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And without that
necessary to get better,

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:54.250 align:middle line:90%
we won't sustain the growth.

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:56.590 align:middle line:90%
The second thing is clarity.

00:40:56.590 --> 00:41:00.090 align:middle line:84%
You gotta know what it
is specifically you want

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:02.600 align:middle line:84%
and what's the
path to get there.

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And that bothers a lot
of people because they

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:07.402 align:middle line:84%
might know what they want, but
they haven't done the research

00:41:07.402 --> 00:41:08.700 align:middle line:90%
to find out the path.

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:11.913 align:middle line:84%
They don't know what they should
do, so they don't do anything.

00:41:11.913 --> 00:41:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And so this has to be a
very deliberate thing.

00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:16.020 align:middle line:84%
When you have a
dream or necessity

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:19.185 align:middle line:84%
says you better succeed here
because new competition came in

00:41:19.185 --> 00:41:22.510 align:middle line:84%
or because some incident
made you change,

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:24.480 align:middle line:84%
you better figure
out a path fast.

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:27.542 align:middle line:84%
And that's the number one
thing people wait too long on,

00:41:27.542 --> 00:41:28.500 align:middle line:90%
to figure out the path.

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:30.120 align:middle line:84%
They know what they
want, but they wait.

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:32.070 align:middle line:84%
They keep hoping someone's
going to give them the answer.

00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:32.350 align:middle line:90%
No, I say.

00:41:32.350 --> 00:41:33.870 align:middle line:84%
You gotta do
research right away.

00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:35.910 align:middle line:84%
Find clarity about
how to get there,

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:37.140 align:middle line:90%
and you'll start to improve.

00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:39.690 align:middle line:84%
The third thing, which
psychologically hasn't been

00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:43.830 align:middle line:84%
measured, which still bothers
me and boggles my mind--

00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:45.480 align:middle line:90%
it's why we started the study--

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:47.440 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:49.210 align:middle line:84%
You take all those
personality tests.

00:41:49.210 --> 00:41:51.820 align:middle line:84%
They barely ever
talk about health.

00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:54.850 align:middle line:84%
You take all these supposed
success indicators,

00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:57.110 align:middle line:84%
and they don't ask
the simple question,

00:41:57.110 --> 00:42:00.910 align:middle line:84%
do you have the mental stamina
and the physical energy

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:03.280 align:middle line:90%
to do that over the long term?

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:05.030 align:middle line:90%
And today, most people don't.

00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:06.370 align:middle line:90%
They don't have the energy.

00:42:06.370 --> 00:42:07.210 align:middle line:90%
They're tired.

00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:08.010 align:middle line:90%
They're wiped out.

00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:09.005 align:middle line:90%
They're distracted.

00:42:09.005 --> 00:42:09.880 align:middle line:90%
They're overburdened.

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:10.720 align:middle line:90%
They're not meditating.

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:11.590 align:middle line:90%
They're not eating right.

00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:12.820 align:middle line:90%
They're not sleeping well.

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:15.070 align:middle line:90%
They're not nutrition-focused.

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:17.370 align:middle line:90%
And so they're wiped out.

00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:19.590 align:middle line:90%
And so push?

00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:20.720 align:middle line:90%
Challenge?

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:21.520 align:middle line:90%
No, man, I'm tired.

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:23.560 align:middle line:90%
Turn on Netflix.

00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And so their energy isn't at
the level of their ambitions,

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:30.850 align:middle line:84%
so they never achieve
their ultimate goals.

00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Then you have productivity,
which is huge.

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:35.560 align:middle line:90%
And this was a tough one.

00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:39.010 align:middle line:84%
This productivity, is it
causation or correlation

00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:40.730 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to
high performance?

00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:42.618 align:middle line:90%
Productivity is essential.

00:42:42.618 --> 00:42:44.660 align:middle line:84%
But here's what we learned
about high performers.

00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:47.202 align:middle line:84%
It's not that they just get more
done because that could just

00:42:47.202 --> 00:42:48.490 align:middle line:90%
be pushing paper all day.

00:42:48.490 --> 00:42:50.680 align:middle line:84%
It could just be you're
doing stuff all day.

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:52.570 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't matter.

00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:54.520 align:middle line:84%
High performers
have a higher level

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:57.260 align:middle line:84%
of what's called
productive output.

00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:00.660 align:middle line:84%
They are putting things out
that are necessary for success

00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:01.460 align:middle line:90%
in their career.

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:03.252 align:middle line:84%
If you're a painter,
that means you're more

00:43:03.252 --> 00:43:05.450 align:middle line:90%
prolific than the next guy.

00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:08.990 align:middle line:84%
Monet, Picasso,
Beethoven, Mozart--

00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:10.730 align:middle line:90%
why do these people stand out?

00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:13.580 align:middle line:84%
They were way more
prolific, way more prolific,

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:15.920 align:middle line:84%
than those who were
there at that time.

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:18.215 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes their work
wasn't even original yet.

00:43:18.215 --> 00:43:19.340 align:middle line:90%
They were still working it.

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:21.740 align:middle line:84%
But through prolific
productivity,

00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:23.450 align:middle line:90%
they found mastery.

00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:25.220 align:middle line:84%
You have to stay
at, and you have

00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:28.040 align:middle line:84%
to do the work, that's
required in your field

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:30.062 align:middle line:84%
to become excellent
over a period of time.

00:43:30.062 --> 00:43:31.770 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise you won't
hit high performance.

00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:33.140 align:middle line:90%
It's everything.

00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:35.210 align:middle line:90%
The next one was influence.

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:38.790 align:middle line:84%
High performers really deeply
care about their relationships.

00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And because they care, they
have great degrees of empathy.

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:43.970 align:middle line:84%
Because they put
a lot of intention

00:43:43.970 --> 00:43:47.150 align:middle line:84%
into how they come
across, what they convey,

00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:48.630 align:middle line:90%
they're more influential.

00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:51.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's hard to
succeed over the long term

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:53.540 align:middle line:90%
without influence.

00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:55.910 align:middle line:84%
There's a popular book
going around right now--

00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:57.710 align:middle line:84%
phenomenal book--
by Angela Duckworth.

00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:59.000 align:middle line:90%
It's called "Grit."

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And she found that
gritty people--

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:04.220 align:middle line:84%
people who succeeded-- she
studied initial success.

00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:07.040 align:middle line:84%
People who have initial
objective success,

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:10.320 align:middle line:84%
they have a lot of passion
and a lot of perseverance.

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And that was a big finding
because she proved it

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:14.478 align:middle line:84%
in the science with
some assessments.

00:44:14.478 --> 00:44:16.520 align:middle line:84%
The challenge, as anyone
in the real world knows,

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:18.170 align:middle line:90%
those things aren't enough.

00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:20.000 align:middle line:84%
How many passionate,
persevering people

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.040 align:middle line:84%
do you know who never
succeeded because they

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:24.013 align:middle line:90%
sucked at relationships?

00:44:24.013 --> 00:44:25.680 align:middle line:84%
They weren't good
with the people skill.

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:28.370 align:middle line:84%
That's the third P. She
got passion, perseverance.

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:30.333 align:middle line:84%
She forgot people
skills because no one

00:44:30.333 --> 00:44:32.250 align:middle line:84%
succeeds over the long
term without developing

00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:33.050 align:middle line:90%
people's skills.

00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:35.280 align:middle line:84%
Even Mark Zuckerberg is
good with people now.

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:36.510 align:middle line:90%
He sucked at it before.

00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:37.770 align:middle line:90%
Now he's amazing.

00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:39.690 align:middle line:84%
You have to develop
that skill and capacity.

00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And then the last
one is courage.

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:44.310 align:middle line:84%
High performers have
a lot of courage.

00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:46.355 align:middle line:84%
To reach the next
level takes courage.

00:44:46.355 --> 00:44:48.480 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be willing
to put yourself out there.

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:50.070 align:middle line:90%
You have to try new things.

00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:51.870 align:middle line:84%
And you don't do
it once on a Sunday

00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:53.370 align:middle line:90%
when you finally got motivated.

00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:54.930 align:middle line:90%
It's every day.

00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:57.330 align:middle line:84%
Courage is telling the
world, here's what I think,

00:44:57.330 --> 00:44:59.430 align:middle line:84%
what I feel, what I
need, what I desire.

00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:01.260 align:middle line:84%
It's going after things
that you don't even

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:03.300 align:middle line:90%
have any right to go after.

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.010 align:middle line:90%
It's moonshot goals.

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes moonshot
goals for somebody

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:10.020 align:middle line:84%
means leaving their house
today, going into the boardroom

00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:13.790 align:middle line:84%
and saying, guys, we're
doing the wrong thing.

00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:16.490 align:middle line:84%
It means going into the company
and saying, you know what?

00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:18.020 align:middle line:90%
We need to create something new.

00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:21.530 align:middle line:84%
It means going to your spouse
and saying, it's not working.

00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:24.160 align:middle line:84%
That level of courage
is demonstrated

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:24.960 align:middle line:90%
by high performers.

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:26.752 align:middle line:84%
That's why they succeed
over the long term,

00:45:26.752 --> 00:45:30.140 align:middle line:84%
because they speak up for
themselves over the long term.

00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:32.120 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot of popularity
around the concept

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.770 align:middle line:90%
of vulnerability right now.

00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:36.140 align:middle line:90%
Real vulnerability is voice.

00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:38.630 align:middle line:84%
It's about sharing
who you really are

00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:40.110 align:middle line:84%
and what you really
desire of life.

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not
doing that, it's

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:43.730 align:middle line:84%
impossible to reach the next
level because you'll just

00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:46.310 align:middle line:90%
stay there in your own silence.

00:45:46.310 --> 00:45:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And in personal development,
there's two kinds of silence.

00:45:49.610 --> 00:45:51.500 align:middle line:84%
One, that silence within
that's meditative,

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:52.932 align:middle line:90%
that's the good kind.

00:45:52.932 --> 00:45:54.640 align:middle line:84%
But there's also
another kind of silence.

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:59.070 align:middle line:84%
That's silencing our thoughts,
our dreams, our feelings.

00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:00.770 align:middle line:90%
And that kind of silence?

00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:02.260 align:middle line:90%
There's suffering.

00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And the only way
through is voice,

00:46:05.350 --> 00:46:07.240 align:middle line:84%
sharing what we really
want, standing up

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:09.460 align:middle line:84%
for who we really are even
when they make fun of us.

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:11.085 align:middle line:84%
That's the courage
that's needed today.

00:46:11.085 --> 00:46:18.520 align:middle line:90%


00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:19.450 align:middle line:90%
10 years.

00:46:19.450 --> 00:46:20.250 align:middle line:90%
10 years.

00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:22.000 align:middle line:84%
So the qualitative
part of it was

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.965 align:middle line:84%
getting to work with a lot
of extreme high performers,

00:46:26.965 --> 00:46:28.840 align:middle line:90%
just amazing, amazing people--

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Oprah, Arianna Huffington,
just the top caliber in a lot

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:37.200 align:middle line:84%
of the different
worlds, and seeing them.

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:38.530 align:middle line:90%
And I've coached for 10 years.

00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:39.880 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't take that much.

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:42.555 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you coach for
three years, you're good.

00:46:42.555 --> 00:46:44.890 align:middle line:84%
You coach for 10, you've
reached another level

00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:46.030 align:middle line:90%
understanding people.

00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And so I just, well,
what do I think?

00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:52.765 align:middle line:84%
Originally, I had 62 measures,
and then kind of categorized

00:46:52.765 --> 00:46:55.573 align:middle line:84%
those measures, brought it
down to what I thought were 12,

00:46:55.573 --> 00:46:57.490 align:middle line:84%
started the assessments,
started the research.

00:46:57.490 --> 00:47:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And my research team
is real-deal academics

00:47:00.370 --> 00:47:02.920 align:middle line:84%
from University of
Pennsylvania, the number one

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:04.900 align:middle line:84%
positive psychology
school in the world.

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:07.180 align:middle line:90%
And these guys are smart.

00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:08.190 align:middle line:90%
They get the data.

00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And we crunch it down
to these six categories.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And those six I talked
about, they make everything--

00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:18.130 align:middle line:84%
necessity, clarity, energy,
productivity, influence,

00:47:18.130 --> 00:47:19.090 align:middle line:90%
courage.

00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:22.800 align:middle line:84%
So when you take this
assessment, you'll get scores.

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:25.720 align:middle line:84%
You get a one to five score
on each of those six areas.

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:29.730 align:middle line:84%
And then you can say, oh,
crap, here's where I suck.

00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:31.928 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people--
we just did this for very,

00:47:31.928 --> 00:47:32.970 align:middle line:90%
very large group people--

00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:36.860 align:middle line:84%
and their particular one,
they were low on necessity.

00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:39.890 align:middle line:84%
They just didn't have that sense
that they needed to do this.

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:43.010 align:middle line:84%
So what was interesting is
they were low on necessity.

00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:46.250 align:middle line:84%
Guess what their
next lowest one was?

00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Productivity, because
it's not necessary to do.

00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:52.560 align:middle line:90%
Netflix is on.

00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:55.440 align:middle line:84%
If it's not necessary
to do, why do it?

00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:57.330 align:middle line:84%
So their productivity
score, it's always--

00:47:57.330 --> 00:47:58.830 align:middle line:84%
if the necessity
is lowest, I can

00:47:58.830 --> 00:48:01.950 align:middle line:84%
predict with accurate persuasion
within plus or minus three

00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:04.110 align:middle line:84%
points, productivity is
going to be the next lowest

00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:06.960 align:middle line:84%
one because you don't
have to-- why do it?

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:11.580 align:middle line:84%
Internal and external,
meaning that's

00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:16.080 align:middle line:84%
the secret of why we call
it necessity versus desire

00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:19.950 align:middle line:90%
because demand is there.

00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:22.390 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people like myself--

00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:25.060 align:middle line:84%
I went bankrupt
early in my career.

00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:27.420 align:middle line:90%
And it was awful.

00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:30.810 align:middle line:84%
I knew a lot of
what to do to repair

00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:32.910 align:middle line:84%
and what to do, especially
for me as a writer

00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:33.710 align:middle line:90%
and as a trainer.

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:35.627 align:middle line:84%
I gotta write some books
and do some seminars.

00:48:35.627 --> 00:48:37.500 align:middle line:90%
But I couldn't motivate myself.

00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:40.110 align:middle line:84%
So I would be sitting
there pretending to write.

00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:42.455 align:middle line:84%
I'd go to the cafe and look
at all the people writing

00:48:42.455 --> 00:48:43.830 align:middle line:84%
and be like, try
to pretend to be

00:48:43.830 --> 00:48:45.120 align:middle line:90%
one of those pretentious guys.

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:45.930 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm writing, too.

00:48:45.930 --> 00:48:47.640 align:middle line:84%
But nothing was-- I ordered
all the green teas and all

00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:47.940 align:middle line:90%
the coffees.

00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:48.970 align:middle line:90%
Nothing would happen.

00:48:48.970 --> 00:48:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, I said, well, I
can't find creativity.

00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:52.340 align:middle line:84%
So I'd go walk around the
block and fool myself.

00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:53.200 align:middle line:90%
Well, I must need to walk.

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:54.990 align:middle line:84%
I must need something
for creative inspiration.

00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:56.190 align:middle line:84%
No, I need to sit
there and write.

00:48:56.190 --> 00:48:57.150 align:middle line:90%
I didn't do it.

00:48:57.150 --> 00:49:00.907 align:middle line:84%
And then one night I am writing,
starting to get into it--

00:49:00.907 --> 00:49:03.032 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know if you've
heard this story before,

00:49:03.032 --> 00:49:06.690 align:middle line:84%
but I was then living
with my girlfriend.

00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:08.070 align:middle line:90%
And we were broke.

00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And actually she was
doing better than I was,

00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:11.258 align:middle line:90%
but I'd gone bankrupt.

00:49:11.258 --> 00:49:13.050 align:middle line:84%
So I had to move out
of my apartment, moved

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:14.610 align:middle line:90%
in with my then girlfriend.

00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm writing on
my mom's foldout,

00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:21.090 align:middle line:84%
three-legged table that used
to use for sewing room table.

00:49:21.090 --> 00:49:22.723 align:middle line:90%
And I'm writing.

00:49:22.723 --> 00:49:24.140 align:middle line:84%
But I've been
writing every night.

00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:25.440 align:middle line:90%
Nothing's really working.

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And the apartment
was so small, I

00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:31.140 align:middle line:84%
had all my bills,
and my vision boards,

00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:34.162 align:middle line:84%
and my journals and my
research all over the bed.

00:49:34.162 --> 00:49:35.620 align:middle line:84%
The bed was like
the extended desk.

00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:38.290 align:middle line:84%
It had this little pull-out
table right next to it.

00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:40.790 align:middle line:90%
And my lady walked in one night.

00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of-- she was just
trying not to disturb me.

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:44.380 align:middle line:90%
And I'm typing along.

00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:46.470 align:middle line:90%
And she walks around the bed.

00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And she gets under
the covers, trying not

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:50.438 align:middle line:90%
to disturb the paper and me.

00:49:50.438 --> 00:49:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And I'm typing along
and a little bit later

00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:53.730 align:middle line:90%
and I look over.

00:49:53.730 --> 00:50:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And there is my woman sleeping
under the weight of my bills.

00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, uh, I
didn't want that for her.

00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And here I'm trying
to be a writer,

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:09.045 align:middle line:90%
but I'm not getting stuff done.

00:50:09.045 --> 00:50:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeing my
woman literally sleep

00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:14.570 align:middle line:84%
under my invoices, my
bills, my bankruptcy papers.

00:50:14.570 --> 00:50:19.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, no, that's
not the life I want to live.

00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:22.670 align:middle line:84%
Had I not had that moment
would I have motivated

00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:25.100 align:middle line:90%
myself to start my career?

00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:28.710 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to think
so, but I hadn't yet.

00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And so she gave me
the gift of necessity.

00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:33.930 align:middle line:84%
An external demand
sometimes because we'll

00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:38.370 align:middle line:84%
do more things for our
children, for our spouses,

00:50:38.370 --> 00:50:40.200 align:middle line:84%
for our mission, for
a cause, for God,

00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:41.760 align:middle line:90%
than we'll do for ourselves.

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:44.052 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people lose that
connection with something

00:50:44.052 --> 00:50:44.940 align:middle line:90%
beyond ourselves.

00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:49.320 align:middle line:84%
What is it that's going to
make you get up and fight?

00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:51.720 align:middle line:84%
She gave me something
to fight for.

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:53.700 align:middle line:84%
Each day, I was
losing the battles.

00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:55.830 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to win the war for us.

00:50:55.830 --> 00:50:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And so, luckily, she stayed
with me through those times

00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:01.890 align:middle line:90%
and became my wife.

00:51:01.890 --> 00:51:05.460 align:middle line:84%
So you have to have
something external

00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:09.040 align:middle line:84%
from you giving you
cause to chase your dream

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:10.607 align:middle line:90%
because your dream isn't enough.

00:51:10.607 --> 00:51:11.940 align:middle line:90%
People like to think that today.

00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:13.690 align:middle line:84%
You read that in a lot
of self-help books.

00:51:13.690 --> 00:51:16.200 align:middle line:84%
It's just not about
your dream because we

00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:18.860 align:middle line:84%
don't live in a universe
where we're alone.

00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:21.932 align:middle line:84%
There's other people that
we have to fight for.

00:51:21.932 --> 00:51:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And some people don't
like that metaphor.

00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:25.820 align:middle line:84%
They say, well, Brendon,
something to fight for?

00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:26.810 align:middle line:90%
Very masculine energy.

00:51:26.810 --> 00:51:28.895 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, then find
something to love for.

00:51:28.895 --> 00:51:30.860 align:middle line:84%
But whatever it
is, if you're not

00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:33.740 align:middle line:84%
connected to that each
day, what's happening

00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:38.560 align:middle line:84%
is at some point you're
moving, you're going,

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:39.570 align:middle line:90%
but you don't know it.

00:51:39.570 --> 00:51:41.258 align:middle line:90%
Ego is starting to creep in.

00:51:41.258 --> 00:51:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening is
really, yeah, you're achieving.

00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:44.350 align:middle line:90%
You're moving.

00:51:44.350 --> 00:51:47.180 align:middle line:84%
But it's really
ego propelling you.

00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:48.680 align:middle line:90%
And you don't even know it.

00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:51.230 align:middle line:84%
That's what happens
with successful people.

00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:53.162 align:middle line:90%
The ego sneaks up on them.

00:51:53.162 --> 00:51:55.130 align:middle line:84%
They didn't start
out bad people.

00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:56.530 align:middle line:90%
They don't start power hungry.

00:51:56.530 --> 00:51:59.110 align:middle line:84%
They didn't start
jealous or angry.

00:51:59.110 --> 00:52:01.100 align:middle line:84%
It crept up on him
because for so long

00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:04.540 align:middle line:84%
they were chasing their
dream for themselves alone.

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And that dream-- every
day they're fighting.

00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Even if they're
really hard-working,

00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:10.060 align:middle line:84%
and high-performing
people, they're going.

00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:12.940 align:middle line:84%
But what happened
is they got detached

00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:16.900 align:middle line:84%
from others, their spouse,
their kids, the bigger cause

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:20.440 align:middle line:84%
because they kept reminding
themselves of their dream.

00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:23.530 align:middle line:84%
They kept remind themselves
to be awesome for themselves.

00:52:23.530 --> 00:52:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And they forgot
that in the end, all

00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:27.280 align:middle line:90%
we have is our relationships.

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:31.542 align:middle line:84%
All we have is how we
were with other people.

00:52:31.542 --> 00:52:34.000 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're on your
deathbed, you're looking around

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.470 align:middle line:90%
and you're asking who's around?

00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:36.560 align:middle line:90%
Who's here?

00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:37.790 align:middle line:90%
Who do I care for?

00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And so it's so
necessary every day

00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:43.150 align:middle line:84%
to have some part of
your life that says,

00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:45.130 align:middle line:90%
who can I connect with today?

00:52:45.130 --> 00:52:47.620 align:middle line:84%
What's the broader
mission beyond me?

00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Your dream is important,
but it's not everything.

00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:54.250 align:middle line:84%
Contribution,
purpose, your love--

00:52:54.250 --> 00:52:56.080 align:middle line:84%
that's more important
than your dream.

00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:56.950 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:58.510 align:middle line:90%
It's OK sometimes.

00:52:58.510 --> 00:53:00.260 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you got to
sacrifice your dream

00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:01.570 align:middle line:90%
because you had a 3-year-old.

00:53:01.570 --> 00:53:02.612 align:middle line:90%
And you got a year there.

00:53:02.612 --> 00:53:04.420 align:middle line:84%
It's like, hey,
man, I can't even

00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:07.180 align:middle line:84%
walk because I haven't
slept this year.

00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:09.980 align:middle line:84%
There's times when
family trumps our dreams.

00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:11.050 align:middle line:90%
And that's OK.

00:53:11.050 --> 00:53:13.790 align:middle line:84%
There's times-- it doesn't
mean that we stop them forever.

00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:15.760 align:middle line:84%
It just means we say,
hey, priority right now.

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:23.042 align:middle line:90%


00:53:23.042 --> 00:53:25.000 align:middle line:84%
I think it's really
unfortunate a lot of people

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.480 align:middle line:84%
don't feel fulfilled today
because you look at their life

00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:29.140 align:middle line:90%
and they're pretty successful.

00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And fulfillment,
it's something that

00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:34.280 align:middle line:84%
doesn't stick unless we
have a deliberate practice

00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:35.080 align:middle line:90%
to make it stick.

00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:36.550 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you an example.

00:53:36.550 --> 00:53:38.440 align:middle line:90%
Every Sunday, I sit down.

00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And I have a page in my
journal, and I write down

00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:44.070 align:middle line:84%
what went well this
week, this last week.

00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:44.870 align:middle line:90%
What am I proud of?

00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:46.810 align:middle line:90%
What did I try to give?

00:53:46.810 --> 00:53:48.910 align:middle line:90%
What did I overcome?

00:53:48.910 --> 00:53:49.810 align:middle line:90%
Who did I see?

00:53:49.810 --> 00:53:51.350 align:middle line:90%
What was beautiful?

00:53:51.350 --> 00:53:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And I just write about
this every single Sunday

00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:55.720 align:middle line:90%
to reflect on the week.

00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And then one
important thing I do,

00:53:57.140 --> 00:53:59.470 align:middle line:84%
which is really difficult
for a lot of people to do,

00:53:59.470 --> 00:54:02.460 align:middle line:90%
is to integrate success.

00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:04.830 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are
unfulfilled because they never

00:54:04.830 --> 00:54:07.290 align:middle line:90%
have an act of integration.

00:54:07.290 --> 00:54:08.880 align:middle line:84%
You have to, every
single week, say

00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:12.240 align:middle line:84%
what did I do today that brought
some passion, that brought

00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:15.150 align:middle line:84%
some meaning, that
was good, that gave,

00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:18.690 align:middle line:84%
and allow yourself to feel
it, to take it in and say,

00:54:18.690 --> 00:54:21.300 align:middle line:90%
OK, I am on my path.

00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:23.100 align:middle line:90%
I did good this week.

00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:26.580 align:middle line:84%
It's literally taking
time from the day

00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:30.750 align:middle line:84%
and allowing yourself
to say, I did that.

00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:33.750 align:middle line:84%
If you don't integrate your
successes into your identity,

00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:35.940 align:middle line:84%
you'll never feel
fulfilled ever.

00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:37.440 align:middle line:84%
You'll just go on
to the next thing.

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:38.440 align:middle line:90%
It's the next treadmill.

00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:39.648 align:middle line:90%
It's the next accomplishment.

00:54:39.648 --> 00:54:40.830 align:middle line:90%
It's keeping up the Joneses.

00:54:40.830 --> 00:54:43.470 align:middle line:84%
It's always trying to get the
next new height without ever

00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:45.450 align:middle line:90%
feeling the previous height.

00:54:45.450 --> 00:54:47.682 align:middle line:90%
And that's terrible.

00:54:47.682 --> 00:54:49.140 align:middle line:84%
So you have to have
a practice that

00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:53.730 align:middle line:84%
says I need to allow
myself to feel the win.

00:54:53.730 --> 00:54:55.500 align:middle line:90%
I did good this week.

00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:57.760 align:middle line:90%
OK, this is making a difference.

00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:00.660 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people in my
world, they read a comment

00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:02.687 align:middle line:84%
from someone that says,
thank you for this.

00:55:02.687 --> 00:55:03.770 align:middle line:90%
It really changed my life.

00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:04.812 align:middle line:90%
It made a big difference.

00:55:04.812 --> 00:55:07.470 align:middle line:84%
They'll write a beautiful
email or a beautiful Facebook

00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:08.640 align:middle line:90%
comment--

00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:11.610 align:middle line:84%
three, four, five sentences
or four or five paragraphs,

00:55:11.610 --> 00:55:14.227 align:middle line:84%
or seven, eight pages
of this person saying,

00:55:14.227 --> 00:55:15.060 align:middle line:90%
you changed my life.

00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:17.192 align:middle line:84%
And they read it,
and they go on.

00:55:17.192 --> 00:55:19.780 align:middle line:90%
When I read it, I read it once.

00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:20.600 align:middle line:90%
I close my eyes.

00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:22.730 align:middle line:90%
I think about that person.

00:55:22.730 --> 00:55:24.470 align:middle line:84%
I give gratitude
that this happened.

00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:25.320 align:middle line:90%
I read it again.

00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:27.650 align:middle line:84%
I try to put myself in
that person's shoes.

00:55:27.650 --> 00:55:31.680 align:middle line:84%
I read again, give
thanks that happened.

00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:33.570 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:35.610 align:middle line:84%
You get a cue that
you're doing good.

00:55:35.610 --> 00:55:38.360 align:middle line:84%
You get a sense that
something's fulfilling.

00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:39.570 align:middle line:90%
But you bypass it too fast.

00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:42.250 align:middle line:84%
It's like when people here, they
drive across the Golden Gate

00:55:42.250 --> 00:55:43.050 align:middle line:90%
Bridge.

00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:43.440 align:middle line:90%
They stop.

00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:43.770 align:middle line:90%
They take the picture.

00:55:43.770 --> 00:55:44.940 align:middle line:90%
They leave.

00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:46.800 align:middle line:90%
They didn't take it in.

00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:49.198 align:middle line:84%
People would be more
fulfilled if they took it in.

00:55:49.198 --> 00:55:50.740 align:middle line:84%
They got the high
five from the boss.

00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:51.880 align:middle line:90%
Walk out of the office.

00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:53.900 align:middle line:84%
Close your eyes and
go, you did it, man.

00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:54.700 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:55.930 align:middle line:90%
We've come a long way.

00:55:55.930 --> 00:55:57.890 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:55:57.890 --> 00:55:59.050 align:middle line:90%
And then keep going.

00:55:59.050 --> 00:56:00.610 align:middle line:84%
Without that moment
of integration,

00:56:00.610 --> 00:56:03.615 align:middle line:90%
we'll never feel fulfilled.

00:56:03.615 --> 00:56:09.090 align:middle line:84%
To purpose, I think that's a
tricky one because people think

00:56:09.090 --> 00:56:11.290 align:middle line:84%
that they're going
to walk out the door

00:56:11.290 --> 00:56:13.560 align:middle line:84%
and the piano of purpose
is going to fall on them.

00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, thank
you, God, for handing

00:56:15.310 --> 00:56:16.420 align:middle line:84%
me this one single
one thing I was

00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:17.290 align:middle line:90%
supposed to do with my life.

00:56:17.290 --> 00:56:18.040 align:middle line:90%
It's about time it came.

00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:19.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm 40.

00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:22.060 align:middle line:84%
It's like, that
doesn't really happen.

00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:26.030 align:middle line:84%
Purpose emerges from
small acts of kindness.

00:56:26.030 --> 00:56:27.420 align:middle line:90%
That's how you get it.

00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:29.173 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
know it's going to be.

00:56:29.173 --> 00:56:30.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
a lot of people

00:56:30.590 --> 00:56:35.390 align:middle line:84%
have that divine moment where
everything comes crystal clear.

00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:36.950 align:middle line:90%
Maybe sometimes it does.

00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:40.150 align:middle line:84%
But it actually came after
about 1,000 whispers.

00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:41.150 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't hear it.

00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:43.350 align:middle line:90%
And then one day they got it.

00:56:43.350 --> 00:56:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And so I think what you have
to do, don't wait for purpose.

00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:48.320 align:middle line:90%
Don't hope it hits you.

00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:51.840 align:middle line:84%
Go to a soup kitchen
next Sunday, serve.

00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:56.130 align:middle line:84%
Go join that volunteer group
in town and just do something.

00:56:56.130 --> 00:56:58.110 align:middle line:90%
Go volunteer at the kids camp.

00:56:58.110 --> 00:56:59.670 align:middle line:90%
Go volunteer at the school.

00:56:59.670 --> 00:57:03.150 align:middle line:84%
Go help Junior Achievement,
Kiwanis, YMCA, Big Brothers,

00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:04.110 align:middle line:90%
Big Sisters.

00:57:04.110 --> 00:57:05.730 align:middle line:84%
There's a million
organizations you

00:57:05.730 --> 00:57:09.180 align:middle line:84%
can join that you can just go
do something actively each week

00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:11.700 align:middle line:90%
and just try something.

00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:14.370 align:middle line:84%
You're never going to
have that sense of purpose

00:57:14.370 --> 00:57:18.070 align:middle line:84%
being important until
you volunteered.

00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:19.820 align:middle line:84%
It's really important
for people to think.

00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:20.840 align:middle line:84%
They think they're going
to find their purpose

00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:21.640 align:middle line:90%
in their business.

00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And I go, uh, your business can
become part of your purpose.

00:57:26.410 --> 00:57:28.490 align:middle line:84%
But real purpose
is going to come

00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:31.670 align:middle line:84%
when you did it
for no other reason

00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:33.363 align:middle line:84%
than the act of
kindness and generosity.

00:57:33.363 --> 00:57:35.030 align:middle line:84%
That's when you're
going to really touch

00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:36.590 align:middle line:90%
the hem of real purposes.

00:57:36.590 --> 00:57:37.860 align:middle line:90%
You can have passion.

00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:39.490 align:middle line:90%
You can have a business mission.

00:57:39.490 --> 00:57:40.660 align:middle line:90%
But real purpose?

00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:42.350 align:middle line:84%
Until you have lots
of little moments,

00:57:42.350 --> 00:57:47.630 align:middle line:84%
these small acts of you giving,
volunteering, being kind, being

00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:48.590 align:middle line:90%
generous--

00:57:48.590 --> 00:57:50.780 align:middle line:84%
those things are all
just opening the door

00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:53.120 align:middle line:90%
to a bigger divine calling.

00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:56.200 align:middle line:84%
But unless you open
those doors, everything's

00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:57.610 align:middle line:90%
going to fall flat.

00:57:57.610 --> 00:57:59.470 align:middle line:90%
So don't wait for the big thing.

00:57:59.470 --> 00:58:00.638 align:middle line:90%
Go do the small things.

00:58:00.638 --> 00:58:02.180 align:middle line:84%
Do them over and
over and over again.

00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And the best way I tell
people, volunteerism.

00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:08.560 align:middle line:84%
You'll never meet better
quality people than volunteers.

00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:09.460 align:middle line:90%
They're nice.

00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:10.480 align:middle line:90%
They're positive.

00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:11.380 align:middle line:90%
They're giving.

00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:13.030 align:middle line:84%
They're not stressed because
they're taking time out

00:58:13.030 --> 00:58:15.280 align:middle line:84%
of their day to do something
that they've consciously

00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:16.877 align:middle line:90%
chosen to do, to give.

00:58:16.877 --> 00:58:18.460 align:middle line:84%
You want to be
influence in your life?

00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:19.370 align:middle line:90%
Volunteer.

00:58:19.370 --> 00:58:20.740 align:middle line:90%
Who are the volunteers?

00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:21.700 align:middle line:90%
Influencers.

00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:24.430 align:middle line:84%
Usually volunteering
at any given place,

00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:28.000 align:middle line:84%
it's the most respected,
the most wealthy people

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.250 align:middle line:84%
in the community because
they've carved out that time.

00:58:30.250 --> 00:58:31.708 align:middle line:84%
They achieved their
dream, and they

00:58:31.708 --> 00:58:33.010 align:middle line:90%
said, now how do I give back?

00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:33.990 align:middle line:90%
They're the ones volunteering.

00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:35.532 align:middle line:84%
So I say, hey, if
you've got nothing,

00:58:35.532 --> 00:58:38.050 align:middle line:84%
go volunteer because you're
going to get a lot of wealthy,

00:58:38.050 --> 00:58:40.900 align:middle line:84%
giving, smart people
who can mentor you.

00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:42.745 align:middle line:84%
And most importantly,
you get to watch them.

00:58:42.745 --> 00:58:44.620 align:middle line:84%
If they never give you
anything, but you just

00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:46.420 align:middle line:84%
saw people being
generous, there's

00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:48.066 align:middle line:90%
inspiration for the day.

00:58:48.066 --> 00:58:55.040 align:middle line:90%


00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:58.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, motivation is
different than inspiration

00:58:58.370 --> 00:59:00.852 align:middle line:90%
and enthusiasm, very different.

00:59:00.852 --> 00:59:02.810 align:middle line:84%
Like inspiration, you
see something on YouTube,

00:59:02.810 --> 00:59:03.893 align:middle line:90%
you're like, I'm inspired.

00:59:03.893 --> 00:59:05.560 align:middle line:84%
Or you want to start
your day and you're

00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:07.250 align:middle line:84%
energized to do
something, motivation

00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:11.295 align:middle line:84%
is, do you do it day after
day after day after day?

00:59:11.295 --> 00:59:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Some people say
motivation is fleeting.

00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:14.545 align:middle line:90%
It's not, not real motivation.

00:59:14.545 --> 00:59:15.920 align:middle line:84%
What they're really
talking about

00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:17.730 align:middle line:90%
is inspiration and enthusiasm.

00:59:17.730 --> 00:59:19.290 align:middle line:84%
They're not talking
about motivation.

00:59:19.290 --> 00:59:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Motivation is the reason
for what you're doing.

00:59:22.650 --> 00:59:23.450 align:middle line:90%
It's the drive.

00:59:23.450 --> 00:59:24.560 align:middle line:90%
It's the why.

00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And what people don't
understand is it's not something

00:59:26.810 --> 00:59:28.110 align:middle line:90%
that you have.

00:59:28.110 --> 00:59:30.980 align:middle line:84%
My biggest breakthrough in my
life was to get over the lie

00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:34.190 align:middle line:84%
that I have to have
something for it to be true.

00:59:34.190 --> 00:59:35.960 align:middle line:90%
You don't have happiness.

00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:37.830 align:middle line:90%
You don't have energy.

00:59:37.830 --> 00:59:39.260 align:middle line:90%
You don't have sadness.

00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:41.660 align:middle line:90%
And you don't have motivation.

00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:46.190 align:middle line:84%
My greatest metaphor of my
life is that the power plant

00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:48.200 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have energy.

00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:51.560 align:middle line:90%
It generates energy.

00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:53.310 align:middle line:90%
I don't have motivation.

00:59:53.310 --> 00:59:54.110 align:middle line:90%
I generate it.

00:59:54.110 --> 00:59:55.490 align:middle line:90%
I have to generate it.

00:59:55.490 --> 00:59:56.630 align:middle line:90%
I don't have happiness.

00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:58.075 align:middle line:90%
I must generate that.

00:59:58.075 --> 00:59:59.450 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
you have, it's

00:59:59.450 --> 01:00:01.990 align:middle line:84%
something that you
generate by your thoughts,

01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:04.910 align:middle line:84%
by the command of your own
mastery of your emotions

01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:06.022 align:middle line:90%
and your attention.

01:00:06.022 --> 01:00:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And so what I've
learned about motivation

01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:10.160 align:middle line:84%
is motivation really comes
from just a few simple things.

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:12.452 align:middle line:84%
The spark of motivation, the
thing that most people are

01:00:12.452 --> 01:00:13.970 align:middle line:84%
familiar with
motivation is really

01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:17.108 align:middle line:84%
what is called ambition
and expectancy.

01:00:17.108 --> 01:00:19.400 align:middle line:84%
These two things firing off
together give me the spark.

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:21.330 align:middle line:84%
So ambition is
what I really want.

01:00:21.330 --> 01:00:22.417 align:middle line:90%
It's something more.

01:00:22.417 --> 01:00:24.750 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I want something
more of something right now.

01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And so that gives
me the enthusiasm.

01:00:26.410 --> 01:00:27.890 align:middle line:90%
That gives me some energy.

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And expectancy is I
believe that I could have

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.110 align:middle line:90%
that, which is so important.

01:00:33.110 --> 01:00:35.057 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't
have real motivation

01:00:35.057 --> 01:00:36.890 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
believe they can have it.

01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:38.408 align:middle line:90%
So what they have is hope.

01:00:38.408 --> 01:00:40.700 align:middle line:84%
What they have is momentary
inspiration and enthusiasm.

01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:41.780 align:middle line:90%
That's not motivation.

01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Real motivation says I
believe in my ability

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.520 align:middle line:90%
to figure things out.

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:49.320 align:middle line:84%
There's my ambition, and
I believe I can get it.

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:51.920 align:middle line:84%
That's the spark
of real motivation.

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:54.560 align:middle line:84%
Then what sustains real
motivation is this idea

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:57.920 align:middle line:84%
that we have to have effort
and attention on the thing

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.170 align:middle line:90%
that we want.

01:00:59.170 --> 01:01:01.510 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think, I'll
have motivation one day.

01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:04.070 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, no, here's
how you get motivation.

01:01:04.070 --> 01:01:05.980 align:middle line:90%
Get momentum.

01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:07.920 align:middle line:84%
With momentum comes
more motivation.

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:10.320 align:middle line:84%
More motivation, more-- it's
like this beautiful loop

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:12.070 align:middle line:84%
that happens over and
over and over again.

01:01:12.070 --> 01:01:15.220 align:middle line:84%
You gotta take action every
single day, three small steps

01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:16.270 align:middle line:90%
towards what you want.

01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:20.120 align:middle line:84%
That effort will seal in your
mind that this is important.

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:23.110 align:middle line:84%
We know from neuroscience
that effort, the small wins,

01:01:23.110 --> 01:01:24.258 align:middle line:90%
drops more dopamine.

01:01:24.258 --> 01:01:26.050 align:middle line:84%
We start building neural
pathways that say,

01:01:26.050 --> 01:01:26.860 align:middle line:90%
we like this.

01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:28.810 align:middle line:90%
Let's keep doing this.

01:01:28.810 --> 01:01:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And our attention
must be brought back

01:01:30.850 --> 01:01:33.760 align:middle line:84%
to ownership of what is
important in our life.

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:38.185 align:middle line:84%
You can't sustain motivation
in the midst of distraction.

01:01:38.185 --> 01:01:39.310 align:middle line:90%
You gotta get rid of stuff.

01:01:39.310 --> 01:01:40.930 align:middle line:84%
You gotta stop paying
attention to dumb stuff that

01:01:40.930 --> 01:01:43.720 align:middle line:84%
doesn't matter and say, what's
important of my day today?

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:46.030 align:middle line:84%
Without a focus
of your attention,

01:01:46.030 --> 01:01:47.960 align:middle line:90%
motivation's out the window.

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And then what amplifies
motivation over the long term?

01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Over the long term is
attitude and environment.

01:01:54.070 --> 01:01:56.915 align:middle line:84%
You gotta choose to have
a great attitude even

01:01:56.915 --> 01:01:58.540 align:middle line:84%
despite the difficulties
because you're

01:01:58.540 --> 01:01:59.980 align:middle line:90%
going to honor the struggle.

01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:03.130 align:middle line:84%
You're going to keep connected
to your purpose and the people

01:02:03.130 --> 01:02:04.130 align:middle line:90%
around you.

01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:06.520 align:middle line:84%
You're going to know that
you can figure things out.

01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going to
structure an environment

01:02:08.170 --> 01:02:09.130 align:middle line:90%
to win.

01:02:09.130 --> 01:02:10.480 align:middle line:90%
It's very important.

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:12.850 align:middle line:84%
My environment is
structured to win.

01:02:12.850 --> 01:02:15.250 align:middle line:84%
You look at my calendar,
it's structured to win.

01:02:15.250 --> 01:02:17.740 align:middle line:84%
My mornings are
clear so I can focus

01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:20.435 align:middle line:84%
on my prioritization, my
art, the things that's

01:02:20.435 --> 01:02:22.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm supposed to get
done during the day

01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:24.190 align:middle line:84%
before I go respond to
anybody or take any calls

01:02:24.190 --> 01:02:25.750 align:middle line:90%
or do anything else.

01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:27.670 align:middle line:84%
We're doing this
interview later in the day

01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:29.998 align:middle line:84%
because I command the
beginning of my day

01:02:29.998 --> 01:02:31.540 align:middle line:84%
to make sure I'm
getting things done.

01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:33.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm setting up as much
as I can in my life

01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:37.000 align:middle line:84%
to ensure that I'm moving toward
the things that matter most

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:37.960 align:middle line:90%
to me.

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And that means getting
rid of a lot of things.

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:42.610 align:middle line:84%
That means not hanging
out with negative people.

01:02:42.610 --> 01:02:45.040 align:middle line:84%
It means not being
sucked in so easily

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:47.390 align:middle line:84%
into the drama of
politics or whatever

01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:49.090 align:middle line:90%
is in this current news cycle.

01:02:49.090 --> 01:02:52.450 align:middle line:84%
It's about saying, OK,
if I could structure

01:02:52.450 --> 01:02:56.150 align:middle line:84%
my environment so that I could
win, what would it look like?

01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:57.940 align:middle line:90%
I did that when I was bankrupt.

01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:00.610 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, I want
to write a book.

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:03.370 align:middle line:84%
What would my ideal
environment look like?

01:03:03.370 --> 01:03:05.470 align:middle line:90%
I was broke.

01:03:05.470 --> 01:03:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Now today, I've taken
it up to the next level.

01:03:07.810 --> 01:03:10.615 align:middle line:84%
I have this big,
beautiful place on a cliff

01:03:10.615 --> 01:03:11.740 align:middle line:90%
where I write all my books.

01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:14.740 align:middle line:84%
It just gorgeous, this place
in the woods and the gorge.

01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:16.467 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a stunning
place in Oregon.

01:03:16.467 --> 01:03:18.300 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's like, wow,
this place is amazing.

01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:20.530 align:middle line:84%
It's 5,000 square
feet just to write it.

01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:22.690 align:middle line:90%
It's unbelievable.

01:03:22.690 --> 01:03:27.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, my first book was written
on a borrowed foldout desk.

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And all I could do to control
that environment at that time?

01:03:30.670 --> 01:03:33.400 align:middle line:84%
I had a nice little
candle over there.

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:35.620 align:middle line:84%
I had this crappy
little thing playing--

01:03:35.620 --> 01:03:37.510 align:middle line:84%
I think it was
Pandora at the time.

01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:40.090 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't ideal, but
I made sure that when

01:03:40.090 --> 01:03:43.580 align:middle line:84%
I walked in there, I said,
this is my ship right now.

01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:44.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm the commander of this.

01:03:44.990 --> 01:03:47.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take charge
of this environment.

01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:50.150 align:middle line:84%
I got around people
who were positive.

01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:52.400 align:middle line:84%
I set up my day that if I
was going to read something,

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:54.850 align:middle line:84%
it's wasn't going to
be trashy magazines.

01:03:54.850 --> 01:03:56.380 align:middle line:90%
It was going to be education.

01:03:56.380 --> 01:03:58.020 align:middle line:90%
It was going to be research.

01:03:58.020 --> 01:03:59.395 align:middle line:84%
It was going to
be something that

01:03:59.395 --> 01:04:01.805 align:middle line:84%
would give me something,
not take away from me.

01:04:01.805 --> 01:04:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I started structuring
and deliberately controlling

01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:04.980 align:middle line:90%
all these things.

01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:07.680 align:middle line:84%
So every day,
what's my ambition?

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:09.430 align:middle line:84%
What do I believe I
can make happen today?

01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:10.780 align:middle line:90%
That's ambition expectancy.

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:12.607 align:middle line:84%
Every single day, what
are my main things

01:04:12.607 --> 01:04:13.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to move towards?

01:04:13.690 --> 01:04:15.240 align:middle line:84%
What's the effort
I'm going to give?

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And how am I going to
control my attention today

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:18.100 align:middle line:90%
when it's crazy?

01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:19.892 align:middle line:84%
What's my attitude
going to be about today?

01:04:19.892 --> 01:04:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And how can I structure
this environment even better

01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:24.460 align:middle line:84%
to support my growth
and my giving?

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And by doing those
things I have motivation.

01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:37.355 align:middle line:90%
